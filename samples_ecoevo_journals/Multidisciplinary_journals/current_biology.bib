Abstract = {The timing of the placental mammal radiation has been the focus of
   debate over the efficacy of competing methods for establishing
   evolutionary timescales. Molecular clock analyses estimate that
   placental mammals originated before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass
   extinction, anywhere from the Late Cretaceous to the Jurassic. However,
   the absence of definitive fossils of placentals before the K-Pg boundary
   is compatible with a post-Cretaceous origin. Nevertheless, lineage
   divergence must occur before it can be manifest phenotypically in
   descendent lineages. This, combined with the non-uniformity of the rock
   and fossil records, requires the fossil record to be interpreted rather
   than read literally. To achieve this, we introduce an extended Bayesian
   Brownian bridge model that estimates the age of origination and, where
   applicable, extinction through a probabilistic interpretation of the
   fossil record. The model estimates the origination of placentals in the
   Late Cretaceous, with ordinal crown groups originating at or after the
   K-Pg boundary. The results reduce the plausible interval for placental
   mammal origination to the younger range of molecular clock estimates.
   Our findings support both the Long Fuse and Soft Explosive models of
   placental mammal diversification, indicating that the placentals
   originated shortly prior to the K-Pg mass extinction. The origination of
   many modern mammal lineages overlapped with and followed the K-Pg mass
   extinction.},

Title = {Food-caching mountain chickadees can learn abstract rules to solve a
   complex spatial-temporal pattern},

Abstract = {The use of abstract rules in behavioral decisions is considered evidence
   of executive functions associated with higher-level cognition.
   Laboratory studies across taxa have shown that animals may be capable of
   learning abstract concepts, such as the relationships between items, but
   often use simpler cognitive abilities to solve tasks. Little is known
   about whether or how animals learn and use abstract rules in natural
   environ-ments. Here, we tested whether wild, food-caching mountain
   chickadees (Poecile gambeli) could learn an abstract rule in a
   spatial-temporal task in which the location of a food reward rotated
   daily around an 8-feeder square spatial array for up to 34 days.
   Chickadees initially searched for the daily food reward by visiting the
   most recently rewarding locations and then moving backward to visit
   previously rewarding feeders, using memory of previous locations. But by
   the end of the task, chickadees were more likely to search forward in
   the correct direction of rotation, moving away from the previously
   rewarding feeders. These results suggest that chickadees learned the
   direction rule for daily feeder rotation and used this to guide their
   decisions while searching for a food reward. Thus, chickadees appear to
   use an executive function to make decisions on a foraging-based task in
   the wild.},

Abstract = {Statistical inference, the ability to use limited information to draw
   conclusions about the likelihood of an event, is critical for
   decision-making during uncertainty. The ability to make statistical
   inferences was thought to be a uniquely human skill requiring verbal
   instruction and mathematical reasoning.1 However, basic infer-ences have
   been demonstrated in both preliterate and pre-numerate individuals,2-7
   as well as non-human pri-mates.8 More recently, the ability to make
   statistical inferences has been extended to members outside of the
   primate lineage in birds.9,10True statistical inference requires
   subjects use relative rather than absolute fre-quency of previously
   experienced events. Here, we show that crows can relate memorized reward
   probabil-ities to infer reward-maximizing decisions. Two crows were
   trained to associate multiple reward probabilities ranging from 10\% to
   90\% to arbitrary stimuli. When later faced with the choice between
   various stimulus combinations, crows retrieved the reward probabilities
   associated with individual stimuli from memory and used them to gain
   maximum reward. The crows showed behavioral distance and size effects
   when judging reward values, indicating that the crows represented
   probabilities as abstract magnitudes. When controlling for absolute
   reward frequency, crows still made reward-maximizing choices, which is
   the signa-ture of true statistical inference. Our study provides
   compelling evidence of decision-making by relative reward frequency in a
   statistical inference task.},

Title = {A stabilizing eco-evolutionary feedback loop in the wild},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {15},
Pages = {3272+},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that evolutionary and ecological processes
   can operate on the same time-scale1,2 (i.e., contemporary time). As
   such, evolution can be sufficiently rapid to affect ecological processes
   such as predation or competition. Thus, evolution can influence
   population, community, and ecosystem-level dynamics. Indeed, studies
   have now shown that evolutionary dynamics can alter community
   structure3-6 and ecosystem function.7-10 In turn, shifts in ecological
   dynamics driven by evolution might feed back to affect the evolutionary
   trajectory of individual species.11 This feedback loop, where
   evolutionary and ecological changes reciprocally affect one another, is
   a central tenet of eco-evolutionary dynamics.1,12 However, most work on
   such dynamics in natural populations has focused on one-way causal
   associations between ecology and evolution.13 Hence, direct empirical
   evidence for eco-evolutionary feedback is rare and limited to laboratory
   or mesocosm experiments.13-16 Here, we show in the wild that
   eco-evolutionary dynamics in a plant-feeding arthropod community involve
   a negative feedback loop. Specifically, adaptation in cryptic coloration
   in a stick-insect species mediates bird predation, with local
   maladaptation increasing predation. In turn, the abundance of arthropods
   is reduced by predation. Here, we experimentally manipulate arthropod
   abundance to show that these changes at the community level feed back to
   affect the stick-insect evolution. Specifically, low-arthropod abundance
   increases the strength of selection on crypsis, increasing local
   adap-tation of stick insects in a negative feedback loop. Our results
   suggest that eco-evolutionary feedbacks are able to stabilize complex
   systems by preventing consistent directional change and therefore
   increasing resilience.},

Title = {Zebrafish larvae use stimulus intensity and contrast to estimate
   distance to prey},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {The ability to determine the distance to objects is an important feature
   of most visual systems, but little is known about the neuronal
   mechanisms for distance estimation. Larval zebrafish execute different
   visual behaviors depending on distance; at medium distances, they
   converge their eyes and approach, but when the prey is close enough,
   they execute a strike and suck the prey into their mouths. To study
   distance estimation, we developed a head-fixed strike assay. We found
   that we could evoke strike behavior in head-fixed larvae and quantify
   head movements to classify the behavior as a strike. Strikes were
   dependent on distance to prey, allowing us to use them to study distance
   estimation. Light intensity is rapidly attenuated as it travels through
   water, so we hypothesized that larvae could use intensity as a distance
   cue. We found that increasing stimulus intensity could cause larvae to
   strike at prey that would normally be out of range, and decreasing the
   intensity could lower the strike rate even for very proximal stimuli. In
   addition, stimulus contrast is a key parameter, and this could allow
   larvae to estimate distance over the range of natural illumination.
   Finally, we presented prey in the binocular vs. monocular visual field
   and found that monocular prey did evoke strikes, although the binocular
   input produced more. These results suggest that strike behavior is
   optimally evoked by bright UV dots in the binocular zone with minimal UV
   background light and provide a foundation to study the neuronal
   mechanisms of distance estimation.},

Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {The histology of bone can be preserved virtually unaltered for hundreds
   of millions of years in fossils from all environments and all vertebrate
   taxa, giving rise to the flourishing field of paleohistology.1 The
   shafts of long bones are formed by the apposition of periosteal bone
   tissue, similar to the growth of wood, and preserve, an often cyclical,
   record of the growth of the individual and events in its life history.
   One such event is sexual maturation or puberty, during which hormonal
   changes transform the juvenile into a sexually mature adult. Puberty has
   been well studied in humans and some other living vertebrates. Here, we
   describe puberty in Keichousaurus, a small sexually dimorphic and
   live-bearing marine reptile from Middle Triassic rocks of SW China,
   about 240 million years old. Using a combination of bone histology and
   morphology, we detected puberty2 as one of the four life stages (the
   others being fetus, juvenile, and adult). Adult Keichousaurus males have
   a more robust humerus than females, with pronounced muscle attachment
   sites and a triangular shaft cross section. Midshaft sections of the
   humeri of the males show the transition from the rounded juvenile cross
   section to the triangular adult cross section, as reflected in the
   contour of the growth marks. This shape change is produced by
   differential bone apposition of the periosteum, presumably triggered by
   sex hormones, as in humans,3 and influenced by changes in loading regime
   during puberty. This is the first report of puberty in a fossil amniote.},

Abstract = {Bacteria, ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, and land plants have been
   coevolving for nearly 200 million years, and their interactions
   presumably contribute to the function of terrestrial ecosystems. The
   direction, stability, and strength of bacteria-EcM fungi interactions
   across landscapes and across a single plant host, however, remains
   unclear. Moreover, the genetic mechanisms that govern them have not been
   ad-dressed. To these ends, we collected soil samples from Bishop pine
   forests across a climate-latitude gradient spanning coastal California,
   fractionated the soil samples based on their proximity to EcM-colo-nized
   roots, characterized the microbial communities using amplicon
   sequencing, and generated linear regression models showing the impact
   that select bacterial taxa have on EcM fungal abundance. In addition, we
   paired greenhouse experiments with transcriptomic analyses to determine
   the directionality of these relationships and identify which genes
   EcM-synergist bacteria express during tripartite symbi-oses. Our data
   reveal that ectomycorrhizas (i.e., EcM-colonized roots) enrich conserved
   bacterial taxa across climatically heterogeneous regions. We also show
   that phylogenetically diverse EcM synergists are positively associated
   with plant and fungal growth and have unique gene expression profiles
   compared with EcM-antagonist bacteria. In sum, we identify common
   mechanisms that facilitate wide-spread and diverse multipartite
   symbioses, which inform our understanding of how plants develop in

Abstract = {The extensive biodiversification of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera)
   is partly attributed to their unique mouth -parts (proboscis {[}Pr])
   that can span in length from less than 1 mm to over 280 mm in Darwin's
   sphinx moths. Lepi-doptera, similar to other insects, are believed to
   inhale and exhale respiratory gases only through valve-like spi-racles
   on their thorax and abdomen, making gas exchange through the narrow
   tracheae (Tr) challenging for the elongated Pr. How Lepidoptera overcome
   distance effects for gas transport to the Pr is an open question that is
   important to understanding how the Pr elongated over evolutionary time.
   Here, we show with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray imaging that
   distance effects on gas exchange are overcome by previously unreported
   micropores on the Pr surface and by superhydrophobic Tr that prevent
   water loss and entry. We find that the density of micropores decreases
   monotonically along the Pr length with the maxima proportional to the Pr
   length and that micropore diameters produce a Knudsen number at the
   boundary between the slip and transition flow regimes. By numerical
   estimation, we further show that the respiratory gas exchange for the Pr
   predominantly occurs via diffusion through the micropores. These
   adaptations are key innovations vital to Pr elongation, which likely
   facilitated lepidopteran biodiversification and the radiation of
   angiosperms by coevolutionary processes.},

Abstract = {Internal predictions about the sensory consequences of self-motion,
   encoded by corollary discharge, are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom,
   including for fruit flies, dragonflies, and humans. In contrast,
   predicting the future location of an independently moving external
   target requires an internal model. With the use of in-ternal models for
   predictive gaze control, vertebrate predatory species compensate for
   their sluggish visual systems and long sensorimotor latencies. This
   ability is crucial for the timely and accurate decisions that un-derpin
   a successful attack. Here, we directly demonstrate that the robber fly
   Laphria saffrana, a specialized beetle predator, also uses predictive
   gaze control when head tracking potential prey. Laphria uses this
   pre-dictive ability to perform the difficult categorization and
   perceptual decision task of differentiating a beetle from other flying
   insects with a low spatial resolution retina. Specifically, we show that
   (1) this predictive behavior is part of a saccade-and-fixate strategy,
   (2) the relative target angular position and velocity, ac-quired during
   fixation, inform the subsequent predictive saccade, and (3) the
   predictive saccade provides Laphria with additional fixation time to
   sample the frequency of the prey's specular wing reflections. We also
   demonstrate that Laphria uses such wing reflections as a proxy for the
   wingbeat frequency of the poten-tial prey and that consecutively
   flashing LEDs to produce apparent motion elicits attacks when the LED
   flicker frequency matches that of the beetle's wingbeat cycle.},

Abstract = {Malignant tumors trigger a complex network of inflammatory and wound
   repair responses, prompting Dvor-ak's characterization of tumors as
   ``wounds that never heal.{''}1 Some of these responses lead to profound
   defects in blood clotting, such as disseminated intravascular
   coagulopathy (DIC), which correlate with poor prognoses.2-4 Here, we
   demonstrate that a new tumor model in Drosophila provokes phenotypes
   that resemble coagulopathies observed in patients. Fly ovarian tumors
   overproduce multiple secreted com-ponents of the clotting cascade and
   trigger hypercoagulation of fly blood (hemolymph). Hypercoagulation
   occurs shortly after tumor induction and is transient; it is followed by
   a hypocoagulative state that is defective in wound healing. Cellular
   clotting regulators accumulate on the tumor over time and are depleted
   from the body, suggesting that hypocoagulation is caused by exhaustion
   of host clotting components. We show that rescuing coagulopathy by
   depleting a tumor-produced clotting factor improves survival of
   tumor-bearing flies, despite the fact that flies have an open
   (non-vascular) circulatory system. As clinical studies suggest that
   lethality in patients with high serum levels of clotting components can
   be independent of thrombotic events,5,6 our work establishes a platform
   for identifying alternative mechanisms by which tumor-driven
   coagulopathy triggers early mortality. Moreover, it opens up exploration

Abstract = {Being part of a group facilitates cooperation between group members but
   also creates competition for re-sources. This is a conundrum for gravid
   females, whose future offspring benefit from being in a group only if
   there are enough resources relative to group size. Females may therefore
   be expected to modulate repro-ductive output depending on social
   context. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, females actively
   attract conspecifics to lay eggs on the same resources, generating
   groups in which individuals may cooperate or compete. The genetic
   tractability of this species allows dissecting the mechanisms underlying
   physiological adaptation to social context. Here, we show that females
   produce eggs increasingly faster as group size in-creases. By laying
   eggs faster when grouped than when isolated, females reduce competition
   between offspring and increase offspring survival. In addition, grouped
   females lay eggs during the day, while isolated females lay them at
   night. We show that responses to the presence of others requires visual
   input and that flies from any sex, mating status, or species can trigger
   these responses. The mechanisms of this modulation of egg laying by
   group is connected to a lifting of the inhibition of light on oogenesis
   and egg laying, possibly mediated in part by an increase in juvenile
   hormone activity. Because modulation of reproduction by social context
   is a hallmark of animals with higher levels of sociality, our findings
   in a species considered solitary question the validity of this
   nomenclature and suggest a widespread and profound influence of social
   context on reproduction.},

Abstract = {Competition drives rapid evolution, which, in turn, alters the
   trajectory of ecological communities. These ecoevolutionary dynamics are
   increasingly well-appreciated, but we lack a mechanistic framework for
   identifying the types of traits that will evolve and their trajectories.
   Metabolic theory offers explicit predictions for how competition should
   shape the (co)evolution of metabolism and size, but these are untested,
   particularly in eukaryotes. We use experimental evolution of a
   eukaryotic microalga to examine how metabolism, size, and demography
   coevolve under inter-and intraspecific competition. We find that the
   focal species evolves in accordance with the predictions of metabolic
   theory, reducing metabolic costs and maximizing population carrying
   capacity via changes in cell size. The smaller-evolved cells initially
   had lower population growth rates, as expected from their
   hyper-allometric metabolic scaling, but longer-term evolution yielded
   important departures from theory: we observed improvements in both
   population growth rate and carrying capacity. The evasion of this
   trade-off arose due to the rapid evolution of metabolic plasticity.
   Lineages exposed to competition evolved more labile metabolisms that
   tracked resource availability more effectively than lineages that were
   competition-free. That metabolic evolution can occur is unsurprising,
   but our finding that metabolic plasticity also co-evolves rapidly is
   new. Metabolic theory provides a powerful theoretical basis for
   predicting the eco-evolutionary responses to changing resource regimes
   driven by global change. Metabolic theory needs also to be updated to
   incorporate the effects of metabolic plasticity on the link between
   metabolism and demography, as this likely plays an underappreciated role
   in mediating eco-evolutionary dynamics of competition.},

Abstract = {In many reptile species, gonadal sex is affected by environmental
   temperature during a critical period of embryonic development-a process
   known as temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD).1 The oviparous
   red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, has a warm-female/cool-male
   TSD system and is among the best-studied members of this group.2 When
   incubated at low temperatures, the somatic cells of the bipotential
   gonad differentiate into Sertoli cells, the support cells of the testis,
   whereas at high temperatures, they differentiate into granulosa cells,
   the support cells of the ovary.3 Here, we report the unexpected finding
   that temperature independently affects the number of primordial germ
   cells (GCs) in the embryonic gonad at a time before somatic cell
   differentiation has initiated. Specifically, embryos incubated at
   higher, female inducing temperatures have more GCs than those incubated
   at the male-inducing temperature. Furthermore, elimination of GCs in
   embryos incubating at intermediate temperatures results in a strong
   shift toward male biased sex ratios. This is the first evidence that
   temperature affects GC number and the first evidence that GC number
   influences sex determination in amniotes. This observation has two
   important implications. First, it supports a new model in which
   temperature can impact sex determination in incremental ways through
   multiple cell types. Second, the findings have important implications
   for a major unresolved question in the fields of ecology and
   evolutionary biology-the adaptive significance of TSD. We suggest that
   linking high GC number with female development improves female
   reproductive potential and provides an adaptive advantage for TSD.},

Abstract = {Most terrestrial animals naturally accumulate electrostatic charges,
   meaning that they will generate electric forces that interact with other
   charges in their environment, including those on or within other
   organisms. However, how this naturally occurring static electricity
   influences the ecology and life history of organisms remains largely
   unknown.1 Mammals, birds, and reptiles are known to carry appreciable
   net electrostatic charges, equivalent to surface potentials on the order
   of hundreds to tens of thousands of volts.1-7 Therefore, we hypothesize
   that their parasites, such as ticks, are passively attracted onto their
   surfaces by electrostatic forces acting across air gaps. This
   biophysical mechanism is proposed by us to assist these ectoparasites in
   making contact with their hosts, increasing their effective
   ``reach{''}because they are otherwise incapable of jumping. Herein,
   experimental and theoretical evidence show that the tick Ixodes ricinus
   (Figure 1A) can close the gap to their hosts using ecologically relevant
   electric fields. We also find that this electrostatic interaction is not
   significantly influenced by the polarity of the electric field,
   revealing that the mechanism of attraction relies upon induction of an
   electrical polarization within the tick, as opposed to a static charge
   on its surface. These findings open a new dimension to our understanding
   of how ticks, and possibly many other terrestrial organisms, find and
   attach to their hosts or vectors. Furthermore, this discovery may
   inspire novel solutions for mitigating the notable and often devastating
   economic, social, and public health impacts of ticks on humans and
   livestock.8-15},

Abstract = {The genes that drive development each typically have many different
   enhancers. Properly coordinating the action of these different enhancers
   is crucial to correctly specifying cell-fate decisions, yet it remains
   poorly understood how their activity is choregraphed in time. To shed
   light on this question, we used recently devel-oped single-cell live
   imaging tools to dissect the regulation of Fushi tarazu (Ftz) in
   Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Ftz is a transcription factor that is
   expressed in asymmetric stripes by two distinct enhancers:
   au-toregulatory and zebra. The anterior edge of each stripe needs to be
   sharply defined to specify essential line-age boundaries. Here, we
   tracked how boundary cells commit to either a high-Ftz or low-Ftz fate
   by measuring Ftz protein traces in real time and simultaneously
   quantifying transcription from the endogenous locus and individual
   enhancers. This revealed that the autoregulatory enhancer does not
   establish this fate choice. Instead, it perpetuates the decision defined
   by zebra. This is contrary to the prevailing view that au-toregulation
   drives the fate decision by causing bi-stable Ftz expression.
   Furthermore, we showed that the autoregulatory enhancer is not activated
   based on a Ftz-concentration threshold but through a timing-based
   mechanism. We hypothesize that this is regulated by several ubiquitously
   expressed pioneer-like transcrip-tion factors, which have recently been
   shown to act as timers in the embryo. Our work provides new insight into
   how precisely timed enhancer activity can directly regulate the dynamics
   of gene regulatory networks, which may be a general mechanism for
   ensuring that embryogenesis runs like clockwork.},

Abstract = {The capacity of beneficial microbes to compete for host infection-and
   the ability of hosts to discriminate among them-introduces evolutionary
   conflict that is predicted to destabilize mutualism. We investigated
   fitness outcomes in associations between legumes and their symbiotic
   rhizobia to characterize fitness im-pacts of microbial competition.
   Diverse Bradyrhizobium strains varying in their capacity to fix nitrogen
   sym-biotically with a common host plant, Acmispon strigosus, were tested
   in full-factorial coinoculation experi-ments involving 28 pairwise
   strain combinations. We analyzed the effects of interstrain competition
   and host discrimination on symbiotic-interaction outcomes by
   relativizing fitness proxies to clonally infected and uninfected
   controls. More than one thousand root nodules of coinoculated plants
   were genotyped to quantify strain occupancy, and the Bradyrhizobium
   strain genome sequences were analyzed to uncover the genetic bases of
   interstrain competition outcomes. Strikingly, interstrain competition
   favored a fast-growing, minimally beneficial rhizobia strain. Host
   benefits were significantly diminished in coinoculation treatments
   relative to expectations from clonally inoculated controls, consistent
   with competitive interfer-ence among rhizobia that reduced both
   nodulation and plant growth. Competition traits appear polygenic, linked
   with inter-strain allelopathic interactions in the rhizosphere. This
   study confirms that competition among strains can destabilize mutualism
   by favoring microbes that are superior in colonizing host tissues but
   provide minimal benefits to host plants. Moreover, our findings help
   resolve the paradox that despite effi-cient host control post infection,
   legumes nonetheless encounter rhizobia that vary in their nitrogen
   fixation.},

Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Cephalopods are highly visual animals with camera-type eyes, large
   brains, and a rich repertoire of visually guided behaviors. However, the
   cephalopod brain evolved independently from those of other highly visual
   species, such as vertebrates; therefore, the neural circuits that
   process sensory information are profoundly different. It is largely
   unknown how their powerful but unique visual system functions, as there
   have been no direct neural measurements of visual responses in the
   cephalopod brain. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to
   record visually evoked responses in the primary visual processing center
   of the octopus central brain, the optic lobe, to determine how basic
   features of the visual scene are represented and organized. We found
   spatially localized receptive fields for light (ON) and dark (OFF)
   stimuli, which were retinotopically organized across the optic lobe,
   demonstrating a hallmark of visual system organization shared across
   many species. An examination of these responses revealed transformations
   of the visual representation across the layers of the optic lobe,
   including the emergence of the OFF pathway and increased size
   selectivity. We also identified asymmetries in the spatial processing of
   ON and OFF stimuli, which suggest unique circuit mechanisms for form
   processing that may have evolved to suit the specific demands of
   processing an underwater visual scene. This study provides insight into
   the neural processing and functional organization of the octopus visual
   system, highlighting both shared and unique aspects, and lays a
   foundation for future studies of the neural circuits that mediate visual
   processing and behavior in cephalopods.},

Pages = {2830+},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Understanding how horizontally transmitted mutualisms are maintained is
   a major focus of symbiosis research.1-4 Unlike vertical transmission,
   hosts that rely on horizontal transmission produce symbiont-free
   offspring that must find and acquire their beneficial microbes from the
   environment. This transmission strat-egy is inherently risky since hosts
   may not obtain the right symbiont every generation. Despite these
   potential costs, horizontal transmission underlies stable mutualisms
   involving a large diversity of both plants and an-imals.5-9 One largely
   unexplored way horizontal transmission is maintained is for hosts to
   evolve sophisti-cated mechanisms to consistently find and acquire
   specific symbionts from the environment. Here, we examine this
   possibility in the squash bug Anasa tristis, an insect pest that
   requires bacterial symbionts in the genus Caballeronia10 for survival
   and development.11 We conduct a series of behavioral and transmission
   experiments that track strain-level transmission in vivo among
   individuals in real-time. We demonstrate that nymphs can accurately find
   feces from adult bugs in both the presence and absence of those adults.
   Once nymphs locate the feces, they deploy feeding behavior that results
   in nearly perfect symbiont acquisition suc-cess. We further demonstrate
   that nymphs can locate and feed on isolated, cultured symbionts in the
   absence of feces. Finally, we show this acquisition behavior is highly
   host specific. Taken together, our data describe not only the evolution
   of a reliable horizontal transmission strategy, but also a potential
   mech-anism that drives patterns of species-specific microbial
   communities among closely related, sympatric host species.},

Abstract = {The coleoid cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus, and squid) are a group of
   soft-bodied marine mollusks that exhibit an array of interesting
   biological phenomena, including dynamic camouflage, complex social
   be-haviors, prehensile regenerating arms, and large brains capable of
   learning, memory, and problem-solv-ing.1-10 The dwarf cuttlefish, Sepia
   bandensis, is a promising model cephalopod species due to its small
   size, substantial egg production, short generation time, and dynamic
   social and camouflage behaviors.11 Cuttlefish dynamically camouflage to
   their surroundings by changing the color, pattern, and texture of their
   skin. Camouflage is optically driven and is achieved by expanding and
   contracting hundreds of thou-sands of pigment-filled saccules
   (chromatophores) in the skin, which are controlled by motor neurons
   emanating from the brain. We generated a dwarf cuttlefish brain atlas
   using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning, and histology,
   and we built an interactive web tool (https://www.cuttlebase.org/) to
   host the data. Guided by observations in other cephalopods,12-20 we
   identified 32 brain lobes, including two large optic lobes (75\% the
   total volume of the brain), chromatophore lobes whose motor neurons
   directly innervate the chromatophores of the color-changing skin, and a
   vertical lobe that has been impli-cated in learning and memory. The
   brain largely conforms to the anatomy observed in other Sepia species

Abstract = {Interactions between different animal species are a critical determinant
   of each species' evolution and range expansion. Chemical, visual, and
   mechanical interactions have been abundantly reported, but the
   importance of electric interactions is not well understood. Here, we
   report the discovery that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans transfers
   across electric fields to achieve phoretic attachment to insects. First,
   we found that dauer larvae of C. elegans nictating on a substrate in a
   Petri dish moved directly to the lid through the air due to the
   electrostatic force from the lid. To more systematically investigate the
   transfer behavior, we constructed an assay system with well-controlled
   electric fields: the worms flew up regardless of whether a positive or
   negative electric field was applied, suggesting that an induced charge
   within the worm is related to this transfer. The mean take-off speed is
   0.86 m/s, and the worm flies up under an electric field exceeding 200
   kV/m. This worm transfer occurs even when the worms form a nictation
   column composed of up to 100 worms; we term this behavior ``multiworm
   transfer.{''}These observations led us to conclude that C. elegans can
   transfer and attach to the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, which was
   charged by rubbing with flower pollen in the lab. The charge on the
   bumblebee was measured with a coulomb-meter to be 806 pC, which was
   within the range of bumblebee charges and of the same order of flying
   insect charges observed in nature, suggesting that electrical
   interactions occur among different species.},

Abstract = {Stomata are controllable micropores formed between two adjacent guard
   cells (GCs) that regulate gas flow across the plant surface.1 Grasses,
   among the most successful organisms on the planet and the main food
   crops for humanity, have GCs flanked by specialized lateral subsidiary
   cells (SCs).2-4 SCs improve performance by acting as a local pool of
   ions and metabolites to drive changes in turgor pressure within the GCs
   that open/close the stomatal pore.4-8 The 4-celled complex also involves
   distinctive changes in geometry, having dumbbell-shaped GCs compared
   with typical kidney-shaped stomata.2,4,9 However, the degree to which
   this distinctive geometry contributes to improved stomatal performance,
   and the underlying mechanism, remains unclear. To address this question,
   we created a finite element method (FEM) model of a grass stomatal
   complex that successfully captures experimentally observed pore
   opening/closure. Exploration of the model, including in silico and
   experimental mutant analyses, supports the importance of a reciprocal
   pressure system between GCs and SCs for effective stomatal function,
   with SCs functioning as springs to restrain lateral GC movement. Our
   results show that SCs are not essential but lead to a more responsive
   system. In addition, we show that GC wall anisotropy is not required for
   grass stomatal function (in contrast to kidney-shaped GCs10) but that a
   relatively thick GC rod region is needed to enhance pore opening. Our
   results demonstrate that a specific cellular geometry and associated
   mechanical properties are required for the effective functioning of
   grass stomata.},

Abstract = {Bachman's warbler1 (Vermivora bachmanii)-last sighted in 1988-is one of
   the only North American passerines to recently go extinct.2-4 Given
   extensive ongoing hybridization of its two extant congeners-the blue
   winged warbler (V. cyanoptera) and golden-winged warbler (V.
   chrysoptera)5-8-and shared patterns of plumage variation between
   Bachman's warbler and hybrids between those extant species, it has been
   suggested that Bachman's warbler might have also had a component of
   hybrid ancestry. Here, we use historic DNA (hDNA) and whole genomes of
   Bachman's warblers collected at the turn of the 20th century to address
   this. We combine these data with the two extant Vermivora species to
   examine patterns of population differentiation, inbreeding, and gene
   flow. In contrast to the admixture hypothesis, the genomic evidence is
   consistent with V. bachmanii having been a highly divergent,
   reproductively isolated species, with no evidence of introgression. We
   show that these three species have similar levels of runs of
   homozygosity (ROH), consistent with effects of a small long-term
   effective population size or population bottlenecks, with one V.
   bachmanii outlier showing numerous long ROH and a FROH greater than 5\%.
   We also found-using population branch statistic estimates-previously
   undocumented evidence of lineage-specific evolution in V. chrysoptera
   near a pigmentation gene candidate, CORIN, which is a known modifier of
   ASIP, which is in turn involved in melanic throat and mask coloration in
   this family of birds. Together, these genomic results also highlight how
   natural history collections are such invaluable repositories of
   information about extant and extinct species.},

Abstract = {The vestibular system in the inner ear plays a central role in
   sensorimotor control by informing the brain about the orientation and
   acceleration of the head. However, most experiments in neurophysiology
   are performed using head-fixed configurations, depriving animals of
   vestibular inputs. To overcome this limitation, we decorated the
   utricular otolith of the vestibular system in larval zebrafish with
   paramagnetic nanoparticles. This procedure effectively endowed the
   animal with magneto-sensitive capacities: applied magnetic field
   gradients induced forces on the otoliths, resulting in robust behavioral
   responses comparable to those evoked by rotating the animal by up to 25
   degrees. We recorded the whole-brain neuronal response to this fictive
   motion stimulation using light-sheet functional imaging. Experiments
   performed in unilaterally injected fish revealed the activation of a
   commissural inhibition between the brain hemispheres. This
   magnetic-based stimulation technique for larval zebrafish opens new
   perspectives to functionally dissect the neural circuits underlying
   vestibular processing and to develop multisensory virtual environments,
   including vestibular feedback.},

Title = {Cambrian stem-group ambulacrarians and the nature of the ancestral
   deuterostome},

Abstract = {Deuterostomes are characterized by some of the most widely divergent
   body plans in the animal kingdom. These striking morphological
   differences have hindered efforts to predict ancestral characters, with
   the origin and earliest evolution of the group remaining ambiguous.
   Several iconic Cambrian fossils have been suggested to be early
   deuterostomes and hence could help elucidate ancestral character states.
   However, their phylogenetic relationships are controversial. Here, we
   describe new, exceptionally preserved specimens of the discoidal
   metazoan Rotadiscus grandis from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota of
   China. These reveal a previously unknown double spiral structure, which
   we interpret as a chordate-like covering to a coelomopore, located
   adjacent to a horseshoe-shaped tentacle complex. The tentacles differ in
   key aspects from those seen in lophophorates and are instead more
   similar to the tentacular systems of extant pterobranchs and
   echinoderms. Thus, Rotadiscus exhibits a chimeric combination of
   ambulacrarian and chordate characters. Phylogenetic analyses recover
   Rotadiscus and closely related fossil taxa as stem ambulacrarians,
   filling a significant morphological gap in the deuterostome tree of
   life. These results allow us to reconstruct the ancestral body plans of
   major clades of deuterostomes, revealing that key traits of extant
   forms, such as a post-anal region, gill bars, and a U-shaped gut,
   evolved through convergence.},
