Abstract = {Predicting adaptive phenotypic evolution depends on invariable selection
   gradients and on the stability of the genetic covariances between the
   component traits of the multivariate phenotype. We describe the
   evolution of six traits of locomotion behavior and body size in the
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for 50 generations of adaptation to a
   novel environment. We show that the direction of adaptive multivariate
   phenotypic evolution can be predicted from the ancestral selection
   differentials, particularly when the traits were measured in the new
   environment. Interestingly, the evolution of individual traits does not
   always occur in the direction of selection, nor are trait responses to
   selection always homogeneous among replicate populations. These
   observations are explained because the phenotypic dimension with most of
   the ancestral standing genetic variation only partially aligns with the
   phenotypic dimension under directional selection. These findings
   validate selection theory and suggest that the direction of multivariate
   adaptive phenotypic evolution is predictable for tens of generations.},

Title = {An armoured marine reptile from the Early Triassic of South China and
   its phylogenetic and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Sauropterygia was a taxonomically and ecomorphologically diverse clade
   of Mesozoic marine reptiles spanning the Early Triassic to the Late
   Cretaceous. Sauropterygians are traditionally divided into two groups
   representing two markedly different body plans - the short-necked,
   durophagous Placodontia and the long-necked Eosauropterygia - whereas
   Saurosphargidae, a small clade of armoured marine reptiles, is generally
   considered as the sauropterygian sister-group. However, the early
   evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their phylogenetic
   relationships with other groups within Diapsida are still incompletely
   understood. Here, we report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic
   (Olenekian) of South China - Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis gen. et
   sp. nov. - representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An
   updated phylogenetic analysis focussing on the interrelationships among
   diapsid reptiles recovers saurosphargids as nested within
   sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion
   of placodonts. Furthermore, a clade comprising Eusaurosphargis and
   Palatodonta is recovered as the sauropterygian sister-group within
   Sauropterygomorpha tax. nov. The phylogenetic position of several Early
   and Middle Triassic sauropterygians of previously uncertain phylogenetic
   affinity, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and
   Corosaurus, is also clarified, elucidating the early evolutionary
   assembly of the sauropterygian body plan. Finally, our phylogenetic
   analysis supports the placement of Testudines and Archosauromorpha
   within Archelosauria, a result strongly corroborated by molecular data,
   but only recently recovered in a phylogenetic analysis using a
   morphology-only dataset. Our study provides evidence for the rapid
   diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the
   Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasises the importance of
   broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships
   among extinct taxa.},

Title = {Plant secondary metabolite-dependent plant-soil feedbacks can improve
   crop yield in the field},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Plant secondary metabolites that are released into the rhizosphere alter
   biotic and abiotic soil properties, which in turn affect the performance
   of other plants. How this type of plant-soil feedback affects
   agricultural productivity and food quality in the field in the context
   of crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the performance, yield
   and food quality of three winter wheat varieties growing in field plots
   whose soils had been conditioned by either wild type or
   benzoxazinoid-deficient bx1 maize mutant plants. Following maize
   cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial
   fingerprints in the soil. The benzoxazinoid fingerprint was still
   visible during wheat growth, but the microbial fingerprint was no longer
   detected. Wheat emergence, tillering, growth, and biomass increased in
   wild type conditioned soils compared to bx1 mutant conditioned soils.
   Weed cover was similar between soil conditioning treatments, but insect
   herbivore abundance decreased in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. Wheat
   yield was increased by over 4\% without a reduction in grain quality in
   benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. This improvement was directly
   associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our
   experiments provide evidence that soil conditioning by plant secondary
   metabolite producing plants can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks
   under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds true
   across different soils and environments, optimizing root exudation
   chemistry could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance
   crop yields without additional inputs.},

Title = {Comparing the evolutionary dynamics of predominant SARS-CoV-2 virus
   lineages co-circulating in Mexico},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Over 200 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages have been observed in Mexico by
   November 2021. To investigate lineage replacement dynamics, we applied a
   phylodynamic approach and explored the evolutionary trajectories of five
   dominant lineages that circulated during the first year of local
   transmission. For most lineages, peaks in sampling frequencies coincided
   with different epidemiological waves of infection in Mexico. Lineages
   B.1.1.222 and B.1.1.519 exhibited similar dynamics, constituting clades
   that likely originated in Mexico and persisted for >12 months. Lineages
   B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.617.2 also displayed similar dynamics,
   characterized by multiple introduction events leading to a few
   successful extended local transmission chains that persisted for several
   months. For the largest B.1.617.2 clades, we further explored viral
   lineage movements across Mexico. Many clades were located within the
   south region of the country, suggesting that this area played a key role
   in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico.},

Title = {A brain-wide analysis maps structural evolution to distinct anatomical
   module},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {The vertebrate brain is highly conserved topologically, but less is
   known about neuroanatomical variation between individual brain regions.
   Neuroanatomical variation at the regional level is hypothesized to
   provide functional expansion, building upon ancestral anatomy needed for
   basic functions. Classically, animal models used to study evolution have
   lacked tools for detailed anatomical analysis that are widely used in
   zebrafish and mice, presenting a barrier to studying brain evolution at
   fine scales. In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of
   brain anatomy using a single species of fish consisting of divergent
   surface and cave morphs, that permits functional genetic testing of
   regional volume and shape across the entire brain. We generated a
   high-resolution brain atlas for the blind Mexican cavefish Astyanax
   mexicanus and coupled the atlas with automated computational tools to
   directly assess variability in brain region shape and volume across all
   populations. We measured the volume and shape of every grossly defined
   neuroanatomical region of the brain and assessed correlations between
   anatomical regions in surface fish, cavefish, and surface x cave F-2
   hybrids, whose phenotypes span the range of surface to cave. We find
   that dorsal regions of the brain are contracted, while ventral regions
   have expanded, with F-2 hybrid data providing support for developmental
   constraint along the dorsal-ventral axis. Furthermore, these
   dorsal-ventral relationships in anatomical variation show similar
   patterns for both volume and shape, suggesting that the anatomical
   evolution captured by these two parameters could be driven by similar
   developmental mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that A.
   mexicanus is a powerful system for functionally determining basic
   principles of brain evolution and will permit testing how genes
   influence early patterning events to drive brain-wide anatomical
   evolution.},

Title = {Temperature sensitivity of the interspecific interaction strength of
   coastal marine fish communities},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {The effects of temperature on interaction strengths are important for
   understanding and forecasting how global climate change impacts marine
   ecosystems; however, tracking and quantifying interactions of marine
   fish species are practically difficult especially under field
   conditions, and thus, how temperature influences their interaction
   strengths under field conditions remains poorly understood. We herein
   performed quantitative fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding on
   550 seawater samples that were collected twice a month from 11 coastal
   sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula, Japan, and analyzed eDNA
   monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. We
   detected fish-fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time
   series, reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently
   detected species, and quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction
   strengths. Although there was a large variation, water temperature
   influenced fish-fish interaction strengths. The impact of water
   temperature on interspecific interaction strengths varied among fish
   species, suggesting that fish species identity influences the
   temperature effects on interactions. For example, interaction strengths
   that Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus received
   strongly increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis
   japonicus and Girella punctata decreased with water temperature. An
   increase in water temperature induced by global climate change may
   change fish interactions in a complex way, which consequently influences
   marine community dynamics and stability. Our research demonstrates a
   practical research framework to study the effects of environmental
   variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature,
   which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine
   ecosystem dynamics. eLife digestThe world's oceans are home to tens of
   thousands of fish species, many of which live in nutrient-rich coastal
   waters. Different species living in a particular environment interact
   with each other in many ways. For example, a predatory fish may prey on
   some species of small fish but avoid feeding on others that help it by
   removing parasites from its skin. Rising ocean temperatures caused by
   global climate change could affect how different fish species interact
   with one another and, as a result, impact their communities.One of the
   first steps to understanding how fish interact with each other in nature
   typically requires researchers to count the number of different species
   present and observe how they behave, which is time-consuming and
   labor-intensive. An alternative is to use an emerging technique in which
   researchers extract DNA from water, soil or air - known as environmental
   DNA - and analyze it to identify the species present and estimate their
   numbers.Ushio et al. analyzed hundreds of samples of seawater that had
   been collected over a two-year period from the Boso Peninsula in Japan.
   Statistical methods were used to quantify how strongly fish species
   interact with each other and determine whether the temperature of the
   water influenced how different species of fish interacted over time. The
   findings showed that water temperature had a significant but complex
   effect on how strongly pairs of fish species interacted, with both
   positive and negative effects depending on the conditions.
   The impact of water temperature on the strength of the interactions
   varied between species, for example, Japanese anchovy and largescale
   blackfish interacted less strongly with other fish species in warmer
   water, whereas the Stripey and a species of wrasse interacted with other
   fish species more strongly.The findings provide new insights into how
   water temperature affects the communities of fish living in coastal
   areas. Alongside complementing existing knowledge in the field, refining
   the research framework used in this work will benefit those working in
   fishery science by providing valuable insights into how natural and
   commercially important fish species respond to climate change.

Title = {Dopamine signaling regulates predator-driven changes in
   <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> egg laying behavior},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Prey respond to predators by altering their behavior to optimize their
   own fitness and survival. Specifically, prey are known to avoid
   predator-occupied territories to reduce their risk of harm or injury to
   themselves and their progeny. We probe the interactions between
   Caenorhabditis elegans and its naturally cohabiting predator
   Pristionchus uniformis to reveal the pathways driving changes in prey
   behavior. While C. elegans prefers to lay its eggs on a bacteria food
   lawn, the presence of a predator inside a lawn induces C. elegans to lay
   more eggs away from that lawn. We confirm that this change in egg laying
   is in response to bites from predators, rather than to predatory
   secretions. Moreover, predator-exposed prey continue to lay their eggs
   away from the dense lawn even after the predator is removed, indicating
   a form of learning. Next, we find that mutants in dopamine synthesis
   significantly reduce egg laying behavior off the lawn in both
   predator-free and predator-inhabited lawns, which we can rescue by
   transgenic complementation or supplementation with exogenous dopamine.
   Moreover, we find that dopamine is likely released from multiple
   dopaminergic neurons and requires combinations of both D1- (DOP-1) and
   D2-like (DOP-2 and DOP-3) dopamine receptors to alter predator-induced
   egg laying behavior, whereas other combinations modify baseline levels
   of egg laying behavior. Together, we show that dopamine signaling can
   alter both predator-free and predator-induced foraging strategies,
   suggesting a role for this pathway in defensive behaviors.},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {The freshwater polyp Hydra is a popular biological model system;
   however, we still do not understand one of its most salient behaviors,
   the generation of spontaneous body wall contractions. Here, by applying
   experimental fluid dynamics analysis and mathematical modeling, we
   provide functional evidence that spontaneous contractions of body walls
   enhance the transport of chemical compounds from and to the tissue
   surface where symbiotic bacteria reside. Experimentally, a reduction in
   the frequency of spontaneous body wall contractions is associated with a
   changed composition of the colonizing microbiota. Together, our findings
   suggest that spontaneous body wall contractions create an important
   fluid transport mechanism that (1) may shape and stabilize specific
   host-microbe associations and (2) create fluid microhabitats that may
   modulate the spatial distribution of the colonizing microbes. This
   mechanism may be more broadly applicable to animal-microbe interactions
   since research has shown that rhythmic spontaneous contractions in the
   gastrointestinal tracts are essential for maintaining normal microbiota.},

Title = {Behavioral dissection of hunger states in <i>Drosophila</i>},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Hunger is a motivational drive that promotes feeding, and it can be
   generated by the physiological need to consume nutrients as well as the
   hedonic properties of food. Brain circuits and mechanisms that regulate
   feeding have been described, but which of these contribute to the
   generation of motive forces that drive feeding is unclear. Here, we
   describe our first efforts at behaviorally and neuronally distinguishing
   hedonic from homeostatic hunger states in Drosophila melanogaster and
   propose that this system can be used as a model to dissect the molecular
   mechanisms that underlie feeding motivation. We visually identify and
   quantify behaviors exhibited by hungry flies and find that increased
   feeding duration is a behavioral signature of hedonic feeding
   motivation. Using a genetically encoded marker of neuronal activity, we
   find that the mushroom body (MB) lobes are activated by hedonic food
   environments, and we use optogenetic inhibition to implicate a
   dopaminergic neuron cluster (protocerebral anterior medial {[}PAM]) to
   alpha'/beta' MB circuit in hedonic feeding motivation. The
   identification of discrete hunger states in flies and the development of
   behavioral assays to measure them offers a framework to begin dissecting
   the molecular and circuit mechanisms that generate motivational states

Title = {Flexible specificity of memory in <i>Drosophila</i> depends on a
   comparison between choices},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Memory guides behavior across widely varying environments and must
   therefore be both sufficiently specific and general. A memory too
   specific will be useless in even a slightly different environment, while
   an overly general memory may lead to suboptimal choices. Animals
   successfully learn to both distinguish between very similar stimuli and
   generalize across cues. Rather than forming memories that strike a
   balance between specificity and generality, Drosophila can flexibly
   categorize a given stimulus into different groups depending on the
   options available. We asked how this flexibility manifests itself in the
   well-characterized learning and memory pathways of the fruit fly. We
   show that flexible categorization in neuronal activity as well as
   behavior depends on the order and identity of the perceived stimuli. Our
   results identify the neural correlates of flexible
   stimulus-categorization in the fruit fly.
   Editor's evaluation
   Memory recall is more precise when discrimination is required. This work
   in Drosophila shows that two related odors trigger near identical Kenyon
   cell responses when tested in isolation, but trigger different responses
   to the second odor if these are experienced in sequence within a small
   temporal window. The authors argue that this template comparison
   requires some activity downstream of Kenyon cells, that is recruited by
   MBONs. Overall, the experiments, building on a clever method to build
   ``miminal memories{''} via optogenetically restricting the formation of
   memory traces in selective output compartments of the Kenyon cell (KC)
   axon terminals, provide very nice physiological evidence for a neural
   mechanism that underlies a contextual basis for the precision of memory
   recall.},

   some flying squirrels cache elliptical or oblate nuts by hanging them
   securely in vegetation. These small flying squirrels were identified as
   Hylopetes phayrei electilis (G. M. Allen, 1925) and Hylopetes alboniger
   (Hodgson, 1870), in video clips captured of their behavior around focal
   nuts. Squirrels chewed grooves encircling ellipsoid nuts or distributed
   on the bottoms of oblate nuts, and then used these grooves to fix nuts
   tightly between small twigs 0.1-0.6 cm in diameter that were connected
   at angles of 25-40 degrees. The grooves carved on the nuts (concave
   structure) connected with Y-shaped twigs (convex structure) and thus
   firmly affixed the nuts to the plant in a way similar to a mortise
   -tenon joint used in architecture and carpentry. Cache sites were on
   small plants located 10-25 m away from the closest potentially
   nut-producing tree, a behavior that likely reduces the discovery and
   consumption of the nuts by other animals. The adaptive squirrel behavior
   that shapes and fits nuts between twigs seems to be directed at
   providing more secure storage that increases food supply during dry
   periods in a humid tropical rainforest. In addition to providing such
   benefits for the squirrels, we suggest that this behavior also impacts
   the distribution of tree species in the forest.},

Title = {Evolution of an extreme hemoglobin phenotype contributed to the
   sub-Arctic specialization of extinct Steller's sea cows},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The extinct Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas; dagger 1768) was a
   whale-sized marine mammal that manifested profound morphological
   specializations to exploit the harsh coastal climate of the North
   Pacific. Yet despite first-hand accounts of their biology, little is
   known regarding the physiological adjustments underlying their evolution
   to this environment. Here, the adult-expressed hemoglobin (Hb;
   alpha(2)beta/delta(2)) of this sirenian is shown to harbor a fixed amino
   acid replacement at an otherwise invariant position (beta/delta 82Lys ->
   Asn) that alters multiple aspects of Hb function. First, our functional
   characterization of recombinant sirenian Hb proteins demonstrates that
   the Hb-O-2 affinity of this sub-Arctic species was less affected by
   temperature than those of living (sub)tropical sea cows. This phenotype
   presumably safeguarded O-2 delivery to cool peripheral tissues and
   largely arises from a reduced intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the
   H. gigas protein. Additional experiments on H. gigas beta/delta 82Asn ->
   Lys mutant Hb further reveal this exchange renders Steller's sea cow Hb
   unresponsive to the potent intraerythrocytic allosteric effector
   2,3-diphosphoglycerate, a radical modification that is the first
   documented example of this phenotype among mammals. Notably, beta/delta
   82Lys -> Asn moreover underlies the secondary evolution of a reduced
   blood-O-2 affinity phenotype that would have promoted heightened tissue
   and maternal/ fetal O-2 delivery. This conclusion is bolstered by
   analyses of two Steller's sea cow prenatal Hb proteins (Hb Gower I; zeta
   (2)epsilon(2) and HbF; alpha(2)gamma(2)) that suggest an exclusive
   embryonic stage expression pattern, and reveal uncommon replacements in
   H. gigas HbF (gamma 38Thr -> Ile and gamma 101Glu -> Asp) that increased
   Hb-O-2 affinity relative to dugong HbF. Finally, the beta/delta 82Lys ->
   Asn replacement of the adult/fetal protein is shown to increase protein
   solubility, which may have elevated red blood cell Hb content within
   both the adult and fetal circulations and contributed to meeting the
   elevated metabolic (thermoregulatory) requirements and fetal growth
   rates associated with this species cold adaptation.},

   dilemma game},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Human society and natural environment form a complex giant ecosystem,
   where human activities not only lead to the change in environmental
   states, but also react to them. By using collective-risk social dilemma
   game, some studies have already revealed that individual contributions
   and the risk of future losses are inextricably linked. These works,
   however, often use an idealistic assumption that the risk is constant
   and not affected by individual behaviors. Here, we develop a
   coevolutionary game approach that captures the coupled dynamics of
   cooperation and risk. In particular, the level of contributions in a
   population affects the state of risk, while the risk in turn influences
   individuals' behavioral decision-making. Importantly, we explore two
   representative feedback forms describing the possible effect of strategy
   on risk, namely, linear and exponential feedbacks. We find that
   cooperation can be maintained in the population by keeping at a certain
   fraction or forming an evolutionary oscillation with risk, independently
   of the feedback type. However, such evolutionary outcome depends on the
   initial state. Taken together, a two-way coupling between collective
   actions and risk is essential to avoid the tragedy of the commons. More
   importantly, a critical starting portion of cooperators and risk level
   is what we really need for guiding the evolution toward a desired
   direction.},

Title = {Tradeoffs explain scaling, sex differences, and seasonal oscillations in
   the remarkable weapons of snapping shrimp (<i>Alpheus spp</i>.)},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Evolutionary theory suggests that individuals should express costly
   traits at a magnitude that optimizes the trait bearer's cost-benefit
   difference. Trait expression varies across a species because costs and
   benefits vary among individuals. For example, if large individuals pay
   lower costs than small individuals, then larger individuals should reach
   optimal cost-benefit differences at greater trait magnitudes. Using the
   cavitation-shooting weapons found in the big claws of male and female
   snapping shrimp, we test whether size- and sex-dependent expenditures
   explain scaling and sex differences in weapon size. We found that males
   and females from three snapping shrimp species (Alpheus heterochaelis,
   Alpheus angulosus, and Alpheus estuariensis) show patterns consistent
   with tradeoffs between weapon and abdomen size. For male A.
   heterochaelis, the species for which we had the greatest statistical
   power, smaller individuals showed steeper tradeoffs. Our extensive
   dataset in A. heterochaelis also included data about pairing, breeding
   season, and egg clutch size. Therefore, we could test for reproductive
   tradeoffs and benefits in this species. Female A. heterochaelis
   exhibited tradeoffs between weapon size and egg count, average egg
   volume, and total egg mass volume. For average egg volume, smaller
   females exhibited steeper tradeoffs. Furthermore, in males but not
   females, large weapons were positively correlated with the probability
   of being paired and the relative size of their pair mates. In
   conclusion, we identified size-dependent tradeoffs that could underlie
   reliable scaling of costly traits. Furthermore, weapons are especially
   beneficial to males and burdensome to females, which could explain why
   males have larger weapons than females.},

Title = {Larger but younger fish when growth outpaces mortality in heated
   ecosystem},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Ectotherms are predicted to `shrink' with global warming, in line with
   general growth models and the temperature-size rule (TSR), both
   predicting smaller adult sizes with warming. However, they also predict
   faster juvenile growth rates and thus larger size-at-age of young
   organisms. Hence, the result of warming on the size-structure of a
   population depends on the interplay between how mortality rate,
   juvenile- and adult growth rates are affected by warming. Here, we use
   two-decade long time series of biological samples from a unique enclosed
   bay heated by cooling water from a nearby nuclear power plant to become
   5-10 degrees C warmer than its reference area. We used growth-increment
   biochronologies (12,658 reconstructed length-at-age estimates from 2426
   individuals) to quantify how >20 years of warming has affected body
   growth, size-at-age, and catch to quantify mortality rates and
   population size- and age structure of Eurasian perch (Perca
   fluviatilis). In the heated area, growth rates were faster for all
   sizes, and hence size-at-age was larger for all ages, compared to the
   reference area. While mortality rates were also higher (lowering mean
   age by 0.4 years), the faster growth rates lead to a 2 cm larger mean
   size in the heated area. Differences in the size-spectrum exponent
   (describing how the abundance declines with size) were less clear
   statistically. Our analyses reveal that mortality, in addition to
   plastic growth and size-responses, is a key factor determining the size
   structure of populations exposed to warming. Understanding the
   mechanisms by which warming affects the size- and the age structure of
   populations is critical for predicting the impacts of climate change on
   ecological functions, interactions, and dynamics.},

Title = {Complex plumages spur rapid color diversification in kingfishers (Aves:
   Alcedinidae)},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Colorful signals in nature provide some of the most stunning examples of
   rapid phenotypic evolution. Yet, studying color pattern evolution has
   been historically difficult owing to differences in perceptual ability
   of humans and analytical challenges with studying how complex color
   patterns evolve. Island systems provide a natural laboratory for testing
   hypotheses about the direction and magnitude of phenotypic change. A
   recent study found that plumage colors of island species are darker and
   less complex than continental species. Whether such shifts in plumage
   complexity are associated with increased rates of color evolution
   remains unknown. Here, we use geometric morphometric techniques to test
   the hypothesis that plumage complexity and insularity interact to
   influence color diversity in a species -rich clade of colorful
   birds-kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae). In particular, we test three
   predictions: (1) plumage complexity enhances interspecific rates of
   color evolution, (2) plumage complexity is lower on islands, and (3)
   rates of plumage color evolution are higher on islands. Our results show
   that more complex plumages result in more diverse colors among species
   and that island species have higher rates of color evolution.
   Importantly, we found that island species did not have more complex
   plumages than their continental relatives. Thus, complexity may be a key
   innovation that facilitates evolutionary response of individual color
   patches to distinct selection pressures on islands, rather than being a
   direct target of selection itself. This study demonstrates how a truly
   multivariate treatment of color data can reveal evolutionary patterns
   that might otherwise go unnoticed.},

Title = {Echolocating bats prefer a high risk-high gain foraging strategy to
   increase prey profitability},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Predators that target multiple prey types are predicted to switch
   foraging modes according to prey profitability to increase energy
   returns in dynamic environments. Here, we use bat-borne tags and DNA
   metabarcoding of feces to test the hypothesis that greater mouse-eared
   bats make immediate foraging decisions based on prey profitability and
   changes in the environment. We show that these bats use two foraging
   strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial
   insects and 29 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat, but with much
   higher capture success in the air (76\%) vs ground (30\%). However,
   owing to the 3-20 times larger ground prey, 85\% of the nightly food
   acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure
   rates. We find that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given
   night suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behavior to weather and
   ground conditions. We conclude that these bats use high risk-high gain
   gleaning of ground prey as a primary foraging tactic, but switch to
   aerial hunting when environmental changes reduce the profitability of
   ground prey, showing that prey switching matched to environmental
   dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in
   specialized predators.},

Title = {Epidermal threads reveal the origin of hagfish slime},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {When attacked, hagfishes produce a soft, fibrous defensive slime within
   a fraction of a second by ejecting mucus and threads into seawater. The
   rapid setup and remarkable expansion of the slime make it a highly
   effective and unique form of defense. How this biomaterial evolved is
   unknown, although circumstantial evidence points to the epidermis as the
   origin of the thread- and mucus-producing cells in the slime glands.
   Here, we describe large intracellular threads within a putatively
   homologous cell type from hagfish epidermis. These epidermal threads
   averaged similar to 2 mm in length and similar to 0.5 mu m in diameter.
   The entire hagfish body is covered by a dense layer of epidermal thread
   cells, with each square millimeter of skin storing a total of similar to
   96 cm threads. Experimentally induced damage to a hagfish's skin caused
   the release of threads, which together with mucus, formed an adhesive
   epidermal slime that is more fibrous and less dilute than the defensive
   slime. Transcriptome analysis further suggests that epidermal threads
   are ancestral to the slime threads, with duplication and diversification
   of thread genes occurring in parallel with the evolution of slime
   glands. Our results support an epidermal origin of hagfish slime, which
   may have been driven by selection for stronger and more voluminous
   slime.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary trajectories and genetic architectures underlying
   ecological divergence with gene flow are poorly understood. Sympatric
   timing types of the intertidal insect Clunio marinus (Diptera) from
   Roscoff (France) differ in lunar reproductive timing. One type
   reproduces at full moon, the other at new moon, controlled by a
   circalunar clock of yet unknown molecular nature. Lunar reproductive
   timing is a magic trait for a sympatric speciation process, as it is
   both ecologically relevant and entails assortative mating. Here, we show
   that the difference in reproductive timing is controlled by at least
   four quantitative trait loci (QTL) on three different chromosomes. They
   are partly associated with complex inversions, but differentiation of
   the inversion haplotypes cannot explain the different phenotypes. The
   most differentiated locus in the entire genome, with QTL support, is the
   period locus, implying that this gene could not only be involved in
   circadian timing but also in lunar timing. Our data indicate that magic
   traits can be based on an oligogenic architecture and can be maintained

Title = {Community diversity is associated with intra-species genetic diversity
   and gene loss in the human gut microbiome},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {How the ecological process of community assembly interacts with
   intra-species diversity and evolutionary change is a longstanding
   question. Two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed: Diversity
   Begets Diversity (DBD), in which taxa tend to become more diverse in
   already diverse communities, and Ecological Controls (EC), in which
   higher community diversity impedes diversification. Previously, using
   16S rRNA gene amplicon data across a range of microbiomes, we showed a
   generally positive relationship between taxa diversity and community
   diversity at higher taxonomic levels, consistent with the predictions of
   DBD (Madi et al., 2020). However, this positive `diversity slope'
   plateaus at high levels of community diversity. Here we show that this
   general pattern holds at much finer genetic resolution, by analyzing
   intra-species strain and nucleotide variation in static and temporally
   sampled metagenomes from the human gut microbiome. Consistent with DBD,
   both intra-species polymorphism and strain number were positively
   correlated with community Shannon diversity. Shannon diversity is also
   predictive of increases in polymorphism over time scales up to similar
   to 4-6 months, after which the diversity slope flattens and becomes
   negative - consistent with DBD eventually giving way to EC. Finally, we
   show that higher community diversity predicts gene loss at a future time
   point. This observation is broadly consistent with the Black Queen
   Hypothesis, which posits that genes with functions provided by the
   community are less likely to be retained in a focal species' genome.
   Together, our results show that a mixture of DBD, EC, and Black Queen
   may operate simultaneously in the human gut microbiome, adding to a
   growing body of evidence that these eco-evolutionary processes are key
   drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Abstract = {The avian palaeognath phylogeny has been recently revised significantly

   Ancestral state reconstruction and parsimony analysis additionally show
   that rhea-style eggshell represents the ancestral state of palaeognath
   eggshells both in microstructure and crystallography. The ornithological
   and palaeontological implications of the current study are not only

Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {Causal loss-of-function (LOF) variants for Mendelian and severe complex
   diseases are enriched in `mutation intolerant' genes. We show how such
   observations can be interpreted in light of a model of
   mutation-selection balance and use the model to relate the pathogenic
   consequences of LOF mutations at present to their evolutionary fitness
   effects. To this end, we first infer posterior distributions for the
   fitness costs of LOF mutations in 17,318 autosomal and 679 X-linked
   genes from exome sequences in 56,855 individuals. Estimated fitness
   costs for the loss of a gene copy are typically above 1\%; they tend to
   be largest for X-linked genes, whether or not they have a Y homolog,
   followed by autosomal genes and genes in the pseudoautosomal region. We
   compare inferred fitness effects for all possible de novo LOF mutations
   to those of de novo mutations identified in individuals diagnosed with
   one of six severe, complex diseases or developmental disorders. Probands
   carry an excess of mutations with estimated fitness effects above 10\%;
   as we show by simulation, when sampled in the population, such highly
   deleterious mutations are typically only a couple of generations old.
   Moreover, the proportion of highly deleterious mutations carried by
   probands reflects the typical age of onset of the disease. The study
   design also has a discernible influence: a greater proportion of highly
   deleterious mutations is detected in pedigree than case-control studies,
   and for autism, in simplex than multiplex families and in female versus
   male probands. Thus, anchoring observations in human genetics to a
   population genetic model allows us to learn about the fitness effects of
   mutations identified by different mapping strategies and for different

Title = {Balancing selection on genomic deletion polymorphisms in humans},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {A key question in biology is why genomic variation persists in a
   population for extended periods. Recent studies have identified examples
   of genomic deletions that have remained polymorphic in the human lineage
   for hundreds of millennia, ostensibly owing to balancing selection.
   Nevertheless, genome-wide investigation of ancient and possibly adaptive
   deletions remains an imperative exercise. Here, we demonstrate an excess
   of polymorphisms in present-day humans that predate the modern
   human-Neanderthal split (ancient polymorphisms), which cannot be
   explained solely by selectively neutral scenarios. We analyze the
   adaptive mechanisms that underlie this excess in deletion polymorphisms.
   Using a previously published measure of balancing selection, we show
   that this excess of ancient deletions is largely owing to balancing
   selection. Based on the absence of signatures of overdominance, we
   conclude that it is a rare mode of balancing selection among ancient
   deletions. Instead, more complex scenarios involving spatially and
   temporally variable selective pressures are likely more common
   mechanisms. Our results suggest that balancing selection resulted in
   ancient deletions harboring disproportionately more exonic variants with
   GWAS (genome-wide association studies) associations. We further found
   that ancient deletions are significantly enriched for traits related to
   metabolism and immunity. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that
   deletions are, on average, more deleterious than single nucleotide
   variants. We can now argue that not only is a vast majority of common
   variants shared among human populations, but a considerable portion of
   biologically relevant variants has been segregating among our ancestors
   for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years.
   eLife digest The persistence of versions of genes that cause severe
   disease in human populations has long perplexed scientists. It is common
   for many versions of a gene to exist. But scientists expect that over
   time natural selection will eliminate versions of genes harmful to human
   health. Sometimes, there are good reasons that a disease-causing gene
   may persist. For example, having two copies of a particular gene variant
   causes a condition, called sickle cell disease. But having one sickle
   cell-causing copy of the gene and one non-disease-causing copy protects
   against malaria. As a result, the version of the gene that causes sickle
   cell is more common in people from areas where malaria is prevalent
   despite the risks to people who end up with two copies. Scientists call
   this phenomenon balancing selection because trade-offs in the gene's
   benefits and risks cause it to persist in the population. Aqil et al.
   show that balancing selection has likely caused many ancient gene
   variants to persist in human populations. In the experiments, Aqil et
   al. scoured the genomes of hundreds of modern humans from around the
   world and four groups of ancient human ancestors, including Neanderthals
   and Denisovans. The experiments looked for structural changes in genes,
   like deletions, that date back to more than 700,000 years ago - before
   modern humans split from their ancestors. They found large numbers of
   such ancient genes in modern humans. Using computer modeling, Aqil et
   al. showed that these ancient genes likely persist because of balancing
   selection. Many of these ancient genes regulate the immune response and
   metabolism. These genes may protect against infectious diseases
   outbreaks and starvation, which have occurred periodically throughout
   human history. But these same genes may cause immune or metabolic
   diseases in modern humans not currently facing these threats. The
   experiments show how such biological trade-offs have shaped human
   evolution and reveal that modern human populations, regardless of race
   or region of origin, share the same genetic variation that already our
   ancestors carried within them.},

Title = {The evolution and biological correlates of hand preferences in
   anthropoid primates},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The evolution of human right-handedness has been intensively debated for
   decades. Manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the
   potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness,
   but restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies have so
   far limited comparative phylogenetic studies. By combining original data
   with published literature reports, we assembled data on hand preferences
   for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species
   of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Based on
   that, we employ quantitative phylogenetic methods to test prevalent
   hypotheses on the roles of ecology, brain size, and tool use in primate
   handedness evolution. We confirm that human right-handedness represents
   an unparalleled extreme among anthropoids and found taxa displaying
   population-level handedness to be rare. Species-level direction of
   manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and
   did not strongly correlate with any of the selected biological
   predictors, nor with phylogeny. In contrast, we recovered highly
   variable patterns of hand preference strength, which show signatures of
   both ecology and phylogeny. In particular, terrestrial primates tend to
   display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results
   challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution, including the
   postural origins hypothesis. Furthermore, they point to a potential
   adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates, a
   measure of hand preference that has often been overlooked in the past.
   Finally, our data show that human lateralization patterns do not align
   with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique
   selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our
   species.},

Title = {Insight into the evolutionary assemblage of cranial kinesis from a
   Cretaceous bird},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {The independent movements and flexibility of various parts of the skull,
   called cranial kinesis, are an evolutionary innovation that is found in
   living vertebrates only in some squamates and crown birds and is
   considered to be a major factor underpinning much of the enormous
   phenotypic and ecological diversity of living birds, the most diverse
   group of extant amniotes. Compared to the postcranium, our understanding
   of the evolutionary assemblage of the characteristic modern bird skull
   has been hampered by sparse fossil records of early cranial materials,
   with competing hypotheses regarding the evolutionary development of
   cranial kinesis among early members of the avialans. Here, a detailed
   three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull of the Early Cretaceous
   enantiornithine Yuanchuavis kompsosoura allows for its in-depth
   description, including elements that are poorly known among
   early-diverging avialans but are central to deciphering the mosaic
   assembly of features required for modern avian cranial kinesis. Our
   reconstruction of the skull shows evolutionary and functional
   conservation of the temporal and palatal regions by retaining the
   ancestral theropod dinosaurian configuration within the skull of this
   otherwise derived and volant bird. Geometric morphometric analysis of
   the palatine suggests that loss of the jugal process represents the
   first step in the structural modifications of this element leading to
   the kinetic crown bird condition. The mixture of plesiomorphic temporal
   and palatal structures together with a derived avialan rostrum and
   postcranial skeleton encapsulated in Yuanchuavis manifests the key role
   of evolutionary mosaicism and experimentation in early bird
   diversification.},
