Abstract = {The end-Neoproterozoic transition marked a gradual but permanent shift
   between distinct configurations of Earth's biosphere. This interval
   witnessed the demise of the enigmatic Ediacaran Biota, ushering in the
   structured trophic webs and disparate animal body plans of Phanerozoic
   ecosystems. However, little consensus exists on the reality, drivers,
   and macroevolutionary implications of end-Neoproterozoic extinctions.
   Here we evaluate potential drivers of late-Neoproterozoic turnover by
   addressing recent findings on Ediacaran geochronology, the persistence
   of classical Ediacaran macrobionts into the Cambrian, and the existence
   of Ediacaran crown-group eumetazoans. Despite renewed interest in the
   possibility of Phanerozoic-style `mass extinctions' in the latest
   Neoproterozoic, our synthesis of the available evidence does not support
   extinction models based on episodic geochemical triggers, nor does it
   validate simple ecological interpretations centred on direct competitive
   displacement. Instead, we argue that the protracted and indirect effects
   of early bilaterian innovations, including escalations in sediment
   engineering, predation, and the largely understudied impacts of
   reef-building, may best account for the temporal structure and possible
   selectivity of late-Neoproterozoic extinctions. We integrate these
   processes into a generalised model of early eumetazoan-dominated
   ecologies, charting the disruption of spatial and temporal isotropy on
   the Ediacaran benthos as a consequence of diversifying macrofaunal
   interactions. Given the nature of resource distribution in Ediacaran
   ecologies, the continuities among Ediacaran and Cambrian faunas, and the
   convergent origins of ecologically disruptive innovations among
   bilaterians we suggest that the rise of Phanerozoic-type biotas may have
   been unstoppable.},

Title = {A general framework for modelling trade-offs in adaptive behaviour},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {99},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An animal's behaviour can influence many variables, such as its energy
   reserves, its risk of injury or mortality, and its rate of reproduction.
   To identify the optimal action in a given situation, these various
   effects can be compared in the common currency of reproductive value.
   While this idea has been widely used to study trade-offs between pairs
   of variables, e.g. between energy gain versus survival, here we present
   a unified framework that makes explicit how these various trade-offs fit
   together. This unification covers a wide range of biological phenomena,
   highlighting similarities in their logical structure and helping to
   identify knowledge gaps. To fill one such gap, we present a new model of
   foraging under the risk of predation and damage accumulation. We
   conclude by discussing the use and limitations of state-dependent
   optimisation theory in predicting biological observations.},

Title = {Carotenoid ornaments and the spandrels of physiology: a critique of
   theory to explain condition dependency},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2320-2332},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Even as numerous studies have documented that the red and yellow
   coloration resulting from the deposition of carotenoids serves as an
   honest signal of condition, the evolution of condition dependency is
   contentious. The resource trade-off hypothesis proposes that
   condition-dependent honest signalling relies on a trade-off of resources
   between ornamental display and body maintenance. By this model,
   condition dependency can evolve through selection for a re-allocation of
   resources to promote ornament expression. By contrast, the index
   hypothesis proposes that selection focuses mate choice on carotenoid
   coloration that is inherently condition dependent because production of
   such coloration is inexorably tied to vital cellular processes. These
   hypotheses for the origins of condition dependency make strongly
   contrasting and testable predictions about ornamental traits. To assess
   these two models, we review the mechanisms of production of carotenoids,
   patterns of condition dependency involving different classes of
   carotenoids, and patterns of behavioural responses to carotenoid
   coloration. We review evidence that traits can be condition dependent
   without the influence of sexual selection and that novel traits can show
   condition-dependent expression as soon as they appear in a population,
   without the possibility of sexual selection. We conclude by highlighting
   new opportunities for studying condition-dependent signalling made
   possible by genetic manipulation and expression of ornamental traits in
   synthetic biological systems.},

Title = {Space-for-time substitutions in climate change ecology and evolution},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2243-2270},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In an epoch of rapid environmental change, understanding and predicting
   how biodiversity will respond to a changing climate is an urgent
   challenge. Since we seldom have sufficient long-term biological data to
   use the past to anticipate the future, spatial climate-biotic
   relationships are often used as a proxy for predicting biotic responses
   to climate change over time. These `space-for-time substitutions' (SFTS)
   have become near ubiquitous in global change biology, but with different
   subfields largely developing methods in isolation. We review how
   climate-focussed SFTS are used in four subfields of ecology and
   evolution, each focussed on a different type of biotic variable -
   population phenotypes, population genotypes, species' distributions, and
   ecological communities. We then examine the similarities and differences
   between subfields in terms of methods, limitations and opportunities.
   While SFTS are used for a wide range of applications, two main
   approaches are applied across the four subfields: spatial in situ
   gradient methods and transplant experiments. We find that SFTS methods
   share common limitations relating to (i) the causality of identified
   spatial climate-biotic relationships and (ii) the transferability of
   these relationships, i.e. whether climate-biotic relationships observed
   over space are equivalent to those occurring over time. Moreover,
   despite widespread application of SFTS in climate change research, key
   assumptions remain largely untested. We highlight opportunities to
   enhance the robustness of SFTS by addressing key assumptions and
   limitations, with a particular emphasis on where approaches could be
   shared between the four subfields.},

Title = {eIF4E as a molecular wildcard in metazoans RNA metabolism},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2284-2306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The evolutionary origin of eukaryotes spurred the transition from
   prokaryotic-like translation to a more sophisticated, eukaryotic
   translation. During this process, successive gene duplication of a
   single, primordial eIF4E gene encoding the mRNA cap-binding protein
   eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) gave rise to a
   plethora of paralog genes across eukaryotes that underwent further
   functional diversification in RNA metabolism. The ability to take
   different roles is due to eIF4E promiscuity in binding many partner
   proteins, rendering eIF4E a highly versatile and multifunctional player
   that functions as a molecular wildcard. Thus, in metazoans, eIF4E
   paralogs are involved in various processes, including messenger RNA
   (mRNA) processing, export, translation, storage, and decay. Moreover,
   some paralogs display differential expression in tissues and
   developmental stages and show variable biochemical properties. In this
   review, we discuss recent advances shedding light on the functional
   diversification of eIF4E in metazoans. We emphasise humans and two
   phylogenetically distant species which have become paradigms for studies
   on development, namely the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the
   roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans.},

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Neurulation transforms the neuroectoderm into the neural tube. This
   transformation relies on reorganising the configurational relationships
   between the orientations of intrinsic polarities of neighbouring cells.
   These orientational intercellular relationships are established,
   maintained, and modulated by orientational cell adhesions (OCAs). Here,
   using zebrafish (Danio rerio) neurulation as a major model, we propose a
   new perspective on how OCAs contribute to the parallel, antiparallel,
   and opposing intercellular relationships that underlie the neural
   plate-keel-rod-tube transformation, a stepwise process of cell
   aggregation followed by cord hollowing. We also discuss how OCAs in
   neurulation may be regulated by various adhesion molecules, including
   cadherins, Eph/Ephrins, Claudins, Occludins, Crumbs, Na+/K+-ATPase, and
   integrins. By comparing neurulation among species, we reveal that
   antiparallel OCAs represent a conserved mechanism for the fusion of the
   neural tube. Throughout, we highlight some outstanding questions
   regarding OCAs in neurulation. Answers to these questions will help us
   understand better the mechanisms of tubulogenesis of many tissues.},

Title = {Evolution of the neuronal substrate for kin recognition in social
   Hymenoptera},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2226-2242},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In evolutionary terms, life is about reproduction. Yet, in some species,
   individuals forgo their own reproduction to support the reproductive
   efforts of others. Social insect colonies for example, can contain up to
   a million workers that actively cooperate in tasks such as foraging,
   brood care and nest defence, but do not produce offspring. In such
   societies the division of labour is pronounced, and reproduction is
   restricted to just one or a few individuals, most notably the queen(s).
   This extreme eusocial organisation exists in only a few mammals,
   crustaceans and insects, but strikingly, it evolved independently up to
   nine times in the order Hymenoptera (including ants, bees and wasps).
   Transitions from a solitary lifestyle to an organised society can occur
   through natural selection when helpers obtain a fitness benefit from
   cooperating with kin, owing to the indirect transmission of genes
   through siblings. However, this process, called kin selection, is
   vulnerable to parasitism and opportunistic behaviours from unrelated
   individuals. An ability to distinguish kin from non-kin, and to respond
   accordingly, could therefore critically facilitate the evolution of
   eusociality and the maintenance of non-reproductive workers. The
   question of how the hymenopteran brain has adapted to support this
   function is therefore a fundamental issue in evolutionary neuroethology.
   Early neuroanatomical investigations proposed that social Hymenoptera
   have expanded integrative brain areas due to selection for increased
   cognitive capabilities in the context of processing social information.
   Later studies challenged this assumption and instead pointed to an
   intimate link between higher social organisation and the existence of
   developed sensory structures involved in recognition and communication.
   In particular, chemical signalling of social identity, known to be
   mediated through cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), may have evolved hand in
   hand with a specialised chemosensory system in Hymenoptera. Here, we
   compile the current knowledge on this recognition system, from emitted
   identity signals, to the molecular and neuronal basis of chemical
   detection, with particular emphasis on its evolutionary history.
   Finally, we ask whether the evolution of social behaviour in Hymenoptera
   could have driven the expansion of their complex olfactory system, or
   whether the early origin and conservation of an olfactory subsystem
   dedicated to social recognition could explain the abundance of eusocial
   species in this insect order. Answering this question will require
   further comparative studies to provide a comprehensive view on
   lineage-specific adaptations in the olfactory pathway of Hymenoptera.},

Title = {A critical assessment of the cellular defences of the avian respiratory
   system: are birds in general and poultry in particular relatively more
   susceptible to pulmonary infections/afflictions?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},

Abstract = {In commercial poultry farming, respiratory diseases cause high
   morbidities and mortalities, begetting colossal economic losses. Without
   empirical evidence, early observations led to the supposition that birds
   in general, and poultry in particular, have weak innate and adaptive
   pulmonary defences and are therefore highly susceptible to injury by
   pathogens. Recent findings have, however, shown that birds possess
   notably efficient pulmonary defences that include: (i) a structurally
   complex three-tiered airway arrangement with aerodynamically intricate
   air-flow dynamics that provide efficient filtration of inhaled air; (ii)
   a specialised airway mucosal lining that comprises air-filtering
   (ciliated) cells and various resident phagocytic cells such as surface
   and tissue macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes; (iii) an
   exceptionally efficient mucociliary escalator system that efficiently
   removes trapped foreign agents; (iv) phagocytotic atrial and
   infundibular epithelial cells; (v) phagocytically competent surface
   macrophages that destroy pathogens and injurious particulates; (vi)
   pulmonary intravascular macrophages that protect the lung from the
   vascular side; and (vii) proficiently phagocytic pulmonary extravasated
   erythrocytes. Additionally, the avian respiratory system rapidly
   translocates phagocytic cells onto the respiratory surface, ostensibly
   from the subepithelial space and the circulatory system: the mobilised
   cells complement the surface macrophages in destroying foreign agents.
   Further studies are needed to determine whether the posited weak defence
   of the avian respiratory system is a global avian feature or is
   exclusive to poultry. This review argues that any inadequacies of
   pulmonary defences in poultry may have derived from exacting genetic
   manipulation(s) for traits such as rapid weight gain from efficient
   conversion of food into meat and eggs and the harsh environmental
   conditions and severe husbandry operations in modern poultry farming. To
   reduce pulmonary diseases and their severity, greater effort must be
   directed at establishment of optimal poultry housing conditions and use
   of more humane husbandry practices.},

Title = {Diversity of `simple' multicellular eukaryotes: 45 independent cases and
   six types of multicellularity},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2188-2209},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Multicellularity evolved multiple times in the history of life, with
   most reviewers agreeing that it appeared at least 20 times in
   eukaryotes. However, a specific list of multicellular eukaryotes with
   clear criteria for inclusion has not yet been published. Herein, an
   updated critical review of eukaryotic multicellularity is presented,
   based on current understanding of eukaryotic phylogeny and new
   discoveries in microbiology, phycology and mycology. As a result, 45
   independent multicellular lineages are identified that fall into six
   distinct types. Functional criteria, as distinct from a purely
   topological definition of a cell, are introduced to bring uniformity and
   clarity to the existing definitions of terms such as colony,
   multicellularity, thallus or plasmodium. The category of clonal
   multicellularity is expanded to include: (i) septated multinucleated
   thalli found in Pseudofungi and early-branching Fungi such as
   Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota; and (ii) multicellular
   reproductive structures formed by plasmotomy in intracellular parasites
   such as Phytomyxea. Furthermore, (iii) endogeneous budding, as found in
   Paramyxida, is described as a form of multicellularity. The best-known
   case of clonal multicellularity, i.e. (iv) non-separation of cells after
   cell division, as known from Metazoa and Ochrophyta, is also discussed.
   The category of aggregative multicellularity is expanded to include not
   only (v) pseudoplasmodial forms, such a sorocarp-forming Acrasida, but
   also (vi) meroplasmodial organisms, such as members of Variosea or
   Filoreta. A common set of topological, geometric, genetic and life-cycle
   criteria are presented that form a coherent, philosophically sound
   framework for discussing multicellularity. A possibility of a seventh
   type of multicellularity is discussed, that of multi-species
   superorganisms formed by protists with obligatory bacterial symbionts,
   such as some members of Oxymonada or Parabasalia. Its inclusion is
   dependent on the philosophical stance taken towards the concepts of
   individuality and organism in biology. Taxa that merit special attention
   are identified, such as colonial Centrohelea, and a new speculative form
   of multicellularity, possibly present in some reticulopodial amoebae, is
   briefly described. Because of insufficient phylogenetic and
   morphological data, not all lineages could be unequivocally identified,
   and the true total number of all multicellular eukaryotic lineages is
   therefore higher, likely close to a hundred.},

Title = {Floral nectar production: what cost to a plant?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2078-2090},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Floral nectar production is central to plant pollination, and hence to
   human wellbeing. As floral nectar is essentially a solution in water of
   various sugars, it is likely a valuable plant resource, especially in
   terms of energy, with plants experiencing costs/trade-offs associated
   with its production or absorption and adopting mechanisms to regulate
   nectar in flowers. Possible costs of nectar production may also
   influence the evolution of nectar volume, concentration and composition,
   of pollination syndromes involving floral nectar, and the production of
   some crops.There has been frequent agreement that costs of floral nectar
   production are significant, but relevant evidence is scant and difficult
   to interpret. Convincing direct evidence comes from experimental studies
   that relate either enhanced nectar sugar production (through repeated
   nectar removal) to reduced ability to produce seeds, or increased sugar
   availability (through absorption of additional artificial nectar) to
   increased seed production. Proportions of available photosynthate
   allocated by plants to nectar production may also indicate nectar cost.
   However, such studies are rare, some do not include treatments of all
   (or almost all) flowers per plant, and all lack quantitative
   cost-benefit comparisons for nectar production. Additional
   circumstantial evidence of nectar cost is difficult to interpret and
   largely equivocal.Future research should repeat direct experimental
   approaches that relate reduced or enhanced nectar sugar availability for
   a plant with consequent ability to produce seeds. To avoid confounding
   effects of inter-flower resource transfer, each plant should experience
   a single treatment, with treatment of all or almost all flowers per
   plant. Resource allocation by plants, pathways used for resource
   transfer, and the locations of resource sources and sinks should also be
   investigated.Future research should also consider extension of nectar
   cost into other areas of biology. For example, evolutionary models of
   nectar production are rare but should be possible if plant fitness gains
   and costs associated with nectar production are expressed in the same
   currency, such as energy. It should then be possible to understand
   observed nectar production for different plant species and pollination
   syndromes involving floral nectar. In addition, potential economic
   benefits should be possible to assess if relationships between nectar
   production and crop value are evaluated.},

Title = {Successional theories},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2049-2077},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how
   species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new
   substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of
   succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land-use
   change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet,
   despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional
   theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional
   theories ('models') and their key points, group them based on conceptual
   similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and
   provide suggestions how to move forward.Four groups of models can be
   recognised. The first group (patch \& plants) focuses on plants at the
   patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early
   20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal,
   establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during
   succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species
   responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A
   last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying
   demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models
   (ecosystems) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering
   the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem
   structure and processes. The third group (landscape) considers a larger
   spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape
   matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches
   determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the
   neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed
   sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group (socio-ecological
   systems) includes the human component by focusing on socio-ecological
   systems where management practices have long-lasting legacies on
   successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of
   ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders.The four groups of
   models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational
   level (plant species, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), increase in
   scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on
   succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that
   reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all
   views still coexist. The four successional views are: succession of
   plants (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of
   species replacement; succession of communities and ecosystems (from 1965
   onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession; succession
   in landscapes (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the
   structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional
   pathways, and increased remote-sensing technology allowed for a better
   quantification of the landscape context; and succession with people
   (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal
   drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem
   processes and services are important for human well-being, and that
   restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local
   people.Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework
   of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework
   already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling
   application to different systems.
   The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be
   improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical
   scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), and
   by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional
   models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region),
   temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and
   evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape
   (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and
   societal factors (previous and current land-use intensity) into account.
   Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination
   of empirical research, experiments, process-based modelling and novel
   tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental
   and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional
   processes matter and under what conditions.},

Abstract = {Intraguild interactions among carnivores have long held the fascination
   of ecologists. Ranging from competition to facilitation and coexistence,
   these interactions and their complex interplay influence everything from
   species persistence to ecosystem functioning. Yet, the patterns and
   pathways of such interactions are far from understood in tropical forest
   systems, particularly across countries in the Global South. Here, we
   examined the determinants and consequences of competitive interactions
   between dholes Cuon alpinus and the two large felids (leopards Panthera
   pardus and tigers Panthera tigris) with which they most commonly
   co-occur across Asia. Using a combination of traditional and novel data
   sources (N = 118), we integrate information from spatial, temporal, and
   dietary niche dimensions. These three species have faced catastrophic
   declines in their extent of co-occurrence over the past century; most of
   their source populations are now confined to Protected Areas. Analysis
   of dyadic interactions between species pairs showed a clear social
   hierarchy. Tigers were dominant over dholes, although pack strength in
   dholes helped ameliorate some of these effects; leopards were
   subordinate to dholes. Population-level spatio-temporal interactions
   assessed at 25 locations across Asia did not show a clear pattern of
   overlap or avoidance between species pairs. Diet-profile assessments
   indicated that wild ungulate biomass consumption by tigers was highest,
   while leopards consumed more primate and livestock prey as compared to
   their co-predators. In terms of prey offtake (ratio of wild prey biomass
   consumed to biomass available), the three species together harvested
   0.4-30.2\% of available prey, with the highest offtake recorded from the
   location where the carnivores reach very high densities. When
   re-examined in the context of prey availability and offtake, locations
   with low wild prey availability showed spatial avoidance and temporal
   overlap among the carnivore pairs, and locations with high wild prey
   availability showed spatial overlap and temporal segregation. Based on
   these observations, we make predictions for 40 Protected Areas in India
   where temporally synchronous estimates of predator and prey densities
   are available. We expect that low prey availability will lead to higher
   competition, and in extreme cases, to the complete exclusion of one or
   more species. In Protected Areas with high prey availability, we expect
   intraguild coexistence and conspecific competition among carnivores,
   with spill-over to forest-edge habitats and subsequent prey-switching to
   livestock. We stress that dhole-leopard-tiger co-occurrence across their
   range is facilitated through an intricate yet fragile balance between
   prey availability, and intraguild and conspecific competition. Data gaps
   and limitations notwithstanding, our study shows how insights from
   fundamental ecology can be of immense utility for applied aspects like
   large predator conservation and management of human-carnivore
   interactions. Our findings also highlight potential avenues for future
   research on tropical carnivores that can broaden current understanding
   of intraguild competition in forest systems of Asia and beyond.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation using macroalgae: a

Abstract = {The conservation, restoration, and improved management of terrestrial
   forests significantly contributes to mitigate climate change and its
   impacts, as well as providing numerous co-benefits. The pressing need to
   reduce emissions and increase carbon removal from the atmosphere is now
   also leading to the development of natural climate solutions in the
   ocean. Interest in the carbon sequestration potential of underwater
   macroalgal forests is growing rapidly among policy, conservation, and
   corporate sectors. Yet, our understanding of whether carbon
   sequestration from macroalgal forests can lead to tangible climate
   change mitigation remains severely limited, hampering their inclusion in
   international policy or carbon finance frameworks. Here, we examine the
   results of over 180 publications to synthesise evidence regarding
   macroalgal forest carbon sequestration potential. We show that research
   efforts on macroalgae carbon sequestration are heavily skewed towards
   particulate organic carbon (POC) pathways (77\% of data publications),
   and that carbon fixation is the most studied flux (55\%). Fluxes leading
   directly to carbon sequestration (e.g. carbon export or burial in marine
   sediments) remain poorly resolved, likely hindering regional or
   country-level assessments of carbon sequestration potential, which are
   only available from 17 of the 150 countries where macroalgal forests
   occur. To solve this issue, we present a framework to categorize
   coastlines according to their carbon sequestration potential. Finally,
   we review the multiple avenues through which this sequestration can
   translate into climate change mitigation capacity, which largely depends
   on whether management interventions can increase carbon removal above a
   natural baseline or avoid further carbon emissions. We find that
   conservation, restoration and afforestation interventions on macroalgal
   forests can potentially lead to carbon removal in the order of 10's of
   Tg C globally. Although this is lower than current estimates of natural
   sequestration value of all macroalgal habitats (61-268 Tg C year(-1)),
   it suggests that macroalgal forests could add to the total mitigation
   potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems, and offer valuable
   mitigation opportunities in polar and temperate areas where blue carbon
   mitigation is currently low. Operationalizing that potential will
   necessitate the development of models that reliably estimate the
   proportion of production sequestered, improvements in macroalgae carbon
   fingerprinting techniques, and a rethinking of carbon accounting
   methodologies. The ocean provides major opportunities to mitigate and
   adapt to climate change, and the largest coastal vegetated habitat on
   Earth should not be ignored simply because it does not fit into existing
   frameworks.},

Abstract = {What can the stable isotope values of human and animal faeces tell us?
   This often under-appreciated waste product is gaining recognition across
   a variety of disciplines. Faecal isotopes provide a means of monitoring
   diet, resource partitioning, landscape use, tracking nutrient inputs and
   cycling, and reconstructing past climate and environment. Here, we
   review what faeces are composed of, their temporal resolution, and how
   these factors may be impacted by digestive physiology and efficiency. As
   faeces are often used to explore diet, we clarify how isotopic offsets
   between diet and faeces can be calculated, as well as some differences
   among commonly used calculations that can lead to confusion. Generally,
   faecal carbon isotope (\& delta;C-13) values are lower than those of the
   diet, while faecal nitrogen isotope values (\& delta;N-15) values are
   higher than in the diet. However, there is considerable variability both
   within and among species. We explore the role of study design and how
   limitations stemming from a variety of factors can affect both the
   reliability and interpretability of faecal isotope data sets. Finally,
   we summarise the various ways in which faecal isotopes have been applied
   to date and provide some suggestions for future research. Despite
   remaining challenges, faecal isotope data are poised to continue to
   contribute meaningfully to a variety of fields.},

Abstract = {Novel biotic interactions in shifting communities play a key role in
   determining the ability of species' ranges to track suitable habitat. To
   date, the impact of biotic interactions on range dynamics have
   predominantly been studied in the context of interactions between
   different trophic levels or, to a lesser extent, exploitative
   competition between species of the same trophic level. Yet, both theory
   and a growing number of empirical studies show that interspecific
   behavioural interference, such as interspecific territorial and mating
   interactions, can slow down range expansions, preclude coexistence, or
   drive local extinction, even in the absence of resource competition. We
   conducted a systematic review of the current empirical research into the
   consequences of interspecific behavioural interference on range
   dynamics. Our findings demonstrate there is abundant evidence that
   behavioural interference by one species can impact the spatial
   distribution of another. Furthermore, we identify several gaps where
   more empirical work is needed to test predictions from theory robustly.
   Finally, we outline several avenues for future research, providing
   suggestions for how interspecific behavioural interference could be
   incorporated into existing scientific frameworks for understanding how
   biotic interactions influence range expansions, such as species
   distribution models, to build a stronger understanding of the potential
   consequences of behavioural interference on the outcome of future range
   dynamics.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Various biological attributes associated with individual fitness in
   animals change predictably over the lifespan of an organism. Therefore,
   the study of animal ecology and the work of conservationists frequently
   relies upon the ability to assign animals to functionally relevant age
   classes to model population fitness. Several approaches have been
   applied to determining individual age and, while these methods have
   proved useful, they are not without limitations and often lack
   standardisation or are only applicable to specific species. For these
   reasons, scientists have explored the potential use of biological clocks
   towards creating a universal age-determination method. Two biological
   clocks, tooth layer annulation and otolith layering have found universal
   appeal. Both methods are highly invasive and most appropriate for
   post-mortem age-at-death estimation. More recently, attributes of
   cellular ageing previously explored in humans have been adapted to
   studying ageing in animals for the use of less-invasive molecular
   methods for determining age. Here, we review two such methods,
   assessment of methylation and telomere length, describing (i) what they
   are, (ii) how they change with age, and providing (iii) a summary and
   meta-analysis of studies that have explored their utility in animal age
   determination. We found that both attributes have been studied across
   multiple vertebrate classes, however, telomere studies were used before
   methylation studies and telomere length has been modelled in nearly
   twice as many studies. Telomere length studies included in the review
   often related changes to stress responses and illustrated that telomere
   length is sensitive to environmental and social stressors and, in the
   absence of repair mechanisms such as telomerase or alternative
   lengthening modes, lacks the ability to recover. Methylation studies,
   however, while also detecting sensitivity to stressors and toxins,
   illustrated the ability to recover from such stresses after a period of
   accelerated ageing, likely due to constitutive expression or
   reactivation of repair enzymes such as DNA methyl transferases. We also
   found that both studied attributes have parentally heritable features,
   but the mode of inheritance differs among taxa and may relate to
   heterogamy. Our meta-analysis included more than 40 species in common
   for methylation and telomere length, although both analyses included at
   least 60 age-estimation models. We found that methylation outperforms
   telomere length in terms of predictive power evidenced from effect sizes
   (more than double that observed for telomeres) and smaller prediction
   intervals. Both methods produced age correlation models using similar
   sample sizes and were able to classify individuals into young, middle,
   or old age classes with high accuracy. Our review and meta-analysis
   illustrate that both methods are well suited to studying age in animals
   and do not suffer significantly from variation due to differences in the
   lifespan of the species, genome size, karyotype, or tissue type but
   rather that quantitative method, patterns of inheritance, and
   environmental factors should be the main considerations. Thus, provided
   that complex factors affecting the measured trait can be accounted for,
   both methylation and telomere length are promising targets to develop as
   biomarkers for age determination in animals.},

   have experienced large declines in coral cover and abundance, there has
   been great interest in understanding the factors causing coral
   recruitment to vary and the conditions under which it can support
   community resilience. While progress in these areas is being facilitated
   by technological and scientific advances, one of the best tools to
   quantify recruitment remains the humble settlement tile, variants of
   which have been in use for over a century. Here I review the biology and
   ecology of coral recruits and the recruitment process, largely as
   resolved through the use of settlement tiles, by: (i) defining how the
   terms `recruit' and `recruitment' have been used, and explaining why
   loose terminology has impeded scientific advancement; (ii) describing
   how coral recruitment is measured and why settlement tiles have value
   for this purpose; (iii) summarizing previous efforts to review
   quantitative analyses of coral recruitment; (iv) describing advances
   from hypothesis-driven studies in determining how refuges, seawater
   flow, and grazers can modulate coral recruitment; (v) reviewing the
   biology of small corals (i.e. recruits) to understand better how they
   respond to environmental conditions; and (vi) updating a quantitative
   compilation of coral recruitment studies extending from 1974 to present,
   thus revealing long-term global declines in density of recruits,
   juxtaposed with apparent resilience to coral bleaching. Finally, I
   review future directions in the study of coral recruitment, and
   highlight the need to expand studies to deliver taxonomic resolution,
   and explain why time series of settlement tile deployments are likely to
   remain pivotal in quantifying coral recruitment.},

Title = {A multifaceted framework to establish the presence of meaning in
   non-human communication},

Abstract = {Does non-human communication, like language, involve meaning? This
   question guides our focus through an interdisciplinary review of the
   theories and terminology used to study meaning across disciplines and
   species. Until now, it has been difficult to apply the concept of
   meaning to communication in non-humans. This is partly because of the
   varied approaches to the study of meaning. Additionally, while there is
   a scholarly acknowledgement of potential meaning in non-human cognition,
   there is also scepticism when the topic of communication arises. We
   organise some of the key literature into a coherent framework that can
   bridge disciplines and species, to ensure that aspects of meaning are
   accurately and fairly compared. We clarify the growing view in the
   literature that, rather than requiring multiple definitions or being
   split into different types, meaning is a multifaceted yet still unified
   concept. In so doing, we propose that meaning is an umbrella term.
   Meaning cannot be summed up with a short definition or list of features,
   but involves multiple complexities that are outlined in our framework.
   Specifically, three global facets are needed to describe meaning: a
   Signal Meaning Facet, an Interactant Meaning Facet, and a Resultant
   Meaning Facet. Most importantly, we show that such analyses are possible
   to apply as much to non-humans as to humans. We also emphasise that
   meaning nuances differ among non-human species, making a dichotomous
   approach to meaning questionable. Instead, we show that a multifaceted
   approach to meaning establishes how meaning appears within highly
   diverse examples of non-human communication, in ways consistent with the
   phenomenon's presence in human non-verbal communication and language(s).
   Therefore, without further recourse to `functional' approaches that
   circumvent the critical question of whether any non-human meaning
   exists, we show that the concept of meaning is suitable for evolutionary
   biologists, behavioural ecologists, and others to study, to establish
   exactly which species exhibit meaning in their communication and in what
   ways.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation is the major mechanism behind adaptation and
   evolutionary change. As most proteins operate through interactions with
   other proteins, changes in protein complex composition and subunit
   sequence provide potentially new functions. Comparative genomics can
   reveal expansions, losses and sequence divergence within protein-coding
   genes, but in silico analysis cannot detect subunit substitutions or
   replacements of entire protein complexes. Insights into these
   fundamental evolutionary processes require broad and extensive
   comparative analyses, from both in silico and experimental evidence.
   Here, we combine data from both approaches and consider the gamut of
   possible protein complex compositional changes that arise during
   evolution, citing examples of complete conservation to partial and total
   replacement by functional analogues. We focus in part on complexes in
   trypanosomes as they represent one of the better studied
   non-animal/non-fungal lineages, but extend insights across the
   eukaryotes by extensive comparative genomic analysis. We argue that gene
   loss plays an important role in diversification of protein complexes and
   hence enhancement of eukaryotic diversity.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection is considered one of the key processes that contribute
   to the emergence of new species. While the connection between sexual
   selection and speciation has been supported by comparative studies, the
   mechanisms that mediate this connection remain unresolved, especially in
   plants. Similarly, it is not clear how speciation processes within plant
   populations translate into large-scale speciation dynamics. Here, we
   review the mechanisms through which sexual selection, pollination, and
   mate choice unfold and interact, and how they may ultimately produce
   reproductive isolation in plants. We also overview reproductive
   strategies that might influence sexual selection in plants and
   illustrate how functional traits might connect speciation at the
   population level (population differentiation, evolution of reproductive
   barriers; i.e. microevolution) with evolution above the species level
   (macroevolution). We also identify outstanding questions in the field,
   and suitable data and tools for their resolution. Altogether, this
   effort motivates further research focused on plants, which might
   potentially broaden our general understanding of speciation by sexual
   selection, a major concept in evolutionary biology.},

Abstract = {Cooperative breeding (i.e. when alloparents care for the offspring of
   other group members) has been studied for nearly a century. Yet,
   inconsistent definitions of this breeding system still hamper
   comparative research. Here, we identify two major inconsistencies,
   discuss their consequences and propose a way forward. First, some
   researchers restrict the term `cooperative breeding' to species with
   non-breeding alloparents. We show that such restrictive definitions lack
   distinct quantitative criteria to define non-breeding alloparents. This
   ambiguity, we argue, reflects the reproductive-sharing continuum among
   cooperatively breeding species. We therefore suggest that cooperative
   breeding should not be restricted to the few species with extreme
   reproductive skew and should be defined independent of the reproductive
   status of alloparents. Second, definitions rarely specify the type,
   extent and prevalence of alloparental care required to classify species
   as cooperative breeders. We thus analysed published data to propose
   qualitative and quantitative criteria for alloparental care. We conclude
   by proposing the following operational definition: cooperative breeding
   is a reproductive system where >5\% of broods/litters in at least one
   population receive species-typical parental care and conspecifics
   provide proactive alloparental care that fulfils >5\% of at least one
   type of the offspring's needs. This operational definition is designed
   to increase comparability across species and disciplines while allowing
   to study the intriguing phenomenon of cooperative breeding as a
   behaviour with multiple dimensions.},

Title = {Water column contributions to coral reef productivity: overcoming

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are declining at an unprecedented rate. Effective management
   and conservation initiatives necessitate improved understanding of the
   drivers of production because the high rates found in these ecosystems
   are the foundation of the many services they provide. The water column
   is the nexus of coral reef ecosystem dynamics, and functions as the
   interface through which essentially all energy and nutrients are
   transferred to fuel both new and recycled production. Substantial
   research has described many aspects of water column dynamics, often
   focusing on specific components because water column dynamics are highly
   spatially and temporally context dependent. Although necessary, a cost
   of this approach is that these dynamics are often not well linked to the
   broader ecosystem or across systems. To help overcome the challenge of
   context dependence, we provide a comprehensive review of this
   literature, and synthesise it through the perspective of ecosystem
   ecology. Specifically, we provide a framework to organise the drivers of
   temporal and spatial variation in production dynamics, structured around
   five primary state factors. These state factors are used to deconstruct
   the environmental contexts in which three water column sub-food webs
   mediate `new' and `recycled' production. We then highlight critical
   pathways by which global change drivers are altering coral reefs via the
   water column. We end by discussing four key knowledge gaps hindering
   understanding of the role of the water column for mediating coral reef
   production, and how overcoming these could improve conservation and
   management strategies. Throughout, we identify areas of extensive
   research and those where studies remain lacking and provide a database
   of 84 published studies. Improved integration of water column dynamics
   into models of coral reef ecosystem function is imperative to achieve
   the understanding of ecosystem production necessary to develop effective

Abstract = {In many disturbed terrestrial landscapes, a subset of native generalist
   vertebrates thrives. The population trends of these disturbance-tolerant
   species may be driven by multiple factors, including habitat
   preferences, foraging opportunities (including crop raiding or human
   refuse), lower mortality when their predators are persecuted (the `human
   shield' effect) and reduced competition due to declines of
   disturbance-sensitive species. A pronounced elevation in the abundance
   of disturbance-tolerant wildlife can drive numerous cascading impacts on
   food webs, biodiversity, vegetation structure and people in coupled
   human-natural systems. There is also concern for increased risk of
   zoonotic disease transfer to humans and domestic animals from wildlife
   species with high pathogen loads as their abundance and proximity to
   humans increases. Here we use field data from 58 landscapes to document
   a supra-regional phenomenon of the hyperabundance and community
   dominance of Southeast Asian wild pigs and macaques. These two groups
   were chosen as prime candidates capable of reaching hyperabundance as
   they are edge adapted, with gregarious social structure, omnivorous
   diets, rapid reproduction and high tolerance to human proximity.
   Compared to intact interior forests, population densities in degraded
   forests were 148\% and 87\% higher for wild boar and macaques,
   respectively. In landscapes with >60\% oil palm coverage, wild boar and
   pig-tailed macaque estimated abundances were 337\% and 447\% higher than
   landscapes with <1\% oil palm coverage, respectively, suggesting marked
   demographic benefits accrued by crop raiding on calorie-rich food
   subsidies. There was extreme community dominance in forest landscapes
   with >20\% oil palm cover where two pig and two macaque species
   accounted for >80\% of independent camera trap detections, leaving 1 kg
   considered. Establishing the population trends of pigs and macaques is
   imperative since they are linked to cascading impacts on the fauna and
   flora of local forest ecosystems, disease and human health, and
   economics (i.e., crop losses). The severity of potential negative
   cascading effects may motivate control efforts to achieve ecosystem
   integrity, human health and conservation objectives. Our review
   concludes that the rise of native generalists can be mediated by
   specific types of degradation, which influences the ecology and
   conservation of natural areas, creating both positive and detrimental
   impacts on intact ecosystems and human society.},

Title = {Towards a mechanistic understanding of the impacts of nitrogen

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition has increased substantially since the second
   half of the 20th century due to human activities. This increase of
   reactive N into the biosphere has major implications for ecosystem
   functioning, including primary production, soil and water chemistry and
   producer community structure and diversity. Increased N deposition is
   also linked to the decline of insects observed over recent decades.
   However, we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of the effects of
   high N deposition on individual fitness, species richness and community
   structure of both invertebrate and vertebrate consumers. Here, we review
   the effects of N deposition on producer-consumer interactions, focusing
   on five existing ecological frameworks: C:N:P ecological stoichiometry,
   trace element ecological stoichiometry, nutritional geometry, essential
   micronutrients and allelochemicals. We link reported N
   deposition-mediated changes in producer quality to life-history
   strategies and traits of consumers, to gain a mechanistic understanding
   of the direction of response in consumers. We conclude that high N
   deposition influences producer quality via eutrophication and
   acidification pathways. This makes oligotrophic poorly buffered
   ecosystems most vulnerable to significant changes in producer quality.
   Changes in producer quality between the reviewed frameworks are often
   interlinked, complicating predictions of the effects of high N
   deposition on producer quality. The degree and direction of fitness
   responses of consumers to changes in producer quality varies among
   species but can be explained by differences in life-history traits and
   strategies, particularly those affecting species nutrient intake
   regulation, mobility, relative growth rate, host-plant specialisation,
   ontogeny and physiology. To increase our understanding of the effects of
   N deposition on these complex mechanisms, the inclusion of life-history
   traits of consumer species in future study designs is pivotal. Based on
   the reviewed literature, we formulate five hypotheses on the mechanisms
   underlying the effects of high N deposition on consumers, by linking
   effects of nutritional ecological frameworks to life-history strategies.
   Importantly, we expect that N-deposition-mediated changes in producer
   quality will result in a net decrease in consumer community as well as
   functional diversity. Moreover, we anticipate an increased risk of
   outbreak events of a small subset of generalist species, with
   concomitant declines in a multitude of specialist species. Overall,
   linking ecological frameworks with consumer life-history strategies
   provides a mechanistic understanding of the impacts of high N deposition
   on producer-consumer interactions, which can inform management towards
   more effective mitigation strategies.},

Title = {On the paradox of thriving cold-water coral reefs in the food-limited
   deep sea},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1768-1795},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The deep sea is amongst the most food-limited habitats on Earth, as only
   a small fraction (<4\%) of the surface primary production is exported
   below 200 m water depth. Here, cold-water coral (CWC) reefs form oases
   of life: their biodiversity compares with tropical coral reefs, their
   biomass and metabolic activity exceed other deep-sea ecosystems by far.
   We critically assess the paradox of thriving CWC reefs in the
   food-limited deep sea, by reviewing the literature and open-access data
   on CWC habitats. This review shows firstly that CWCs typically occur in
   areas where the food supply is not constantly low, but undergoes
   pronounced temporal variation. High currents, downwelling and/or
   vertically migrating zooplankton temporally boost the export of surface
   organic matter to the seabed, creating `feast' conditions, interspersed
   with `famine' periods during the non-productive season. Secondly, CWCs,
   particularly the most common reef-builder Desmophyllum pertusum
   (formerly known as Lophelia pertusa), are well adapted to these
   fluctuations in food availability. Laboratory and in situ measurements
   revealed their dietary flexibility, tissue reserves, and temporal
   variation in growth and energy allocation. Thirdly, the high structural
   and functional diversity of CWC reefs increases resource retention:
   acting as giant filters and sustaining complex food webs with diverse
   recycling pathways, the reefs optimise resource gains over losses.
   Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change and ocean
   acidification, threaten this fragile equilibrium through decreased
   resource supply, increased energy costs, and dissolution of the
   calcium-carbonate reef framework. Based on this review, we suggest
   additional criteria to judge the health of CWC reefs and their chance to
   persist in the future.},
