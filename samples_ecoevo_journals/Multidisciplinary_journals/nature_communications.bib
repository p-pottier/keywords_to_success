Abstract = {The genomic underpinnings of cave-related phenotypes are underexplored.
   Here, the authors investigate adaptation to underground life in cave
   beetle lineages using transcriptomic and genomic data, finding both
   parallel and convergent changes in six independent episodes of
   subterranean colonization.
   Adaptation to life in caves is often accompanied by dramatically
   convergent changes across distantly related taxa, epitomized by the loss
   or reduction of eyes and pigmentation. Nevertheless, the genomic
   underpinnings underlying cave-related phenotypes are largely unexplored
   from a macroevolutionary perspective. Here we investigate genome-wide
   gene evolutionary dynamics in three distantly related beetle tribes with
   at least six instances of independent colonization of subterranean
   habitats, inhabiting both aquatic and terrestrial underground systems.
   Our results indicate that remarkable gene repertoire changes mainly
   driven by gene family expansions occurred prior to underground
   colonization in the three tribes, suggesting that genomic exaptation may
   have facilitated a strict subterranean lifestyle parallelly across
   beetle lineages. The three tribes experienced both parallel and
   convergent changes in the evolutionary dynamics of their gene
   repertoires. These findings pave the way towards a deeper understanding
   of the evolution of the genomic toolkit in hypogean fauna.},

Title = {Sexual selection for both diversity and repetition in birdsong},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Birdsong is simultaneously repetitive and highly diverse. Sierro et al.
   resolve this apparent paradox through experiments in blue tits showing
   that consistent repetition is a fitness indicator, while song diversity
   reduces habituation during singing displays.
   From fiddler crabs to humans, animals perform repetitive displays
   showing neuromotor skill and vigour. Consistent repetition of identical
   notes (vocal consistency) facilitates the assessment of neuromotor
   skills and is important in communication in birds. Most birdsong
   research has focused on song diversity as a signal of individual
   quality, which seems contradictory as repetition is extremely common in
   most species. Here we show that consistent repetition within songs is
   positively correlated with reproductive success in male blue tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus). A playback experiment shows that females are
   sexually aroused by male songs with high levels of vocal consistency,
   which also peaks seasonally during the fertile period of the female,
   supporting the role of vocal consistency in mate choice. Male vocal
   consistency also increases with subsequent repetitions of the same song
   type (a warm-up effect) which conflicts with the fact that females
   habituate to repeated song, showing decreased arousal. Importantly, we
   find that switching song types elicits significant dishabituation within
   the playback, supporting the habituation hypothesis as an evolutionary
   mechanism driving song diversity in birds. An optimal balance between
   repetition and diversity may explain the singing style of many bird
   species and displays of other animals.},

Title = {Dynamic pathogen detection and social feedback shape collective hygiene
   in ants},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Cooperative disease defense emerges as group-level collective behavior,
   yet how group members make the underlying individual decisions is poorly
   understood. Using garden ants and fungal pathogens as an experimental
   model, we derive the rules governing individual ant grooming choices and
   show how they produce colony-level hygiene. Time-resolved behavioral
   analysis, pathogen quantification, and probabilistic modeling reveal
   that ants increase grooming and preferentially target highly-infectious
   individuals when perceiving high pathogen load, but transiently suppress
   grooming after having been groomed by nestmates. Ants thus react to
   both, the infectivity of others and the social feedback they receive on
   their own contagiousness. While inferred solely from momentary ant
   decisions, these behavioral rules quantitatively predict hour-long
   experimental dynamics, and synergistically combine into efficient
   colony-wide pathogen removal. Our analyses show that noisy individual
   decisions based on only local, incomplete, yet dynamically-updated
   information on pathogen threat and social feedback can lead to potent
   collective disease defense.
   Cooperative disease defense is part of group-level collective behavior.
   Here, the authors explore individual decisions, finding that garden ants
   increase grooming highly infectious individuals when they perceive a
   high pathogen load and suppress grooming after having been groomed by
   nestmates.},

Abstract = {Diverse microbial trajectories in carbon and nitrogen cycle processes
   represent a positive feedback loop of deglaciation on climate warming.
   Due to climate warming, ice sheets around the world are losing mass,
   contributing to changes across terrestrial landscapes on decadal time
   spans. However, landscape repercussions on climate are poorly
   constrained mostly due to limited knowledge on microbial responses to
   deglaciation. Here, we reveal the genomic succession from
   chemolithotrophy to photo- and heterotrophy and increases in methane
   supersaturation in freshwater lakes upon glacial retreat. Arctic lakes
   at Svalbard also revealed strong microbial signatures form nutrient
   fertilization by birds. Although methanotrophs were present and
   increased along lake chronosequences, methane consumption rates were low
   even in supersaturated systems. Nitrous oxide oversaturation and genomic
   information suggest active nitrogen cycling across the entire
   deglaciated landscape, and in the high Arctic, increasing bird
   populations serve as major modulators at many sites. Our findings show
   diverse microbial succession patterns, and trajectories in carbon and

Title = {Distinct genomic routes underlie transitions to specialised symbiotic
   lifestyles in deep-sea annelid worms},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Annelid worms have colonised extreme ecological niches, such as
   hydrothermal vents and whale falls thanks to symbiotic bacteria. This
   study finds that Osedax worms and the related Vestimentifera have
   evolved different genomic adaptations to sustain their bacterial
   symbioses and exploit different resources, such as decaying bone.
   Bacterial symbioses allow annelids to colonise extreme ecological
   niches, such as hydrothermal vents and whale falls. Yet, the genetic
   principles sustaining these symbioses remain unclear. Here, we show that
   different genomic adaptations underpin the symbioses of phylogenetically
   related annelids with distinct nutritional strategies. Genome compaction
   and extensive gene losses distinguish the heterotrophic symbiosis of the
   bone-eating worm Osedax frankpressi from the chemoautotrophic symbiosis
   of deep-sea Vestimentifera. Osedax's endosymbionts complement many of
   the host's metabolic deficiencies, including the loss of pathways to
   recycle nitrogen and synthesise some amino acids. Osedax's endosymbionts
   possess the glyoxylate cycle, which could allow more efficient
   catabolism of bone-derived nutrients and the production of carbohydrates
   from fatty acids. Unlike in most Vestimentifera, innate immunity genes
   are reduced in O. frankpressi, which, however, has an expansion of
   matrix metalloproteases to digest collagen. Our study supports that
   distinct nutritional interactions influence host genome evolution
   differently in highly specialised symbioses.},

Abstract = {The high level of morphological diversity in Australasian marsupials
   compared to those from the Americas remains poorly understood. This
   study shows that variation in ontogenetic allometry among Australasian
   and American marsupials is similar, despite this great difference in
   ecomorphological diversity.
   The relatively high level of morphological diversity in Australasian
   marsupials compared to that observed among American marsupials remains
   poorly understood. We undertake a comprehensive macroevolutionary
   analysis of ontogenetic allometry of American and Australasian
   marsupials to examine whether the contrasting levels of morphological
   diversity in these groups are reflected in their patterns of allometric
   evolution. We collate ontogenetic series for 62 species and 18 families
   of marsupials (n = 2091 specimens), spanning across extant marsupial
   diversity. Our results demonstrate significant lability of ontogenetic
   allometric trajectories among American and Australasian marsupials, yet
   a phylogenetically structured pattern of allometric evolution is
   preserved. Here we show that species diverging more than 65 million
   years ago converge in their patterns of ontogenetic allometry under
   animalivorous and herbivorous diets, and that Australasian marsupials do
   not show significantly greater variation in patterns of ontogenetic
   allometry than their American counterparts, despite displaying greater
   magnitudes of extant ecomorphological diversity.},

Title = {Call combinations and compositional processing in wild chimpanzees},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Through syntax, i.e., the combination of words into larger phrases,
   language can express a limitless number of messages. Data in great apes,
   our closest-living relatives, are central to the reconstruction of
   syntax's phylogenetic origins, yet are currently lacking. Here, we
   provide evidence for syntactic-like structuring in chimpanzee
   communication. Chimpanzees produce ``alarm-huus{''} when surprised and
   ``waa-barks{''} when potentially recruiting conspecifics during
   aggression or hunting. Anecdotal data suggested chimpanzees combine
   these calls specifically when encountering snakes. Using snake
   presentations, we confirm call combinations are produced when
   individuals encounter snakes and find that more individuals join the
   caller after hearing the combination. To test the meaning-bearing nature
   of the call combination, we use playbacks of artificially-constructed
   call combinations and both independent calls. Chimpanzees react most
   strongly to call combinations, showing longer looking responses,
   compared with both independent calls. We propose the ``alarm-huu +
   waa-bark{''} represents a compositional syntactic-like structure, where
   the meaning of the call combination is derived from the meaning of its
   parts. Our work suggests that compositional structures may not have
   evolved de novo in the human lineage, but that the cognitive
   building-blocks facilitating syntax may have been present in our last
   common ancestor with chimpanzees.
   Syntax is a key feature distinguishing human language from other animal
   communication systems. Here, Leroux et al. show that chimpanzees produce
   a compositional syntactic-like structure, suggesting syntax might be
   evolutionary ancient and potentially already present in our last common
   ancestor with chimpanzees.},

Title = {Incorporating human dimensions is associated with better wildlife
   translocation outcomes},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Conservation biologists have made calls for including human dimensions
   in wildlife conservation efforts. This quantitative synthesis of case
   studies from a global IUCN reintroduction program suggests that
   inclusion of local stakeholders in wildlife restoration programs boosts
   success rate.
   Wildlife translocations are increasingly used to combat declining
   biodiversity worldwide. Successful translocation often hinges on
   coexistence between humans and wildlife, yet not all translocation
   efforts explicitly include human dimensions (e.g., economic incentives,
   education programs, and conflict reduction assistance). To evaluate the
   prevalence and associated outcomes of including human dimensions as
   objectives when planning translocations, we analyze 305 case studies
   from the IUCN's Global Re-Introduction Perspectives Series. We find that
   fewer than half of all projects included human dimension objectives
   (42\%), but that projects including human dimension objectives were
   associated with improved wildlife population outcomes (i.e., higher
   probability of survival, reproduction, or population growth).
   Translocation efforts were more likely to include human dimension
   objectives if they involved mammals, species with a history of local
   human conflict, and local stakeholders. Our findings underscore the
   importance of incorporating objectives related to human dimensions in
   translocation planning efforts to improve conservation success.},

Title = {The value of ecosystem services in global marine kelp forests},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {While marine kelp forests have provided valuable ecosystem services for
   millennia, the global ecological and economic value of those services is
   largely unresolved. Kelp forests are diminishing in many regions
   worldwide, and efforts to manage these ecosystems are hindered without
   accurate estimates of the value of the services that kelp forests
   provide to human societies. Here, we present a global estimate of the
   ecological and economic potential of three key ecosystem services -
   fisheries production, nutrient cycling, and carbon removal provided by
   six major forest forming kelp genera (Ecklonia, Laminaria, Lessonia,
   Macrocystis, Nereocystis, and Saccharina). Each of these genera creates
   a potential value of between \$64,400 and \$147,100/hectare each year.
   Collectively, they generate between \$465 and \$562 billion/year
   worldwide, with an average of \$500 billion. These values are primarily
   driven by fisheries production (mean \$29,900, 904 Kg/Ha/year) and
   nitrogen removal (\$73,800, 657 Kg N/Ha/year), though kelp forests are
   also estimated to sequester 4.91 megatons of carbon from the
   atmosphere/year highlighting their potential as blue carbon systems for
   climate change mitigation. These findings highlight the ecological and
   economic value of kelp forests to society and will facilitate better
   informed marine management and conservation decisions.
   By combining fisheries, nutrient, and carbon cycling data, this
   synthesis suggests that marine kelp forests, a dominant but often
   undescribed habitat, provide services with a potential value of
   \$111,000/ha/year and a global yearly value of \$500 billion.},

Abstract = {Dudek et al. describe rectangular bacterial structures in the mouths of
   dolphins. Using various genomic and microscopy techniques, they show
   that the structures consist of bacterial cells that appear to divide
   along the longitudinal axis and display other unusual features.
   Much remains to be explored regarding the diversity of uncultured,
   host-associated microbes. Here, we describe rectangular bacterial
   structures (RBSs) in the mouths of bottlenose dolphins. DNA staining
   revealed multiple paired bands within RBSs, suggesting the presence of
   cells dividing along the longitudinal axis. Cryogenic transmission
   electron microscopy and tomography showed parallel membrane-bound
   segments that are likely cells, encapsulated by an S-layer-like periodic
   surface covering. RBSs displayed unusual pilus-like appendages with
   bundles of threads splayed at the tips. We present multiple lines of
   evidence, including genomic DNA sequencing of micromanipulated RBSs, 16S
   rRNA gene sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, suggesting
   that RBSs are bacterial and distinct from the genera Simonsiella and
   Conchiformibius (family Neisseriaceae), with which they share similar
   morphology and division patterning. Our findings highlight the diversity
   of novel microbial forms and lifestyles that await characterization
   using tools complementary to genomics such as microscopy.},

Title = {The pace of shifting seasons in lakes},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Lake ecosystems are vulnerable to seasonal thermal cues, with subtle
   alterations in the timing of seasonal temperatures having a dramatic
   influence on aquatic species. Here, a measure of seasonal change in
   temperature is used to describe the pace of shifting seasons in lakes.
   Since 1980 spring and summer temperatures in Northern Hemisphere lakes
   have arrived earlier (2.0- and 4.3-days decade(-1), respectively),
   whilst the arrival of autumn has been delayed (1.5-days decade(-1)) and
   the summer season lengthened (5.6-days decade(-1)). This century, under
   a high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, current spring and summer
   temperatures will arrive even earlier (3.3- and 8.3-days decade(-1),
   respectively), autumn temperatures will arrive later (3.1-days
   decade(-1)), and the summer season will lengthen further (12.1-days
   decade(-1)). These seasonal alterations will be much slower under a
   low-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario. Changes in seasonal temperatures
   will benefit some species, by prolonging the growing season, but
   negatively impact others, by leading to phenological mismatches in
   critical activities.
   Water temperature influences lake ecosystems, but little is known about
   changes in its seasonality. This study shows that the timing of spring
   temperatures will arrive earlier whilst autumn temperatures will be
   delayed globally under climate change.},

Title = {Migrating mule deer compensate en route for phenological mismatches},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Billions of animals migrate to track seasonal pulses in resources.
   Optimally timing migration is a key strategy, yet the ability of animals
   to compensate for phenological mismatches en route is largely unknown.
   Using GPS movement data collected from 72 adult female deer over a
   10-year duration, we study a population of mule deer (Odocoileus
   hemionus) in Wyoming that lack reliable cues on their desert winter
   range, causing them to start migration 70 days ahead to 52 days behind
   the wave of spring green-up. We show that individual deer arrive at
   their summer range within an average 6-day window by adjusting movement
   speed and stopover use. Late migrants move 2.5 times faster and spend
   72\% less time on stopovers than early migrants, which allows them to
   catch the green wave. Our findings suggest that ungulates, and
   potentially other migratory species, possess cognitive abilities to
   recognize where they are in space and time relative to key resources.
   Such behavioral capacity may allow migratory taxa to maintain foraging
   benefits amid rapidly changing phenology.
   This study examined the movements of mule deer in western Wyoming, which
   began their spring migration considerably mismatched from the wave of
   green-up that propagates from low-elevation winter ranges to
   high-elevation summer ranges. They show that individual deer compensated
   for phenological mismatches with the green wave en route by accelerating
   or decelerating their movement.},

Title = {Year-round utilization of sea ice-associated carbon in Arctic ecosystems},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Koch and Brown et al. led a collaborative and comprehensive synthesis
   that shows the transfer of ice algal carbon is widespread throughout the
   Arctic marine food web and contributes to supporting organisms
   throughout the dark winter months
   Sea ice primary production is considered a valuable energy source for
   Arctic marine food webs, yet the extent remains unclear through existing
   methods. Here we quantify ice algal carbon signatures using unique lipid
   biomarkers in over 2300 samples from 155 species including
   invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals collected across the
   Arctic shelves. Ice algal carbon signatures were present within 96\% of
   the organisms investigated, collected year-round from January to
   December, suggesting continuous utilization of this resource despite its
   lower proportion to pelagic production. These results emphasize the
   importance of benthic retention of ice algal carbon that is available to
   consumers year-round. Finally, we suggest that shifts in the phenology,
   distribution and biomass of sea ice primary production anticipated with
   declining seasonal sea ice will disrupt sympagic-pelagic-benthic
   coupling and consequently the structure and the functioning of the food
   web which is critical for Indigenous Peoples, commercial fisheries, and
   global biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Based on geochemical and paleontological data, this study shows that
   habitable open-oceans extended to mid-latitude coastal oceans during the
   waning stage of the Marinoan snowball Earth, offering refugia for
   benthic photosynthetic eukaryotes
   During the Marinoan Ice Age (ca. 654-635 Ma), one of the `Snowball
   Earth' events in the Cryogenian Period, continental icesheets reached
   the tropical oceans. Oceanic refugia must have existed for aerobic
   marine eukaryotes to survive this event, as evidenced by benthic
   phototrophic macroalgae of the Songluo Biota preserved in black shales
   interbedded with glacial diamictites of the late Cryogenian Nantuo
   Formation in South China. However, the environmental conditions that
   allowed these organisms to thrive are poorly known. Here, we report
   carbon-nitrogen-iron geochemical data from the fossiliferous black
   shales and adjacent diamictites of the Nantuo Formation. Iron-speciation
   data document dysoxic-anoxic conditions in bottom waters, whereas
   nitrogen isotopes record aerobic nitrogen cycling perhaps in surface
   waters. These findings indicate that habitable open-ocean conditions
   were more extensive than previously thought, extending into mid-latitude
   coastal oceans and providing refugia for eukaryotic organisms during the
   waning stage of the Marinoan Ice Age.},

Title = {Anthropogenic impacts on threatened species erode functional diversity

Abstract = {Many species of reptiles are threatened with extinction. This analysis
   on 259 species of turtles, tortoises and crocodilians identifies
   anthropogenic threats that disproportionally affect species with certain
   life history strategies and others that affect all species similarly.
   The Anthropocene is tightly associated with a drastic loss of species
   worldwide and the disappearance of their key ecosystem functions. The
   orders Testudines (turtles and tortoises) and Crocodilia (crocodiles,
   alligators, and gharials) contain numerous threatened, long-lived
   species for which the functional diversity and potential erosion by
   anthropogenic impacts remains unknown. Here, we examine 259 (69\%) of
   the existing 375 species of Testudines and Crocodilia, quantifying their
   life history strategies (i.e., trade-offs in survival, development, and
   reproduction) from open-access data on demography, ancestry, and
   threats. We find that the loss of functional diversity in simulated
   extinction scenarios of threatened species is greater than expected by
   chance. Moreover, the effects of unsustainable local consumption,
   diseases, and pollution are associated with life history strategies. In
   contrast, climate change, habitat disturbance, and global trade affect
   species independent of their life history strategy. Importantly, the
   loss of functional diversity for threatened species by habitat
   degradation is twice that for all other threats. Our findings highlight
   the importance of conservation programmes focused on preserving the
   functional diversity of life history strategies jointly with the
   phylogenetic representativity of these highly threatened groups.},

Title = {Aggregation pheromones have a non-linear effect on oviposition behavior
   in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) oviposit at communal sites
   where the larvae may cooperate or compete for resources depending on
   group size. This offers a model system to determine how females assess
   quantitative social information. We show that the concentration of
   pheromones found on a substrate increases linearly with the number of
   adult flies that have visited that site. Females prefer oviposition
   sites with pheromone concentrations corresponding to an intermediate
   number of previous visitors, whereas sites with low or high
   concentrations are unattractive. This dose-dependent decision is based
   on a blend of 11-cis-Vaccenyl Acetate (cVA) indicating the number of
   previous visitors and heptanal (a novel pheromone deriving from the
   oxidation of 7-Tricosene), which acts as a dose-independent co-factor.
   This response is mediated by detection of cVA by odorant receptor
   neurons Or67d and Or65a, and at least five different odorant receptor
   neurons for heptanal. Our results identify a mechanism allowing
   individuals to transform a linear increase of pheromones into a
   non-linear behavioral response.
   Drosophila larvae may benefit each other at lower densities but compete
   at higher densities. Here, Verschut et al. identify a mechanism enabling
   Drosophila females to favor egg-laying sites containing medium
   concentrations of aggregation pheromones, which may facilitate choice of
   favorable sites.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Compiled data on litterfall and litter in eucalypt forests and woodlands
   for the Australian continent shows that litter mass can be robustly
   predicted using just three independent variables - time, aridity and
   litterfall quality
   Litter decomposition / accumulation are rate limiting steps in soil
   formation, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and fire risk in
   temperate forests, highlighting the importance of robust predictive
   models at all geographic scales. Using a data set for the Australian
   continent, we show that among a range of models, >60\% of the variance
   in litter mass over a 40-year time span can be accounted for by a
   parsimonious model with elapsed time, and indices of aridity and litter
   quality, as independent drivers. Aridity is an important driver of
   variation across large geographic and climatic ranges while litter
   quality shows emergent properties of climate-dependence. Up to 90\% of
   variance in litter mass for individual forest types can be explained
   using models of identical structure. Results provide guidance for future
   decomposition studies. Algorithms reported here can significantly
   improve accuracy and reliability of predictions of carbon and nutrient
   dynamics and fire risk.},

Title = {Regional occupancy increases for widespread species but decreases for
   narrowly distributed species in metacommunity time series},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {While human activities are known to elicit rapid turnover in species
   composition through time, the properties of the species that increase or
   decrease their spatial occupancy underlying this turnover are less
   clear. Here, we used an extensive dataset of 238 metacommunity time
   series of multiple taxa spread across the globe to evaluate whether
   species that are more widespread (large-ranged species) differed in how
   they changed their site occupancy over the 10-90 years the
   metacommunities were monitored relative to species that are more
   narrowly distributed (small-ranged species). We found that on average,
   large-ranged species tended to increase in occupancy through time,
   whereas small-ranged species tended to decrease. These relationships
   were stronger in marine than in terrestrial and freshwater realms.
   However, in terrestrial regions, the directional changes in occupancy
   were less extreme in protected areas. Our findings provide evidence for
   systematic decreases in occupancy of small-ranged species, and that
   habitat protection could mitigate these losses in the face of
   environmental change.
   Whether a species declines under the current biodiversity crisis could
   partly depend on its range size. Here, the authors use replicated
   metacommunity data to identify global patterns in the relationship
   between species' range size and changes in occupancy through time.},

Title = {Understanding opposing predictions of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> in a
   changing climate},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {This work explains how the spatial structuring of populations, focusing
   on the globally dominant phytoplankton Prochlorococcus, can lead to
   erroneous statistical predictions for changes in plankton abundance as
   the ocean warms. Conflicting predictions of dynamical and statistical
   models for this biogeochemically critical species are resolved.
   Statistically derived species distribution models (SDMs) are
   increasingly used to predict ecological changes on a warming planet. For
   Prochlorococcus, the most abundant phytoplankton, an established
   statistical prediction conflicts with dynamical models as they predict
   large, opposite, changes in abundance. We probe the SDM at various
   spatial-temporal scales, showing that light and temperature fail to
   explain both temporal fluctuations and sharp spatial transitions. Strong
   correlations between changes in temperature and population emerge only
   at very large spatial scales, as transects pass through transitions
   between regions of high and low abundance. Furthermore, a two-state
   model based on a temperature threshold matches the original SDM in the
   surface ocean. We conclude that the original SDM has little power to
   predict changes when Prochlorococcus is already abundant, which resolves
   the conflict with dynamical models. Our conclusion suggests that SDMs
   should prove efficacy across multiple spatial-temporal scales before
   being trusted in a changing ocean.},

Title = {Ozone exposure disrupts insect sexual communication},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Insect sexual communication often relies upon sex pheromones. Most
   insect pheromones, however, contain carbon-carbon double bonds and
   potentially degrade by oxidation. Here, we show that frequently reported
   increased levels of Anthropocenic ozone can oxidize all described
   male-specific pheromones of Drosophila melanogaster, resulting in
   reduced amounts of pheromones such as cis-Vaccenyl Acetate and
   (Z)-7-Tricosene. At the same time female acceptance of ozone-exposed
   males is significantly delayed. Interestingly, groups of ozone-exposed
   males also exhibit significantly increased levels of male-male courtship
   behaviour. When repeating similar experiments with nine other
   drosophilid species, we observe pheromone degradation and/or disrupted
   sex recognition in eight of them. Our data suggest that Anthropocenic
   levels of ozone can extensively oxidize double bonds in a variety of
   insect pheromones, thereby leading to deviations in sexual recognition.
   Insect pheromones can be degraded by the air pollutant ozone. Jiang et
   al. show that ozone-exposed male flies lose their pheromones and become
   less attractive to females. Additionally, ozone-exposed males exhibited
   increased male-male courtship behaviour as a result of reduced sex
   recognition.},

Title = {Wind-driven upwelling of iron sustains dense blooms and food webs in the
   eastern Weddell Gyre},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {The Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2 and an important
   foraging area for top trophic level consumers. However, iron limitation
   sets an upper limit to primary productivity. Here we report on a
   considerably dense late summer phytoplankton bloom spanning 9000 km(2)
   in the open ocean of the eastern Weddell Gyre. Over its 2.5 months
   duration, the bloom accumulated up to 20 g C m(-2) of organic matter,
   which is unusually high for Southern Ocean open waters. We show that,
   over 1997-2019, this open ocean bloom was likely driven by anomalies in
   easterly winds that push sea ice southwards and favor the upwelling of
   Warm Deep Water enriched in hydrothermal iron and, possibly, other iron
   sources. This recurring open ocean bloom likely facilitates enhanced
   carbon export and sustains high standing stocks of Antarctic krill,
   supporting feeding hot spots for marine birds and baleen whales.
   This study reports a dense, late summer phytoplankton bloom in the
   Southern Ocean that accumulated unusually high levels of organic matter
   and supported feeding hot spots for birds and whales. The authors show
   that this recurring open ocean bloom is driven by anomalies in easterly
   winds that push sea ice southwards and favour the upwelling of deep
   waters enriched in hydrothermal iron.},

Title = {Evolutionary ecology of microbial populations inhabiting deep sea

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Deep sea cold seep sediments host abundant and diverse microbial
   populations that significantly influence biogeochemical cycles. While
   numerous studies have revealed their community structure and functional
   capabilities, little is known about genetic heterogeneity within
   species. Here, we examine intraspecies diversity patterns of 39 abundant
   species identified in sediment layers down to 430 cm below the sea floor
   across six cold seep sites. These populations are grouped as aerobic
   methane-oxidizing bacteria, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria. Different evolutionary trajectories are
   observed at the genomic level among these physiologically and
   phylogenetically diverse populations, with generally low rates of
   homologous recombination and strong purifying selection. Functional
   genes related to methane (pmoA and mcrA) and sulfate (dsrA) metabolisms
   are under strong purifying selection in most species investigated. These
   genes differ in evolutionary trajectories across phylogenetic clades but
   are functionally conserved across sites. Intrapopulation diversification
   of genomes and their mcrA and dsrA genes is depth-dependent and subject
   to different selection pressure throughout the sediment column redox
   zones at different sites. These results highlight the interplay between
   ecological processes and the evolution of key bacteria and archaea in
   deep sea cold seep extreme environments, shedding light on microbial
   adaptation in the subseafloor biosphere.
   Little is known about genetic heterogeneity within deep sea cold seep
   microbial populations. From examining 39 abundant microbial species
   identified in sediment layers below the sea floor and across six cold

Abstract = {The evolution and systematics of Madagascar's extinct elephant birds
   remains unclear. Here, the authors recover genetic, stable isotope,
   morphological, and geographic data from fossil eggshell to describe
   variation among clades, identifying cryptic diversity and potential
   drivers of speciation.
   The systematics of Madagascar's extinct elephant birds remains
   controversial due to large gaps in the fossil record and poor
   biomolecular preservation of skeletal specimens. Here, a molecular
   analysis of 1000-year-old fossil eggshells provides the first
   description of elephant bird phylogeography and offers insight into the
   ecology and evolution of these flightless giants. Mitochondrial genomes
   from across Madagascar reveal genetic variation that is correlated with
   eggshell morphology, stable isotope composition, and geographic
   distribution. The elephant bird crown is dated to ca. 30 Mya, when
   Madagascar is estimated to have become less arid as it moved northward.
   High levels of between-clade genetic variation support reclassifying
   Mullerornis into a separate family. Low levels of within-clade genetic
   variation suggest there were only two elephant bird genera existing in
   southern Madagascar during the Holocene. However, we find an eggshell
   collection from Madagascar's far north that represents a unique lineage
   of Aepyornis. Furthermore, divergence within Aepyornis coincides with
   the aridification of Madagascar during the early Pleistocene ca. 1.5 Ma,
   and is consistent with the fragmentation of populations in the highlands
   driving diversification and the evolution of extreme gigantism over
   shorts timescales. We advocate for a revision of their taxonomy that
   integrates palaeogenomic and palaeoecological perspectives.},

Title = {Climate-induced range shifts drive adaptive response via spatio-temporal
   sieving of alleles},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Quaternary climate fluctuations drove many species to shift their
   geographic ranges, in turn shaping their genetic structures. Recently,
   it has been argued that adaptation may have accompanied species range
   shifts via the ``sieving{''} of genotypes during colonisation and
   establishment. However, this has not been directly demonstrated, and
   knowledge remains limited on how different evolutionary forces, which
   are typically investigated separately, interacted to jointly mediate
   species responses to past climatic change. Here, through whole-genome
   re-sequencing of over 1200 individuals of the carnation Dianthus
   sylvestris coupled with integrated population genomic and
   gene-environment models, we reconstruct the past neutral and adaptive
   landscape of this species as it was shaped by the Quaternary glacial
   cycles. We show that adaptive responses emerged concomitantly with the
   post-glacial range shifts and expansions of this species in the last 20
   thousand years. This was due to the heterogenous sieving of adaptive
   alleles across space and time, as populations expanded out of
   restrictive glacial refugia into the broader and more heterogeneous
   range of habitats available in the present-day inter-glacial. Our
   findings reveal a tightly-linked interplay of migration and adaptation
   under past climate-induced range shifts, which we show is key to
   understanding the spatial patterns of adaptive variation we see in
   species today.
   The interplay of migration and adaptation was key in shaping species'
   responses to Quaternary climate change. Illustrating this, Luqman et al.
   show that adaptive responses in a plant species emerged from
   climate-induced range shifts due to heterogenous sieving of adaptive
   alleles across space and time.},

Title = {A density functional theory for ecology across scales},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Ecology lacks a holistic approach that can model phenomena across
   temporal and spatial scales, largely because of the challenges in
   modelling systems with a large number of interacting constituents. This
   hampers our understanding of complex ecosystems and the impact that
   human interventions (e.g., deforestation, wildlife harvesting and
   climate change) have on them. Here we use density functional theory, a
   computational method for many-body problems in physics, to develop a
   computational framework for ecosystem modelling. Our methods accurately
   fit experimental and synthetic data of interacting multi-species
   communities across spatial scales and can project to unseen data. As the
   key concept we establish and validate a cost function that encodes the
   trade-offs between the various ecosystem components. We show how this
   single general modelling framework delivers predictions on par with
   established, but specialised, approaches for systems from predatory
   microbes to territorial flies to tropical tree communities. Our density
   functional framework thus provides a promising avenue for advancing our
   understanding of ecological systems.
   Modelling diverse ecological phenomena across scales with a single
   mathematical framework is challenging. Here, the authors draw on density
   functional theory to develop a framework that bridges between
   mechanistic theories at fine scales and statistical models at large
   scales.},
