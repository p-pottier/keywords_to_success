Abstract = {The biological mechanisms that underpin primate social evolution remain
   poorly understood. Asian colobines display a range of social
   organizations, which makes them good models for investigating social
   evolution. By integrating ecological, geological, fossil, behavioral,
   and genomic analyses, we found that colobine primates that inhabit
   colder environments tend to live in larger, more complex groups.
   Specifically, glacial periods during the past 6 million years promoted
   the selection of genes involved in cold-related energy metabolism and
   neurohormonal regulation. More-efficient dopamine and oxytocin pathways
   developed in odd-nosed monkeys, which may have favored the prolongation
   of maternal care and lactation, increasing infant survival in cold
   environments. These adaptive changes appear to have strengthened
   interindividual affiliation, increased male-male tolerance, and
   facilitated the stepwise aggregation from independent one-male groups to
   large multilevel societies.},

Abstract = {Hybridization is widely recognized as promoting both species and
   phenotypic diversity. However, its role in mammalian evolution is rarely
   examined. We report historical hybridization among a group of snub-nosed
   monkeys (Rhinopithecus) that resulted in the origin of a hybrid species.
   The geographically isolated gray snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus
   brelichi shows a stable mixed genomic ancestry derived from the golden
   snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) and the ancestor of
   black-white (Rhinopithecus bieti) and black snub-nosed monkeys
   (Rhinopithecus strykeri). We further identified key genes derived from
   the parental lineages, respectively, that may have contributed to the
   mosaic coat coloration of R. brelichi, which likely promoted premating
   reproductive isolation of the hybrid from parental lineages. Our study
   highlights the underappreciated role of hybridization in generating
   species and phenotypic diversity in mammals.},

Abstract = {The earliest vascular plants had stems with a central cylindrical strand
   of water-conducting xylem, which rapidly diversified into more complex
   shapes. This diversification is understood to coincide with increases in
   plant body size and branching; however, no selection pressure favoring
   xylem strand-shape complexity is known. We show that incremental changes
   in xylem network organization that diverge from the cylindrical
   ancestral form lead to progressively greater drought resistance by
   reducing the risk of hydraulic failure. As xylem strand complexity
   increases, independent pathways for embolism spread become fewer and
   increasingly concentrated in more centrally located conduits, thus
   limiting the systemic spread of embolism during drought. Selection by
   drought may thus explain observed trajectories of xylem strand evolution
   in the fossil record and the diversity of extant forms.},

Journal = {SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {380},
Number = {6645},
Pages = {616-618},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Several scenarios have been proposed to explain rapid net size increases
   in some early Cenozoic mammalian lineages: sustained and gradual
   directional change, successive occupation of adaptive zones associated
   with progressively larger body sizes, and nondirectional evolution
   associated with branching events in combination with higher
   diversification potential of the larger lineages. We test these
   hypotheses in brontotheres, which are among the first radiations of
   mammals that consistently evolved multitonne sizes. Body-mass evolution
   in brontotheres mainly occurred during speciation and had no
   preferential direction. Long-term directional change stemmed from the
   higher survival of larger lineages in less-saturated herbivore guilds.
   Our study emphasizes the role of differential species proliferation in
   explaining the long-term phenotypic trends observed in the fossil
   record, which are more than an accumulation of steady microevolutionary
   changes.},

Abstract = {Thousands of genomic regions have been associated with heritable human
   diseases, but attempts to elucidate biological mechanisms are impeded by
   an inability to discern which genomic positions are functionally
   important. Evolutionary constraint is a powerful predictor of function,
   agnostic to cell type or disease mechanism. Single-base phyloP scores
   from 240 mammals identified 3.3\% of the human genome as significantly
   constrained and likely functional. We compared phyloP scores to genome
   annotation, association studies, copy-number variation, clinical
   genetics findings, and cancer data. Constrained positions are enriched
   for variants that explain common disease heritability more than other
   functional annotations. Our results improve variant annotation but also
   highlight that the regulatory landscape of the human genome still needs
   to be further explored and linked to disease.},

Abstract = {Conserved genomic sequences disrupted in humans may underlie uniquely

   conferring significant differences in regulatory activity, half of which
   enhance rather than disrupt regulatory function. We highlight several
   hCONDELs with putative human-specific effects on brain development,
   including HDAC5, CPEB4, and PPP2CA. Reverting an hCONDEL to the
   ancestral sequence alters the expression of LOXL2 and developmental
   genes involved in myelination and synaptic function. Our data provide a

Abstract = {In most organisms, reproduction is correlated with shorter life span.
   However, the reproductive queen in eusocial insects exhibits a much
   longer life span than that of workers. In Harpegnathos ants, when the
   queen dies, workers can undergo an adult caste switch to reproductive
   pseudo-queens (gamergates), exhibiting a five-times prolonged life span.
   To explore the relation between reproduction and longevity, we compared
   gene expression during caste switching. Insulin expression is increased
   in the gamergate brain that correlates with increased lipid synthesis
   and production of vitellogenin in the fat body, both transported to the
   egg. This results from activation of the mitogen-activated protein
   kinase (MAPK) branch of the insulin signaling pathway. By contrast, the
   production in the gamergate developing ovary of anti-insulin Imp-L2
   leads to decreased signaling of the AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) branch in
   the fat body, which is consistent with their extended longevity.},

Abstract = {Southern Ocean primary productivity is principally controlled by
   adjustments in light and iron limitation, but the spatial and temporal
   determinants of iron availability, accessibility, and demand are poorly
   constrained, which hinders accurate long-term projections. We present a
   multidecadal record of phytoplankton photophysiology between 1996 and
   2022 from historical in situ datasets collected by Biogeochemical Argo
   (BGC-Argo) floats and ship-based platforms. We find a significant
   multidecadal trend in irradiance-normalized nonphotochemical quenching
   due to increasing iron stress, with concomitant declines in regional net
   primary production. The observed trend of increasing iron stress results
   from changing Southern Ocean mixed-layer physics as well as complex
   biological and chemical feedback that is indicative of important ongoing
   changes to the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.},

Abstract = {Deadwood is a large global carbon store with its store size partially
   determined by biotic decay. Microbial wood decay rates are known to
   respond to changing temperature and precipitation. Termites are also
   important decomposers in the tropics but are less well studied. An
   understanding of their climate sensitivities is needed to estimate
   climate change effects on wood carbon pools. Using data from 133 sites
   spanning six continents, we found that termite wood discovery and
   consumption were highly sensitive to temperature (with decay increasing
   >6.8 times per 10 degrees C increase in temperature)-even more so than
   microbes. Termite decay effects were greatest in tropical seasonal
   forests, tropical savannas, and subtropical deserts. With
   tropicalization (i.e., warming shifts to tropical climates), termite
   wood decay will likely increase as termites access more of Earth's
   surface.},

Abstract = {We examined transposable element (TE) content of 248 placental mammal
   genome assemblies, the largest de novo TE curation effort in eukaryotes
   to date. We found that although mammals resemble one another in total TE
   content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to
   recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and
   quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly
   long interspersed elements, drive increases in genome size, whereas DNA
   transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to
   accumulate only a few types of TEs at any given time, with one TE type
   dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the
   presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will
   serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental
   mammals.},

Abstract = {The Cretaceous-Paleogene event was the last mass extinction event, yet
   its impact and long-term effects on species-level marine vertebrate
   diversity remain largely uncharacterized. We quantified elasmobranch
   (sharks, skates, and rays) speciation, extinction, and ecological change
   resulting from the end-Cretaceous event using >3200 fossil occurrences
   and 675 species spanning the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene interval at
   global scale. Elasmobranchs declined by >62\% at the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and did not fully recover in the
   Paleocene. The end-Cretaceous event triggered a heterogeneous pattern of
   extinction, with rays and durophagous species reaching the highest
   levels of extinction (>72\%) and sharks and nondurophagous species being
   less affected. Taxa with large geographic ranges and/or those restricted
   to high-latitude settings show higher survival. The Cretaceous-Paleogene
   event drastically altered the evolutionary history of marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Mismatches between an organism???s phenotype and its environment can
   result in short-term fitness costs. Here, we show that some
   phenotype???environment mismatch errors can be explained by asymmetrical
   costs of different types of errors in wild red squirrels. Mothers that
   mistakenly increased reproductive effort when signals of an upcoming
   food pulse were absent were more likely to correctly increase effort
   when a food pulse did occur. However, mothers that failed to increase
   effort when cues of an upcoming food pulse were present suffered
   lifetime fitness costs that could only be offset through food
   supplementation. In fluctuating environments, such
   phenotype???environment mismatches may therefore reflect a bias to
   overestimate environmental cues and avoid making the costliest error,
   ultimately enhancing lifetime fitness.},

Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Fish moving between different thermal environments experience heat
   exchange via conduction through the body wall and convection from blood
   flow across the gills. We report a strategy of preventing convective
   heat loss at the gills during excursions into deep, cold water by the
   tropical scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphryna lewini). Adult scalloped
   hammerhead sharks dive rapidly and repeatedly from warm (similar to 26
   degrees C) surface waters to depths exceeding 800 meters with
   temperatures as low as 5 degrees C. Biologgers attached to adult sharks
   show that warm muscle temperatures were maintained throughout the
   deepest portion of each dive. Substantive cooling only occurred during
   the latter stages of the ascent phase and, once initiated, was rapid.
   Heat transfer coefficient modeling indicated that convective heat
   transfer was suspended, probably by suppressing gill function during
   deep dives. This previously unobserved strategy has broad similarities
   to marine mammal ``breath hold{''} diving.},

Abstract = {Emotional contagion is the most ancestral form of empathy. We tested to
   what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are
   evolutionarily conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to
   regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in
   zebrafish. Using oxytocin and oxytocin receptor mutants, we show that
   oxytocin is both necessary and sufficient for observer zebrafish to
   imitate the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. The brain
   regions associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous
   to those involved in the same process in rodents (e.g., striatum,
   lateral septum), receiving direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons
   located in the pre-optic area. Together, our results support an
   evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic
   empathic behaviors across vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Comparative analysis of primate genomes within a phylogenetic context is
   essential for understanding the evolution of human genetic architecture
   and primate diversity. We present such a study of 50 primate species
   spanning 38 genera and 14 families, including 27 genomes first reported
   here, with many from previously less well represented groups, the New
   World monkeys and the Strepsirrhini. Our analyses reveal heterogeneous
   rates of genomic rearrangement and gene evolution across primate
   lineages. Thousands of genes under positive selection in different
   lineages play roles in the nervous, skeletal, and digestive systems and
   may have contributed to primate innovations and adaptations. Our study
   reveals that many key genomic innovations occurred in the Simiiformes
   ancestral node and may have had an impact on the adaptive radiation of
   the Simiiformes and human evolution.},

Abstract = {We elucidate grapevine evolution and domestication histories with 3525
   cultivated and wild accessions worldwide. In the Pleistocene, harsh
   climate drove the separation of wild grape ecotypes caused by continuous
   habitat fragmentation. Then, domestication occurred concurrently about
   11,000 years ago in Western Asia and the Caucasus to yield table and
   wine grapevines. The Western Asia domesticates dispersed into Europe
   with early farmers, introgressed with ancient wild western ecotypes, and
   subsequently diversified along human migration trails into muscat and
   unique western wine grape ancestries by the late Neolithic. Analyses of
   domestication traits also reveal new insights into selection for berry
   palatability, hermaphroditism, muscat flavor, and berry skin color.
   These data demonstrate the role of the grapevines in the early inception
   of agriculture across Eurasia.},

Abstract = {Echolocating toothed whales (odontocetes) capture fast-moving prey in
   dark marine environments, which critically depends on their ability to
   generate powerful, ultrasonic clicks. How their supposedly air-driven
   sound source can produce biosonar clicks at depths of >1000 meters,
   while also producing rich vocal repertoires to mediate complex social
   communication, remains unknown. We show that odontocetes possess a sound
   production system based on air driven through nasal passages that is
   functionally analogous to laryngeal and syringeal sound production.
   Tissue vibration in different registers produces distinct echolocation
   and communication signals across all major odontocete clades, and thus
   provides a physiological basis for classifying their vocal repertoires.
   The vocal fry register is used by species from porpoises to sperm whales
   for generating powerful, highly air-efficient echolocation clicks.},

Abstract = {North America has experienced a massive increase in cropland use since
   1800, accompanied more recently by the intensification of agricultural
   practices. Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples
   spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect
   of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across
   the native range of the common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), a
   now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed
   strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts
   in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in
   the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was
   facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping
   genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the
   success of this weed in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Earth's forests harbor extensive biodiversity and are currently a major
   carbon sink. Forest conservation and restoration can help mitigate
   climate change; however, climate change could fundamentally imperil
   forests in many regions and undermine their ability to provide such
   mitigation. The extent of climate risks facing forests has not been
   synthesized globally nor have different approaches to quantifying forest
   climate risks been systematically compared. We combine outputs from
   multiple mechanistic and empirical approaches to modeling carbon,
   biodiversity, and disturbance risks to conduct a synthetic climate risk
   analysis for Earth's forests in the 21st century. Despite large
   uncertainty in most regions we find that some forests are consistently
   at higher risk, including southern boreal forests and those in western
   North America and parts of the Amazon.},

Abstract = {Faunal turnover in Indo-Australia across Wallace's Line is one of the
   most recognizable patterns in biogeography and has catalyzed debate
   about the role of evolutionary and geoclimatic history in biotic
   interchanges. Here, analysis of more than 20,000 vertebrate species with
   a model of geoclimate and biological diversification shows that broad
   precipitation tolerance and dispersal ability were key for exchange
   across the deep-time precipitation gradient spanning the region.
   Sundanian (Southeast Asian) lineages evolved in a climate similar to the
   humid ``stepping stones{''} of Wallacea, facilitating colonization of
   the Sahulian (Australian) continental shelf. By contrast, Sahulian
   lineages predominantly evolved in drier conditions, hampering
   establishment in Sunda and shaping faunal distinctiveness. We
   demonstrate how the history of adaptation to past environmental
   conditions shapes asymmetrical colonization and global biogeographic
   structure.},

Abstract = {The rich diversity of morphology and behavior displayed across primate
   species provides an informative context in which to study the impact of
   genomic diversity on fundamental biological processes. Analysis of that
   diversity provides insight into long-standing questions in evolutionary
   and conservation biology and is urgent given severe threats these
   species are facing. Here, we present high-coverage wholegenome data from
   233 primate species representing 86\% of genera and all 16 families.
   This dataset was used, together with fossil calibration, to create a
   nuclear DNA phylogeny and to reassess evolutionary divergence times
   among primate clades. We found within-species genetic diversity across
   families and geographic regions to be associated with climate and
   sociality, but not with extinction risk. Furthermore, mutation rates
   differ across species, potentially influenced by effective population
   sizes. Lastly, we identified extensive recurrence of missense mutations
   previously thought to be human specific. This study will open a wide
   range of research avenues for future primate genomic research.},

Abstract = {The horse is central to many Indigenous cultures across the American
   Southwest and the Great Plains. However, when and how horses were first
   integrated into Indigenous lifeways remain contentious, with extant
   models derived largely from colonial records. We conducted an
   interdisciplinary study of an assemblage of historic archaeological
   horse remains, integrating genomic, isotopic, radiocarbon, and
   paleopathological evidence. Archaeological and modern North American
   horses show strong Iberian genetic affinities, with later influx from
   British sources, but no Viking proximity. Horses rapidly spread from the
   south into the northern Rockies and central plains by the first half of
   the 17th century CE, likely through Indigenous exchange networks. They
   were deeply integrated into Indigenous societies before the arrival of
   18th-century European observers, as reflected in herd management,
   ceremonial practices, and culture.},

Abstract = {Forestation of the vast global drylands has been considered a promising
   climate change mitigation strategy. However, its actual climatic
   benefits are uncertain because the forests' reduced albedo can produce
   large warming effects. Using high-resolution spatial analysis of global
   drylands, we found 448 million hectares suitable for afforestation. This
   area's carbon sequestration potential until 2100 is 32.3 billion tons of
   carbon (Gt C), but 22.6 Gt C of that is required to balance albedo
   effects. The net carbon equivalent would offset similar to 1\% of
   projected medium-emissions and business-as-usual scenarios over the same
   period. Focusing forestation only on areas with net cooling effects
   would use half the area and double the emissions offset. Although such
   smart forestation is clearly important, its limited climatic benefits
   reinforce the need to reduce emissions rapidly.},

Abstract = {The evolution of advanced cognition in vertebrates is associated with
   two independent innovations in the forebrain: the six-layered neocortex
   in mammals and the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) in sauropsids
   (reptiles and birds). How these innovations arose in vertebrate
   ancestors remains unclear. To reconstruct forebrain evolution in
   tetrapods, we built a cell-type atlas of the telencephalon of the
   salamander Pleurodeles waltl. Our molecular, developmental, and
   connectivity data indicate that parts of the sauropsid DVR trace back to
   tetrapod ancestors. By contrast, the salamander dorsal pallium is devoid
   of cellular and molecular characteristics of the mammalian neocortex yet
   shares similarities with the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Our
   findings chart the series of innovations that resulted in the emergence
   of the mammalian six-layered neocortex and the sauropsid DVR.},

Abstract = {The human skeletal form underlies bipedalism, but the genetic basis of
   skeletal proportions (SPs) is not well characterized. We applied
   deep-learning models to 31,221 x-rays from the UK Biobank to extract a
   comprehensive set of SPs, which were associated with 145 independent
   loci genome-wide. Structural equation modeling suggested that limb
   proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were independent of
   width and torso proportions. Polygenic score analysis identified
   specific associations between osteoarthritis and hip and knee SPs. In
   contrast to other traits, SP loci were enriched in human accelerated
   regions and in regulatory elements of genes that are differentially
   expressed between humans and great apes. Combined, our work identifies
   specific genetic variants that affect the skeletal form and ties a major
   evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis.},
