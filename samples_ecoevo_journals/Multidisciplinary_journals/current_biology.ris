AB  - Oscine birds preferentially respond to certain sounds over others from an early age, which focuses subse-quent learning onto sexually relevant songs.1-3 Songs vary both across species and, due to cultural evolution, among populations of the same species. As a result, early song responses are expected to be shaped by se-lection both to avoid the fitness costs of cross-species learning4 and to promote learning of population -typical songs.5 These sources of selection are not mutually exclusive but can result in distinct geographic patterns of song responses in juvenile birds: if the risks of interspecific mating are the main driver of early song discrimination, then discrimination should be strongest where closely related species co-occur.4 In contrast, if early discrimination primarily facilitates learning local songs, then it should be tuned to songs typical of the local dialect.5-7 Here, we experimentally assess the drivers of song discrimination in nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). We first demonstrate that early discrimination against the songs of the closely related collared flycatcher (F. albicollis) is not strongly affected by co-occurrence. Second, across six European populations, we show that nestlings' early song responses are tuned to their local song dialect and that responses to the songs of collared flycatchers are similarly weak as to those of other conspecific dialects. Taken together, these findings provide clear experimental support for the hypothesis that cultural evolution, in conjunction with associated learning predispositions, drives the emergence of pre-mating reproductive barriers.

AB  - Earth's wilderness areas are reservoirs of genetic information and carbon storage systems, and are vital to reducing extinction risks. Retaining the conservation value of these areas is fundamental to achieving global biodiversity conservation goals; however, climate and land-use risk can undermine their ability to provide these functions. The extent to which wilderness areas are likely to be impacted by these drivers has not pre-viously been quantified. Using climate and land-use change during baseline (1971-2005) and future (2016- 2050) periods, we estimate that these stressors within wilderness areas will increase by ca. 60% and 39%, respectively, under a scenario of high emission and land-use change (SSP5-RCP8.5). Nearly half (49%) of all wilderness areas could experience substantial climate change by 2050 under this scenario, potentially limiting their capacity to shelter biodiversity. Notable climate (>5 km year -1) and land-use (>0.25 km year -1) changes are expected to occur more rapidly in the unprotected wilderness, including the edges of the Amazonian wilderness, Northern Russia, and Central Africa, which support unique assemblages of species and are critical for the preservation of biodiversity. However, an alternative scenario of sustainable develop-ment (SSP1-RCP2.6) would attenuate the projected climate velocity and land-use instability by 54% and 6%, respectively. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and preserving the remaining intact natural ecosystems can help fortify these bastions of biodiversity.

AB  - Intact tropical forests have a high conservation value.1 Although perceived as wild,2 they have been under long-term human influence.3 As global area-based conservation targets increase, the ecological contribu-tions of Indigenous peoples through their governance institutions and practices4 are gaining mainstream interest. Indigenous lands-covering a quarter of Earth's surface5 and overlapping with a third of intact forests6-often have reduced deforestation, degradation, and carbon emissions, compared with non -pro-tected areas and protected areas.7,8 A key question with implications for the design of more equitable and effective conservation policies is to understand the impacts of Indigenous lands on forest integrity and long-term use, as critical measures of ecosystem health included within the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.9 Using the forest landscape integrity index10 and Anthromes11 datasets, we find that high -integrity forests tend to be located within the overlap of protected areas and Indigenous lands (protected -Indigenous areas). After accounting for location biases through statistical matching and regression, protected-Indigenous areas had the highest protective effect on forest integrity and the lowest land-use intensity relative to Indigenous lands, protected areas, and non-protected controls pan-tropically. The pro-tective effect of Indigenous lands on forest integrity was lower in Indigenous lands than in protected areas and non-protected areas in the Americas and Asia. The combined positive effects of state legislation and Indigenous presence in protected-Indigenous areas may contribute to maintaining tropical forest integrity. Understanding management and governance in protected-Indigenous areas can help states to appropriately support community-governed lands.

AB  - Over the past decade, molecular phylogenetics has reshaped our understanding of the fungal tree of life by unraveling a hitherto elusive diversity of the protistan relatives of Fungi. Aphelida constitutes one of these novel deep branches that precede the emergence of osmotrophic fungal lifestyle and hold particular signif-icance as the pathogens of algae. Here, we obtain and analyze the genomes of aphelid species Amoeboa-phelidium protococcarum and Amoeboaphelidium occidentale. Genomic data unmask the vast divergence between these species, hidden behind their morphological similarity, and reveal hybrid genomes with a com-plex evolutionary history in two strains of A. protococcarum. We confirm the proposed sister relationship be-tween Aphelida and Fungi using phylogenomic analysis and chart the reduction of characteristic proteins involved in phagocytic activity in the evolution of Holomycota. Annotation of aphelid genomes demonstrates the retention of actin nucleation-promoting complexes associated with phagocytosis and amoeboid motility and also reveals a conspicuous expansion of receptor-like protein kinases, uncharacteristic of fungal line-ages. We find that aphelids possess multiple carbohydrate-processing enzymes that are involved in fungal cell wall synthesis but do not display rich complements of algal cell-wall-processing enzymes, suggesting an independent origin of fungal plant-degrading capabilities. Aphelid genomes show that the emergence of Fungi from phagotrophic ancestors relied on a common cell wall synthetic machinery but required a different set of proteins for digestion and interaction with the environment.

AB  - Understanding how novel structures arise is a central question in evolution. Novel structures are often defined as structures that are not derived from (homologous to) any structure in the ancestor.(1) The carapace of the crustacean Daphnia magna is a bivalved "cape " of exoskeleton. Shiga et al.(2) proposed that the carapace of crustaceans like Daphnia and many other plate-like outgrowths in arthropods are novel structures that arose through the repeated co-option of genes like vestigial that also pattern insect wings.(2-4) To determine whether the Daphnia carapace is a novel structure, we compare previous functional work(2) with the expression of genes known to pattern the proximal leg region (pannier, araucan, and vestigial)(5,6) between Daphnia, Parhyale, and Tribolium. Our results suggest that the Daphnia carapace did not arise by co-option but instead derived from an exite (lateral leg lobe) that emerges from an ancestral proximal leg segment that was incorporated into the Daphnia body wall. The Daphnia carapace, therefore, appears to be homologous to the Parhyale tergal plate and the insect wing.(5) Remarkably, the vestigial-positive tissue that gives rise to the Daphnia carapace appears to be present in Parhyale(7) and Tribolium as a small, inconspicuous protrusion. Thus, rather than a novel structure resulting from gene co-option, the Daphnia carapace appears to have arisen from a shared, ancestral tissue (morphogenetic field) that persists in a cryptic state in other arthropod lineages. Cryptic persistence of unrecognized serial homologs may thus be a general solution for the origin of novel structures.

AB  - There is an urgent need to halt and reverse loss of mangroves and seagrass to protect and increase the ecosystem services they provide to coastal communities, such as enhancing coastal resilience and contributing to climate stability. Ambitious targets for their recovery can inspire public and private investment in conservation, 3 but the expected outcomes of different protection and restoration strategies are unclear. We estimated potential recovery of mangroves and seagrass through gains in ecosystem extent to the year 2070 under a range of protection and restoration strategies implemented until the year 2050. Under a protectiononly scenario, the current trajectories of net mangrove loss slowed, and a minor net gain in global seagrass extent (similar to 1%) was estimated. Protection alone is therefore unlikely to drive sufficient recovery. However, if action is taken to both protect and restore, net gains of up to 5% and 35% of mangroves and seagrasses, respectively, could be achieved by 2050. Further, protection and restoration can be complementary, as protection prevents losses that would otherwise occur post-2050, highlighting the importance of implementing protection measures. Our findings provide the scientific evidence required for setting strategic and ambitious targets to inspire significant global investment and effort in mangrove and seagrass conservation.

AB  - Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the most variable-sized mammalian species on Earth, displaying a 40-fold size difference between breeds.(1) Although dogs of variable size are found in the archeological record,(2-4) the most dramatic shifts in body size are the result of selection over the last two centuries, as dog breeders selected and propagated phenotypic extremes within closed breeding populations.(5) Analyses of over 200 domestic breeds have identified approximately 20 body size genes regulating insulin processing, fatty acid metabolism, TGF beta signaling, and skeletal formation.(6-10) Of these, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) predominates, controlling approximately 15% of body size variation between breeds.(8) The identification of a functional mutation associated with IGF1 has thus far proven elusive.(6,10,11) Here, to identify and elucidate the role of an ancestral IGF1 allele in the propagation of modern canids, we analyzed 1,431 genome sequences from 13 species, including both ancient and modem canids, thus allowing us to define the evolutionary history of both ancestral and derived alleles at this locus. We identified a single variant in an antisense long non-coding RNA (IGF1-AS) that interacts with the IGF1 gene, creating a duplex. While the derived mutation predominates in both modern gray wolves and large domestic breeds, the ancestral allele, which predisposes to small size, was common in small-sized breeds and smaller wild canids. Our analyses demonstrate that this major regulator of canid body size nearly vanished in Pleistocene wolves, before its recent resurgence resulting from human-imposed selection for small-sized breed dogs.

AB  - The evolution of pregnancy exposes parental tissues to new, potentially stressful conditions, which can trigger inflammation.(1) Inflammation is costly(2,3) and can induce embryo rejection, which constrains the evolution of pregnancy.(1) In contrast, inflammation can also promote morphological innovation at the maternal embryonic interface as exemplified by co-option of pro-inflammatory signaling for eutherian embryo implantation.(1,4,5) Given its dual function, inflammation could be a key process explaining how innovations such as pregnancy and placentation evolved many times convergently. Pelvic brooding ricefishes evolved a novel "plug"tissue,(6,7) which forms inside the female gonoduct after spawning, anchors egg-attaching filaments, and enables pelvic brooders to carry eggs externally until hatching.(6,8) Compared to pregnancy, i.e., internal bearing of embryos, external bearing should alleviate constraints on inflammation in the reproductive tract. We thus hypothesized that an ancestral inflammation triggered by the retention of attaching filaments gave rise to pathways orchestrating plug formation. In line with our hypothesis, histological sections of the developing plug revealed signs of gonoduct injuries by egg-attaching filaments in the pelvic brooding ricefish Oryzias eversi. Tissue-specific transcriptomes showed that inflammatory signaling dominates the plug transcriptome and inflammation-induced genes controlling vital processes for plug development such as tissue growth and angiogenesis were overexpressed in the plug. Finally, mammalian placenta genes were enriched in the plug transcriptome, indicating convergent gene co-option for building, attaching, and sustaining a transient tissue in the female reproductive tract. This study highlights the role of gene co-option and suggests that recruiting inflammatory signaling into physiological processes provides a fast-track to evolutionary innovation.

AB  - The killer whale (Orcinus orca) and false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) are the only extant cetaceans that hunt other marine mammals, with pods of the former routinely preying on baleen whales >10 m in length and the latter being known to take other delphinids.(1-3) Fossil evidence for the origins of this feeding behavior is wanting, although molecular phylogenies indicate that it evolved independently in the two lineages.(4) We describe a new extinct representative of the killer whale ecomorph, Rododelphis stamatiadisi, based on a partial skeleton from the Pleistocene of Rhodes (Greece). Five otoliths of the bathypelagic blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou are associated with the holotype, providing unexpected evidence of its last meal. The evolutionary relationships of R. stamatiadisi and the convergent evolution of killer whale-like features were explored through a broad-ranging phylogenetic analysis that recovered R. stamatiadisi as the closest relative of P. crassidens and O. orca as the only living representative of a once diverse Glade. Within the clade of Orca and kin, key features implicated in extant killer whale feeding, such as body size, tooth size, and tooth count, evolved in a stepwise manner. The tooth wear in Rododelphis and an extinct species of Orcinus (O. citoniensis) are consistent with a fish-based diet, supporting an exaptative Pleistocene origin for marine mammal hunting in both lineages. If correct, predation by the ancestors of Pseudorca and Orca did not play a significant role in the evolution of baleen whale gigantism.

AB  - Understanding determinants of differential reproductive success is at the core of evolutionary biology because of its connection to fitness. Early work has linked variation in reproductive success to differences in age,(1) rank,(2) or size,(3)'(4) as well as habitat characteristics. 5 More recently, studies in group-living taxa have revealed that social relationships also have measurable effects on fitness.(6-8) The influence of social bonds on fitness is particularly interesting in males who compete over reproductive opportunities. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, groups of 4-14 unrelated male bottlenose dolphins cooperate in second-order alliances to compete with rival alliances over access to females.(9-12) Nested within second-order alliances, pairs or trios of males, which can vary in composition, form first-order alliances to herd estrus females. Using 30 years of behavioral data, we examined how individual social factors, such as first-order alliance stability, social connectivity, and variation in social bond strength within second-order alliances, affect male fitness. Analyzing the reproductive careers of 85 males belonging to 10 second-order alliances, we found that the number of paternities a male achieved was positively correlated with his cumulative social bond strength but negatively correlated with his variation in bond strength. Thus, well-integrated males with more homogeneous social bonds to second-order allies obtained most paternities. Our findings provide novel insights into the fitness benefits of polyadic cooperation among unrelated males and highlight the adaptive value of social bonds in this context.

AB  - A breeding colony of notothenioid icefish (Neopagetopsis ionah, Nybelin 1947) of globally unprecedented extent has been discovered in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The colony was estimated to cover at least similar to 240 km(2) of the eastern flank of the Filchner Trough, comprised of fish nests at a density of 0.26 nests per square meter, representing an estimated total of -60 million active nests and associated fish biomass of >60,000 tonnes. The majority of nests were each occupied by 1 adult fish guarding 1,735 eggs (+/- 433 SD). Bottom water temperatures measured across the nesting colony were up to 2 degrees C warmer than the surrounding bottom waters, indicating a spatial correlation between the modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) upflow onto the Weddell Shelf and the active nesting area. Historical and concurrently collected seal movement data indicate that this concentrated fish biomass may be utilized by predators such as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Lesson 1826). Numerous degraded fish carcasses within and near the nesting colony suggest that, in death as well as life, these fish provide input for local food webs and influence local biogeochemical processing. To our knowledge, the area surveyed harbors the most spatially expansive continuous fish breeding colony discovered to date globally at any depth, as well as an exceptionally high Antarctic seafloor biomass. This discovery provides support for the establishment of a regional marine protected area in the Southern Ocean under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) umbrella.

AB  - Efference copies are neural replicas of motor outputs used to anticipate the sensory consequences of a selfgenerated motor action or to coordinate neural networks involved in distinct motor behaviors.(1) An established example of this motor-to-motor coupling is the efference copy of the propulsive motor command, which supplements classical visuo-vestibular reflexes to ensure gaze stabilization during amphibian larval locomotion.(2) Such feedforward replica of spinal pattern-generating circuits produces a spino-extraocular motor coupled activity that evokes eye movements, spatiotemporally coordinated to tail undulation independently of any sensory signal.(3,4) Exploiting the developmental stages of the frog,(1) studies in metamorphing Xenopus demonstrated the persistence of this spino-extraocular motor command in adults and its developmental adaptation to tetrapodal locomotion.(5,6) Here, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of a comparable locomotor-to-ocular motor coupling in the mouse. In neonates, ex vivo nerve recordings of brain-stem-spinal cord preparations reveal a spino-extraocular motor coupled activity similar to the one described in Xenopus. In adult mice, trans-synaptic rabies virus injections in lateral rectus eye muscle label cervical spinal cord neurons closely connected to abducens motor neurons. Finally, treadmill-elicited locomotion in decerebrated preparations(7) evokes rhythmic eye movements in synchrony with the limb gait pattern. Overall, our data are evidence for the conservation of locomotor-induced eye movements in vertebrate lineages. Thus, in mammals as in amphibians, CPG-efference copy feedforward signals might interact with sensory feedback to ensure efficient gaze control during locomotion.

AB  - Examination of the changes in order and arrangement of homologous genes is key for understanding the mechanisms of genome evolution in eukaryotes. Previous comparisons between eukaryotic genomes have revealed considerable conservation across species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago (e.g., vertebrates,1-3 bilaterian animals,4,5 and filamentous fungi6). However, understanding how genome organization evolves within and between eukaryotic major lineages remains underexplored. We analyzed high quality genomes of 120 representative budding yeast species (subphylum Saccharomycotina) spanning-400 million years of eukaryotic evolution to examine how their genome organization evolved and to compare it with the evolution of animal and plant genome organization.7 We found that the decay of both macrosynteny (the conservation of homologous chromosomes) and microsynteny (the conservation of local gene content and order) was strongly associated with evolutionary divergence across budding yeast major clades. However, although macrosynteny decayed very fast, within-100 million years, the microsynteny of many genes-especially genes in metabolic clusters (e.g., in the GAL gene cluster8)-was much more deeply conserved both within major clades and across the subphylum. We further found that when genomes with similar evolutionary divergence times were compared, budding yeasts had lower macrosynteny conservation than animals and filamentous fungi but higher conservation than angiosperms. In contrast, budding yeasts had levels of microsynteny conservation on par with mammals, whereas angiosperms exhibited very low conservation. Our results provide new insight into the tempo and mode of the evolution of gene and genome organization across an entire eukaryotic subphylum.

AB  - Predation risk imposes strong selection pressures on visual systems to quickly and accurately identify the position and movement of potential predators.1,2 Many invertebrates and other small animals, however, have limited capacity for distance perception due to their low spatial resolution and closely situated eyes.3,4 Consequently, they often rely on simplified decision criteria, essentially heuristics or "rules of thumb", to make decisions. The visual cues animals use to make escape decisions are surprisingly consistent, especially among arthropods, with the timing of escape commonly triggered by size -depen-dent visual cues such as angular size or angular size increment.5-10 Angular size, however, confuses predator size and distance and provides no information about the speed of the attack. Here, we show that fiddler crabs (Gelasimus dampieri) are unique among the arthropods studied to date as they timed their escape response based on the speed of an object's angular expansion. The crabs responded reli-ably by running away from visual stimuli that expanded at approximately 1.7 degrees/s, irrespective of stimulus size, speed, or its initial distance from the crabs. Though the threshold expansion speed was consistent across different stimulus conditions, we found that the escape timing was modulated by the elevation at which the stimulus approached, suggesting that other risk factors can bias the expansion speed threshold. The results suggest that the visual escape cues used by arthropods are less conserved than previously thought and that lifestyle and environment are significant drivers determining the escape cues used by different species.

AB  - In addition to being among the most iconic and bizarre-looking Cambrian animals, radiodonts are a group that offers key insight into the acquisition of the arthropod body plan by virtue of their phylogenetic divergence prior to all living members of the phylum. Nonetheless, radiodont fossils are rare and often fragmentary, and contentions over their interpretation have hindered resolution of important evolutionary co-nundrums. Here, we describe 268 specimens of Stanleycaris hirpex from the Cambrian Burgess Shale, including many exceptionally preserved whole-body specimens, informing the most complete reconstruc-tion of a radiodont to date. The trunk region of Stanleycaris has up to 17 segments plus two pairs of filiform caudal blades. The recognition of dorsal sclerotic segmentation of the trunk cuticle and putative unganglio-nated nerve cords provides new insight into the relative timing of acquisition of segmental traits, the epitome of the arthropod body plan. In addition to the pair of stalked lateral eyes, the short head unexpectedly bears a large median eye situated behind a preocular sclerite on an anteriorly projecting head lobe. Upon re-evalu-ation, similar median eyes can be identified in other Cambrian panarthropods demonstrating a deep evolutionary continuity. The exquisitely preserved brain of Stanleycaris is consistent with the hypothesized deutocerebral innervation of the frontal appendages, reconciling neuroanatomical evidence with external morphology in support of an ancestrally bipartite head and brain for arthropods. We propose that the inte-gration of this bipartite head prior to the acquisition of most segmental characters exclusively in the arthropod trunk may help explain its developmental differentiation.

AB  - Density-dependent prey depletion around breeding colonies has long been considered an important factor controlling the population dynamics of colonial animals.(1-4) Ashmole proposed that as seabird colony size increases, intraspecific competition leads to declines in reproductive success, as breeding adults must spend more time and energy to find prey farther from the colony.(1) Seabird colony size often varies over several orders of magnitude within the same species and can include millions of individuals per colony.(5,6) As such, colony size likely plays an important role in determining the individual behavior of its members and how the colony interacts with the surrounding environment.(6) Using tracking data from murres (Uria spp.), the world's most densely breeding seabirds, we show that the distribution of foraging-trip distances scales to colony size(0.33) during the chick-rearing stage, consistent with Ashmole's halo theory.(1,2) This pattern occurred across colonies varying in size over three orders of magnitude and distributed throughout the North Atlantic region. The strong relationship between colony size and foraging range means that the foraging areas of some colonial species can be estimated from colony sizes, which is more practical to measure over a large geographic scale. Two-thirds of the North Atlantic murre population breed at the 16 largest colonies; by extrapolating the predicted foraging ranges to sites without tracking data, we show that only two of these large colonies have significant coverage as marine protected areas. Our results are an important example of how theoretical models, in this case, Ashmole's version of central-place-foraging theory, can be applied to inform conservation and management in colonial breeding species.

AB  - Comparative whole-genome analyses hold great power to illuminate commonalities and differences in the evolution of related species that share similar ecologies. The mustelid subfamily Lutrinae includes 13 currently recognized extant species of otters,(1-5) a semiaquatic group whose evolutionary history is incompletely understood. We assembled a dataset comprising 24 genomes from all living otter species, 14 of which were newly sequenced. We used this dataset to infer phylogenetic relationships and divergence times, to characterize patterns of genome-wide genealogical discordance, and to investigate demographic history and current genomic diversity. We found that genera Lutra, Aonyx, Amblonyx, and Lutrogale form a coherent clade that should be synonymized under Lutra, simplifying the taxonomic structure of the subfamily. The poorly known tropical African Aonyx congicus and the more widespread Aonyx capensis were found to be reciprocally monophyletic (having diverged 440,000 years ago), supporting the validity of the former as a distinct species. We observed variable changes in effective population sizes over time among otters within and among continents, although several species showed similar trends of expansions and declines during the last 100,000 years. This has led to different levels of genomic diversity assessed by overall heterozygosity, genome-wide SNV density, and run of homozygosity burden. Interestingly, there were cases in which diversity metrics were consistent with the current threat status (mostly based on census size), highlighting the potential of genomic data for conservation assessment. Overall, our results shed light on otter evolutionary history and provide a framework for further in-depth comparative genomic studies targeting this group.

AB  - Theropod dinosaurs underwent some of the most remarkable dietary changes in vertebrate evolutionary history, shifting from ancestral carnivory(1-3) to hypercarnivory(4,5) and omnivory/herbivory,(6-9) with some taxa eventually reverting to carnivory.(10-12) The mandible is an important tool for food acquisition in vertebrates and reflects adaptations to feeding modes and diets.(13,14) The morphofunctional modifications accompanying the dietary changes in theropod dinosaurs are not well understood because most of the previous studies focused solely on the cranium and/or were phylogenetically limited in scope,(12,15-21) while studies that include multiple clades are usually based on linear measurements and/or discrete osteological characters.(8,22) Given the potential relationship between macroevolutionary change and ontogenetic pattern,(23) we explore whether functional morphological patterns observed in theropod mandibular evolution show similarities to the ontogenetic trajectory. Here, we use finite element analysis to study the mandibles of non-avialan coelurosaurian theropods and demonstrate how feeding mechanics vary between dietary groups and major clades. We reveal an overall reduction in feeding-induced stresses along all theropod lineages through time. This is facilitated by a post-dentary expansion and the development of a downturned dentary in herbivores and an upturned dentary in carnivores likely via the "curved bone effect."We also observed the same reduction in feeding-induced stress in an ontogenetic series of jaws of the tyrannosaurids Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus , which is best attributed to bone functional adaptation. This suggests that this common tendency for structural strengthening of the theropod mandible through time, irrespective of diet, is linked to "functional peramorphosis"of bone functional adaptations acquired during ontogeny.

AB  - Sexual selection is the basis of some of the most striking phenotypic variation in nature.1,2 In animals, sexual selection in males can act on traits that improve access to mates prior to copulation,3-8 but also on sperm traits filtered by sperm competition,9-14 or female choice expressed simply by the morphology and physi-ology of genital tracts.14-16 Although long overlooked as a mode of selection on plant traits, sexual selection should act on land plants too because they are anisogamous: males produce more, and smaller, gametes than females.17-19 Numerical asymmetry in gamete production is thought to play a central role in selection on traits that affect pollen transfer to mates,20,21 but very little is known about how pollen competition or cryptic female choice might affect the evolution of traits expressed after pollination.22,23 Here, we report the divergence of pollen and pistil traits of the dioecious wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua dur-ing evolution over three generations between populations at low versus high plant density, corresponding to low versus higher levels of polyandry;24 we expected selection under higher polyandry to strengthen compe-tition among pollen donors for fertilizing ovules. We found that populations at high density evolved faster -growing pollen tubes (an equivalent of greater sperm velocity), greater expression of pollen proteins involved in pollen growth, and larger stigmas (a trait likely enhancing the number of pollen donors and thus competi-tion for ovules). Our results identify the post-pollination phase of plant mating as an important arena for the action of sexual selection.

AB  - Human runners have long been thought to have the ability to consume a near-constant amount of energy per distance traveled, regardless of speed, allowing speed to be adapted to particular task demands with minimal energetic consequence.(1-3) However, recent and more precise laboratory measures indicate that humans may in fact have an energy-optimal running speed.(4-6) Here, we characterize runners' speeds in a free-living environment and determine if preferred speed is consistent with task- or energy-dependent objectives. We analyzed a large-scale dataset of free-living runners, which was collected via a commercial fitness tracking device, and found that individual runners preferred a particular speed that did not change across commonly run distances. We compared the data from lab experiments that measured participants' energy-optimal running speeds with the free-living preferred speeds of age- and gender-matched runners in our dataset and found the speeds to be indistinguishable. Human runners prefer a particular running speed that is independent of task distance and is consistent with the objective of minimizing energy expenditure. Our findings offer an insight into the biological objectives that shape human running preferences in the real world-an important consideration when examining human ecology or creating training strategies to improve performance and prevent injury.

AB  - The Late Paleozoic acquisition of wings in insects represents one of the key steps in arthropod evolution. While the origin of wings has been a contentious matter for nearly two centuries, recent evolutionary developmental studies suggest either the participation of both tergal and pleural tissues in the formation of wings(1) or wings originated from exites of the most proximal leg podite incorporated into the insect body wall.(2) The so-called "dual hypothesis'' for wing origins finds support from studies of embryology, evo-devo, and genomics, although the degree of the presumed contribution from tergal and pleural tissues differ.(3-6) Ohde et al.,(7) confirmed amajor role for tergal tissue in the formation of the cricket wing and suggested that "wings evolved from the pre-existing lateral terga of a wingless insect ancestor.'' Additional work has focused on identifying partial serially homologous structures of wings on the prothorax(8,9) and abdominal segments.(10) Thus, several studies have suggested that the prothoracic horns in scarab beetles,(9) gin traps of tenebrionid and scarab beetle pupae,(11,12) or abdominal tracheal gills of mayfly larvae(1,13) evolved from serial homologues of wings. Here, we present critical information from abdominal lateral outgrowths (flaps) of Paleozoic palaeodictyopteran larvae, which show comparable structure to thoracic wings, consisting of cordate lateral outgrowths antero-basally hinged by muscle attachments. These flaps therefore most likely represent wing serial homologues. The presence of these paired outgrowths on abdominal segments I-IX in early diverging Pterygota likely corresponds to crustacean epipods(14,15) and resembles a hypothesized ancestral body plan of a "protopterygote'' model.

AB  - Endophytic oviposition behavior, the insertion of eggs into plant tissues, represents a sophisticated repro-ductive strategy of insects.1 This process is accomplished by employing a specialized egg-laying device, the ovipositor, that effectively protects eggs through plant tissue concealment.2,3 Endophytic oviposition behavior is currently common in many lineages of several major, extant insect orders, principally Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), Orthoptera (katydids and grasshoppers), Hemiptera (cicadas, aphids, scale in-sects, whiteflies, leafhoppers, and bugs), Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (moths), and Hymenoptera (saw-flies).3,4 Based on the occurrences of egg insertion damage and associated scar tissue expressed in fossil plant stems and leaves, endophytic ovipositional behavior is presumed to have emerged as early as the Early Pennsylvanian Period.5 However, for impression fossils, egg morphology and surrounding scar tissue can be difficult to discern on plants, often resulting in ovipositional damage that may be assigned to exophytic (eggs laid on plant surfaces) or to endophytic behavior.6-9 This ambiguity is due to the spatial relationships and his-tological mingling of ovipositional damage and enveloping scars with adjoining plant-host tissues. Here, we describe body fossils of insect eggs within ginkgophyte leaves from the Upper Triassic of China. Feeding damage from an egg-predatory insect commonly occurs on these eggs, as some eggs bear up to several feeding punctures. We provide exceptional body-fossil evidence for resource use of a host plant by an ovipositing insect and unravel the earliest-known tritrophic cascade of a host plant, an ovipositing insect, and an egg-predatory insect.

AB  - The evolution of eusociality has allowed ants to become one of the most conspicuous and ecologically dominant groups of organisms in the world. A large majority of the current similar to 14,000 ant species belong to the formicoids,(1) a clade of nine subfamilies that exhibit the most extreme forms of reproductive division of labor, large colony size,(2) worker polymorphism,(3) and extended queen longevity.(4) The eight remaining non-formicoid subfamilies are less well studied, with few genomes having been sequenced so far and unclear phylogenetic relationships.(5) By sequencing 65 genomes, we provide a robust phylogeny of the 17 ant subfamilies, retrieving high support to the controversial leptanillomorph clade (Leptanillinae and Martialinae) as the sister group to all other extant ants. Moreover, our genomic analyses revealed that the emergence of the formicoids was accompanied by an elevated number of positive selection events. Importantly, the top three gene functions under selection are linked to key features of complex eusociality, with histone acetylation being implicated in caste differentiation, gene silencing by RNA in worker sterility, and autophagy in longevity. These results show that the key pathways associated with eusociality have been under strong selection during the Cretaceous, suggesting that the molecular foundations of complex eusociality may have evolved rapidly in less than 20 Ma.

AB  - Although scales are a defining and conspicuous feature of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera),(1-3 )their earliest evolution predates the group but is shrouded by a dearth of fossil evidence. Herein, we report two new species in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, representing lineages closely related to Lepidoptera: one represents the extinct Tarachoptera, with dense scales on the fore-and hindwings, while the other is an early lineage of caddisflies, with a hindwing covered by a single layer of angustifoliate scales. A novel phylogenetic analysis of 174 morphological characters and 73 extant and fossil representatives of Mecopterida demonstrates a monophyletic origin of scales in the common ancestor of Tarachoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera; that Tarachoptera are monophyletic but their scale morphology is plesiomorphic for the whole group; and that scales were lost early in caddisfly evolution before reappearing multiple times within the clade. Collectively, these fossils provide clarity into the origin and early evolution of scales before their diversification among the moths and butterflies.

AB  - Bats have evolved behavioral specializations that are unique among mammals, including self-propelled flight and echolocation. However, areas of motor cortex that are critical in the generation and fine control of these unique behaviors have never been fully characterized in any bat species, despite the fact that bats compose similar to 25% of extant mammalian species. Using intracortical microstimulation, we examined the organization of motor cortex in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a species that has evolved a novel form of tongue-based echolocation.(1,2) We found that movement representations include an enlarged tongue region containing discrete subregions devoted to generating distinct tongue movement types, consistent with their behavioral specialization generating active sonar using tongue clicks. This magnification of the tongue in motor cortex is comparable to the enlargement of somatosensory representations in species with sensory specializations.(3-5) We also found a novel degree of coactivation between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, both of which are involved in altering the shape and tension of wing membranes during flight. Together, these findings suggest that the organization of motor cortex has coevolved with peripheral morphology in bats to support the unique motor demands of flight and echolocation.

AB  - Many animals detect other individuals effortlessly. In Drosophila, previous studies have examined sensory processing during social interactions using simple blobs as visual stimulation; however, whether and how flies extract higher-order features from conspecifics to guide behavior remains elusive. Arguing that this should be reflected in sensorimotor relations, we developed unbiased machine learning tools for natural behavior quantification and applied these tools, which may prove broadly useful, to study interacting pairs. By transforming motor patterns with female-centered reference frames, we established circling, where heading and traveling directions intersect, as a unique pattern of social interaction during courtship. We found circling to be highly visual, with males exhibiting view-tuned motor patterns. Interestingly, males select specific wing and leg actions based on the positions and motions of the females' heads and tails. Using system identification, we derived visuomotor transformation functions indicating history-dependent action selection, with distance predicting action initiation and angular position predicting wing choices and locomotion directions. Integration of vision with somatosensation further boosts these sensorimotor relations. Essentially comprised of orchestrated wing and leg maneuvers that are more variable in the light, circling induces mutually synchronized conspecific responses stronger than wing extension alone. Finally, we found that actions depend on integrating spatiotemporally structured features with goals. Altogether, we identified a series of sensorimotor relations during circling, implying that during courtship, flies detect complex spatiotemporally structured features of conspecifics, laying the foundation for a mechanistic understanding of conspecific recognition in Drosophila.

AB  - A key component of nature's contribution to people is aesthetic value.(1,2) Charismatic species rally public support and bolster conservation efforts.(3,4) However, an insidious aspect to humanity's valuation of nature is that high value also drives wildlife trade,(5,6) which can spearhead the demise of prized species.(7-9) Here, we explore the antagonistic roles of aesthetic value in biodiversity conservation by using novel metrics of color to evaluate the aesthetics of the most speciose radiation of birds: passerines (i.e., the perching birds). We identify global color hotspots for passerines and highlight the breadth of color in the global bird trade. The tropics emerge as an epicentre of color, encompassing 91% and 65% of the world's most diverse and most uniquely colored passerine assemblages, respectively. We show that the pet trade, which currently affects 30% of passerines (1,408/5,266), traverses the avian phylogeny and targets clusters of related species that are uniquely colored. We identify an additional 478 species at risk of future trade based on their coloration and phylogenetic relationship to currently traded species-together totaling 1,886 species traded, a 34% increase. By modeling future extinctions based on species' current threat status, we predict localized losses of color diversity and uniqueness in many avian communities, undermining their aesthetic value and muting nature's color palette. Given the distribution of color and the association of unique colors with threat and trade, proactive regulation of the bird trade is crucial to conserving charismatic biodiversity, alongside recognition and celebration of color hotspots.

AB  - Marine tetrapods occupy important roles in modern marine ecosystems and often gather in large aggrega-tions driven by patchy prey distribution,1,2 social or reproductive behaviors,3,4 or oceanographic factors.5 Here, we show that similar grouping behaviors evolved in an early marine tetrapod lineage, documented by dozens of specimens of the giant ichthyosaur Shonisaurus in the Luning Formation in West Union Canyon, Nevada, USA.6,7 A concentration of at least seven skeletons closely preserved on a single bedding plane received the bulk of previous attention. However, many more specimens are preserved across-106 square meters and-200 stratigraphic meters of outcrop representing an estimated >105-6 years. Unlike other marine-tetrapod-rich deposits, this assemblage is essentially monotaxic; other vertebrate fossils are excep-tionally scarce. Large individuals are disproportionately abundant, with the exception of multiple neonatal or embryonic specimens, indicating an unusual demographic composition apparently lacking intermediate -sized juveniles or subadults. Combined with geological evidence, our data suggest that dense aggregations of Shonisaurus inhabited this moderately deep, low-diversity, tropical marine environment for millennia dur-ing the latest Carnian Stage of the Late Triassic Period (237-227 Ma). Thus, philopatric grouping behavior in marine tetrapods, potentially linked to reproductive activity, has an antiquity of at least 230 million years.

AB  - Sauropod dinosaurs include the largest land animals to have walked the earth, mostly weighing 10-70 tons (e.g., Sander et al.1 and Carballido et al.2). Osteohistology suggests that derived physiological traits evolved near the origin of sauropod gigantism, including both rapid and uninterrupted growth from juvenile to adult with little developmental plasticity.1,3,4 This differs from the slower, seasonally interrupted growth of their direct ancestors, as evident in most non-sauropodan sauropodomorphs, which also show developmental plasticity in some groups. Accelerated but seasonally interrupted growth is present in Lessemsauridae, the sister clade to Sauropoda, which also attained giant adult body sizes (>10 tons).5 These observations suggest a correlation between giant size and accelerated growth. However, testing this evolutionary connec-tion has been limited by the incomplete understanding of the growth patterns in some of the closest non-giant relatives of sauropods. We present the osteohistology of two such taxa, Aardonyx celestae and Sefapano-saurus zatronensis. Both exhibit highly vascularized woven-parallel complexes, with fibrolamellar complexes during early to mid-ontogeny, containing regular growth marks. These observations provide strong evidence for rapid but seasonally interrupted growth with limited developmental plasticity (indicated by the regular spacing of growth marks). Combined with our review of early branching sauropodomorph osteohistology, these results show that highly accelerated growth rates originated among smaller, non-sauropodan sauro-podomorphs weighing 1 to 2 tons but preceded the origins of giant size (>10 tons). Therefore, the capacity for rapid bone tissue formation, a derived aspect of rapid growth seen in sauropods, did not evolve specif-ically to enable giant body sizes but may have been a prerequisite for them.

AB  - Variation in group size is ubiquitous in social animals, but explaining the range of group sizes seen in nature remains challenging.(1-3) Group-living species occur most frequently in climatically unpredictable environments, such that the costs and benefits of sociality may change from year to year.(4-6) It is, therefore, possible that variation in climate may help to maintain a range of group sizes, but this hypothesis is rarely tested empirically.(7,8) Here, we examine selection on breeding group size in the greater ani (Crotophaga major), a tropical bird that nests in cooperative groups containing multiple co-breeders and non-breeding helpers.(9) We found that larger groups experience lower nest predation (due to cooperative nest defense) but suffer higher nest-ling starvation (due to intra-clutch competition). Long-term data revealed that the relative magnitude of these costs and benefits depends on climate, with frequent changes across years in the strength and direction of selection on group size. In wet years, individual reproductive success was higher in large groups than in small groups, whereas the opposite was true in dry years. This was partly a consequence of competition among nestlings in large clutches, which suffered significantly higher mortality in dry years than in wet years. Aver-aged over the 13-year study period, annual reproductive success was approximately equal for females in small and large groups. These results suggest that temporal changes in the direction of selection may help explain the persistence of a range of group sizes and that a full understanding of the selective pressures shaping sociality requires long-term fitness data.
