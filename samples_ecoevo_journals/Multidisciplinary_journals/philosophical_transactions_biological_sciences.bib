Abstract = {Species with large geographical ranges provide an excellent model for
   studying how different populations respond to dissimilar local
   conditions, particularly with respect to variation in climate. Maternal
   effects, such as nest-site choice greatly affect offspring phenotypes
   and survival. Thus, maternal behaviour has the potential to mitigate the
   effects of divergent climatic conditions across a species' range. We
   delineated natural nesting areas of six populations of painted turtles
   (Chrysemys picta) that span a broad latitudinal range and quantified
   spatial and temporal variation in nest characteristics. To quantify
   microhabitats available for females to choose, we also identified sites
   within the nesting area of each location that were representative of
   available thermal microhabitats. Across the range, females nested
   non-randomly and targeted microhabitats that generally had less canopy
   cover and thus higher nest temperatures. Nest microhabitats differed
   among locations but did not predictably vary with latitude or historic
   mean air temperature during embryonic development. In conjunction with
   other studies of these populations, our results suggest that nest-site
   choice is homogenizing nest environments, which buffers embryos from
   thermally induced selection and could slow embryonic evolution. Thus,
   although effective at a macroclimatic scale, nest-site choice is
   unlikely to compensate for novel stressors that rapidly increase local
   temperatures.This article is part of the theme issue `The evolutionary
   ecology of nests: a cross-taxon approach'.},

Abstract = {The primary function of animal nests is to protect developing offspring
   from hostile and fluctuating environments. Animal builders have been
   shown to adjust nest construction in response to changes in their
   environment. However, the extent of this plasticity, and its dependence
   on an evolutionary history of environmental variability, is not well
   understood. To test whether an evolutionary history with flowing water
   impacts male ability to adjust nests in response to flow regime, we
   collected three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from three
   lakes and three rivers, and brought them into reproductive condition in
   controlled laboratory aquaria. Males were then allowed to nest under
   both flowing and static conditions. Nest building behaviour, nest
   structure and nest composition were all recorded. In comparison to males
   building nests under static conditions, males building in flowing water
   took longer to construct their nests and invested more in nesting
   behaviour. Moreover, nests built in flowing water contained less
   material, were smaller, more compact, neater and more elongated than
   nests built under static conditions. Whether males came from rivers or
   lakes had little impact on nesting activities, or male capacity to
   adjust behaviours in response to flow treatment. Our findings suggest
   that aquatic animals which have experienced a stable environment over a
   long period of time retain plasticity in nest-building behaviours that
   allow them to adjust nests to ambient flow conditions. This ability may
   prove crucial in coping with the increasingly unpredictable flow regimes
   found in anthropogenically altered waterways and those resulting from
   global climate change.This article is part of the theme issue `The

Abstract = {Thermal conditions in the developmental environment can substantially
   affect an individual's phenotype, particularly in egg-laying ectotherms.
   However, whether these effects persist into adulthood is rarely
   examined. To investigate this, we incubated delicate skink, Lampropholis
   delicata, eggs at either cool (22 \& DEG;C), mild (26 \& DEG;C) or hot
   (30 \& DEG;C) temperatures. After hatching, we measured growth, thermal
   performance curves of locomotor activity, and thermal sensitivity of
   resting metabolic rate of offspring as juveniles (4-6 weeks of age),
   sub-adults (approx. 200 days of age), and adults (approx. 2 years of
   age), and then measured developmental temperature impacts on male
   fertility. Incubation temperature had a lasting effect on growth and
   locomotor performance, with cool and hot incubation temperatures
   resulting in faster growth and larger maximum size, and hot incubation
   temperatures reducing locomotor performance at all timepoints. Effects
   on resting metabolic rate were only present in sub-adults, with a higher
   metabolic rate at high and average body mass and negative metabolic
   scaling exponent in cool-incubated lizards. Additionally, cool and hot
   incubation treatments resulted in shorter sperm midpieces and heads.
   Incubation temperature did not affect testis mass or sperm count.
   Overall, our results demonstrate that incubation temperature can have
   lasting effects on later life stages, highlighting the importance of
   maternal nest-site selection, but that some effects are age
   dependent.This article is part of the theme issue `The evolutionary

Abstract = {In the hyperarid Namib Desert, the sand termite Psammotermes allocerus
   Silvestri, 1908 (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) establishes colonies that
   create conspicuous, barren patches known as `fairy circles' on
   permeable, sandy soils. The central bare areas of fairy circles serve
   the key function of storing moisture received from sparse rainfall. The
   sandy soil texture allows rapid infiltration and percolation of
   precipitation, while localized herbivory by the termites creates the
   bare patch, thereby reducing the rapid loss of soil moisture by the
   uptake and transpiration of water by plants. The resulting storage of
   rain water even during prolonged periods of drought enables perennial
   life in hyperarid desert environments and forms a globally unique
   example of ecosystem engineering by social insects. During the past
   decade, most publications primarily debated the origin of fairy circles.
   Here, we contribute to the special issue with a focus on the functional
   and evolutionary dimension of the structure of the Psammotermes colony
   with two differing nest types and two spatially separated key resources,
   as a successful adaptation to extreme desert environment. The paper is
   primarily a review and a synthesis of previous work, with the inclusion
   of new, relevant findings.This article is part of the theme issue `The

Year = {2023},
Volume = {378},

Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Animals construct and inhabit nests that can exhibit dramatic intra- and
   interspecific variation due to differences in behaviour, the biotic and
   abiotic environment, and evolutionary history. In ants, variation in
   nest architecture reflects both differences in ecology and in the
   collective behaviour of the colonies that live in the nests. Each
   component of the nest (such as depth, and the number, size and
   connectivity of chambers) reflects selective pressures for different
   functions, or structural constraints that are imposed by the environment
   or evolutionary history. To determine potential drivers of nest
   structure variation in subterranean nests, we performed a meta-analysis
   of measures of published ant nests to compare different structural
   elements within and across species. We complemented this survey with 42
   nest casts of two closely related species. We quantified nest features
   that can potentially impact ant foraging behaviour and examined whether
   phylogeny or foraging strategy are better explanatory variables for the
   variation we observed. We found that foraging strategy better explained
   nest features than evolutionary history. Our work reveals the importance
   of ecology in shaping nest structure and provides an important
   foundation for future investigations into the selective pressures that
   have shaped ant nest architecture.This article is part of the theme

Abstract = {Innovations in nest design are thought to be one potential factor in the
   evolutionary success of passerine birds (order: Passeriformes), which
   colonized new ecological niches as they diversified in the Oligocene and
   Miocene. In particular, tyrant flycatchers and their allies (parvorder:
   Tyrannida) are an extremely diverse group of New World suboscine
   passerines occupying a wide range of habitats and exhibiting substantial
   extant variation in nest design. To explore the evolution of nest
   architecture in this clade, we first described nest traits across the
   Tyrannida phylogeny and estimated ancestral nest conditions. We then
   quantified macroevolutionary transition rates between nest types,
   examined a potential coevolutionary relationship between nest type and
   habitat, and used phylogenetic mixed models to determine possible
   ecological and environmental correlates of nest design. The Tyrannida
   ancestor probably built a cup nest in a closed habitat, and dome nests
   independently evolved at least 15 times within this group. Both cup- and
   dome-nesting species diversified into semi-open and open habitats, and
   we did not detect a coevolutionary relationship between nest type and
   habitat. Furthermore, nest type was not significantly correlated with
   several key ecological, life-history and environmental traits,
   suggesting that broad variation in Tyrannida nest architecture may not
   easily be explained by a single factor.This article is part of the theme

Abstract = {Researchers have long suggested that animals with greater behavioural
   flexibility will be more likely to survive in face of environmental
   changes. However, it is unknown how this varies across species. Nest
   building is a behaviour directly related to the reproduction and
   survival of species by conferring protection from external environmental
   conditions. The study of nests offers a window into the behaviour of
   birds, and variation in nest morphology is necessarily linked to
   variation in building behaviours. We test whether variation in nest
   morphology is phylogenetically conserved by using data on nest
   morphology from 55 passerine species (>700 specimens) and measuring
   intraspecific variability in nest structure. We found that species mean
   and within-species variation in nest morphology are phylogenetically
   conserved, and that species with domed nests presented higher levels of
   nest morphology variation than cup nest species. We also revealed that
   the capacity of species to present innovative behaviours is not linked
   with how they vary nest morphology. Moreover, we revealed that nests
   from species with larger variation in clutch size and that are built by
   single parents are more variable. Our results help in the understanding
   of how behaviour and extended phenotypes evolve, and highlight the
   importance of exploring the phylogenetic history of behavioural
   flexibility when trying to predict the capacity of species to respond to
   novel challenges.This article is part of the theme issue `The

Abstract = {The large, iconic nests constructed by social species are engineered to
   create internal conditions buffered from external climatic extremes, to
   allow reproduction and/or food production. Nest-inhabiting eusocial
   Macrotermitinae (Blattodea: Isoptera) are outstanding palaeo-tropical
   ecosystem engineers that evolved fungus-growing to break down plant
   matter ca 62 Mya; the termites feed on the fungus and plant matter.
   Fungus-growing ensures a constant food supply, but the fungi need
   temperature-buffered, high humidity conditions, created in
   architecturally complex, often tall, nest-structures (mounds). Given the
   need for constant and similar internal nest conditions by fungi farmed
   by different Macrotermes species, we assessed whether current
   distributions of six African Macrotermes correlate with similar
   variables, and whether this would reflect in expected species'
   distribution shifts with climate change. The primary variables
   explaining species' distributions were not the same for the different
   species. Distributionally, three of the six species are predicted to see
   declines in highly suitable climate. For two species, range increases
   should be small (less than 9\%), and for a single species, M.
   vitrialatus, `very suitable' climate could increase by 64\%. Mismatches
   in vegetation requirements and anthropogenic habitat transformation may
   preclude range expansion, however, presaging disruption to ecosystem
   patterns and processes that will cascade through systems at both

Abstract = {The evolution of behaviour can both influence, and be influenced by,
   morphology. Recent advances in methods and data availability have
   facilitated broad-scale investigations of physical form and behavioural
   function in many contexts, but the relationship between animal
   morphology and object manipulation-particularly objects used in
   construction-remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a new global
   database of nest materials used by 5924 species of birds together with
   phylogenetically informed random forest models to evaluate the link
   between beak shape and these nest-building materials. We find that beak
   morphology, together with species diet and access to materials, can
   predict nest-material use above chance and with high accuracy (68-97\%).
   Much of this relationship, however, is driven by phylogenetic signal and
   sampling biases. We therefore conclude that while variation in nest
   material use is linked with that of beak shape across bird species,
   these correlations are modulated by the ecological context and
   evolutionary history of these species.This article is part of the theme

Abstract = {Continuing the centuries-long exchange between economics and biology,
   our model of reproductive skew is an adaptation of the principal-agent
   relationship between an employer and an employee. Inspired by the case
   of purple martins (Progne subis) and lazuli buntings (Passerina amoena),
   we model a dominant male whose fitness can be advanced not only by
   coercing a subordinate male but, where coercion is impossible or not
   cost-effective, also by providing positive fitness incentives for the
   subordinate that induce him to behave in ways that contribute to the
   dominant's fitness. We model a situation in which a dominant and
   subordinate contest over a variable amount of joint total fitness, both
   the level and division of which result from the strategies adopted by
   both. Thus there is not some given amount of potential fitness (or
   `pie') that is to be divided between the two (or wasted in costly
   contests). The fitness incentives that in evolutionary equilibrium are
   conceded to the subordinate by the dominant maximize the dominant's own
   fitness. The reason is that the larger pie resulting from the
   subordinate's increased helping more than compensates for the dominant's
   reduced fitness share. But the conflict over fitness shares nonetheless
   limits the size of the pie.This article is part of the theme issue

Abstract = {The extent of (in)equality is highly diverse across species of social
   mammals, but we have a poor understanding of the factors that produce or
   inhibit equitable social organizations. Here, we adopt a comparative
   evolutionary perspective to test whether the evolution of social
   dominance hierarchies, a measure of social inequality in animals,
   exhibits phylogenetic conservatism and whether interspecific variation
   in these traits can be explained by sex, age or captivity. We find that
   hierarchy steepness and directional consistency evolve rapidly without
   any apparent constraint from evolutionary history. Given this
   extraordinary variability, we next consider multiple factors that have
   evolved to mitigate social inequality. Social networks, coalitionary
   support and knowledge transfer advantage to privilege some individuals
   over others. Nutritional access and prenatal stressors can impact the
   development of offspring, generating health disparities with
   intergenerational consequences. Intergenerational transfer of material
   resources (e.g. stone tools, food stashes, territories) advantage those
   who receive. Nonetheless, many of the same social species that
   experience unequal access to food (survival) and mates (reproduction)
   engage in levelling mechanisms such as food sharing, adoption,
   revolutionary coalitions, forgiveness and inequity aversion. Taken
   together, mammals rely upon a suite of mechanisms of (in)equality to
   balance the costs and benefits of group living.

Abstract = {Research in medicine and evolutionary biology suggests that the

   history and health. Here, we take advantage of the synchronous birth
   system of wild banded mongooses to test experimentally the lifetime
   consequences to offspring of receiving extra investment prenatally
   versus postnatally. We provided extra food to half of the breeding
   females in each group during pregnancy, leaving the other half as
   matched controls. This manipulation resulted in two categories of
   experimental offspring in synchronously born litters: (i) `prenatal
   boost' offspring whose mothers had been fed during pregnancy, and (ii)
   `postnatal boost' offspring whose mothers were not fed during pregnancy

   Prenatal boost offspring lived substantially longer as adults, but
   postnatal boost offspring had higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS)
   and higher glucocorticoid levels across the lifespan. Both types of
   experimental offspring had higher LRS than offspring from unmanipulated
   litters. We found no difference between the two experimental categories
   of offspring in adult weight, age at first reproduction, oxidative
   stress or telomere lengths. These findings are rare experimental
   evidence that prenatal and postnatal investments have distinct effects

Abstract = {Individuals and societies are linked through a feedback loop of mutual
   influence. Demographic turnover shapes group composition and structure
   by adding and removing individuals, and social inheritance shapes social
   structure through the transmission of social traits from parents to
   offspring. Here I examine how these drivers of social structure feedback
   to influence individual outcomes. I explore these society-to-individual
   effects in systems with social inheritance of hierarchy position, as
   occur in many primates and spotted hyenas. Applying Markov chain models
   to empirical and simulated data reveals how demography and social
   inheritance interact to strongly shape individual hierarchy positions.
   In hyena societies, demographic processes-not status seeking-account for
   the majority of hierarchy dynamics and cause an on-average lifetime
   decline in social hierarchy position. Simulated societies clarify how
   social inheritance alters demographic effects-demographic processes
   cause hierarchy position to regress to the mean, but the addition of
   social inheritance modifies this pattern. Notably, the combination of
   social inheritance and rank-related reproductive success causes
   individuals to decline in rank over their lifespans, as seen in the
   hyena data. Further analyses explore how `queens' escape this pattern of
   decline, and how variation in social inheritance generates variability
   in reproductive inequality.This article is part of the theme issue

Abstract = {Co-operatively breeding mammals often exhibit a female reproductive skew
   and suppression of the subordinate non-breeding group members. According
   to evolutionary theory and the immunity-fertility axis, an inverse
   relationship between reproductive investment and survival (through
   immunocompetence) is expected. As such, this study investigated if a
   trade-off between immunocompetence and reproduction arises in two
   co-operatively breeding African mole-rat species, namely the Damaraland
   mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis) and common mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus
   hottentotus), which possess female reproductive division of labour. This
   study also attempted to investigate the relationship between the immune
   and endocrine systems in Damaraland mole-rats. There was no trade-off
   between reproduction and immunocompetence in co-operatively breeding
   African mole-rat species, and in the case of the Damaraland mole-rats,
   breeding females (BFs) possessed increased immunocompetence compared
   with non-breeding females (NBFs). Furthermore, the increased levels of
   progesterone possessed by Damaraland mole-rat BFs compared with NBFs
   appear to be correlated to increased immunocompetence. In comparison, BF
   and NBF common mole-rats possess similar immunocompetence. The
   species-specific differences in the immunity-fertility axis may be due
   to variations in the strengths of reproductive suppression in each

Abstract = {Variation in food resources can result in dramatic fluctuations in the
   body condition of animals dependent on those resources. Decreases in
   body mass can disrupt patterns of energy allocation and impose stress,
   thereby altering immune function. In this study, we investigated links
   between changes in body mass of captive cane toads (Rhinella marina),
   their circulating white blood cell populations, and their performance in
   immune assays. Captive toads that lost weight over a three-month period
   had increased levels of monocytes and heterophils and reduced levels of
   eosinophils. Basophil and lymphocyte levels were unrelated to changes in
   mass. Because individuals that lost mass had higher heterophil levels
   but stable lymphocyte levels, the ratio of these cell types was also
   higher, partially consistent with a stress response. Phagocytic ability
   of whole blood was higher in toads that lost mass, owing to increased
   circulating levels of phagocytic cells. Other measures of immune
   performance were unrelated to mass change. These results highlight the
   challenges faced by invasive species as they expand their range into
   novel environments which may impose substantial seasonal changes in food
   availability that were not present in the native range. Individuals
   facing energy restrictions may shift their immune function towards more
   economical and general avenues of combating pathogens.This article is

Abstract = {Macrophage (M phi)-lineage cells are integral to the immune defences of
   all vertebrates, including amphibians. Across vertebrates, M phi
   differentiation and functionality depend on activation of the colony
   stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) receptor by CSF1 and interluekin-34 (IL34)
   cytokines. Our findings to date indicate that amphibian (Xenopus laevis)
   M phi s differentiated with CSF1 and IL34 are morphologically,
   transcriptionally and functionally distinct. Notably, mammalian M phi s
   share common progenitor population(s) with dendritic cells (DCs), which
   rely on fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) for differentiation
   while X. laevis IL34-M phi s exhibit many features attributed to
   mammalian DCs. Presently, we compared X. laevis CSF1- and IL34-M phi s
   with FLT3L-derived X. laevis DCs. Our transcriptional and functional
   analyses indicated that indeed the frog IL34-M phi s and FLT3L-DCs

Abstract = {Greater knowledge of how host-microbiome interactions vary with
   anthropogenic environmental change and influence pathogenic infections
   is needed to better understand stress-mediated disease outcomes. We
   investigated how increasing salinization in freshwaters (e.g. due to
   road de-icing salt runoff) and associated increases in growth of
   nutritional algae influenced gut bacterial assembly, host physiology and
   responses to ranavirus exposure in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica).
   Elevating salinity and supplementing a basic larval diet with algae
   increased larval growth and also increased ranavirus loads. However,
   larvae given algae did not exhibit elevated kidney corticosterone
   levels, accelerated development or weight loss post-infection, whereas
   larvae fed a basic diet did. Thus, algal supplementation reversed a
   potentially maladaptive stress response to infection observed in prior
   studies in this system. Algae supplementation also reduced gut bacterial
   diversity. Notably, we observed higher relative abundances of Firmicutes
   in treatments with algae-a pattern consistent with increased growth and
   fat deposition in mammals-that may contribute to the diminished stress
   responses to infection via regulation of host metabolism and endocrine
   function. Our study informs mechanistic hypotheses about the role of
   microbiome mediation of host responses to infection that can be tested

Abstract = {Naive multi-host communities include species that may differentially
   maintain, transmit and amplify novel pathogens; therefore, we expect
   species to fill distinct roles during infectious disease emergence.
   Characterizing these roles in wildlife communities is challenging
   because most disease emergence events are unpredictable. Here, we used
   field-collected data to investigate how species-specific attributes
   influenced the degree of exposure, probability of infection, and
   pathogen intensity, during the emergence of the fungal pathogen
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in a highly diverse tropical
   amphibian community. Our findings confirmed that ecological traits
   commonly evaluated as correlates of decline were positively associated
   with infection prevalence and intensity at the species level during the
   outbreak. We identified key hosts that disproportionally contributed to
   transmission dynamics in this community and found a signature of
   phylogenetic history in disease responses associated with increased
   pathogen exposure via shared life-history traits. Our findings establish
   a framework that could be applied in conservation efforts to identify
   key species driving disease dynamics under enzootics before
   reintroducing amphibians back into their original communities.
   Reintroductions of supersensitive hosts that are unable to overcome
   infections will limit the success of conservation programmes by
   amplifying the disease at the community level.This article is part of

Abstract = {The immune equilibrium model suggests that exposure to microbes during
   early life primes immune responses for pathogen exposure later in life.
   While recent studies using a range of gnotobiotic (germ-free) model
   organisms offer support for this theory, we currently lack a tractable
   model system for investigating the influence of the microbiome on immune
   system development. Here, we used an amphibian species (Xenopus laevis)
   to investigate the importance of the microbiome in larval development
   and susceptibility to infectious disease later in life. We found that
   experimental reductions of the microbiome during embryonic and larval
   stages effectively reduced microbial richness, diversity and altered
   community composition in tadpoles prior to metamorphosis. In addition,
   our antimicrobial treatments resulted in few negative effects on larval
   development, body condition, or survival to metamorphosis. However,
   contrary to our predictions, our antimicrobial treatments did not alter
   susceptibility to the lethal fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd) in the adult life stage. While our treatments to
   reduce the microbiome during early development did not play a critical
   role in determining susceptibility to disease caused by Bd in X. laevis,
   they nevertheless indicate that developing a gnotobiotic amphibian model

   amphibians, most immune memory is not carried through metamorphosis,
   leading to variation in the complexity of immune responses across life
   stages. To test if the ontogeny of host immunity might drive
   interactions among co-infecting parasites, we simultaneously exposed
   Cuban treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) to a fungus
   (Batrachochytrium dendrobaditis, Bd) and a nematode (Aplectana
   hamatospicula) at tadpole, metamorphic and post-metamorphic life stages.
   We measured metrics of host immunity, host health and parasite
   abundance. We predicted facilitative interactions between co-infecting
   parasites as the different immune responses hosts mount to combat these
   infectious are energetically challenging to mount simultaneously. We
   found ontogenetic differences in IgY levels and cellular immunity but no
   evidence that metamorphic frogs were more immunosuppressed than
   tadpoles. There was also little evidence that these parasites
   facilitated one another and no evidence that A. hamatospicula infection
   altered host immunity or health. However, Bd, which is known to be
   immunosuppressive, decreased immunity in metamorphic frogs. This made
   metamorphic frogs both less resistant and less tolerant of Bd infection
   than the other life stages. These findings indicate that changes in

Abstract = {With emerging diseases on the rise, there is an urgent need to identify
   and understand novel mechanisms of prophylactic protection in vertebrate
   hosts. Inducing resistance against emerging pathogens through
   prophylaxis is an ideal management strategy that may impact pathogens
   and their host-associated microbiome. The host microbiome is recognized
   as a critical component of immunity, but the effects of prophylactic
   inoculation on the microbiome are unknown. In this study, we investigate
   the effects of prophylaxis on host microbiome composition, focusing on
   the selection of anti-pathogenic microbes contributing to host acquired
   immunity in a model host-fungal disease system, amphibian
   chytridiomycosis. We inoculated larval Pseudacris regilla against the
   fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) with a Bd
   metabolite-based prophylactic. Increased prophylactic concentration and
   exposure duration were associated with significant increases in
   proportions of putatively Bd-inhibitory host-associated bacterial taxa,
   indicating a protective prophylactic-induced shift towards microbiome
   members that are antagonistic to Bd. Our findings are in accordance with
   the adaptive microbiome hypothesis, where exposure to a pathogen alters
   the microbiome to better cope with subsequent pathogen encounters. Our
   study advances research on the temporal dynamics of microbiome memory
   and the role of prophylaxis-induced shifts in microbiomes contributing

Abstract = {Testosterone (T) regulates immune function, with both immunostimulatory
   and immunosuppressive effects on several vertebrates. We investigated
   the covariation between plasma T and corticosterone (CORT) levels and
   immunity (plasma bacterial killing ability (BKA), and neutrophil to
   lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) in free-living Rhinella icterica male toads
   inside and outside the reproductive season. We found an overall positive
   correlation between steroids and immune traits, with toads during the
   reproductive season displaying increased T, CORT and BKA. We also
   investigated the T transdermal application effects on T, CORT,
   phagocytosis of blood cells, BKA and NLR in captive toads. Toads were
   treated with T (1, 10 or 100 mu g) or vehicle (sesame oil) for eight
   consecutive days. Animals were bled on the first and eighth days of
   treatment. Increased plasma T was observed on the first and last day of
   T-treatment, while increased BKA was observed following all T doses on
   the last day, with a positive correlation between T and BKA. Plasma
   CORT, NLR and phagocytosis increased on the last day for all T-treated
   and vehicle groups. Overall, we demonstrated a positive covariation
   between T and immune traits in the field and T-induced augmented BKA in
   captive toads, indicating a T immunoenhancing effect in R. icterica
   males.This article is part of the theme issue `Amphibian immunity:
   stress, disease and ecoimmunology'.},

Abstract = {Species richness is an essential biodiversity variable indicative of
   ecosystem states and rates of invasion, speciation and extinction both
   contemporarily and in fossil records. However, limited sampling effort
   and spatial aggregation of organisms mean that biodiversity surveys
   rarely observe every species in the survey area. Here we present a
   non-parametric, asymptotic and bias-minimized richness estimator, omega
   by modelling how spatial abundance characteristics affect observation of
   species richness. Improved asymptotic estimators are critical when both
   absolute richness and difference detection are important. We conduct
   simulation tests and applied omega to a tree census and a seaweed
   survey. omega consistently outperforms other estimators in balancing
   bias, precision and difference detection accuracy. However, small
   difference detection is poor with any asymptotic estimator. An
   R-package, Richness, performs the proposed richness estimations along
   with other asymptotic estimators and bootstrapped precisions. Our
   results explain how natural and observer-induced variations affect
   species observation, how these factors can be used to correct observed
   richness using the estimator omega on a variety of data, and why further
   improvements are critical for biodiversity assessments.This article is
   part of the theme issue `Detecting and attributing the causes of
   biodiversity change: needs, gaps and solutions'.},
