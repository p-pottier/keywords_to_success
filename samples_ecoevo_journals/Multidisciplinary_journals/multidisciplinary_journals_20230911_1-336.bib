Abstract = {European rabbits are exotic pests in Australia, New Zealand, parts of
   South America and Europe, and on many islands. Their abundance, and the
   damage they cause, might be reduced by the release of naturally
   occurring or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that act as
   biological control agents (BCAs). Some promising pathogens and parasites
   of European rabbits and other lagomorphs are discussed, with special
   reference to those absent from Australia as an example of the range of
   necessary considerations in any given case. The possibility of
   introducing these already-known BCAs into areas where rabbits are pests
   warrants further investigation. The most cost-effective method for
   finding potentially useful but as-yet undiscovered BCAs would be to
   maintain a global watch on new diseases and pathologies in domestic
   rabbits. The absence of wild European rabbits from climatically suitable
   parts of North and South America and southern Africa may indicate the
   presence there of useful BCAs, although other explanations for their
   absence are possible. Until the non-target risks of deploying
   disseminating GMOs to control rabbits have been satisfactorily
   minimised, efforts to introduce BCAs into exotic rabbit populations
   should focus on naturally occurring organisms. The development of safe
   disseminating GMOs remains an important long-term goal, with the
   possible use of homing endonuclease genes warranting further
   investigation.},

Title = {Assessing the current and future biological control potential of

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDUnderstanding interactions between biocontrol agents and their
   pest hosts under climate change should assist implementation of
   biocontrol strategies, by identifying appropriate biocontrol agents for
   release or determining the optimal timing of releases. Species
   distribution models (SDMs) were applied to evaluate the distributions of
   Trichogramma ostriniae and its native host, Ostrinia furnacalis, in
   southeastern Asia, and a non-native host, Ostrinia nubilalis, in a novel
   range, North America, using MAXENT and CLIMEX modelling approaches.
   RESULTSThe models led to similar predictions about the expected
   distribution of the two species in Asia, and emphasized likely
   mismatches between host and natural enemy. Trichogramma ostriniae was
   predicted to occur in the summer corn region of China, with distribution
   limits linked to its sensitivity to cold, seasonality of radiation and
   precipitation. The modelled Ostrinia nubilalis distribution overlapped
   with the main corn production areas of the northeastern USA and Canada;
   temporary/seasonal suitable habitat was also predicted across the
   southeastern USA. Climate change scenarios are predicted to favour T.
   ostriniae over its hosts in northeastern China and North America.
   CONCLUSIONThe modelling approaches used here proved useful for assessing
   environmental factors linked to an egg parasitoid and its lepidopteran
   hosts and identifying areas potentially suitable for inundative
   releases. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

Title = {Island biogeography of the Macaronesian Gesnouinia and Mediterranean
   Soleirolia (Parietarieae, Urticaceae) with implications for the
   evolution of insular woodiness},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urticaceae tribe Parietarieae serves as an excellent example to study
   hypotheses on Macaronesian-Mediterranean island biogeography.
   Parietarieae is distributed in both of these floristically closely
   related regions and contains two island endemic genera. Gesnouinia is
   endemic to Macaronesia and was considered a Tertiary relict from a
   European paleotropical vegetation. This, however, may contradict the
   general idea of insular woodiness also proposed for this genus. For the
   origin of the western Mediterranean island endemic Soleirolia, a
   vicariance scenario, i.e., the split of the Hercynian massif in southern
   Europe has been suggested. To evaluate these hypotheses and to provide a
   time frame for island and inter-island colonization, we applied
   molecular phylogenetics and dating based on two plastid and one nuclear
   DNA marker. Additionally, we performed ancestral area reconstruction,
   analyzed the anatomy of the stem and reconstructed the ancestral
   character states of woodiness. Our results indicate that Gesnouinia
   colonized Macaronesia during the Miocene via long-distance dispersal and
   may, therefore, be a Tertiary laurel forest relict. Diversification
   between the laurel forest species Gesnouinia arborea and the rupicolous
   and more xeric G. filamentosa occurred within Macaronesia during the
   Pleistocene, possibly due to climate fluctuations. Therefore, G. arborea
   is not a relict from the Tertiary. Stem anatomy suggests that although
   woodiness in Gesnouinia likely is derived, it may have evolved prior to
   island colonization. Soleirolia originated in the Mediterranean during
   the Miocene. This rules out vicariance from the split of the Hercynian
   massif in southern Europe during the Oligocene. The divergence of
   Soleirolia from Majorca, Corsica, Sardinia and the Italian mainland
   dates to the Pleistocene. This indicates long-distance dispersal as
   predominant colonization mode, not ruling out that migration between
   these areas was possibly facilitated by land bridges during the
   Pleistocene glaciation cycles.},

Title = {An oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptide modulates social foraging
   behavior in the clonal raider ant},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptides are highly conserved and play
   major roles in regulating social behavior across vertebrates. However,
   whether their insect orthologue, inotocin, regulates the behavior of
   social groups remains unknown. Here, we show that in the clonal raider
   ant Ooceraea biroi, individuals that perform tasks outside the nest have
   higher levels of inotocin in their brains than individuals of the same
   age that remain inside the nest. We also show that older ants, which
   spend more time outside the nest, have higher inotocin levels than
   younger ants. Inotocin thus correlates with the propensity to perform
   tasks outside the nest. Additionally, increasing inotocin
   pharmacologically increases the tendency of ants to leave the nest.
   However, this effect is contingent on age and social context.
   Pharmacologically treated older ants have a higher propensity to leave
   the nest only in the presence of larvae, whereas younger ants seem to do
   so only in the presence of pupae. Our results suggest that inotocin
   signaling plays an important role in modulating behaviors that correlate
   with age, such as social foraging, possibly by modulating behavioral
   response thresholds to specific social cues. Inotocin signaling thereby
   likely contributes to behavioral individuality and division of labor in
   ant societies.},

Title = {Response thresholds alone cannot explain empirical patterns of division
   of labor in social insects},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effects of heterogeneity in group composition remain a major hurdle
   to our understanding of collective behavior across disciplines. In
   social insects, division of labor (DOL) is an emergent, colony-level
   trait thought to depend on colony composition. Theoretically, behavioral
   response threshold models have most commonly been employed to
   investigate the impact of heterogeneity on DOL. However, empirical
   studies that systematically test their predictions are lacking because
   they require control over colony composition and the ability to monitor
   individual behavior in groups, both of which are challenging. Here, we
   employ automated behavioral tracking in 120 colonies of the clonal
   raider ant with unparalleled control over genetic, morphological, and
   demographic composition. We find that each of these sources of variation
   in colony composition generates a distinct pattern of behavioral
   organization, ranging from the amplification to the dampening of
   inherent behavioral differences in heterogeneous colonies. Furthermore,
   larvae modulate interactions between adults, exacerbating the apparent
   complexity. Models based on threshold variation alone only partially
   recapitulate these empirical patterns. However, by incorporating the
   potential for variability in task efficiency among adults and task
   demand among larvae, we account for all the observed phenomena. Our
   findings highlight the significance of previously overlooked parameters
   pertaining to both larvae and workers, allow the formulation of
   theoretical predictions for increasing colony complexity, and suggest
   new avenues of empirical study.},

Title = {Perception of biological motion by jumping spiders},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The body of most creatures is composed of interconnected joints. During
   motion, the spatial location of these joints changes, but they must
   maintain their distances to one another, effectively moving semirigidly.
   This pattern, termed ``biological motion{''} in the literature, can be
   used as a visual cue, enabling many animals (including humans) to
   distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Crucially, even artificially
   created scrambled stimuli, with no recognizable structure but that
   maintains semirigid movement patterns, are perceived as animated.
   However, to date, biological motion perception has only been reported in
   vertebrates. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex
   visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to
   discriminate biological from nonbiological motion using point-light
   display stimuli. These kinds of stimuli maintain motion information
   while being devoid of structure. By constraining spiders on a spherical
   treadmill, we simultaneously presented 2 point-light displays with
   specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing
   which pattern they turned toward. Spiders clearly demonstrated the
   ability to discriminate between biological motion and random stimuli,
   but curiously turned preferentially toward the latter. However, they
   showed no preference between biological and scrambled displays, results
   that match responses produced by vertebrates. Crucially, spiders turned
   toward the stimuli when these were only visible by the lateral eyes,
   evidence that this task may be eye specific. This represents the first
   demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate,
   posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability
   and complex visual processing in nonvertebrate systems.},

Title = {gen3sis: A general engine for eco-evolutionary simulations of the
   processes that shape Earth's biodiversity},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Understanding the origins of biodiversity has been an aspiration since
   the days of early naturalists. The immense complexity of ecological,
   evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive
   to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields,
   but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary
   models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially
   explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that
   enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary
   processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic
   landscapes. Modeled processes can include species' abiotic tolerances,
   biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological
   traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as alpha, beta,
   and gamma diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies,
   emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine
   alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity
   gradient (LDG) during the Earth's Cenozoic era. Our exploratory
   simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity
   patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size
   frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open
   source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of
   various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked
   with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns. This work represents
   a key toward a numeric, interdisciplinary, and mechanistic understanding
   of the physical and biological processes that shape Earth's
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Tempo and mode of morphological evolution are decoupled from latitude in
   birds},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient is one of the most striking patterns
   in nature, yet its implications for morphological evolution are poorly
   understood. In particular, it has been proposed that an increased
   intensity of species interactions in tropical biota may either promote
   or constrain trait evolution, but which of these outcomes predominates
   remains uncertain. Here, we develop tools for fitting phylogenetic
   models of phenotypic evolution in which the impact of species
   interactions-namely, competition-can vary across lineages. Deploying
   these models on a global avian trait dataset to explore differences in
   trait divergence between tropical and temperate lineages, we find that
   the effect of latitude on the mode and tempo of morphological evolution
   is weak and clade- or trait dependent. Our results indicate that species
   interactions do not disproportionately impact morphological evolution in
   tropical bird families and question the validity of previously reported
   patterns of slower trait evolution in the tropics.},

Title = {Plant pathogens convergently evolved to counteract redundant nodes of an
   NLR immune receptor network},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In plants, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat
   (NLR)-containing proteins can form receptor networks to confer
   hypersensitive cell death and innate immunity. One class of NLRs, known
   as NLR required for cell death (NRCs), are central nodes in a complex
   network that protects against multiple pathogens and comprises up to
   half of the NLRome of solanaceous plants. Given the prevalence of this
   NLR network, we hypothesised that pathogens convergently evolved to
   secrete effectors that target NRC activities. To test this, we screened
   a library of 165 bacterial, oomycete, nematode, and aphid effectors for
   their capacity to suppress the cell death response triggered by the
   NRC-dependent disease resistance proteins Prf and Rpi-blb2. Among 5 of
   the identified suppressors, 1 cyst nematode protein and 1 oomycete
   protein suppress the activity of autoimmune mutants of NRC2 and NRC3,
   but not NRC4, indicating that they specifically counteract a subset of
   NRC proteins independently of their sensor NLR partners. Whereas the
   cyst nematode effector SPRYSEC15 binds the nucleotide-binding domain of
   NRC2 and NRC3, the oomycete effector AVRcap1b suppresses the response of
   these NRCs via the membrane trafficking-associated protein NbTOL9a
   (Target of Myb 1-like protein 9a). We conclude that plant pathogens have
   evolved to counteract central nodes of the NRC immune receptor network
   through different mechanisms. Coevolution with pathogen effectors may
   have driven NRC diversification into functionally redundant nodes in a
   massively expanded NLR network.},

   vertebrates (1950 to 2019). Despite a rapid rise in data coverage,
   particularly in the last 2 decades, strong geographic and taxonomic
   biases persist. For some taxa and regions, a tremendous growth in
   records failed to directly translate into newfound knowledge due to a
   sharp decline in sampling effectiveness. However, we found that a
   nation's coverage was stronger for species for which it holds greater
   stewardship. As countries under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity
   Framework renew their commitments to an improved, rigorous biodiversity
   knowledge base, our findings highlight opportunities for international

Title = {PhyloFisher: A phylogenomic package for resolving eukaryotic
   relationships},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Phylogenomic analyses of hundreds of protein-coding genes aimed at
   resolving phylogenetic relationships is now a common practice. However,
   no software currently exists that includes tools for dataset
   construction and subsequent analysis with diverse validation strategies
   to assess robustness. Furthermore, there are no publicly available
   high-quality curated databases designed to assess deep (>100 million
   years) relationships in the tree of eukaryotes. To address these issues,
   we developed an easy-to-use software package, PhyloFisher
   (https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher), written in Python 3.
   PhyloFisher includes a manually curated database of 240 protein-coding
   genes from 304 eukaryotic taxa covering known eukaryotic diversity, a
   novel tool for ortholog selection, and utilities that will perform
   diverse analyses required by state-of-the-art phylogenomic
   investigations. Through phylogenetic reconstructions of the tree of
   eukaryotes and of the Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts, we
   demonstrate the utility of the PhyloFisher workflow and the provided
   starting database to address phylogenetic questions across a large range
   of evolutionary time points for diverse groups of organisms. We also
   demonstrate that undetected paralogy can remain in phylogenomic
   ``single-copy orthogroup{''} datasets constructed using widely accepted
   methods such as all vs. all BLAST searches followed by Markov Cluster
   Algorithm (MCL) clustering and application of automated tree pruning
   algorithms. Finally, we show how the PhyloFisher workflow helps detect
   inadvertent paralog inclusions, allowing the user to make more informed
   decisions regarding orthology assignments, leading to a more accurate
   final dataset.},

Abstract = {Insular woodiness (IW), referring to the evolutionary transition from
   herbaceousness toward woodiness on islands, has arisen more than 30
   times on the Canary Islands (Atlantic Ocean). One of the IW hypotheses
   suggests that drought has been a major driver of wood formation, but we
   do not know in which palaeoclimatic conditions the insular woody
   lineages originated. Therefore, we provided an updated review on the
   presence of IW on the Canaries, reviewed the palaeoclimate, and
   estimated the timing of origin of woodiness of 24 insular woody lineages
   that represent a large majority of the insular woody species diversity
   on the Canaries. Our single, broad-scale dating analysis shows that
   woodiness in 60\%-65\% of the insular woody lineages studied originated
   within the last 3.2 Myr, during which Mediterranean seasonality (yearly
   summer droughts) became established on the Canaries. Consequently, our
   results are consistent with palaeoclimatic aridification as a potential
   driver of woodiness in a considerable proportion of the insular woody
   Canary Island lineages. However, the observed pattern between insular
   woodiness and palaeodrought during the last couple of million years
   could potentially have emerged as a result of the typically young age of
   the native insular flora, characterized by a high turnover.},

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},

Volume = {19},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pollution from microplastics and anthropogenic fibres threatens lakes,
   but we know little about what factors predict its accumulation. Lakes
   may be especially contaminated because of long water retention times and
   proximity to pollution sources. Here, we surveyed anthropogenic
   microparticles, i.e., microplastics and anthropogenic fibres, in surface
   waters of 67 European lakes spanning 30 degrees of latitude and large
   environmental gradients. By collating data from >2,100 published net
   tows, we found that microparticle concentrations in our field survey
   were higher than previously reported in lakes and comparable to rivers
   and oceans. We then related microparticle concentrations in our field
   survey to surrounding land use, water chemistry, and plastic emissions
   to sites estimated from local hydrology, population density, and waste
   production. Microparticle concentrations in European lakes quadrupled as
   both estimated mismanaged waste inputs and wastewater treatment loads
   increased in catchments. Concentrations decreased by 2 and 5 times over
   the range of surrounding forest cover and potential in-lake
   biodegradation, respectively. As anthropogenic debris continues to
   pollute the environment, our data will help contextualise future work,
   and our models can inform control and remediation efforts.},

Title = {A phylogenomic framework for charting the diversity and evolution of
   giant viruses},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large DNA viruses of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota have recently emerged
   as important members of ecosystems around the globe that challenge
   traditional views of viral complexity. Numerous members of this phylum
   that cannot be classified within established families have recently been
   reported, and there is presently a strong need for a robust phylogenomic
   and taxonomic framework for these viruses. Here, we report a
   comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of the Nucleocytoviricota, present a
   set of giant virus orthologous groups (GVOGs) together with a
   benchmarked reference phylogeny, and delineate a hierarchical taxonomy
   within this phylum. We show that the majority of Nucleocytoviricota
   diversity can be partitioned into 6 orders, 32 families, and 344 genera,
   substantially expanding the number of currently recognized taxonomic
   ranks for these viruses. We integrate our results within a taxonomy that
   has been adopted for all viruses to establish a unifying framework for
   the study of Nucleocytoviricota diversity, evolution, and environmental
   distribution.</p>},

Title = {Rapid increase in snake dietary diversity and complexity following the
   end-Cretaceous mass extinction},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Cenozoic marked a period of dramatic ecological opportunity in Earth
   history due to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs as well as to
   long-term physiographic changes that created new biogeographic theaters
   and new habitats. Snakes underwent massive ecological diversification
   during this period, repeatedly evolving novel dietary adaptations and
   prey preferences. The evolutionary tempo and mode of these trophic
   ecological changes remain virtually unknown, especially compared with
   co-radiating lineages of birds and mammals that are simultaneously
   predators and prey of snakes. Here, we assemble a dataset on snake diets
   (34,060 observations on the diets of 882 species) to investigate the
   history and dynamics of the multidimensional trophic niche during the
   global radiation of snakes. Our results show that per-lineage dietary
   niche breadths remained remarkably constant even as snakes diversified
   to occupy disparate outposts of dietary ecospace. Rapid increases in
   dietary diversity and complexity occurred in the early Cenozoic, and the
   overall rate of ecospace expansion has slowed through time, suggesting a
   potential response to ecological opportunity in the wake of the
   end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Explosive bursts of trophic innovation
   followed colonization of the Nearctic and Neotropical realms by a group
   of snakes that today comprises a majority of living snake diversity. Our
   results indicate that repeated transformational shifts in dietary
   ecology are important drivers of adaptive radiation in snakes and
   provide a framework for analyzing and visualizing the evolution of
   complex ecological phenotypes on phylogenetic trees.</p>},

Title = {Tapping into non-English-language science for the conservation of global
   biodiversity},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The widely held assumption that any important scientific information
   would be available in English underlies the underuse of
   non-English-language science across disciplines. However,
   non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable
   scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is
   patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is
   an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language
   science to scientific communities and the application of science is
   rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies
   provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation.
   By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified
   1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the
   effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to
   4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria.
   Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an
   increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a
   sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating
   non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e.,
   the number of 2 degrees x 2 degrees grid cells with relevant studies) of
   English-language evidence by 12\% to 25\%, especially in biodiverse
   regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by
   the relevant studies) by 5\% to 32\%, although they do tend to be based
   on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising
   non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of
   local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based
   conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess
   the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing
   decisions to address other global challenges.</p>

Abstract = {The archaeal tailed viruses (arTV), evolutionarily related to tailed
   double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages of the class Caudoviricetes,
   represent the most common isolates infecting halophilic archaea. Only a
   handful of these viruses have been genomically characterized, limiting
   our appreciation of their ecological impacts and evolution. Here, we
   present 37 new genomes of haloarchaeal tailed virus isolates, more than
   doubling the current number of sequenced arTVs. Analysis of all 63
   available complete genomes of arTVs, which we propose to classify into
   14 new families and 3 orders, suggests ancient divergence of archaeal
   and bacterial tailed viruses and points to an extensive sharing of genes
   involved in DNA metabolism and counter defense mechanisms, illuminating
   common strategies of virus-host interactions with tailed bacteriophages.
   Coupling of the comparative genomics with the host range analysis on a
   broad panel of haloarchaeal species uncovered 4 distinct groups of viral
   tail fiber adhesins controlling the host range expansion. The survey of
   metagenomes using viral hallmark genes suggests that the global
   architecture of the arTV community is shaped through recurrent transfers
   between different biomes, including hypersaline, marine, and anoxic
   environments.},

Abstract = {A vast range of research applications in biodiversity sciences requires
   integrating primary species, genetic, or ecosystem data with other
   environmental data. This integration requires a consideration of the
   spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the data and processes in
   question. But a versatile and scale flexible environmental annotation of
   biodiversity data remains constrained by technical hurdles. Existing
   tools have streamlined the intersection of occurrence records with
   gridded environmental data but have remained limited in their ability to
   address a range of spatial and temporal grains, especially for large
   datasets. We present the Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool
   (STOAT), a cloud-based toolbox for flexible biodiversity-environment
   annotations. STOAT is optimized for large biodiversity datasets and
   allows user-specified spatial and temporal resolution and buffering in
   support of environmental characterizations that account for the
   uncertainty and scale of data and of relevant processes. The tool offers
   these services for a growing set of near global, remotely sensed, or
   modeled environmental data, including Landsat, MODIS, EarthEnv, and
   CHELSA. STOAT includes a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that
   provides tools for annotation task management and result visualization,
   linked to Map of Life, and a dedicated R package (rstoat) for
   programmatic access. We demonstrate STOAT functionality with several
   examples that illustrate phenological variation and spatial and temporal
   scale dependence of environmental characteristics of birds at a
   continental scale. We expect STOAT to facilitate broader exploration and
   assessment of the scale dependence of observations and processes in
   ecology.},

Title = {Spatial subsidies drive sweet spots of tropical marine biomass
   production},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Spatial subsidies increase local productivity and boost consumer
   abundance beyond the limits imposed by local resources. In marine
   ecosystems, deeper water and open ocean subsidies promote animal
   aggregations and enhance biomass that is critical for human harvesting.
   However, the scale of this phenomenon in tropical marine systems remains
   unknown. Here, we integrate a detailed assessment of biomass production
   in 3 key locations, spanning a major biodiversity and abundance
   gradient, with an ocean-scale dataset of fish counts to predict the
   extent and magnitude of plankton subsidies to fishes on coral reefs. We
   show that planktivorous fish-mediated spatial subsidies are widespread
   across the Indian and Pacific oceans and drive local spikes in biomass
   production that can lead to extreme productivity, up to 30 kg ha(-1)
   day(-1). Plankton subsidies form the basis of productivity ``sweet
   spots{''} where planktivores provide more than 50\% of the total fish
   production, more than all other trophic groups combined. These sweet
   spots operate at regional, site, and smaller local scales. By harvesting
   oceanic productivity, planktivores bypass spatial constraints imposed by
   local primary productivity, creating ``oases{''} of tropical fish
   biomass that are accessible to humans.},

Title = {Fitness costs of female choosiness are low in a socially monogamous
   songbird},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Female mate choice is thought to be responsible for the evolution of
   many extravagant male ornaments and displays, but the costs of being too
   selective may hinder the evolution of choosiness. Selection against
   choosiness may be particularly strong in socially monogamous mating
   systems, because females may end up without a partner and forego
   reproduction, especially when many females prefer the same few partners
   (frequency-dependent selection). Here, we quantify the fitness costs of
   having mating preferences that are difficult to satisfy, by manipulating
   the availability of preferred males. We capitalize on the recent
   discovery that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males
   of familiar song dialect. We measured female fitness in captive breeding
   colonies in which one-third of females were given ample opportunity to
   choose a mate of their preferred dialect (two-thirds of all males;
   ``relaxed competition{''}), while two-thirds of the females had to
   compete over a limited pool of mates they preferred (one-third of all
   males; ``high competition{''}). As expected, social pairings were
   strongly assortative with regard to song dialect. In the
   high-competition group, 26\% of the females remained unpaired, yet they
   still obtained relatively high fitness by using brood parasitism as an
   alternative reproductive tactic. Another 31\% of high-competition
   females paired disassortatively for song dialect. These females showed
   increased levels of extra-pair paternity, mostly with same-dialect males
   as sires, suggesting that preferences were not abolished after social
   pairing. However, females that paired disassortatively for song dialect
   did not have lower reproductive success. Overall, females in the
   high-competition group reached equal fitness to those that experienced
   relaxed competition. Our study suggests that alternative reproductive
   tactics such as egg dumping can help overcome the frequency-dependent
   costs of being selective in a monogamous mating system, thereby
   facilitating the evolution of female choosiness.</p>},

Title = {Evolutionary pathways to SARS-CoV-2 resistance are opened and closed by
   epistasis acting on ACE2},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects a
   broader range of mammalian species than previously predicted, binding a
   diversity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologs despite
   extensive sequence divergence. Within this sequence degeneracy, we
   identify a rare sequence combination capable of conferring SARS-CoV-2
   resistance. We demonstrate that this sequence was likely unattainable
   during human evolution due to deleterious effects on ACE2
   carboxypeptidase activity, which has vasodilatory and cardioprotective
   functions in vivo. Across the 25 ACE2 sites implicated in viral binding,
   we identify 6 amino acid substitutions unique to mouse-one of the only
   known mammalian species resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Substituting human
   variants at these positions is sufficient to confer binding of the
   SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mouse ACE2, facilitating cellular infection.
   Conversely, substituting mouse variants into either human or dog ACE2
   abolishes viral binding, diminishing cellular infection. However, these
   same substitutions decrease human ACE2 activity by 50\% and are
   predicted as pathogenic, consistent with the extreme rarity of human
   polymorphisms at these sites. This trade-off can be avoided, however,
   depending on genetic background; if substituted simultaneously, these
   same mutations have no deleterious effect on dog ACE2 nor that of the
   rodent ancestor estimated to exist 70 million years ago. This genetic
   contingency (epistasis) may have therefore opened the road to resistance
   for some species, while making humans susceptible to viruses that use
   these ACE2 surfaces for binding, as does SARS-CoV-2.},

Abstract = {Solanum mauritianum Scop. (Solanaceae), colloquially referred to as
   bugweed in South Africa, remains a widespread invasive tree of global
   significance. Although biological control (biocontrol) efforts were
   undertaken from 1984 -2003 in South Africa, the programme eventually
   only released two agents, the sap-sucking lace bug Gargaphia decoris
   Drake (Hemiptera: Tingidae) and flowerbud-feeding weevil Anthonomus
   santacruzi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). To date, these agents
   have been relatively ineffective in controlling S. mauritianum, largely
   due to low establishment success due to climatic incompatibility in
   relation to the widespread distribution of S. mauritianum. This has
   prompted the revival of S. mauritianum biocontrol research in 2018, with
   the programme focused largely on sourcing additional agents from
   climatically suitable regions in the plant's native range in South
   America. Climate matching between cooler regions of South Africa and
   known S. mauritianum sites in South America identified Uruguay as a
   promising source of new agents. Field collections in Uruguay focused
   mainly on Anthonomus spp. but included stem-boring and shoot-galling
   weevils. Low incidence in the field and difficulties in culturing
   candidate species temporarily precluded research into stem-boring and
   shoot-galling candidates, but the rearing and assessment of the
   flowerbud-feeding weevil Anthonomus morticinus Clark (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) is ongoing. Host-specificity testing of A. morticinus has
   thus far confirmed a narrow host range, suggesting it has potential as a
   new agent.},

Title = {Directed evolution of the rRNA methylating enzyme Cfr reveals molecular
   basis of antibiotic resistance},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {eLife digest Antibiotics treat or prevent infections by killing bacteria
   or slowing down their growth. A large proportion of these drugs do this
   by disrupting an essential piece of cellular machinery called the
   ribosome which the bacteria need to make proteins. However, over the
   course of the treatment, some bacteria may gain genetic alterations that
   allow them to resist the effects of the antibiotic. Antibiotic
   resistance is a major threat to global health, and understanding how it
   emerges and spreads is an important area of research. Recent studies
   have discovered populations of resistant bacteria carrying a gene for a
   protein named chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance, or Cfr for short.
   Cfr inserts a small modification in to the ribosome that prevents
   antibiotics from inhibiting the production of proteins, making them
   ineffective against the infection. To date, Cfr has been found to cause
   resistance to eight different classes of antibiotics. Identifying which
   mutations enhance its activity and protect bacteria is vital for
   designing strategies that fight antibiotic resistance. To investigate
   how the gene for Cfr could mutate and make bacteria more resistant, Tsai
   et al. performed a laboratory technique called directed evolution, a
   cyclic process which mimics natural selection. Genetic changes were
   randomly introduced in the gene for the Cfr protein and bacteria
   carrying these mutations were treated with tiamulin, an antibiotic
   rendered ineffective by the modification Cfr introduces into the
   ribosome. Bacteria that survived were then selected and had more
   mutations inserted. By repeating this process several times, Tsai et al.
   identified `super' variants of the Cfr protein that lead to greater
   resistance. The experiments showed that these variants boosted
   resistance by increasing the proportion of ribosomes that contained the
   protective modification. This process was facilitated by mutations that
   enabled higher levels of Cfr protein to accumulate in the cell. In
   addition, the current study allowed, for the first time, direct
   visualization of how the Cfr modification disrupts the effect
   antibiotics have on the ribosome. These findings will make it easier for
   clinics to look out for bacteria that carry these `super' resistant
   mutations. They could also help researchers design a new generation of
   antibiotics that can overcome resistance caused by the Cfr protein.
   Alteration of antibiotic binding sites through modification of ribosomal
   RNA (rRNA) is a common form of resistance to ribosome-targeting
   antibiotics. The rRNA-modifying enzyme Cfr methylates an adenosine
   nucleotide within the peptidyl transferase center, resulting in the C-8
   methylation of A2503 (m(8)A2503). Acquisition of cfr results in
   resistance to eight classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Despite
   the prevalence of this resistance mechanism, it is poorly understood
   whether and how bacteria modulate Cfr methylation to adapt to antibiotic
   pressure. Moreover, direct evidence for how m(8)A2503 alters antibiotic
   binding sites within the ribosome is lacking. In this study, we
   performed directed evolution of Cfr under antibiotic selection to
   generate Cfr variants that confer increased resistance by enhancing
   methylation of A2503 in cells. Increased rRNA methylation is achieved by
   improved expression and stability of Cfr through transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional mechanisms, which may be exploited by pathogens
   under antibiotic stress as suggested by natural isolates. Using a
   variant that achieves near-stoichiometric methylation of rRNA, we
   determined a 2.2 angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of the
   Cfr-modified ribosome. Our structure reveals the molecular basis for
   broad resistance to antibiotics and will inform the design of new
   antibiotics that overcome resistance mediated by Cfr.},

Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {What is the origin of behaviour? Although typically associated with a
   nervous system, simple organisms also show complex behaviours. Among
   them, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, a giant single cell, is
   ideally suited to study emergence of behaviour. Here, we show how
   locomotion and morphological adaptation behaviour emerge from
   self-organized patterns of rhythmic contractions of the actomyosin
   lining of the tubes making up the network-shaped organism. We quantify
   the spatio-temporal contraction dynamics by decomposing experimentally
   recorded contraction patterns into spatial contraction modes. Notably,
   we find a continuous spectrum of modes, as opposed to a few dominant
   modes. Our data suggests that the continuous spectrum of modes allows
   for dynamic transitions between a plethora of specific behaviours with
   transitions marked by highly irregular contraction states. By mapping
   specific behaviours to states of active contractions, we provide the
   basis to understand behaviour's complexity as a function of
   biomechanical dynamics.},

Title = {Environmental selection overturns the decay relationship of soil
   prokaryotic community over geographic distance across grassland biotas},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Though being fundamental to global diversity distribution, little is
   known about the geographic pattern of soil microorganisms across
   different biotas on a large scale. Here, we investigated soil
   prokaryotic communities from Chinese northern grasslands on a scale up
   to 4000 km in both alpine and temperate biotas. Prokaryotic similarities
   increased over geographic distance after tipping points of 1760-1920 km,
   generating a significant U-shape pattern. Such pattern was likely due to
   decreased disparities in environmental heterogeneity over geographic
   distance when across biotas, supported by three lines of evidences: (1)
   prokaryotic similarities still decreased with the environmental
   distance, (2) environmental selection dominated prokaryotic assembly,
   and (3) short-term environmental heterogeneity followed the U-shape
   pattern spatially, especially attributed to dissolved nutrients. In sum,
   these results demonstrate that environmental selection overwhelmed the
   geographic `distance' effect when across biotas, overturning the
   previously well-accepted geographic pattern for microbes on a large
   scale.},

Abstract = {Efference copies are neural replicas of motor outputs used to anticipate
   the sensory consequences of a selfgenerated motor action or to
   coordinate neural networks involved in distinct motor behaviors.(1) An
   established example of this motor-to-motor coupling is the efference
   copy of the propulsive motor command, which supplements classical
   visuo-vestibular reflexes to ensure gaze stabilization during amphibian
   larval locomotion.(2) Such feedforward replica of spinal
   pattern-generating circuits produces a spino-extraocular motor coupled
   activity that evokes eye movements, spatiotemporally coordinated to tail
   undulation independently of any sensory signal.(3,4) Exploiting the
   developmental stages of the frog,(1) studies in metamorphing Xenopus
   demonstrated the persistence of this spino-extraocular motor command in
   adults and its developmental adaptation to tetrapodal locomotion.(5,6)
   Here, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of a comparable
   locomotor-to-ocular motor coupling in the mouse. In neonates, ex vivo
   nerve recordings of brain-stem-spinal cord preparations reveal a
   spino-extraocular motor coupled activity similar to the one described in
   Xenopus. In adult mice, trans-synaptic rabies virus injections in
   lateral rectus eye muscle label cervical spinal cord neurons closely
   connected to abducens motor neurons. Finally, treadmill-elicited
   locomotion in decerebrated preparations(7) evokes rhythmic eye movements
   in synchrony with the limb gait pattern. Overall, our data are evidence
   for the conservation of locomotor-induced eye movements in vertebrate
   lineages. Thus, in mammals as in amphibians, CPG-efference copy
   feedforward signals might interact with sensory feedback to ensure
   efficient gaze control during locomotion.},

Title = {Further evidence for the capacity of mirror self-recognition in cleaner
   fish and the significance of ecologically relevant marks},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An animal that tries to remove a mark from its body that is only visible
   when looking into a mirror displays the capacity for mirror
   self-recognition (MSR), which has been interpreted as evidence for
   self-awareness. Conservative interpretations of existing data conclude
   that convincing evidence for MSR is currently restricted to great apes.
   Here, we address proposed shortcomings of a previous study on MSR in the
   cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus, by varying preexposure to mirrors
   and by marking individuals with different colors. We found that (1)
   14/14 new individuals scraped their throat when a brown mark had been
   provisioned, but only in the presence of a mirror; (2) blue and green
   color marks did not elicit scraping; (3) intentionally injecting the
   mark deeper beneath the skin reliably elicited spontaneous scraping in
   the absence of a mirror; (4) mirror-naive individuals injected with a
   brown mark scraped their throat with lower probability and/or lower
   frequency compared to mirror-experienced individuals; (5) in contrast to
   the mirror images, seeing another fish with the same marking did not
   induce throat scraping; and (6) moving the mirror to another location
   did not elicit renewed aggression in mirror-experienced individuals.
   Taken together, these results increase our confidence that cleaner fish
   indeed pass the mark test, although only if it is presented in
   ecologically relevant contexts. Therefore, we reiterate the conclusion
   of the previous study that either self-awareness in animals or the
   validity of the mirror test needs to be revised.},

Title = {Meta-analysis reveals an extreme ``decline effect{''} in the impacts of
   ocean acidification on fish behavior},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification-decreasing oceanic pH resulting from the uptake of
   excess atmospheric CO2-has the potential to affect marine life in the
   future. Among the possible consequences, a series of studies on coral
   reef fish suggested that the direct effects of acidification on fish
   behavior may be extreme and have broad ecological ramifications. Recent
   studies documenting a lack of effect of experimental ocean acidification
   on fish behavior, however, call this prediction into question. Indeed,
   the phenomenon of decreasing effect sizes over time is not uncommon and
   is typically referred to as the ``decline effect.{''} Here, we explore
   the consistency and robustness of scientific evidence over the past
   decade regarding direct effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior.
   Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of 91 studies empirically
   testing effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior, we provide
   quantitative evidence that the research to date on this topic is
   characterized by a decline effect, where large effects in initial
   studies have all but disappeared in subsequent studies over a decade.
   The decline effect in this field cannot be explained by 3 likely
   biological explanations, including increasing proportions of studies
   examining (1) cold-water species; (2) nonolfactory-associated behaviors;
   and (3) nonlarval life stages. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies
   with large effect sizes in this field tend to be characterized by low
   sample sizes, yet are published in high-impact journals and have a
   disproportionate influence on the field in terms of citations. We
   contend that ocean acidification has a negligible direct impact on fish
   behavior, and we advocate for improved approaches to minimize the
   potential for a decline effect in future avenues of research.},

Title = {Macroevolutionary trends in theropod dinosaur feeding mechanics},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {677+},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Theropod dinosaurs underwent some of the most remarkable dietary changes
   in vertebrate evolutionary history, shifting from ancestral
   carnivory(1-3) to hypercarnivory(4,5) and omnivory/herbivory,(6-9) with
   some taxa eventually reverting to carnivory.(10-12) The mandible is an
   important tool for food acquisition in vertebrates and reflects
   adaptations to feeding modes and diets.(13,14) The morphofunctional
   modifications accompanying the dietary changes in theropod dinosaurs are
   not well understood because most of the previous studies focused solely
   on the cranium and/or were phylogenetically limited in scope,(12,15-21)
   while studies that include multiple clades are usually based on linear
   measurements and/or discrete osteological characters.(8,22) Given the
   potential relationship between macroevolutionary change and ontogenetic
   pattern,(23) we explore whether functional morphological patterns
   observed in theropod mandibular evolution show similarities to the
   ontogenetic trajectory. Here, we use finite element analysis to study
   the mandibles of non-avialan coelurosaurian theropods and demonstrate
   how feeding mechanics vary between dietary groups and major clades. We
   reveal an overall reduction in feeding-induced stresses along all
   theropod lineages through time. This is facilitated by a post-dentary
   expansion and the development of a downturned dentary in herbivores and
   an upturned dentary in carnivores likely via the ``curved bone
   effect.{''}We also observed the same reduction in feeding-induced stress
   in an ontogenetic series of jaws of the tyrannosaurids Tarbosaurus and
   Tyrannosaurus , which is best attributed to bone functional adaptation.
   This suggests that this common tendency for structural strengthening of
   the theropod mandible through time, irrespective of diet, is linked to
   ``functional peramorphosis{''}of bone functional adaptations acquired
   during ontogeny.},

Title = {Inflammation and convergent placenta gene co-option contributed to a

Abstract = {The evolution of pregnancy exposes parental tissues to new, potentially
   stressful conditions, which can trigger inflammation.(1) Inflammation is
   costly(2,3) and can induce embryo rejection, which constrains the
   evolution of pregnancy.(1) In contrast, inflammation can also promote
   morphological innovation at the maternal embryonic interface as
   exemplified by co-option of pro-inflammatory signaling for eutherian
   embryo implantation.(1,4,5) Given its dual function, inflammation could
   be a key process explaining how innovations such as pregnancy and
   placentation evolved many times convergently. Pelvic brooding ricefishes
   evolved a novel ``plug{''}tissue,(6,7) which forms inside the female
   gonoduct after spawning, anchors egg-attaching filaments, and enables
   pelvic brooders to carry eggs externally until hatching.(6,8) Compared
   to pregnancy, i.e., internal bearing of embryos, external bearing should
   alleviate constraints on inflammation in the reproductive tract. We thus
   hypothesized that an ancestral inflammation triggered by the retention
   of attaching filaments gave rise to pathways orchestrating plug
   formation. In line with our hypothesis, histological sections of the
   developing plug revealed signs of gonoduct injuries by egg-attaching
   filaments in the pelvic brooding ricefish Oryzias eversi.
   Tissue-specific transcriptomes showed that inflammatory signaling
   dominates the plug transcriptome and inflammation-induced genes
   controlling vital processes for plug development such as tissue growth
   and angiogenesis were overexpressed in the plug. Finally, mammalian
   placenta genes were enriched in the plug transcriptome, indicating
   convergent gene co-option for building, attaching, and sustaining a
   transient tissue in the female reproductive tract. This study highlights
   the role of gene co-option and suggests that recruiting inflammatory
   signaling into physiological processes provides a fast-track to
   evolutionary innovation.},

Title = {Evolution of sexual conflict in scorpionflies},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Sexual conflict - opposite reproductive/genetic interests between sexes
   - can be a significant driver of insect evolution. Scorpionflies
   (Insecta: Mecoptera) are models in sexual conflict research due to their
   large variety of mating practices, including coercive behaviour and
   nuptial gift provisioning. However, the role of palaeontology in sexual
   conflict studies remains negligible, namely due to the paucity of
   well-preserved fossils. Here, we describe three male scorpionflies from
   Cretaceous and Eocene ambers. The structure of notal and postnotal
   organs is analysed in extant and extinct forms; a depression below the
   base of the notal organ in different panorpid species spatially matches
   the anterior fold of the female's wing. Based on disparate abdominal
   configurations and correlations in extant relatives, we posit that each
   new fossil taxon had a different mating approach along a nuptial
   gifting-coercive spectrum. The Eocene specimen possesses extreme female
   clamping abdominal armature, suggesting a degree of sexual coercion
   greater than in any other known scorpionfly, extinct or extant. The
   fossil record of abdominal modifications in male scorpionflies documents
   a relatively late evolution (Eocene) of long notal organs indicating
   oppressive behaviour toward a female during mating. Our findings reveal
   a wider array of mating-related morphological specialisations among
   extinct Panorpoidea, likely reflecting more diversified past mating
   strategies and behaviours in this group, and represent first steps
   towards gaining a deep-time perspective on the evolution of sexual
   conflict over mating among insects.},

Abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the most variable-sized
   mammalian species on Earth, displaying a 40-fold size difference between
   breeds.(1) Although dogs of variable size are found in the archeological
   record,(2-4) the most dramatic shifts in body size are the result of
   selection over the last two centuries, as dog breeders selected and
   propagated phenotypic extremes within closed breeding populations.(5)
   Analyses of over 200 domestic breeds have identified approximately 20
   body size genes regulating insulin processing, fatty acid metabolism,
   TGF beta signaling, and skeletal formation.(6-10) Of these, insulin-like
   growth factor 1 (IGF1) predominates, controlling approximately 15\% of
   body size variation between breeds.(8) The identification of a
   functional mutation associated with IGF1 has thus far proven
   elusive.(6,10,11) Here, to identify and elucidate the role of an
   ancestral IGF1 allele in the propagation of modern canids, we analyzed
   1,431 genome sequences from 13 species, including both ancient and modem
   canids, thus allowing us to define the evolutionary history of both
   ancestral and derived alleles at this locus. We identified a single
   variant in an antisense long non-coding RNA (IGF1-AS) that interacts
   with the IGF1 gene, creating a duplex. While the derived mutation
   predominates in both modern gray wolves and large domestic breeds, the
   ancestral allele, which predisposes to small size, was common in
   small-sized breeds and smaller wild canids. Our analyses demonstrate
   that this major regulator of canid body size nearly vanished in
   Pleistocene wolves, before its recent resurgence resulting from
   human-imposed selection for small-sized breed dogs.},

Abstract = {A breeding colony of notothenioid icefish (Neopagetopsis ionah, Nybelin
   1947) of globally unprecedented extent has been discovered in the
   southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The colony was estimated to cover at
   least similar to 240 km(2) of the eastern flank of the Filchner Trough,
   comprised of fish nests at a density of 0.26 nests per square meter,
   representing an estimated total of -60 million active nests and
   associated fish biomass of >60,000 tonnes. The majority of nests were
   each occupied by 1 adult fish guarding 1,735 eggs (+/- 433 SD). Bottom
   water temperatures measured across the nesting colony were up to 2
   degrees C warmer than the surrounding bottom waters, indicating a
   spatial correlation between the modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) upflow
   onto the Weddell Shelf and the active nesting area. Historical and
   concurrently collected seal movement data indicate that this
   concentrated fish biomass may be utilized by predators such as Weddell
   seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Lesson 1826). Numerous degraded fish
   carcasses within and near the nesting colony suggest that, in death as
   well as life, these fish provide input for local food webs and influence
   local biogeochemical processing. To our knowledge, the area surveyed
   harbors the most spatially expansive continuous fish breeding colony
   discovered to date globally at any depth, as well as an exceptionally
   high Antarctic seafloor biomass. This discovery provides support for the
   establishment of a regional marine protected area in the Southern Ocean
   under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
   Resources (CCAMLR) umbrella.},

Title = {Behavioral signatures of structured feature detection during courtship
   in Drosophila},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1211+},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Many animals detect other individuals effortlessly. In Drosophila,
   previous studies have examined sensory processing during social
   interactions using simple blobs as visual stimulation; however, whether
   and how flies extract higher-order features from conspecifics to guide
   behavior remains elusive. Arguing that this should be reflected in
   sensorimotor relations, we developed unbiased machine learning tools for
   natural behavior quantification and applied these tools, which may prove
   broadly useful, to study interacting pairs. By transforming motor
   patterns with female-centered reference frames, we established circling,
   where heading and traveling directions intersect, as a unique pattern of
   social interaction during courtship. We found circling to be highly
   visual, with males exhibiting view-tuned motor patterns. Interestingly,
   males select specific wing and leg actions based on the positions and
   motions of the females' heads and tails. Using system identification, we
   derived visuomotor transformation functions indicating history-dependent
   action selection, with distance predicting action initiation and angular
   position predicting wing choices and locomotion directions. Integration
   of vision with somatosensation further boosts these sensorimotor
   relations. Essentially comprised of orchestrated wing and leg maneuvers
   that are more variable in the light, circling induces mutually
   synchronized conspecific responses stronger than wing extension alone.
   Finally, we found that actions depend on integrating spatiotemporally
   structured features with goals. Altogether, we identified a series of
   sensorimotor relations during circling, implying that during courtship,
   flies detect complex spatiotemporally structured features of
   conspecifics, laying the foundation for a mechanistic understanding of
   conspecific recognition in Drosophila.},

Title = {Mammals adjust diel activity across gradients of urbanization},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Time is a fundamental component of ecological processes. How animal
   behavior changes over time has been explored through well-known
   ecological theories like niche partitioning and predator-prey dynamics.
   Yet, changes in animal behavior within the shorter 24-hr light-dark
   cycle have largely gone unstudied. Understanding if an animal can adjust
   their temporal activity to mitigate or adapt to environmental change has
   become a recent topic of discussion and is important for effective
   wildlife management and conservation. While spatial habitat is a
   fundamental consideration in wildlife management and conservation,
   temporal habitat is often ignored. We formulated a temporal resource
   selection model to quantify the diel behavior of 8 mammal species across
   10 US cities. We found high variability in diel activity patterns within
   and among species and species-specific correlations between diel
   activity and human population density, impervious land cover, available
   greenspace, vegetation cover, and mean daily temperature. We also found
   that some species may modulate temporal behaviors to manage both natural
   and anthropogenic risks. Our results highlight the complexity with which
   temporal activity patterns interact with local environmental
   characteristics, and suggest that urban mammals may use time along the
   24-hr cycle to reduce risk, adapt, and therefore persist, and in some
   cases thrive, in human-dominated ecosystems.},

Title = {An Archaea-specific c-type cytochrome maturation machinery is crucial
   for methanogenesis in Methanosarcina acetivorans},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {c-Type cytochromes (cyt c) are proteins that undergo post-translational
   modification to covalently bind heme, which allows them to facilitate
   redox reactions in electron transport chains across all domains of life.
   Genomic evidence suggests that cyt c are involved in electron transfer
   processes among the Archaea, especially in members that produce or
   consume the potent greenhouse gas methane. However, neither the
   maturation machinery for cyt c in Archaea nor their role in methane
   metabolism has ever been functionally characterized. Here, we have used
   CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools to map a distinct pathway for cyt c
   biogenesis in the model methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina
   acetivorans, and have also identified substrate-specific functional
   roles for cyt c during methanogenesis. Although the cyt c maturation
   machinery from M. acetivorans is universally conserved in the Archaea,
   our evolutionary analyses indicate that different clades of Archaea
   acquired this machinery through multiple independent horizontal gene
   transfer events from different groups of Bacteria. Overall, we
   demonstrate the convergent evolution of a novel Archaea-specific cyt c
   maturation machinery and its physiological role during methanogenesis, a
   process which contributes substantially to global methane emissions.},

Title = {Late-life fitness gains and reproductive death in Cardiocondyla
   obscurior ants},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {A key hypothesis for the occurrence of senescence is the decrease in
   selection strength due to the decrease in the proportion of newborns
   from parents attaining an advanced age - the so-called selection shadow.
   Strikingly, queens of social insects have long lifespans and
   reproductive senescence seems to be negligible. By lifelong tracking of
   99 Cardiocondyla obscurior (Formicidae: Myrmicinae) ant colonies, we
   find that queens shift to the production of sexuals in late life
   regardless of their absolute lifespan or the number of workers present.
   Furthermore, RNAseq analyses of old queens past their peak of
   reproductive performance showed the development of massive pathology
   while queens were still fertile, leading to rapid death. We conclude
   that the evolution of superorganismality is accompanied by
   `continuusparity,' a life history strategy that is distinct from other
   iteroparous and semelparous strategies across the tree of life, in that
   it combines continuous reproduction with a fitness peak late in life.},

Title = {Ambitious global targets for mangrove and seagrass recovery},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},

Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {There is an urgent need to halt and reverse loss of mangroves and
   seagrass to protect and increase the ecosystem services they provide to
   coastal communities, such as enhancing coastal resilience and
   contributing to climate stability. Ambitious targets for their recovery
   can inspire public and private investment in conservation, 3 but the
   expected outcomes of different protection and restoration strategies are
   unclear. We estimated potential recovery of mangroves and seagrass
   through gains in ecosystem extent to the year 2070 under a range of
   protection and restoration strategies implemented until the year 2050.
   Under a protectiononly scenario, the current trajectories of net
   mangrove loss slowed, and a minor net gain in global seagrass extent
   (similar to 1\%) was estimated. Protection alone is therefore unlikely
   to drive sufficient recovery. However, if action is taken to both
   protect and restore, net gains of up to 5\% and 35\% of mangroves and
   seagrasses, respectively, could be achieved by 2050. Further, protection
   and restoration can be complementary, as protection prevents losses that
   would otherwise occur post-2050, highlighting the importance of
   implementing protection measures. Our findings provide the scientific
   evidence required for setting strategic and ambitious targets to inspire
   significant global investment and effort in mangrove and seagrass
   conservation.},

Abstract = {Understanding determinants of differential reproductive success is at
   the core of evolutionary biology because of its connection to fitness.
   Early work has linked variation in reproductive success to differences
   in age,(1) rank,(2) or size,(3)'(4) as well as habitat characteristics.
   5 More recently, studies in group-living taxa have revealed that social
   relationships also have measurable effects on fitness.(6-8) The
   influence of social bonds on fitness is particularly interesting in
   males who compete over reproductive opportunities. In Shark Bay, Western
   Australia, groups of 4-14 unrelated male bottlenose dolphins cooperate
   in second-order alliances to compete with rival alliances over access to
   females.(9-12) Nested within second-order alliances, pairs or trios of
   males, which can vary in composition, form first-order alliances to herd
   estrus females. Using 30 years of behavioral data, we examined how
   individual social factors, such as first-order alliance stability,
   social connectivity, and variation in social bond strength within
   second-order alliances, affect male fitness. Analyzing the reproductive
   careers of 85 males belonging to 10 second-order alliances, we found
   that the number of paternities a male achieved was positively correlated
   with his cumulative social bond strength but negatively correlated with
   his variation in bond strength. Thus, well-integrated males with more
   homogeneous social bonds to second-order allies obtained most
   paternities. Our findings provide novel insights into the fitness
   benefits of polyadic cooperation among unrelated males and highlight the
   adaptive value of social bonds in this context.},

Title = {The origins of the killer whale ecomorph},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1843+},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {The killer whale (Orcinus orca) and false killer whale (Pseudorca
   crassidens) are the only extant cetaceans that hunt other marine
   mammals, with pods of the former routinely preying on baleen whales >10
   m in length and the latter being known to take other delphinids.(1-3)
   Fossil evidence for the origins of this feeding behavior is wanting,
   although molecular phylogenies indicate that it evolved independently in
   the two lineages.(4) We describe a new extinct representative of the
   killer whale ecomorph, Rododelphis stamatiadisi, based on a partial
   skeleton from the Pleistocene of Rhodes (Greece). Five otoliths of the
   bathypelagic blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou are associated with
   the holotype, providing unexpected evidence of its last meal. The
   evolutionary relationships of R. stamatiadisi and the convergent
   evolution of killer whale-like features were explored through a
   broad-ranging phylogenetic analysis that recovered R. stamatiadisi as
   the closest relative of P. crassidens and O. orca as the only living
   representative of a once diverse Glade. Within the clade of Orca and
   kin, key features implicated in extant killer whale feeding, such as
   body size, tooth size, and tooth count, evolved in a stepwise manner.
   The tooth wear in Rododelphis and an extinct species of Orcinus (O.
   citoniensis) are consistent with a fish-based diet, supporting an
   exaptative Pleistocene origin for marine mammal hunting in both
   lineages. If correct, predation by the ancestors of Pseudorca and Orca
   did not play a significant role in the evolution of baleen whale
   gigantism.},

Title = {An evolutionary conserved detoxification system for membrane
   lipid-derived peroxyl radicals in Gram-negative bacteria},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {How double-membraned Gram-negative bacteria overcome lipid peroxidation
   is virtually unknown. Bactericidal antibiotics and superoxide ion stress
   stimulate the transcription of the Burkholderia cenocepacia bcnA gene
   that encodes a secreted lipocalin. bcnA gene orthologs are conserved in
   bacteria and generally linked to a conserved upstream gene encoding a
   cytochrome b 561 membrane protein (herein named lcoA,
   lipocalin-associated cytochrome oxidase gene). Mutants in bcnA, lcoA,
   and in a gene encoding a conserved cytoplasmic aldehyde reductase
   (peroxidative stress-associated aldehyde reductase gene, psrA) display
   enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation. Compared to wild type, the levels
   of the peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) increase in the
   mutants upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of the bactericidal
   antibiotics polymyxin B and norfloxacin. Microscopy with lipid
   peroxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes shows that lipid peroxyl
   radicals accumulate at the bacterial cell poles and septum and
   peroxidation is associated with a redistribution of anionic
   phospholipids and reduced antimicrobial resistance in the mutants. We
   conclude that BcnA, LcoA, and PsrA are components of an evolutionary
   conserved, hitherto unrecognized peroxidation detoxification system that
   protects the bacterial cell envelope from lipid peroxyl radicals.},

Title = {Metacommunity analyses show an increase in ecological specialisation
   throughout the Ediacaran period},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The first animals appear during the late Ediacaran (572 to 541 Ma); an
   initial diversity increase was followed reduction in diversity, often
   interpreted as catastrophic mass extinction. We investigate Ediacaran
   ecosystem structure changes over this time period using the ``Elements
   of Metacommunity Structure{''} framework to assess whether this
   diversity reduction in the Nama was likely caused by an external mass
   extinction, or internal metacommunity restructuring. The oldest
   metacommunity was characterised by taxa with wide environmental
   tolerances, and limited specialisation or intertaxa associations.
   Structuring increased in the second oldest metacommunity, with groups of
   taxa sharing synchronous responses to environmental gradients,
   aggregating into distinct communities. This pattern strengthened in the
   youngest metacommunity, with communities showing strong environmental
   segregation and depth structure. Thus, metacommunity structure increased
   in complexity, with increased specialisation and resulting in
   competitive exclusion, not a catastrophic environmental disaster,
   leading to diversity loss in the terminal Ediacaran. These results
   reveal that the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics associated with
   Cambrian diversification were established in the Ediacaran.},

Title = {The Jurassic rise of squamates as supported by lepidosaur disparity and
   evolutionary rates},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {The squamates (lizards, snakes, and relatives) today comprise more than
   10,000 species, and yet their sister group, the Rhynchocephalia, is
   represented by a single species today, the tuatara. The explosion in
   squamate diversity has been tracked back to the Cretaceous Terrestrial
   Revolution, 100 million years ago (Ma), the time when flowering plants
   began their takeover of terrestrial ecosystems, associated with
   diversification of coevolving insects and insect-eating predators such
   as lizards, birds, and mammals. Squamates arose much earlier, but their
   long pre-Cretaceous history of some 150 million years (Myr) is
   documented by sparse fossils. Here, we provide evidence for an initial
   radiation of squamate morphology in the Middle and Late Jurassic
   (174-145 Ma), and show that they established their key ecological roles
   much earlier than had been assumed, and they have not changed them much
   since.},

Title = {Tropical tree mortality has increased with rising atmospheric water
   stress},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {608},
Number = {7923},
Pages = {528+},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Evidence exists that tree mortality is accelerating in some regions of
   the tropics(1,2), with profound consequences for the future of the
   tropical carbon sink and the global anthropogenic carbon budget left to
   limit peak global warming below 2 degrees C. However, the mechanisms
   that may be driving such mortality changes and whether particular
   species are especially vulnerable remain unclear(3-8). Here we analyse a
   49-year record of tree dynamics from 24 old-growth forest plots
   encompassing a broad climatic gradient across the Australian moist
   tropics and find that annual tree mortality risk has, on average,
   doubled across all plots and species over the last 35 years, indicating
   a potential halving in life expectancy and carbon residence time.
   Associated losses in biomass were not offset by gains from growth and
   recruitment. Plots in less moist local climates presented higher average
   mortality risk, but local mean climate did not predict the pace of
   temporal increase in mortality risk. Species varied in the trajectories
   of their mortality risk, with the highest average risk found nearer to
   the upper end of the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit niches of
   species. A long-term increase in vapour pressure deficit was evident
   across the region, suggesting that thresholds involving atmospheric
   water stress, driven by global warming, may be a primary cause of
   increasing tree mortality in moist tropical forests.},

   speed, allowing speed to be adapted to particular task demands with
   minimal energetic consequence.(1-3) However, recent and more precise
   laboratory measures indicate that humans may in fact have an
   energy-optimal running speed.(4-6) Here, we characterize runners' speeds
   in a free-living environment and determine if preferred speed is
   consistent with task- or energy-dependent objectives. We analyzed a
   large-scale dataset of free-living runners, which was collected via a
   commercial fitness tracking device, and found that individual runners
   preferred a particular speed that did not change across commonly run
   distances. We compared the data from lab experiments that measured
   participants' energy-optimal running speeds with the free-living
   preferred speeds of age- and gender-matched runners in our dataset and
   found the speeds to be indistinguishable. Human runners prefer a
   particular running speed that is independent of task distance and is
   consistent with the objective of minimizing energy expenditure. Our
   findings offer an insight into the biological objectives that shape
   human running preferences in the real world-an important consideration
   when examining human ecology or creating training strategies to improve
   performance and prevent injury.},

Title = {Enhanced silica export in a future ocean triggers global diatom decline},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {605},
Number = {7911},
Pages = {696+},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Diatoms account for up to 40\% of marine primary production(1,2) and
   require silicic acid to grow and build their opal shell(3). On the
   physiological and ecological level, diatoms are thought to be resistant
   to, or even benefit from, ocean acidification(4-6). Yet, global-scale
   responses and implications for biogeochemical cycles in the future ocean
   remain largely unknown. Here we conducted five in situ mesocosm
   experiments with natural plankton communities in different biomes and
   find that ocean acidification increases the elemental ratio of silicon
   (Si) to nitrogen (N) of sinking biogenic matter by 17 +/- 6 per cent
   under p(CO2) conditions projected for the year 2100. This shift in Si:N
   seems to be caused by slower chemical dissolution of silica at
   decreasing seawater pH. We test this finding with global sediment trap
   data, which confirm a widespread influence of pH on Si:N in the oceanic
   water column. Earth system model simulations show that a future
   pH-driven decrease in silica dissolution of sinking material reduces the
   availability of silicic acid in the surface ocean, triggering a global
   decline of diatoms by 13-26 per cent due to ocean acidification by the
   year 2200. This outcome contrasts sharply with the conclusions of
   previous experimental studies, thereby illustrating how our current
   understanding of biological impacts of ocean change can be considerably
   altered at the global scale through unexpected feedback mechanisms in
   the Earth system.},

Title = {The spatiotemporal patterns of major human admixture events during the
   European Holocene},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that admixture has been pervasive throughout
   human history. While several methods exist for dating admixture in
   contemporary populations, they are not suitable for sparse, low coverage
   ancient genomic data. Thus, we developed DATES (Distribution of Ancestry
   Tracts of Evolutionary Signals) that leverages ancestry covariance
   patterns across the genome of a single individual to infer the timing of
   admixture. DATES provides reliable estimates under various demographic
   scenarios and outperforms available methods for ancient DNA
   applications. Using DATES on-1100 ancient genomes from sixteen regions
   in Europe and west Asia, we reconstruct the chronology of the formation
   of the ancestral populations and the fine-scale details of the spread of
   Neolithic farming and Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry across Europe.
   By studying the genetic formation of Anatolian farmers, we infer that
   gene flow related to Iranian Neolithic farmers occurred before 9600 BCE,
   predating the advent of agriculture in Anatolia. Contrary to the
   archaeological evidence, we estimate that early Steppe pastoralist
   groups (Yamnaya and Afanasievo) were genetically formed more than a
   millennium before the start of Steppe pastoralism. Our analyses provide
   new insights on the origins and spread of farming and Indo-European
   languages, highlighting the power of genomic dating methods to elucidate
   the legacy of human migrations.},

Title = {Humanization of wildlife gut microbiota in urban environments},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Urbanization is rapidly altering Earth's environments, demanding
   investigation of the impacts on resident wildlife. Here, we show that
   urban populations of coyotes (Canis latrans), crested anole lizards
   (Anolis cristatellus), and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia
   leucophrys) acquire gut microbiota constituents found in humans,
   including gut bacterial lineages associated with urbanization in humans.
   Comparisons of urban and rural wildlife and human populations revealed
   significant convergence of gut microbiota among urban populations
   relative to rural populations. All bacterial lineages overrepresented in
   urban wildlife relative to rural wildlife and differentially abundant
   between urban and rural humans were also overrepresented in urban humans
   relative to rural humans. Remarkably, the bacterial lineage most
   overrepresented in urban anoles was a Bacteroides sequence variant that
   was also the most significantly overrepresented in urban human
   populations. These results indicate parallel effects of urbanization on
   human and wildlife gut microbiota and suggest spillover of bacteria from
   humans into wildlife in cities.},

Title = {An oxygen-sensing mechanism for angiosperm adaptation to altitude},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {606},
Number = {7914},
Pages = {565+},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Flowering plants (angiosperms) can grow at extreme altitudes, and have
   been observed growing as high as 6,400 metres above sea level(1,2);
   however, the molecular mechanismsthat enable plant adaptation
   specifically to altitude are unknown. One distinguishing feature of
   increasing altitude is a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen
   (pO(2)). Here we investigated the relationship between altitude and
   oxygen sensing in relation to chlorophyll biosynthesis-which requires
   molecular oxygen(3)- and hypoxia-related gene expression. We show that
   in etiolated seedlings of angiosperm species, steady-state levels of the
   phototoxic chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide are influenced by
   sensing of atmospheric oxygen concentration. In Arabidopsis thaliana,
   this is mediated by the PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASE (PCO) N-degron pathway
   substrates GROUP VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors
   (ERFVIIs). ERFVIIs positively regulate expression of FLUORESCENT IN BLUE
   LIGHT (FLU), which represses the first committed step of chlorophyll
   biosynthesis, forming an inactivation complex with tetrapyrrole
   synthesis enzymes that are negatively regulated by ERFVIIs, thereby
   suppressing protochlorophyllide. In natural populations representing
   diverse angiosperm clades, we find oxygen-dependent altitudinal clines
   for steady-state levels of protochlorophyllide, expression of
   inactivation complex components and hypoxia-related genes. Finally, A.
   thaliana accessions from contrasting altitudes display
   altitude-dependent ERFVII activity and accumulation. We thus identify a
   mechanism for genetic adaptation to absolute altitude through alteration
   of the sensitivity of the oxygen-sensing system.},

Title = {A general decoding strategy explains the relationship between behavior
   and correlated variability},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Improvements in perception are frequently accompanied by decreases in
   correlated variability in sensory cortex. This relationship is puzzling
   because overall changes in correlated variability should minimally
   affect optimal information coding. We hypothesize that this relationship
   arises because instead of using optimal strategies for decoding the
   specific stimuli at hand, observers prioritize generality: a single set
   of neuronal weights to decode any stimuli. We tested this using a
   combination of multineuron recordings in the visual cortex of behaving
   rhesus monkeys and a cortical circuit model. We found that general
   decoders optimized for broad rather than narrow sets of visual stimuli
   better matched the animals' decoding strategy, and that their
   performance was more related to the magnitude of correlated variability.
   In conclusion, the inverse relationship between perceptual performance
   and correlated variability can be explained by observers using a general
   decoding strategy, capable of decoding neuronal responses to the variety
   of stimuli encountered in natural vision.},

Title = {Fast bacterial growth reduces antibiotic accumulation and efficacy},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Phenotypic variations between individual microbial cells play a key role
   in the resistance of microbial pathogens to pharmacotherapies.
   Nevertheless, little is known about cell individuality in antibiotic
   accumulation. Here, we hypothesise that phenotypic diversification can
   be driven by fundamental cell-to-cell differences in drug transport
   rates. To test this hypothesis, we employed microfluidics-based
   single-cell microscopy, libraries of fluorescent antibiotic probes and
   mathematical modelling. This approach allowed us to rapidly identify
   phenotypic variants that avoid antibiotic accumulation within
   populations of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia
   cenocepacia, and Staphylococcus aureus. Crucially, we found that fast
   growing phenotypic variants avoid macrolide accumulation and survive
   treatment without genetic mutations. These findings are in contrast with
   the current consensus that cellular dormancy and slow metabolism
   underlie bacterial survival to antibiotics. Our results also show that
   fast growing variants display significantly higher expression of
   ribosomal promoters before drug treatment compared to slow growing
   variants. Drug-free active ribosomes facilitate essential cellular
   processes in these fast-growing variants, including efflux that can
   reduce macrolide accumulation. We used this new knowledge to eradicate
   variants that displayed low antibiotic accumulation through the chemical
   manipulation of their outer membrane inspiring new avenues to overcome
   current antibiotic treatment failures.},

Title = {Genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated potatoes},
Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world's most important non-cereal
   food crop, and the vast majority of commercially grown cultivars are
   highly heterozygous tetraploids. Advances in diploid hybrid breeding
   based on true seeds have the potential to revolutionize future potato
   breeding and production(1)(-4). So far, relatively few studies have
   examined the genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated
   landrace potatoes, which limits the application of their diversity in
   potato breeding. Here we assemble 44 high-quality diploid potato genomes
   from 24 wild and 20 cultivated accessions that are representative of
   Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade, as well as 2 genomes
   from the neighbouring section, Etuberosum. Extensive discordance of
   phylogenomic relationships suggests the complexity of potato evolution.
   We find that the potato genome substantially expanded its repertoire of
   disease-resistance genes when compared with closely related
   seed-propagated solanaceous crops, indicative of the effect of
   tuber-based propagation strategies on the evolution of the potato
   genome. We discover a transcription factor that determines tuber
   identity and interacts with the mobile tuberization inductive signal
   SP6A. We also identify 561,433 high-confidence structural variants and
   construct a map of large inversions, which provides insights for
   improving inbred lines and precluding potential linkage drag, as
   exemplified by a 5.8-Mb inversion that is associated with carotenoid
   content in tubers. This study will accelerate hybrid potato breeding and
   enrich our understanding of the evolution and biology of potato as a
   global staple food crop.},

Title = {Ancestral reconstruction of duplicated signaling proteins reveals the
   evolution of signaling specificity},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Gene duplication is crucial to generating novel signaling pathways
   during evolution. However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins
   produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction
   specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways.
   Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and
   characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated
   in alpha-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of
   the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this
   duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for
   establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in
   only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish
   specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened
   interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However,
   others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the
   ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be
   strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with
   such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and
   divergence.},

Title = {Admixture of evolutionary rates across a butterfly hybrid zone},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Hybridization is a major evolutionary force that can erode genetic
   differentiation between species, whereas reproductive isolation
   maintains such differentiation. In studying a hybrid zone between the
   swallowtail butterflies Papilio syfanius and Papilio maackii
   (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), we made the unexpected discovery that
   genomic substitution rates are unequal between the parental species.
   This phenomenon creates a novel process in hybridization, where genomic
   regions most affected by gene flow evolve at similar rates between
   species, while genomic regions with strong reproductive isolation evolve
   at species-specific rates. Thus, hybridization mixes evolutionary rates
   in a way similar to its effect on genetic ancestry. Using coalescent
   theory, we show that the rate-mixing process provides distinct
   information about levels of gene flow across different parts of genomes,
   and the degree of rate-mixing can be predicted quantitatively from
   relative sequence divergence (FST) between the hybridizing species at
   equilibrium. Overall, we demonstrate that reproductive isolation
   maintains not only genomic differentiation, but also the rate at which
   differentiation accumulates. Thus, asymmetric rates of evolution provide
   an additional signature of loci involved in reproductive isolation.},

   starvation-resistant strains survive and recover from starvation better
   than the most starvation-sensitive strains using standard assays. We
   performed genome-wide association (GWA) with the MIP-seq trait data and
   identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for starvation
   resistance, and we created near isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the
   effect of these QTL on the trait. These QTL contain numerous candidate
   genes including several members of the Insulin/EGF Receptor-L Domain
   (irld) family. We used genome editing to show that four different irld
   genes have modest effects on starvation resistance. Natural variants of
   irld-39 and irld-52 affect starvation resistance, and increased
   resistance of the irld-39; irld-52 double mutant depends on daf-16/FoxO.
   DAF-16/FoxO is a widely conserved transcriptional effector of
   insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), and these results suggest that IRLD
   proteins modify IIS, although they may act through other mechanisms as
   well. This work demonstrates efficacy of using MIP-seq to dissect a
   complex trait and it suggests that irld genes are natural modifiers of
   starvation resistance in C. elegans.},

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), is a
   leading cause of death due to infectious disease. TB is not
   traditionally associated with biofilms, but M. tb biofilms are linked
   with drug and immune tolerance and there is increasing recognition of
   their contribution to the recalcitrance of TB infections. Here, we used
   M. tb experimental evolution to investigate this complex phenotype and
   identify candidate loci controlling biofilm formation. We identified
   novel candidate loci, adding to our understanding of the genetic
   architecture underlying M. tb biofilm development. Under selective
   pressure to grow as a biofilm, regulatory mutations rapidly swept to
   fixation and were associated with changes in multiple traits, including
   extracellular matrix production, cell size, and growth rate. Genetic and
   phenotypic paths to enhanced biofilm growth varied according to the
   genetic background of the parent strain, suggesting that epistatic
   interactions are important in M. tb adaptation to changing environments.},

Abstract = {Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time
   and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are
   integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of
   day in Drosophila and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening.
   These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons,
   independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5
   ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning
   expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well
   as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by
   clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in
   response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent
   with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the
   circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock
   neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather conditions associated with climate change affect many
   aspects of plant and animal life, including the response to infectious
   diseases. Production of salicylic acid (SA), a central plant defence
   hormone(1-3), is particularly vulnerable to suppression by short periods
   of hot weather above the normal plant growth temperature range via an
   unknown mechanism(4-7). Here we show that suppression of SA production
   in Arabidopsis thaliana at 28 degrees C is independent of PHYTOCHROME
   B-8,B-9 (phyB) and EARLY FLOWERING 3(10) (ELF3), which regulate
   thermo-responsive plant growth and development. Instead, we found that
   formation of GUANYLATE BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3 (GBPL3) defence-activated
   biomolecular condensates(11) (GDACs) was reduced at the higher growth
   temperature. The altered GDAC formation in vivo is linked to impaired
   recruitment of GBPL3 and SA-associated Mediator subunits to the
   promoters of CBP60g and SARD1, which encode master immune transcription
   factors. Unlike many other SA signalling components, including the SA
   receptor and biosynthetic genes, optimized CBP60g expression was
   sufficient to broadly restore SA production, basal immunity and
   effector-triggered immunity at the elevated growth temperature without
   significant growth trade-offs. CBP60g family transcription factors are
   widely conserved in plants(12). These results have implications for
   safeguarding the plant immune system as well as understanding the
   concept of the plant-pathogen-environment disease triangle and the
   emergence of new disease epidemics in a warming climate.},

Abstract = {The degree to which the distribution of mangrove forests will be
   impacted by climate change depends on the dispersal and establishment of
   sea-faring propagules, which drive forest rejuvenation, gene flow and
   range expansion. Climate change affects sea surface density via changes
   in temperature and salinity. However, these changes have not been mapped
   and it remains unclear how these factors may impact mangrove propagule
   dispersal. Here, we provide evidence for strong warming of coastal
   mangrove waters and elevated geographic variability in surface ocean
   density under representative concentration pathway RCP 8.5 by 2100. The
   largest changes will occur in the Indo West Pacific region, the primary
   hotspot of mangrove diversity. By comparing propagule densities to
   predicted sea surface density, we assessed potential effects on mangrove
   propagule dispersal. In the future, a warmer and fresher ocean is likely
   to alter dispersal trajectories of mangrove propagules and increase

   The authors project the impacts of future changes in sea surface
   temperature, salinity and therefore density on the dispersal of buoyant
   mangrove propagules. They show that warmer and fresher oceans may
   increase propagule sinking rates, potentially reducing future mangrove

Title = {A male steroid controls female sexual behaviour in the malaria mosquito},
Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {608},
Number = {7921},
Pages = {93+},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Insects, unlike vertebrates, are widely believed to lack male-biased sex
   steroid hormones(1). In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the
   ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) appears to have evolved to both
   control egg development when synthesized by females(2) and to induce
   mating refractoriness when sexually transferred by males(3). Because egg
   development and mating are essential reproductive traits, understanding
   how Anopheles females integrate these hormonal signals can spur the
   design of new malaria control programs. Here we reveal that these
   reproductive functions are regulated by distinct sex steroids through a
   sophisticated network of ecdysteroid-activating/inactivating enzymes. We
   identify a male-specific oxidized ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-20E (3D20E),
   which safeguards paternity by turning off female sexual receptivity
   following its sexual transfer and activation by dephosphorylation.
   Notably, 3D20E transfer also induces expression of a reproductive gene
   that preserves egg development during Plasmodium infection, ensuring
   fitness of infected females. Female-derived 20E does not trigger sexual
   refractoriness but instead licenses oviposition in mated individuals
   once a 20E-inhibiting kinase is repressed. Identifying this
   male-specific insect steroid hormone and its roles in regulating female
   sexual receptivity, fertility and interactions with Plasmodium parasites
   suggests the possibility for reducing the reproductive success of
   malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Bats have evolved behavioral specializations that are unique among
   mammals, including self-propelled flight and echolocation. However,
   areas of motor cortex that are critical in the generation and fine
   control of these unique behaviors have never been fully characterized in
   any bat species, despite the fact that bats compose similar to 25\% of
   extant mammalian species. Using intracortical microstimulation, we
   examined the organization of motor cortex in Egyptian fruit bats
   (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a species that has evolved a novel form of
   tongue-based echolocation.(1,2) We found that movement representations
   include an enlarged tongue region containing discrete subregions devoted
   to generating distinct tongue movement types, consistent with their
   behavioral specialization generating active sonar using tongue clicks.
   This magnification of the tongue in motor cortex is comparable to the
   enlargement of somatosensory representations in species with sensory
   specializations.(3-5) We also found a novel degree of coactivation
   between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, both of which are involved in
   altering the shape and tension of wing membranes during flight.
   Together, these findings suggest that the organization of motor cortex
   has coevolved with peripheral morphology in bats to support the unique
   motor demands of flight and echolocation.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},
Number = {13},

Abstract = {The evolution of eusociality has allowed ants to become one of the most
   conspicuous and ecologically dominant groups of organisms in the world.
   A large majority of the current similar to 14,000 ant species belong to
   the formicoids,(1) a clade of nine subfamilies that exhibit the most
   extreme forms of reproductive division of labor, large colony size,(2)
   worker polymorphism,(3) and extended queen longevity.(4) The eight
   remaining non-formicoid subfamilies are less well studied, with few
   genomes having been sequenced so far and unclear phylogenetic
   relationships.(5) By sequencing 65 genomes, we provide a robust
   phylogeny of the 17 ant subfamilies, retrieving high support to the
   controversial leptanillomorph clade (Leptanillinae and Martialinae) as
   the sister group to all other extant ants. Moreover, our genomic
   analyses revealed that the emergence of the formicoids was accompanied
   by an elevated number of positive selection events. Importantly, the top
   three gene functions under selection are linked to key features of
   complex eusociality, with histone acetylation being implicated in caste
   differentiation, gene silencing by RNA in worker sterility, and
   autophagy in longevity. These results show that the key pathways
   associated with eusociality have been under strong selection during the
   Cretaceous, suggesting that the molecular foundations of complex
   eusociality may have evolved rapidly in less than 20 Ma.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems depend on their capacity to withstand and recover from
   natural and anthropogenic perturbations (that is, their resilience)(1).
   Experimental evidence of sudden increases in tree mortality is raising
   concerns about variation in forest resilience(2), yet little is known
   about how it is evolving in response to climate change. Here we
   integrate satellite-based vegetation indices with machine learning to
   show how forest resilience, quantified in terms of critical slowing down
   indicators(3-5), has changed during the period 2000-2020. We show that
   tropical, arid and temperate forests are experiencing a significant
   decline in resilience, probably related to increased water limitations
   and climate variability. By contrast, boreal forests show divergent
   local patterns with an average increasing trend in resilience, probably
   benefiting from warming and CO2 fertilization, which may outweigh the
   adverse effects of climate change. These patterns emerge consistently in
   both managed and intact forests, corroborating the existence of common
   large-scale climate drivers. Reductions in resilience are statistically
   linked to abrupt declines in forest primary productivity, occurring in
   response to slow drifting towards a critical resilience threshold.
   Approximately 23\% of intact undisturbed forests, corresponding to 3.32
   Pg C of gross primary productivity, have already reached a critical
   threshold and are experiencing a further degradation in resilience.
   Together, these signals reveal a widespread decline in the capacity of
   forests to withstand perturbation that should be accounted for in the
   design of land-based mitigation and adaptation plans.},

Title = {Stress diminishes outcome but enhances response representations during
   instrumental learning},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Stress may shift behavioural control from a goal-directed system that
   encodes action-outcome relationships to a habitual system that learns
   stimulus-response associations. Although this shift to habits is highly
   relevant for stress-related psychopathologies, limitations of existing
   behavioural paradigms hinder research from answering the fundamental
   question of whether the stress-induced bias to habits is due to reduced
   outcome processing or enhanced response processing at the time of
   stimulus presentation, or both. Here, we used EEG-based multivariate
   pattern analysis to decode neural outcome representations crucial for
   goal-directed control, as well as response representations during
   instrumental learning. We show that stress reduced outcome
   representations but enhanced response representations. Both were
   directly associated with a behavioural index of habitual responding.
   Furthermore, changes in outcome and response representations were
   uncorrelated, suggesting that these may reflect distinct processes. Our
   findings indicate that habitual behaviour under stress may be the result
   of both enhanced stimulus-response processing and diminished outcome
   processing.},

Title = {Competition for pollinators destabilizes plant coexistence},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {607},
Number = {7920},
Pages = {721+},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Mounting concern over the global decline of pollinators has fuelled
   calls for investigating their role in maintaining plant diversity.
   Theory predicts that competition for pollinators can stabilize
   interactions between plant species by providing opportunities for niche
   differentiation, while at the same time can drive competitive imbalances
   that favour exclusion. Here we empirically tested these contrasting
   effects by manipulating competition for pollinators in a way that
   predicts its long-term implications for plant coexistence. We subjected
   annual plant individuals situated across experimentally imposed
   gradients in neighbour density to either ambient insect pollination or a
   pollen supplementation treatment alleviating competition for
   pollinators. The vital rates of these individuals informed plant
   population dynamic models predicting the key theoretical metrics of
   species coexistence. Competition for pollinators generally destabilized
   the interactions between plant species, reducing the proportion of pairs
   expected to coexist. Interactions with pollinators also influenced the
   competitive imbalances between plant species, effects that are expected
   to strengthen with pollinator decline, potentially disrupting plant
   coexistence. Indeed, results from an experiment simulating pollinator
   decline showed that plant species experiencing greater reductions in
   floral visitation also suffered greater declines in population growth
   rate. Our results reveal that competition for pollinators may weaken
   plant coexistence by destabilizing interactions and contributing to
   competitive imbalances, information critical for interpreting the
   impacts of pollinator decline.},

Title = {Lung evolution in vertebrates and the water-to-land transition},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {A crucial evolutionary change in vertebrate history was the Palaeozoic
   (Devonian 419-359 million years ago) water-to-land transition, allowed
   by key morphological and physiological modifications including the
   acquisition of lungs. Nonetheless, the origin and early evolution of
   vertebrate lungs remain highly controversial, particularly whether the
   ancestral state was paired or unpaired. Due to the rarity of fossil soft
   tissue preservation, lung evolution can only be traced based on the
   extant phylogenetic bracket. Here we investigate, for the first time,
   lung morphology in extensive developmental series of key living lunged
   osteichthyans using synchrotron x-ray microtomography and histology. Our
   results shed light on the primitive state of vertebrate lungs as
   unpaired, evolving to be truly paired in the lineage towards the
   tetrapods. The water-to-land transition confronted profound
   physiological challenges and paired lungs were decisive for increasing
   the surface area and the pulmonary compliance and volume, especially
   during the air-breathing on land. Editor's evaluation This study focused
   on five osteichthy an vertebrate species and investigated their lung
   morphology. The comparison of the observations suggests an origin of the
   lung as an unpaired organ, with the present -day paired forms in
   amniotes being a result of secondary modification. The sound
   morpho-logical comparison presented provides valuable insight into the
   evolution of the lung. The work will be of interest to colleagues
   studying vertebrate evolution.Cupello et al. used a range of techniques
   to examine how the lungs of the bony fish and salamander changed shape
   during development. The results suggested that the lungs of vertebrates
   started out as a single organ, which became truly paired later in
   evolution once vertebrates started developing limbs. This anatomical
   shift increased the surface area available for exchanging oxygen and
   carbon dioxide so that vertebrates could breathe more easily on
   land.These findings provide new insights in to how the lung evolved into
   the paired structure found in most vertebrates alive today. It likely
   that this transition allowed vertebrates to fully adapt to breathing
   above water, which may explain why this event only happened once over
   the course of evolution. All life on Earth started out under water.
   However, around 400 million years ago some vertebrates, such as fish,
   started developing limbs and other characteristics that allowed them to
   explore life on land. One of the most pivotal features to evolve was the
   lungs, which gave vertebrates the ability to breathe above water.Most
   land-living vertebrates, including humans, have two lungs which sit on
   either side of their chest. The lungs extract oxygen from the atmosphere
   and transfer it to the bloodstream in exchange for carbon dioxide which
   then gets exhaled out in to the atmosphere. How this important organ
   first evolved is a hotly debated topic. This is largely because lung
   tissue does not preserve well in fossils, making it difficult to trace
   how the lungs of vertebrates changed over the course of evolution.To
   overcome this barrier, Cupello et al. compared the lungs of living
   species which are crucial to understand the early stages of the
   water-to-land transition. This included four species of lunged bony fish
   which breathe air at the water surface, and a four-legged salamander
   that lives on land.},

Title = {Global analysis of cytosine and adenine DNA modifications across the
   tree of life},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Interpreting the function and metabolism of enzymatic DNA modifications
   requires both position-specific and global quantities. Sequencing-based
   techniques that deliver the former have become broadly accessible, but
   analytical methods for the global quantification of DNA modifications
   have thus far been applied mostly to individual problems. We established
   a mass spectrometric method for the sensitive and accurate
   quantification of multiple enzymatic DNA modifications. Then, we
   isolated DNA from 124 archean, bacterial, fungal, plant, and mammalian
   species, and several tissues and created a resource of global DNA
   modification quantities. Our dataset provides insights into the general
   nature of enzymatic DNA modifications, reveals unique biological cases,
   and provides complementary quantitative information to normalize and
   assess the accuracy of sequencing-based detection of DNA modifications.
   We report that only three of the studied DNA modifications,
   methylcytosine (5mdC), methyladenine (N6mdA) and hydroxymethylcytosine
   (5hmdC), were detected above a picomolar detection limit across species,
   and dominated in higher eukaryotes (5mdC), in bacteria (N6mdA), or the
   vertebrate central nervous systems (5hmdC). All three modifications were
   detected simultaneously in only one of the tested species, Raphanus
   sativus. In contrast, these modifications were either absent or detected
   only at trace quantities, across all yeasts and insect genomes studied.
   Further, we reveal interesting biological cases. For instance, in Allium
   cepa, Helianthus annuus, or Andropogon gerardi, more than 35\% of
   cytosines were methylated. Additionally, next to the mammlian CNS, 5hmdC
   was also detected in plants like Lepidium sativum and was found on 8\%
   of cytosines in the Garra barreimiae brain samples. Thus, identifying
   unexpected levels of DNA modifications in several wild species, our
   resource underscores the need to address biological diversity for
   studying DNA modifications.},

Title = {Heritability and cross-species comparisons of human cortical functional
   organization asymmetry},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is symmetrically organized along large-scale
   axes but also presents inter-hemispheric differences in structure and
   function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, that is
   asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis
   supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed
   whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable
   and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings
   indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a functional
   trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas
   language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal
   network showed rightward asymmetric organization in humans. These
   asymmetries were heritable in humans and showed a similar spatial
   distribution with macaques, in the case of intra-hemispheric asymmetry
   of functional hierarchy. This suggests (phylo)genetic conservation.
   However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a
   qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques. Overall,
   our findings suggest a genetic basis for asymmetry in intrinsic
   functional organization, linked to higher order cognitive functions
   uniquely developed in humans.},

Title = {Phage endolysins are adapted to specific hosts and are evolutionarily
   dynamic},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Endolysins are produced by (bacterio)phages to rapidly degrade the
   bacterial cell wall and release new viral particles. Despite sharing a
   common function, endolysins present in phages that infect a specific
   bacterial species can be highly diverse and vary in types, number, and
   organization of their catalytic and cell wall binding domains. While
   much is now known about the biochemistry of phage endolysins, far less
   is known about the implication of their diversity on phage-host
   adaptation and evolution. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we could
   genetically exchange a subset of different endolysin genes into distinct
   lactococcal phage genomes. Regardless of the type and biochemical
   properties of these endolysins, fitness costs associated to their
   genetic exchange were marginal if both recipient and donor phages were
   infecting the same bacterial strain, but gradually increased when taking
   place between phage that infect different strains or bacterial species.
   From an evolutionary perspective, we observed that endolysins could be
   naturally exchanged by homologous recombination between phages
   coinfecting a same bacterial strain. Furthermore, phage endolysins could
   adapt to their new phage/host environment by acquiring adaptative
   mutations. These observations highlight the remarkable ability of phage
   lytic systems to recombine and adapt and, therefore, explain their large
   diversity and mosaicism. It also indicates that evolution should be
   considered to act on functional modules rather than on bacteriophages
   themselves. Furthermore, the extensive degree of evolvability observed
   for phage endolysins offers new perspectives for their engineering as
   antimicrobial agents.},

Title = {Vertically migrating phytoplankton fuel high oceanic primary production},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Pages = {750+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Marine net primary production (NPP) is remarkably high given the typical
   vertical separation of 50-150 m between the depth zones of light and
   nutrient sufficiency, respectively. Here we present evidence that many
   autotrophs bridge this gap through downward and upward migration,
   thereby facilitating biological nutrient pumping and high rates of
   oceanic NPP. Our model suggests that phytoplankton vertical migration
   (PVM) fuels up to 40\% (>28 tg yr(-1) N) of new production and directly
   contributes 25\% of total oceanic NPP (herein estimated at 56 PgC
   yr(-1)). Confidence in these estimates is supported by good reproduction
   of seasonal, vertical and geographic variations in NPP. In contrast to
   common predictions, a sensitivity study of the PVM model indicates
   higher NPP under global warming when enhanced stratification reduces
   physical nutrient transport into the surface ocean. Our findings suggest
   that PVM is a key mechanism driving marine biogeochemistry and therefore
   requires consideration in global carbon budgets.
   Phytoplankton vertical migration has a role in nutrient pumping and
   primary productivity in the oceans. Here the authors quantify the total
   amount of oceanic net primary productivity facilitated by this
   bio-pumping, under present and future warming conditions.},

Title = {A three-eyed radiodont with fossilized neuroanatomy informs the origin
   of the arthropod head and segmentation},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {15},
Pages = {3302+},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {In addition to being among the most iconic and bizarre-looking Cambrian
   animals, radiodonts are a group that offers key insight into the
   acquisition of the arthropod body plan by virtue of their phylogenetic
   divergence prior to all living members of the phylum. Nonetheless,
   radiodont fossils are rare and often fragmentary, and contentions over
   their interpretation have hindered resolution of important evolutionary
   co-nundrums. Here, we describe 268 specimens of Stanleycaris hirpex from
   the Cambrian Burgess Shale, including many exceptionally preserved
   whole-body specimens, informing the most complete reconstruc-tion of a
   radiodont to date. The trunk region of Stanleycaris has up to 17
   segments plus two pairs of filiform caudal blades. The recognition of
   dorsal sclerotic segmentation of the trunk cuticle and putative
   unganglio-nated nerve cords provides new insight into the relative
   timing of acquisition of segmental traits, the epitome of the arthropod
   body plan. In addition to the pair of stalked lateral eyes, the short
   head unexpectedly bears a large median eye situated behind a preocular
   sclerite on an anteriorly projecting head lobe. Upon re-evalu-ation,
   similar median eyes can be identified in other Cambrian panarthropods
   demonstrating a deep evolutionary continuity. The exquisitely preserved
   brain of Stanleycaris is consistent with the hypothesized deutocerebral
   innervation of the frontal appendages, reconciling neuroanatomical
   evidence with external morphology in support of an ancestrally bipartite
   head and brain for arthropods. We propose that the inte-gration of this
   bipartite head prior to the acquisition of most segmental characters
   exclusively in the arthropod trunk may help explain its developmental
   differentiation.},

Title = {Abdominal serial homologues of wings in Paleozoic insects},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {15},
Pages = {3314+},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {The Late Paleozoic acquisition of wings in insects represents one of the
   key steps in arthropod evolution. While the origin of wings has been a
   contentious matter for nearly two centuries, recent evolutionary
   developmental studies suggest either the participation of both tergal
   and pleural tissues in the formation of wings(1) or wings originated
   from exites of the most proximal leg podite incorporated into the insect
   body wall.(2) The so-called ``dual hypothesis'' for wing origins finds
   support from studies of embryology, evo-devo, and genomics, although the
   degree of the presumed contribution from tergal and pleural tissues
   differ.(3-6) Ohde et al.,(7) confirmed amajor role for tergal tissue in
   the formation of the cricket wing and suggested that ``wings evolved
   from the pre-existing lateral terga of a wingless insect ancestor.''
   Additional work has focused on identifying partial serially homologous
   structures of wings on the prothorax(8,9) and abdominal segments.(10)
   Thus, several studies have suggested that the prothoracic horns in
   scarab beetles,(9) gin traps of tenebrionid and scarab beetle
   pupae,(11,12) or abdominal tracheal gills of mayfly larvae(1,13) evolved
   from serial homologues of wings. Here, we present critical information
   from abdominal lateral outgrowths (flaps) of Paleozoic
   palaeodictyopteran larvae, which show comparable structure to thoracic
   wings, consisting of cordate lateral outgrowths antero-basally hinged by
   muscle attachments. These flaps therefore most likely represent wing
   serial homologues. The presence of these paired outgrowths on abdominal
   segments I-IX in early diverging Pterygota likely corresponds to
   crustacean epipods(14,15) and resembles a hypothesized ancestral body
   plan of a ``protopterygote'' model.},

Abstract = {The sensitivity of forests to near-term warming and associated
   precipitation shifts remains uncertain(1-9). Herein, using a 5-year
   open-air experiment in southern boreal forest, we show divergent
   responses to modest climate alteration among juveniles of nine
   co-occurring North American tree species. Warming alone (+1.6 degrees C
   or +3.1 degrees C above ambient temperature) or combined with reduced
   rainfall increased the juvenile mortality of all species, especially
   boreal conifers. Species differed ingrowth responses to warming, ranging
   from enhanced growth in Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum to severe growth
   reductions in Abies balsamea, Picea glauca and Pinus strob us. Moreover,
   treatment-induced changes in both photosynthesis and growth help explain
   treatment-driven changes in survival. Treatments in which species
   experienced conditions warmer or drier than at their range margins
   resulted in the most adverse impacts on growth and survival. Species
   abundant in southern boreal forests had the largest reductions ingrowth
   and survival due to climate manipulations. By contrast, temperate
   species that experienced little mortality and substantial growth
   enhancement in response to warming are rare throughout southern boreal
   forest and unlikely to rapidly expand their density and distribution.
   Therefore, projected climate change will probably cause regeneration
   failure of currently dominant southern boreal species and, coupled with
   their slow replacement by temperate species, lead to tree regeneration
   shortfalls with potential adverse impacts on the health, diversity and
   ecosystem services of regional forests.},

Abstract = {Unprecedented modern rates of warming are expected to advance boreal
   forest into Arctic tundra(1), thereby reducing albedo(2-4), altering
   carbon cycling(4) and further changing climate(1-4), yet the patterns
   and processes ofthis biome shift remain unclear'. Climate warming,
   required for previous boreal advances(6-17), is not sufficient by itself
   for modern range expansion of conifers forming forest-tundra
   ecotones(5,12,15,17-20). No high-latitude population of conifers, the
   dominant North American Arctic treeline taxon, has previously been
   documented(5) advancing at rates following the last glacial maximum
   (LGM)(6-8). Here we describe a population of white spruce (Piceaglauca)
   advancing at post-LGM rates(7) across an Arctic basin distant from
   established treelines and provide evidence of mechanisms sustaining the
   advance. The population doubles each decade, with exponential radial
   growth in the main stems of individual trees correlating positively with
   July air temperature. Lateral branches in adults and terminal leaders in
   large juveniles grow almost twice as fast as those at established
   treelines. We conclude that surpassing temperature thresholds(1,6-17),
   together with winter winds facilitating long-distance dispersal, deeper
   snowpack and increased soil nutrient availability promoting recruitment
   and growth, provides sufficient conditions for boreal forest advance.
   These observations enable forecast modelling with important insights
   into the environmental conditions converting tundra into forest.},

Title = {Warm springs alter timing but not total growth of temperate deciduous
   trees},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},

Number = {7923},
Pages = {552+},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {As the climate changes, warmer spring temperatures are causing earlier
   leaf-out(1-3) and commencement of CO2 uptake(1,3) in temperate deciduous
   forests, resulting in a tendency towards increased growing season
   length(3) and annual CO2 uptake(1,3-7). However, less is known about how
   spring temperatures affect tree stem growth(8,9), which sequesters
   carbon in wood that has a long residence time in the ecosystem(10,11).
   Here we show that warmer spring temperatures shifted stem diameter
   growth of deciduous trees earlier but had no consistent effect on peak
   growing season length, maximum growth rates, or annual growth, using
   dendrometer band measurements from 440 trees across two forests. The
   latter finding was confirmed on the centennial scale by 207 tree-ring
   chronologies from 108 forests across eastern North America, where annual
   ring width was far more sensitive to temperatures during the peak
   growing season than in the spring. These findings imply that any extra
   CO2 uptake in years with warmer spring temperatures(4,5) does not
   significantly contribute to increased sequestration in long-lived woody
   stem biomass. Rather, contradicting projections from global carbon cycle
   models(1,12), our empirical results imply that warming spring
   temperatures are unlikely to increase woody productivity enough to
   strengthen the long-term CO2 sink of temperate deciduous forests.},

Abstract = {The productivity of rainforests growing on highly weathered tropical
   soils is expected to be limited by phosphorus availability(1). Yet,
   controlled fertilization experiments have been unable to demonstrate a
   dominant role for phosphorus in controlling tropical forest net primary
   productivity. Recent syntheses have demonstrated that responses to
   nitrogen addition are as large as to phosphorus(2), and adaptations to
   low phosphorus availability appear to enable net primary productivity to
   be maintained across major soil phosphorus gradients'. Thus, the extent
   to which phosphorus availability limits tropical forest productivity is
   highly uncertain. The majority of the Amazonia, however, is
   characterized by soils that are more depleted in phosphorus than those
   in which most tropical fertilization experiments have taken place(2).
   Thus, we established a phosphorus, nitrogen and base cation addition
   experiment in an old growth Amazon rainforest, with a low soil
   phosphorus content that is representative of approximately 60\% of the
   Amazon basin. Here we show that net primary productivity increased
   exclusively with phosphorus addition. After 2 years, strong responses
   were observed in fine root (+29\%) and canopy productivity (+19\%), but
   not stem growth. The direct evidence of phosphorus limitation of net
   primary productivity suggests that phosphorus availability may restrict
   Amazon forest responses to CO2 fertilization(4), with major implications
   for future carbon sequestration and forest resilience to climate change.},

Abstract = {Many species are shifting their ranges to keep pace with climate change,
   but habitat fragmentation and limited dispersal could impede these range
   shifts. In the case of climate-vulnerable foundation species such as
   tropical reef corals and temperate forest trees, such limitations might
   put entire communities at risk of extinction. Restoring connectivity
   through corridors, stepping-stones or enhanced quality of existing
   patches could prevent the extinction of several species, but
   dispersal-limited species might not benefit if other species block their
   dispersal. Alternatively, managers might relocate vulnerable species
   between habitats through assisted migration, but this is generally a
   species-by-species approach. To evaluate the relative efficacy of these
   strategies, we simulated the climate-tracking of species in randomized
   competitive metacommunities with alternative management interventions.
   We found that corridors and assisted migration were the most effective
   strategies at reducing extinction. Assisted migration was especially
   effective at reducing the extinction likelihood for short-dispersing
   species, but it often required moving several species repeatedly.
   Assisted migration was more effective at reducing extinction in
   environments with higher stochasticity, and corridors were more
   effective at reducing extinction in environments with lower
   stochasticity. We discuss the application of these approaches to an
   array of systems ranging from tropical corals to temperate forests.This

Title = {Complexity-biodiversity relationships on marine urban structures:
   reintroducing habitat heterogeneity through eco-engineering},

Volume = {377},

Abstract = {Urbanization is leading to biodiversity loss through habitat
   homogenization. The smooth, featureless surfaces of many marine urban
   structures support ecological communities, often of lower biodiversity,
   distinct from the complex natural habitats they replace. Eco-engineering
   (design for ecological co-benefits) seeks to enhance biodiversity and
   ecological functions on urban structures. We assessed the benefits to
   biodiversity of retrofitting four types of complex habitat panels to an
   intertidal seawall at patch (versus flat control panels) and site
   (versus unmodified control seawalls and reference rocky shores) scales.
   Two years after installation, patch-scale effects of complex panels on
   biodiversity ranged from neutral to positive, depending on the
   protective features they provided, though all but one design (honeycomb)
   supported unique species. Water-retaining features (rockpools) and
   crevices, which provided moisture retention and cooling, increased
   biodiversity and supported algae and invertebrates otherwise absent. At
   the site scale, biodiversity benefits ranged from neutral at the high-
   and mid-intertidal to positive at the low-intertidal elevation. The
   results highlight the importance of matching eco-engineering
   interventions to the niche of target species, and environmental
   conditions. While species richness was greatest on rockpool and crevice
   panels, the unique species supported by other panel designs highlights
   that to maximize biodiversity, habitat heterogeneity is essential.This

Abstract = {The pervasive loss of biodiversity in the Anthropocene necessitates
   rapid assessments of ecosystems to understand how they will respond to
   anthropogenic environmental change. Many studies have sought to describe
   the adaptive capacity (AC) of individual species, a measure that
   encompasses a species' ability to respond and adapt to change. Only
   those adaptive mechanisms that can be used over the next few decades
   (e.g. via novel interactions, behavioural changes, hybridization,
   migration, etc.) are relevant to the timescale set by the rapid changes
   of the Anthropocene. The impacts of species loss cascade through
   ecosystems, yet few studies integrate the capacity of ecological
   networks to adapt to change with the ACs of its species. Here, we
   discuss three ecosystems and how their ecological networks impact the AC
   of species and vice versa. A more holistic perspective that considers
   the AC of species with respect to their ecological interactions and
   functions will provide more predictive power and a deeper understanding
   of what factors are most important to a species' survival. We contend
   that the AC of a species, combined with its role in ecosystem function
   and stability, must guide decisions in assigning `risk' and triaging
   biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene.This article is part of the theme
   issue `Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.},

Abstract = {We are in a climate and ecological emergency, where climate change and
   direct anthropogenic interference with the biosphere are risking abrupt
   and/or irreversible changes that threaten our life-support systems.
   Efforts are underway to increase the resilience of some ecosystems that
   are under threat, yet collective awareness and action are modest at
   best. Here, we highlight the potential for a biosphere resilience
   sensing system to make it easier to see where things are going wrong,
   and to see whether deliberate efforts to make things better are working.
   We focus on global resilience sensing of the terrestrial biosphere at
   high spatial and temporal resolution through satellite remote sensing,
   utilizing the generic mathematical behaviour of complex systems-loss of
   resilience corresponds to slower recovery from perturbations, gain of
   resilience equates to faster recovery. We consider what subset of
   biosphere resilience remote sensing can monitor, critically reviewing
   existing studies. Then we present illustrative, global results for
   vegetation resilience and trends in resilience over the last 20 years,
   from both satellite data and model simulations. We close by discussing
   how resilience sensing nested across global, biome-ecoregion, and local
   ecosystem scales could aid management and governance at these different
   scales, and identify priorities for further work.This article is part of
   the theme issue `Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30

Abstract = {Koala retrovirus (KoRV) subtype A (KoRV-A) is currently in transition
   from exogenous virus to endogenous viral element, providing an ideal
   system to elucidate retroviral-host coevolution. We characterized KoRV
   geography using fecal DNA from 192 samples across 20 populations
   throughout the koala's range. We reveal an abrupt change in KoRV
   genetics and incidence at the Victoria/New South Wales state border. In
   northern koalas, pol gene copies were ubiquitously present at above five
   per cell, consistent with endogenous KoRV. In southern koalas, poi
   copies were detected in only 25.8\% of koalas and always at copy numbers
   below one, while the env gene was detected in all animals and in a
   majority at copy numbers above one per cell. These results suggest that
   southern koalas carry partial endogenous KoRV-like sequences. Deep
   sequencing of the env hypervariable region revealed three putatively
   endogenous KoRV-A sequences in northern koalas and a single, distinct
   sequence present in all southern koalas. Among northern populations, env
   sequence diversity decreased with distance from the equator, suggesting
   infectious KoRV-A invaded the koala genome in northern Australia and
   then spread south. The exogenous KoRV subtypes (B to K), two novel
   subtypes, and intermediate subtypes were detected in all northern koala
   populations but were strikingly absent from all southern animals tested.
   Apart from KoRV subtype D, these exogenous subtypes were generally
   locally prevalent but geographically restricted, producing KoRV genetic
   differentiation among northern populations. This suggests that sporadic
   evolution and local transmission of the exogenous subtypes have occurred
   within northern Australia, but this has not extended into animals within
   southern Australia.},

Abstract = {Aging is the price to pay for acquiring and processing energy through
   cellular activity and life history productivity. Climate warming can
   exacerbate the inherent pace of aging, as illustrated by a faster
   erosion of protective telomere DNA sequences. This biomarker integrates
   individual pace of life and parental effects through the germline, but
   whether intra- and intergenerational telomere dynamics underlies
   population trends remains an open question. Here, we investigated the
   covariation between life history, telomere length (TL), and extinction
   risk among three age classes in a cold-adapted ectotherm (Zootoca
   vivipara) facing warming-induced extirpations in its distribution
   limits. TL followed the same threshold relationships with population
   extinction risk at birth, maturity, and adulthood, suggesting
   intergenerational accumulation of accelerated aging rate in declining
   populations. In dwindling populations, most neonates inherited already
   short telomeres, suggesting they were born physiologically old and
   unlikely to reach recruitment. At adulthood, TL further explained
   females' reproductive performance, switching from an index of individual
   quality in stable populations to a biomarker of reproductive costs in
   those close to extirpation. We compiled these results to propose the
   aging loop hypothesis and conceptualize how climate-driven telomere
   shortening in ectotherms may accumulate across generations and generate
   tipping points before local extirpation.},

Abstract = {Male-female coevolution has taken different paths among closely related
   species, but our understanding of the factors that govern its direction
   is limited. While it is clear that ecological factors, life history, and
   the economics of reproduction are connected, the divergent links are
   often obscure. We propose that a complete understanding requires the
   conceptual integration of metabolic phenotypes. Metabolic rate, a nexus
   of life history evolution, is constrained by ecological factors and may
   exert important direct and indirect effects on the evolution of sexual
   dimorphism. We performed standardized experiments in 12 seed beetle
   species to gain a rich set of sex-specific measures of metabolic
   phenotypes, life history traits, and the economics of mating and
   analyzed our multivariate data using phylogenetic comparative methods.
   Resting metabolic rate (RMR) showed extensive evolution and evolved more
   rapidly in males than in females. The evolution of RMR was tightly
   coupled with a suite of life history traits, describing a pace-of-life
   syndrome (POLS), with indirect effects on the economics of mating. As
   predicted, high resource competition was associated with a low RMR and a
   slow POLS. The cost of mating showed sexually antagonistic coevolution,
   a hallmark of sexual conflict. The sex-specific costs and benefits of
   mating were predictably related to ecology, primarily through the
   evolution of male ejaculate size. Overall, our results support the tenet
   that resource competition affects metabolic processes that, in turn,
   have predictable effects on both life history evolution and
   reproduction, such that ecology shows both direct and indirect effects
   on male-female coevolution.},

Abstract = {The aesthetic preferences of potential mates have driven the evolution
   of a baffling diversity of elaborate ornaments. Which fitness benefit-if
   any-choosers gain from expressing such preferences is controversial,
   however. Here, we simulate the evolution of preferences for multiple
   ornament types (e.g., ``Fisherian,{''} ``handicap,{''} and
   ``indicator{''} ornaments) that differ in their associations with genes
   for attractiveness and other components of fitness. We model the costs
   of preference expression in a biologically plausible way, which
   decouples costly mate search from cost-free preferences. Ornaments of
   all types evolved in our model, but their occurrence was far from
   random. Females typically preferred ornaments that carried information
   about a male's quality, defined here as his ability to acquire and
   metabolize resources. Highly salient ornaments, which key into
   preexisting perceptual biases, were also more likely to evolve. When
   males expressed quality-dependent ornaments, females invested readily in
   costly mate search to locate preferred males. In contrast, the genetic
   benefits associated with purely arbitrary ornaments were insufficient to
   sustain highly costly mate search. Arbitrary ornaments could nonetheless
   ``piggyback{''} on mate-search effort favored by other,
   quality-dependent ornaments. We further show that the potential to
   produce attractive male offspring ({''}sexy sons{''}) can be as
   important as producing offspring of high general quality ({''}good
   genes{''}) in shaping female preferences, even when preferred ornaments
   are quality dependent. Our model highlights the importance of
   mate-search effort as a driver of aesthetic coevolution.},

Abstract = {Comparative whole-genome analyses hold great power to illuminate
   commonalities and differences in the evolution of related species that
   share similar ecologies. The mustelid subfamily Lutrinae includes 13
   currently recognized extant species of otters,(1-5) a semiaquatic group
   whose evolutionary history is incompletely understood. We assembled a
   dataset comprising 24 genomes from all living otter species, 14 of which
   were newly sequenced. We used this dataset to infer phylogenetic
   relationships and divergence times, to characterize patterns of
   genome-wide genealogical discordance, and to investigate demographic
   history and current genomic diversity. We found that genera Lutra,
   Aonyx, Amblonyx, and Lutrogale form a coherent clade that should be
   synonymized under Lutra, simplifying the taxonomic structure of the
   subfamily. The poorly known tropical African Aonyx congicus and the more
   widespread Aonyx capensis were found to be reciprocally monophyletic
   (having diverged 440,000 years ago), supporting the validity of the
   former as a distinct species. We observed variable changes in effective
   population sizes over time among otters within and among continents,
   although several species showed similar trends of expansions and
   declines during the last 100,000 years. This has led to different levels
   of genomic diversity assessed by overall heterozygosity, genome-wide SNV
   density, and run of homozygosity burden. Interestingly, there were cases
   in which diversity metrics were consistent with the current threat
   status (mostly based on census size), highlighting the potential of
   genomic data for conservation assessment. Overall, our results shed
   light on otter evolutionary history and provide a framework for further
   in-depth comparative genomic studies targeting this group.},

Abstract = {Climate change is impacting virtually all marine life. Adaptation
   strategies will require a robust understanding of the risks to species
   and ecosystems and how those propagate to human societies. We develop a
   unified and spatially explicit index to comprehensively evaluate the
   climate risks to marine life. Under high emissions (SSP5-8.5), almost
   90\% of similar to 25,000 species are at high or critical risk, with
   species at risk across 85\% of their native distributions. One tenth of
   the ocean contains ecosystems where the aggregated climate risk,
   endemism and extinction threat of their constituent species are high.
   Climate change poses the greatest risk for exploited species in
   low-income countries with a high dependence on fisheries. Mitigating
   emissions (SSP1-2.6) reduces the risk for virtually all species
   (98.2\%), enhances ecosystem stability and disproportionately benefits
   food-insecure populations in low-income countries. Our climate risk
   assessment can help prioritize vulnerable species and ecosystems for
   climate-adapted marine conservation and fisheries management efforts.},

Abstract = {Adaptive plasticity requires an integrated suite of functional responses
   to environmental variation, which can include social communication
   across life stages. Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) exhibit an
   extreme example of phenotypic plasticity called phase polyphenism, in
   which a suite of behavioral and morphological traits differ according to
   local population density. Male and female juveniles developing at low
   population densities exhibit green- or sand-colored background-matching
   camouflage, while at high densities they show contrasting yellow and
   black aposematic patterning that deters predators. The predominant
   background colors of these phenotypes (green/sand/yellow) all depend on
   expression of the carotenoid-binding ``Yellow Protein{''} (YP).
   Gregarious (high-density) adults of both sexes are initially pinkish,
   before a YP-mediated yellowing reoccurs upon sexual maturation. Yellow
   color is especially prominent in gregarious males, but the reason for
   this difference has been unknown since phase polyphenism was first
   described in 1921. Here, we use RNA interference to show that gregarious
   male yellowing acts as an intrasexual warning signal, which forms a
   multimodal signal with the antiaphrodisiac pheromone phenylacetonitrile
   (PAN) to prevent mistaken sexual harassment from other males during
   scramble mating in a swarm. Socially mediated reexpression of YP thus
   adaptively repurposes a juvenile signal that deters predators into an
   adult signal that deters undesirable mates. These findings reveal a
   previously underappreciated sexual dimension to locust phase
   polyphenism, and promote locusts as a model for investigating the
   relative contributions of natural versus sexual selection in the
   evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

Volume = {119},

Abstract = {Field biology is an area of research that involves working directly with
   living organisms in situ through a practice known as ``fieldwork.{''}
   Conducting fieldwork often requires complex logistical planning within
   multiregional or multinational teams, interacting with local communities
   at field sites, and collaborative research led by one or a few of the
   core team members. However, existing power imbalances stemming from
   geopolitical history, discrimination, and professional position, among
   other factors, perpetuate inequities when conducting these research
   endeavors. After reflecting on our own research programs, we propose
   four general principles to guide equitable, inclusive, ethical, and safe
   practices in field biology: be collaborative, be respectful, be legal,
   and be safe. Although many biologists already structure their field
   programs around these principles or similar values, executing equitable
   research practices can prove challenging and requires careful
   consideration, especially by those in positions with relatively greater
   privilege. Based on experiences and input from a diverse group of global
   collaborators, we provide suggestions for action-oriented approaches to
   make field biology more equitable, with particular attention to how
   those with greater privilege can contribute. While we acknowledge that
   not all suggestions will be applicable to every institution or program,
   we hope that they will generate discussions and provide a baseline for
   training in proactive, equitable fieldwork practices.},

Title = {Species-specific chromatin landscape determines how transposable
   elements shape genome evolution},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genetic parasites that increase
   their copy number at the expense of host fitness. The `success', or
   genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species.
   Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has
   remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously
   proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the
   inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs-the
   spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent
   sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated local enrichment of
   repressive marks, or `the epigenetic effect of TEs', in six species in
   the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of
   such effect in determining genomic TE abundance. We found that
   TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent and
   substantially varies across and even within species. While this
   TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we
   surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes
   could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi-species
   analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to
   connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated
   epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and
   genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point
   toward the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome
   evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.},

Abstract = {Body-size reductions are a pervasive response to climate change, and
   body size is a central trait linking together multiple axes of ecology,
   physiology and life history. Using a combination of three decades of
   data and controlled experiments, we show that male and female tree
   swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) have become smaller structurally, despite
   chicks growing larger under warmer nest temperatures and larger chicks
   being more likely to return as adults. We find that adult structural
   size trends are associated with warmer overwintering conditions, rather
   than the nestling period. Further, adult male body mass trends depend on
   climate conditions during spring migration; male breeding mass decreased
   by 4\%, whereas female mass was unchanged. This may be explained by the
   demands of reproduction, as lighter females produce fewer offspring.
   This work highlights the complex interactions that shape relationships
   between traits and fitness, which will be critical for predicting
   evolutionary responses in future environments.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are a major cause of environmental and economic
   disruption. While ecological factors are key determinants of their
   success, the role of genetics has been more challenging to demonstrate.
   The colonization of Australia by the European rabbit is one of the most
   iconic and devastating biological invasions in recorded history. Here,
   we show that despite numerous introductions over a 70-y period, this
   invasion was triggered by a single release of a few animals that spread
   thousands of kilometers across the continent. We found genetic support
   for historical accounts that these were English rabbits imported in 1859
   by a settler named Thomas Austin and traced the origin of the invasive
   population back to his birthplace in England. We also find evidence of
   additional introductions that established local populations but have not
   spread geographically. Combining genomic and historical data we show
   that, contrary to the earlier introductions, which consisted mostly of
   domestic animals, the invasive rabbits had wild ancestry. In New Zealand
   and Tasmania, rabbits also became a pest several decades after being
   introduced. We argue that the common denominator of these invasions was
   the arrival of a new genotype that was better adapted to the natural
   environment. These findings demonstrate how the genetic composition of
   invasive individuals can determine the success of an introduction and
   provide a mechanism by which multiple introductions can be required for
   a biological invasion.},

Abstract = {The platyrrhine family Cebidae (capuchin and squirrel monkeys) exhibit
   among the largest primate encephalization quotients. Each cebid lineage
   is also characterized by notable lineage-specific traits, with capuchins
   showing striking similarities to Hominidae such as high sensorimotor
   intelligence with tool use, advanced cognitive abilities, and behavioral
   flexibility. Here, we take a comparative genomics approach, performing
   genome-wide tests for positive selection across five cebid branches, to
   gain insight into major periods of cebid adaptive evolution. We uncover
   candidate targets of selection across cebid evolutionary history that
   may underlie the emergence of lineage-specific traits. Our analyses
   highlight shifting and sustained selective pressures on genes related to
   brain development, longevity, reproduction, and morphology, including
   evidence for cumulative and diversifying neurobiological adaptations
   across cebid evolution. In addition to generating a high-quality
   reference genome assembly for robust capuchins, our results lend to a
   better understanding of the adaptive diversification of this distinctive
   primate Glade.},

Abstract = {Variability in resource availability is hypothesized to be a significant
   driver of primate adaptation and evolution, but most paleoclimate
   proxies cannot recover environmental seasonality on the scale of an
   individual lifespan. Oxygen isotope compositions (delta O-18 values)
   sampled at high spatial resolution in the dentitions of modern African
   primates (n = 2,352 near weekly measurements from 26 teeth) track
   concurrent seasonal precipitation, regional climatic patterns, discrete
   meteorological events, and niche partitioning. We leverage these data to
   contextualize the first delta O-18 values of two 17 Ma Afropithecus
   turkanensis individuals from Kalodirr, Kenya, from which we infer
   variably bimodal wet seasons, supported by rainfall reconstructions in a
   global Earth system model. Afropithecus' delta O-18 fluctuations are
   intermediate in magnitude between those measured at high resolution in
   baboons (Papio spp.) living across a gradient of aridity and modern
   forest-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). This large-bodied
   Miocene ape consumed seasonally variable food and water sources enriched
   in O-18 compared to contemporaneous terrestrial fauna (n = 66 fossil
   specimens). Reliance on fallback foods during documented dry seasons
   potentially contributed to novel dental features long considered
   adaptations to hardobject feeding. Developmentally informed
   microsampling recovers greater ecological complexity than conventional
   isotope sampling; the two Miocene apes (n = 248 near weekly
   measurements) evince as great a range of seasonal delta O-18 variation
   as more time-averaged bulk measurements from 101 eastern African
   Plio-Pleistocene hominins and 42 papionins spanning 4 million y. These
   results reveal unprecedented environmental histories in primate teeth
   and suggest a framework for evaluating climate change and primate
   paleoecology throughout the Cenozoic.},

Abstract = {Disease transmission prediction across wildlife is crucial for risk
   assessment of emerging infectious diseases. Susceptibility of host
   species to pathogens is influenced by the geographic, environmental, and
   phylogenetic context of the specific system under study. We used machine
   learning to analyze how such variables influence pathogen incidence for
   multihost pathogen assemblages, including one of direct transmission
   (coronaviruses and bats) and two vector-borne systems (West Nile Virus
   {[}WNV] and birds, and malaria and birds). Here we show that this
   methodology is able to provide reliable global spatial susceptibility
   predictions for the studied host-pathogen systems, even when using a
   small amount of incidence information (i.e., <20\% of information in a
   database). We found that avian malaria was mostly affected by
   environmental factors and by an interaction between phylogeny and
   geography, and WNV susceptibility was mostly influenced by phylogeny and
   by the interaction between geographic and environmental distances,
   whereas coronavirus susceptibility was mostly affected by geography.
   This approach will help to direct surveillance and field efforts
   providing cost-effective decisions on where to invest limited resources.},

Title = {The origin of placental mammal life histories},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {610},
Number = {7930},
Pages = {107+},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {After the end-Cretaceous extinction, placental mammals quickly
   diversified(1), occupied key ecological niches(2,3) and increased in
   size(4,5), but this last was not true of other therians(6). The uniquely
   extended gestation of placental young(7) may have factored into their
   success and size increase(8), but reproduction style in early placentals
   remains unknown. Here we present the earliest record of a placental life
   history using palaeohistology and geochemistry, in a 62 million-year-old
   pantodont, the clade including the first mammals to achieve truly large
   body sizes. We extend the application of dental trace element
   mapping(9,10) by 60 million years, identifying chemical markers of birth
   and weaning, and calibrate these to a daily record of growth in the
   dentition. A long gestation (approximately 7 months), rapid dental
   development and short suckling interval (approximately 30-75 days) show
   that Pantolambda bathmodon was highly precocial, unlike non-placental
   mammals and known Mesozoic precursors. These results demonstrate that P.
   bathmodon reproduced like a placental and lived at a fast pace for its
   body size. Assuming that P. bathmodon reflects close placental
   relatives, our findings suggest that the ability to produce
   well-developed, precocial young was established early in placental
   evolution, and that larger neonate sizes were a possible mechanism for
   rapid size increase in early placentals.},

Title = {Polygenic signals of sex differences in selection in humans from the UK
   Biobank},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sex differences in the fitness effects of genetic variants can influence
   the rate of adaptation and the maintenance of genetic variation. For
   example, ``sexually antagonistic{''} (SA) variants, which are beneficial
   for one sex and harmful for the other, can both constrain adaptation and
   increase genetic variability for fitness components such as survival,
   fertility, and disease susceptibility. However, detecting variants with
   sex-differential fitness effects is difficult, requiring genome
   sequences and fitness measurements from large numbers of individuals.
   Here, we develop new theory for studying sex-differential selection
   across a complete life cycle and test our models with genotypic and
   reproductive success data from approximately 250,000 UK Biobank
   individuals. We uncover polygenic signals of sex-differential selection
   affecting survival, reproductive success, and overall fitness, with
   signals of sex-differential reproductive selection reflecting a
   combination of SA polymorphisms and sexually concordant polymorphisms in
   which the strength of selection differs between the sexes. Moreover,
   these signals hold up to rigorous controls that minimise the
   contributions of potential confounders, including sequence mapping
   errors, population structure, and ascertainment bias. Functional
   analyses reveal that sex-differentiated sites are enriched in
   phenotype-altering genomic regions, including coding regions and loci
   affecting a range of quantitative traits. Population genetic analyses
   show that sex-differentiated sites exhibit evolutionary histories
   dominated by genetic drift and/or transient balancing selection, but not
   long-term balancing selection, which is consistent with theoretical
   predictions of effectively weak SA balancing selection in historically
   small populations. Overall, our results are consistent with polygenic
   sex-differential-including SA-selection in humans. Evidence for
   sex-differential selection is particularly strong for variants affecting
   reproductive success, in which the potential contributions of nonrandom
   sampling to signals of sex differentiation can be excluded.},

Title = {Increased drought effects on the phenology of autumn leaf senescence},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Pages = {943+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Global warming delays the autumn date of foliar senescence (DFS) in
   recent decades, with positive implications for growing season length and
   therefore global carbon storage. However, warming-associated drought,
   leading to water limitation, may conversely stimulate earlier DFS. Using
   ground observations since 1940s and 34 years of satellite greenness data
   (1982-2015) over the Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N), we show the
   increased impact of drought on DFS. Earlier DFS is linked to decreased
   precipitation under warming and weaker drought resistance associated
   with various plant functional traits. For example, isohydric plants with
   strict regulation of water status may drop leaves fast during droughts.
   We derive an improved set of phenology models based on this influence

Abstract = {Protists are important regulators of microbial communities and key
   components in food webs with impact on nutrient cycling and ecosystem
   functioning. In turn, their activity is shaped by diverse intracellular
   parasites, including bacterial symbionts and viruses. Yet,
   bacteria-virus interactions within protists are poorly understood. Here,
   we studied the role of bacterial symbionts of free-living amoebae in the
   establishment of infections with nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses
   (Nucleocytoviricota). To investigate these interactions in a system that
   would also be relevant in nature, we first isolated and characterized a
   giant virus (Viennavirus, family Marseilleviridae) and a sympatric
   potential Acanthamoeba host infected with bacterial symbionts.
   Subsequently, coinfection experiments were carried out, using the fresh
   environmental isolates as well as additional amoeba laboratory strains.
   Employing fluorescence in situ hybridization and qPCR, we show that the
   bacterial symbiont, identified as Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, represses
   the replication of the sympatric Viennavirus in both recent
   environmental isolates as well as Acanthamoeba laboratory strains. In
   the presence of the symbiont, virions are still taken up, but viral
   factory maturation is inhibited, leading to survival of the amoeba host.
   The symbiont also suppressed the replication of the more complex
   Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus and Tupanvirus deep ocean
   (Mimiviridae). Our work provides an example of an intracellular
   bacterial symbiont protecting a protist host against virus infections.
   The impact of virus-symbiont interactions on microbial population
   dynamics and eventually ecosystem processes requires further attention.},

Abstract = {Selection accumulates information in the genome-it guides stochastically
   evolving populations toward states (genotype frequencies) that would be
   unlikely under neutrality. This can be quantified as the
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the actual distribution of
   genotype frequencies and the corresponding neutral distribution. First,
   we show that this population-level information sets an upper bound on
   the information at the level of genotype and phenotype, limiting how
   precisely they can be specified by selection. Next, we study how the
   accumulation and maintenance of information is limited by the cost of
   selection, measured as the genetic load or the relative fitness
   variance, both of which we connect to the control-theoretic KL cost of
   control. The information accumulation rate is upper bounded by the
   population size times the cost of selection. This bound is very general,
   and applies across models (Wright-Fisher, Moran, diffusion) and to
   arbitrary forms of selection, mutation, and recombination. Finally, the
   cost of maintaining information depends on how it is encoded: Specifying
   a single allele out of two is expensive, but one bit encoded among many
   weakly specified loci (as in a polygenic trait) is cheap.},

Title = {Environmental context dependency in species interactions},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Number = {36},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Ecological interactions are not uniform across time and can vary with
   environmental conditions. Yet, interactions among species are often
   measured with short-term controlled experiments whose outcomes can
   depend greatly on the particular environmental conditions under which
   they are performed. As an alternative, we use empirical dynamic modeling
   to estimate species interactions across a wide range of environmental
   conditions directly from existing long-term monitoring data. In our case
   study from a southern California kelp forest, we test whether
   interactions between multiple kelp and sea urchin species can be
   reliably reconstructed from time-series data and whether those
   interactions vary predictably in strength and direction across observed
   fluctuations in temperature, disturbance, and low-frequency
   oceanographic regimes. We show that environmental context greatly alters
   the strength and direction of species interactions. In particular, the
   state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation seems to drive the
   competitive balance between kelp species, asserting bottom-up control on
   kelp ecosystem dynamics. We show the importance of specifically studying
   variation in interaction strength, rather than mean interaction
   outcomes, when trying to understand the dynamics of complex ecosystems.
   The significant context dependency in species interactions found in this
   study argues for a greater utilization of long-term data and empirical
   dynamic modeling in studies of the dynamics of other ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Recombination of antibody genes in B cells can involve distant genomic
   loci and contribute a foreign antigen-binding element to form hybrid
   antibodies with broad reactivity for Plasmodium falciparum. So far,
   antibodies containing the extracellular domain of the LAIR1 and LILRB1
   receptors represent unique examples of cross-chromosomal antibody
   diversification. Here, we devise a technique to profile non-VDJ elements
   from distant genes in antibody transcripts. Independent of the
   preexposure of donors to malaria parasites, non-VDJ inserts were
   detected in 80\% of individuals at frequencies of 1 in 10(4) to 10(5) B
   cells. We detected insertions in heavy, but not in light chain or T cell
   receptor transcripts. We classify the insertions into four types
   depending on the insert origin and destination: 1) mitochondrial and 2)
   nuclear DNA inserts integrated at VDJ junctions; 3) inserts originating
   from telomere proximal genes; and 4) fragile sites incorporated between
   J-to-constant junctions. The latter class of inserts was exclusively
   found in memory and in in vitro activated B cells, while all other
   classes were already detected in naive B cells. More than 10\% of
   inserts preserved the reading frame, including transcripts with signs of
   antigen-driven affinity maturation. Collectively, our study unravels a
   mechanism of antibody diversification that is layered on the classical
   V(D)J and switch recombination.},

Abstract = {Insular woodiness (IW)-the evolutionary transition from herbaceousness
   toward wood-iness on islands-is one of the most iconic features of
   island floras. Since pioneering work by Darwin and Wallace, a number of
   drivers of IW have been proposed, such as 1) competition for sunlight
   requiring plants with taller and stronger woody stems and 2) drought
   favoring woodiness to safeguard root-to-shoot water transport.
   Alternatively, IW may be the indirect result of increased lifespan
   related to 3) a favorable aseasonal cli-mate and/or 4) a lack of large
   native herbivores. However, information on the occurrence of IW is
   fragmented, hampering tests of these potential drivers. Here, we
   identify 1,097 insular woody species on 375 islands and infer at least
   175 evolutionary transitions on 31 archipelagos, concentrated in six
   angiosperm families. Structural equation models reveal that the insular
   woody species richness on oceanic islands correlates with a favor-able
   aseasonal climate, followed by increased drought and island isolation
   (approximat-ing competition). When continental islands are also
   included, reduced herbivory pressure by large native mammals, increased
   drought, and island isolation are most rele-vant. Our results illustrate
   different trajectories leading to rampant convergent evolution toward IW
   and further emphasize archipelagos as natural laboratories of evolution,
   where similar abiotic or biotic conditions replicated evolution of
   similar traits.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary profiling has been largely limited to the nucleotide level.
   Using consistent proteomic methods, we quantified proteomic and
   phosphoproteomic layers in fibroblasts from 11 common mammalian species,
   with transcriptomes as reference. Covariation analysis indicates that
   transcript and protein expression levels and variabilities across
   mammals remarkably follow functional role, with extracellular
   matrix-associated expression being the most variable, demonstrating
   strong transcriptome-proteome coevolution. The biological variability of
   gene expression is universal at both interindividual and interspecies
   scales but to a different extent. RNA metabolic processes particularly
   show higher interspecies versus interindividual variation. Our results
   further indicate that while the ubiquitin-proteasome system is strongly
   conserved in mammals, lysosome-mediated protein degradation exhibits
   remarkable variation between mammalian lineages. In addition, the
   phosphosite profiles reveal a phosphorylation coevolution network
   independent of protein abundance.},

Title = {Coevolution of the Ess1-CTD axis in polar fungi suggests a role for
   phase separation in cold tolerance},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {36},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Most of the world's biodiversity lives in cold (-2 degrees to 4 degrees
   C) and hypersaline environments. To understand how cells adapt to such
   conditions, we isolated two key components of the transcription
   machinery from fungal species that live in extreme polar environments:
   the Ess1 prolyl isomerase and its target, the carboxy-terminal domain
   (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Polar Ess1 enzymes are conserved and
   functional in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By contrast,
   polar CTDs diverge from the consensus (YSPTSPS)(26) and are not fully
   functional in S. cerevisiae. These CTDs retain the critical Ess1 Ser-Pro
   target motifs, but substitutions at Y1, T4, and S7 profoundly affected
   their ability to undergo phase separation in vitro and localize in vivo.
   We propose that environmentally tuned phase separation by the CTD and
   other intrinsically disordered regions plays an adaptive role in cold
   tolerance by concentrating enzymes and substrates to overcome energetic
   barriers to metabolic activity.},

Abstract = {Donkeys transformed human history as essential beasts of burden for
   long-distance movement, especially across semi-arid and upland
   environments. They remain insufficiently studied despite globally
   expanding and providing key support to low- to middle-income
   communities. To elucidate their domestication history, we constructed a
   comprehensive genome panel of 207 modern and 31 ancient donkeys, as well
   as 15 wild equids. We found a strong phylogeographic structure in modern
   donkeys that supports a single domestication in Africa similar to 5000
   BCE, followed by further expansions in this continent and Eurasia and
   ultimately returning to Africa. We uncover a previously unknown genetic
   lineage in the Levant similar to 200 BCE, which contributed increasing
   ancestry toward Asia. Donkey management involved inbreeding and the
   production of giant bloodlines at a time when mules were essential to
   the Roman economy and military.},

Abstract = {Parasites impose fitness costs on their hosts. Biologists often assume
   that natural selection favors infection-resistant hosts. Yet, when the
   immune response itself is costly, theory suggests that selection may
   sometimes favor loss of resistance, which may result in alternative
   stable states where some populations are resistant and others are
   tolerant. Intraspecific variation in immune costs is rarely surveyed in
   a manner that tests evolutionary patterns, and there are few examples of
   adaptive loss of resistance. Here, we show that when marine threespine
   stickleback colonized freshwater lakes, they gained resistance to the
   freshwater-associated cestode Schistocephalus solidus. Extensive
   peritoneal fibrosis and inflammation are a commonly observed phenotype
   that contributes to suppression of cestode growth and viability but also
   imposes a substantial cost on fecundity. Combining genetic mapping and
   population genomics, we find that opposing selection generates immune
   system differences between tolerant and resistant populations,
   consistent with divergent optimization.},

Abstract = {The deep structural diversity of languages suggests that our language
   capacities are not based on any single template but rather on an
   underlying ability and motivation for infants to acquire a culturally
   transmitted system. The hypothesis is that this ability has an
   interactional base that has discernable precursors in other primates. In
   this paper, I explore a specific evolutionary route for the most
   puzzling aspect of this interactional base in humans, namely the
   development of an empathetic intentional stance. The route involves a
   generalization of mother-infant interaction patterns to all adults via a
   process (cuteness selection) analogous to, but distinct from, RA
   Fisher's runaway sexual selection. This provides a cornerstone for the
   carrying capacity for language.This article is part of the theme issue

Title = {Great ape communication as contextual social inference: a computational

Year = {2022},
Volume = {377},

Abstract = {Human communication has been described as a contextual social inference
   process. Research into great ape communication has been inspired by this
   view to look for the evolutionary roots of the social, cognitive and
   interactional processes involved in human communication. This approach
   has been highly productive, yet it is partly compromised by the
   widespread focus on how great apes use and understand individual
   signals. This paper introduces a computational model that formalizes
   great ape communication as a multi-faceted social inference process that
   integrates (a) information contained in the signals that make up an
   utterance, (b) the relationship between communicative partners and (c)
   the social context. This model makes accurate qualitative and
   quantitative predictions about real-world communicative interactions
   between semi-wild-living chimpanzees. When enriched with a pragmatic
   reasoning process, the model explains repeatedly reported differences
   between humans and great apes in the interpretation of ambiguous signals
   (e.g. pointing or iconic gestures). This approach has direct
   implications for observational and experimental studies of great ape
   communication and provides a new tool for theorizing about the evolution
   of uniquely human communication.This article is part of the theme issue

Abstract = {Communicative repair is a fundamental and universal element of
   interactive language use. It has been suggested that the persistence and
   elaboration after communicative breakdown in nonhuman primates
   constitute two evolutionary building blocks of this capacity, but the
   conditions favouring it are poorly understood. Because zoo-housed
   individuals of some species are more social and more terrestrial than in
   the wild, they should be more likely to show gestural redoings (i.e.
   both repetition and elaboration) after communicative failure in the
   coordination of their joint activities. Using a large comparative sample
   of wild and zoo-housed orang-utans of two different species, we could
   confirm this prediction for elaboration, the more flexible form of
   redoings. Specifically, results showed that gestural redoings in general
   were best predicted by the specific social action context (i.e. social
   play) and interaction dyad (i.e. beyond mother-offspring), although they
   were least frequent in captive Bornean orang-utans. For gestural
   elaboration, we found the expected differences between captive and wild
   research settings in Borneans, but not in Sumatrans (the more socially
   tolerant species). Moreover, we found that the effectiveness of
   elaboration in eliciting responses was higher in Sumatrans, especially
   the captive ones, whereas effectiveness of mere repetition was
   influenced by neither species nor setting. We conclude that the
   socio-ecological environment plays a central role in the emergence of
   communicative repair strategies in great apes.This article is part of
   the theme issue `Revisiting the human `interaction engine': comparative

Abstract = {Human interactions are organized in sequence, which is a key component
   of Levinson's `interaction engine.' Referring back to the field where it
   originated, conversation analysis, we discuss its relevance within the
   interaction engine, before moving on to show how sequence organization
   is actually oriented to not only humans in social interaction, but also
   to non-human animals. On the basis of video-recorded encounters between
   baboons (Papio anubis), we study canonical sequences constituting
   openings and, within them, greetings. Openings are the locus where
   future interactants adjust to each other to coordinately enter in
   interaction, thus achieving a common definition of their context,
   activity, and relationships. The analysis shows that the ways
   individuals spatially approach each other provide systematic
   interactional affordances for how the first sequences of actions in the
   opening are formatted, initiated, and responded to. Adopting sequential
   multimodal analysis, we demonstrate how participants orient to central
   features of sequence organization-its sequential implicativeness and the
   expectations it produces-building on them their interpretations of
   others' actions, their responsivity, and their mutual understanding of
   the ongoing course of action as it unfolds. This paves the way for
   further reflections on the pervasiveness of the interactional engine in
   human and non-human primate communication.This article is part of the

Title = {The Daphnia carapace and other novel structures evolved via the cryptic
   persistence of serial homologs},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},

Abstract = {Understanding how novel structures arise is a central question in
   evolution. Novel structures are often defined as structures that are not
   derived from (homologous to) any structure in the ancestor.(1) The
   carapace of the crustacean Daphnia magna is a bivalved ``cape `` of
   exoskeleton. Shiga et al.(2) proposed that the carapace of crustaceans
   like Daphnia and many other plate-like outgrowths in arthropods are
   novel structures that arose through the repeated co-option of genes like
   vestigial that also pattern insect wings.(2-4) To determine whether the
   Daphnia carapace is a novel structure, we compare previous functional
   work(2) with the expression of genes known to pattern the proximal leg
   region (pannier, araucan, and vestigial)(5,6) between Daphnia, Parhyale,
   and Tribolium. Our results suggest that the Daphnia carapace did not
   arise by co-option but instead derived from an exite (lateral leg lobe)
   that emerges from an ancestral proximal leg segment that was
   incorporated into the Daphnia body wall. The Daphnia carapace,
   therefore, appears to be homologous to the Parhyale tergal plate and the
   insect wing.(5) Remarkably, the vestigial-positive tissue that gives
   rise to the Daphnia carapace appears to be present in Parhyale(7) and
   Tribolium as a small, inconspicuous protrusion. Thus, rather than a
   novel structure resulting from gene co-option, the Daphnia carapace
   appears to have arisen from a shared, ancestral tissue (morphogenetic
   field) that persists in a cryptic state in other arthropod lineages.
   Cryptic persistence of unrecognized serial homologs may thus be a
   general solution for the origin of novel structures.},

Title = {Foraging range scales with colony size in high-latitude seabirds},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3800+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Density-dependent prey depletion around breeding colonies has long been
   considered an important factor controlling the population dynamics of
   colonial animals.(1-4) Ashmole proposed that as seabird colony size
   increases, intraspecific competition leads to declines in reproductive
   success, as breeding adults must spend more time and energy to find prey
   farther from the colony.(1) Seabird colony size often varies over
   several orders of magnitude within the same species and can include
   millions of individuals per colony.(5,6) As such, colony size likely
   plays an important role in determining the individual behavior of its
   members and how the colony interacts with the surrounding
   environment.(6) Using tracking data from murres (Uria spp.), the world's
   most densely breeding seabirds, we show that the distribution of
   foraging-trip distances scales to colony size(0.33) during the
   chick-rearing stage, consistent with Ashmole's halo theory.(1,2) This
   pattern occurred across colonies varying in size over three orders of
   magnitude and distributed throughout the North Atlantic region. The
   strong relationship between colony size and foraging range means that
   the foraging areas of some colonial species can be estimated from colony
   sizes, which is more practical to measure over a large geographic scale.
   Two-thirds of the North Atlantic murre population breed at the 16
   largest colonies; by extrapolating the predicted foraging ranges to
   sites without tracking data, we show that only two of these large
   colonies have significant coverage as marine protected areas. Our
   results are an important example of how theoretical models, in this
   case, Ashmole's version of central-place-foraging theory, can be applied
   to inform conservation and management in colonial breeding species.},

Abstract = {Although scales are a defining and conspicuous feature of moths and
   butterflies (Lepidoptera),(1-3 )their earliest evolution predates the
   group but is shrouded by a dearth of fossil evidence. Herein, we report
   two new species in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, representing lineages
   closely related to Lepidoptera: one represents the extinct Tarachoptera,
   with dense scales on the fore-and hindwings, while the other is an early
   lineage of caddisflies, with a hindwing covered by a single layer of
   angustifoliate scales. A novel phylogenetic analysis of 174
   morphological characters and 73 extant and fossil representatives of
   Mecopterida demonstrates a monophyletic origin of scales in the common
   ancestor of Tarachoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera; that
   Tarachoptera are monophyletic but their scale morphology is
   plesiomorphic for the whole group; and that scales were lost early in
   caddisfly evolution before reappearing multiple times within the clade.
   Collectively, these fossils provide clarity into the origin and early
   evolution of scales before their diversification among the moths and
   butterflies.},

Abstract = {The origin and early diversification of jawed vertebrates involved major
   changes to skeletal and soft anatomy. Skeletal transformations can be
   examined directly by studying fossil stem gnathostomes; however,
   preservation of soft anatomy is rare. We describe the only known example
   of a three-dimensionally mineralized heart, thick-walled stomach, and
   bilobed liver from arthrodire placoderms, stem gnathostomes from the
   Late Devonian Gogo Formation in Western Australia. The application of
   synchrotron and neutron microtomography to this material shows evidence
   of a flat S-shaped heart, which is well separated from the liver and
   other abdominal organs, and the absence of lungs. Arthrodires thus show
   the earliest phylogenetic evidence for repositioning of the gnathostome
   heart associated with the evolution of the complex neck region in jawed
   vertebrates.},

Abstract = {The gut microbiomes of human populations worldwide have many core
   microbial species in common. However, within a species, some strains can
   show remarkable population specificity. The question is whether such
   specificity arises from a shared evolutionary history
   (codiversification) between humans and their microbes. To test for
   codiversification of host and microbiota, we analyzed paired gut
   metagenomes and human genomes for 1225 individuals in Europe, Asia, and
   Africa, including mothers and their children. Between and within
   countries, a parallel evolutionary history was evident for humans and
   their gut microbes. Moreover, species displaying the strongest
   codiversification independently evolved traits characteristic of host
   dependency, including reduced genomes and oxygen and temperature
   sensitivity. These findings all point to the importance of understanding
   the potential role of population-specific microbial strains in
   microbiome-mediated disease phenotypes.},

Title = {Lost in translation: Molecular basis of reduced flower coloration in a

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Phenotypic evolution is usually attributed to changes in protein
   function or gene transcription. In principle, mutations that affect
   protein abundance through enhancing or attenuating protein translation
   also could be an important source for phenotypic evolution. However,
   these types of mutations remain largely unexplored in the studies of
   phenotypic variation in nature. Through fine-scale genetic mapping and
   functional interrogation, we identify a single nucleotide substitution
   in an anthocyanin-activating R2R3-MYB gene causing flower color
   variation between a pair of closely related monkeyflower (Mimulus)
   species, the hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis, and
   self-pollinated Mimulus parishii. This causal mutation is located in the
   5' untranslated region and generates an upstream ATG start codon,
   leading to attenuated protein translation and reduced flower coloration
   in the self-pollinated species. Together, our results provide empirical
   support for the role of mutations affecting protein translation, as
   opposed to protein function or transcript level, in natural phenotypic
   variation.},

Title = {Temporal gene expression patterns in the coral Euphyllia paradivisa
   reveal the complexity of biological clocks in the cnidarian-algal
   symbiosis},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {37},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Studying chronobiology in reef-building corals is challenging due to the
   tightly coupled symbiosis with their photosynthetic algae,
   Symbiodiniaceae. Although symbiosis requires metabolic synchronization
   and coordination of cellular processes in the holobiont, the cross-talk
   between the host and symbiont's clocks is still puzzling. Here, we use
   the mesophotic coral Euphyllia paradivisa to examine temporal gene
   expression patterns in symbiotic and aposymbiotic morphs exposed to
   natural light/dark cycles and constant darkness. Our comparative
   transcriptomic analyses revealed circadian and circatidal cycles of gene
   expression with a predominant diel pattern in both coral morphs. We
   found a substantial number of transcripts consistently rhythmic under
   both light conditions, including genes likely involved in the
   cnidarians' circadian clock, thus indicating that an endogenous clock,
   which can oscillate independently from the Symbiodiniaceae clock, exists
   in E. paradivisa. The analysis further manifests the remarkable impacts
   of symbiosis on transcriptional rhythms and implies that the algae's
   presence influences the host's biorhythm.},

Title = {Ambush predation and the origin of euprimates},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {37},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Primates of modern aspect (euprimates) are characterized by a suite of
   characteristics (e.g., convergent orbits, grasping hands and feet,
   reduced claws, and leaping), but the selective pressures responsible for
   the evolution of these euprimate characteristics have long remained
   controversial. Here, we used a molecular phyloecological approach to
   determine the diet of the common ancestor of living primates (CALP), and
   the results showed that the CALP had increased carnivory. Given the
   carnivory of the CALP, along with the general observation that orbital
   convergence is largely restricted to ambush predators, our study
   suggests that the euprimate characteristics could have been more
   specifically adapted for ambush predation. In particular, our behavior
   experiment further shows that nonclaw climbing can significantly reduce
   noises, which could benefit the ancestral euprimates' stalking to ambush
   their prey in trees. Therefore, our study suggests that the distinctive
   euprimate characteristics may have evolved as their specialized
   adaptation for ambush predation in arboreal environments.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat loss and climate change are reducing species'
   geographic ranges, increasing extinction risk and losses of species'
   genetic diversity. Although preserving genetic diversity is key to
   maintaining species' adaptability, we lack predictive tools and global
   estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. We introduce a
   mathematical framework that bridges biodiversity theory and population
   genetics to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations
   with decreasing habitat. By analyzing genomic variation of 10,095
   georeferenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that
   genome-wide diversity follows a mutations-area relationship power law
   with geographic area, which can predict genetic diversity loss from
   local population extinctions. We estimate that more than 10\% of genetic
   diversity may already be lost for many threatened and nonthreatened
   species, surpassing the United Nations' post-2020 targets for genetic
   preservation.},

Abstract = {Deadwood is a large global carbon store with its store size partially
   determined by biotic decay. Microbial wood decay rates are known to
   respond to changing temperature and precipitation. Termites are also
   important decomposers in the tropics but are less well studied. An
   understanding of their climate sensitivities is needed to estimate
   climate change effects on wood carbon pools. Using data from 133 sites
   spanning six continents, we found that termite wood discovery and
   consumption were highly sensitive to temperature (with decay increasing
   >6.8 times per 10 degrees C increase in temperature)-even more so than
   microbes. Termite decay effects were greatest in tropical seasonal
   forests, tropical savannas, and subtropical deserts. With
   tropicalization (i.e., warming shifts to tropical climates), termite
   wood decay will likely increase as termites access more of Earth's
   surface.},

Title = {The genetic architecture of phenotypic diversity in the Betta fish
   (Betta splendens)},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The Betta fish displays a remarkable variety of phenotypes selected
   during domestication. However, the genetic basis underlying these traits
   remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a high-quality genome
   assembly and resequencing of 727 individuals representing diverse
   morphotypes of the Betta fish. We show that current breeds have a
   complex domestication history with extensive introgression with wild
   species. Using a genome-wide association study, we identify the genetic
   basis of multiple traits, including coloration patterns, the ``Dumbo{''}
   phenotype with pectoral fin outgrowth, extraordinary enlargement of body
   size that we map to a major locus on chromosome 8, the sex determination
   locus that we map to dmrt1, and the long-fin phenotype that maps to the
   locus containing kcnj15. We also identify a polygenic signal related to
   aggression, involving multiple neural system-related genes such as
   esyt2, apbb2, and pank2. Our study provides a resource for developing
   the Betta fish as a genetic model for morphological and behavioral
   research in vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Spiders, the most specious taxon of predators, have evolved an
   astounding range of predatory strategies, including group hunting,
   specialized silk traps, pheromone-loaded bolas, and aggressive mimicry.
   Spiders that hunt prey defended with behavioral, mechanical, or chemical
   means are under additional selection pressure to avoid injury and death.
   Ants are considered dangerous because they can harm or kill their
   predators, but some groups of spiders, such as the Theridiidae, have a
   very high diversification of ant-hunting species and strategies {[}J.
   Liu et al., Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 94, 658-675 (2016)]. Here, we provide
   detailed behavioral analyses of the highly acrobatic Australian
   ant-slayer spider, Euryopis umbilicata (Theridiidae), that captures much
   larger and defended Camponotus ants on vertical tree trunks. The hunting
   sequence consists of ritualized steps performed within split seconds,
   resulting in an exceptionally high prey capture success rate.},

Abstract = {Gestures play an essential role in primate communication. However,
   little is known about how complexity of gestural use (in terms of
   repertoire size, intentional use, flexibility and use of gestural
   sequences) relates to individual and dyadic measures of sociality and
   whether more complex gestural use is more effective in eliciting a
   response. We observed 19 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 16
   Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) and 18 siamangs (Symphalangus
   syndactylus) to assess the complexity and effectiveness of their
   gestural use. We found that, beyond interspecies variation, the number
   of gesture types used in a dyad was higher when individuals had stronger
   social bonds; the probability of accounting for others' attention
   increased with age, especially for visual gestures; and sequences were
   more likely used by younger or socially less integrated individuals. In
   terms of effectiveness, older individuals and those using fewer
   sequences were more likely to be responded to, while across dyads, the
   probability of obtaining a response was higher when both individuals
   accounted for the other's attention and when they used fewer sequences.
   Overall, this confirms the link between sociality and complex gestural
   use and suggests that more complex forms of communication, at least in
   terms of intentional use, may be more effective at achieving
   communicative goals.This article is part of the theme issue `Cognition,
   communication and social bonds in primates'.},

Title = {Thermal imaging reveals social monitoring during social feeding in wild

Abstract = {Understanding the affective lives of animals has been a long-standing
   challenge in science. Recent technological progress in infrared thermal
   imaging has enabled researchers to monitor animals' physiological states
   in real-time when exposed to ecologically relevant situations, such as
   feeding in the company of others. During social feeding, an individual's
   physiological states are likely to vary with the nature of the resource
   and perceptions of competition. Previous findings in chimpanzees have
   indicated that events perceived as competitive cause decreases in nasal
   temperatures, whereas the opposite was observed for cooperative
   interactions. Here, we tested how food resources and audience structure
   impacted on how social feeding events were perceived by wild
   chimpanzees. Overall, we found that nasal temperatures were lower when
   meat was consumed as compared to figs, consistent with the idea that
   social feeding on more contested resources is perceived as more
   dangerous and stressful. Nasal temperatures were significant affected by
   interactions between food type and audience composition, in particular
   the number of males, their dominance status, and their social bond
   status relative to the subject, while no effects for the presence of
   females were observed. Our findings suggest that male chimpanzees
   closely monitor and assess their social environment during competitive
   situations, and that infrared imaging provides an important complement
   to access psychological processes beyond observable social
   behaviours.This article is part of the theme issue `Cognition,
   communication and social bonds in primates'.},

Abstract = {The `social complexity hypothesis' posits that complex social systems
   (which entail high uncertainty) require complex communicative systems
   (with high vocal flexibility). In species with fission-fusion dynamics,
   where the fluid composition of temporary subgroups increases the
   uncertainty with which group members must manage their social
   relationships, vocal communication must be particularly flexible. This
   study assessed whether contact call rates vary with caller and audience
   characteristics in free-living spider monkeys, as well as with fission
   and fusion events. Adult females and immature individuals called more
   when in small audience settings, while audience size did not influence
   adult males. Adults called more when in the presence of the opposite
   sex, whereas immatures vocalized more in subgroups composed only by
   females. Females also called more when with their mature sons. We found
   higher call rates in periods during which fission and fusion events took
   place than in periods with more stable compositions and when the
   composition after a fission or fusion event changed from one sex to two
   sexes. A flexible use of contact calls allows individuals to identify
   themselves when they join others, particularly if they are members of
   the opposite sex. This socio-spatial cohesion function reduces the
   uncertainty about subgroup composition.This article is part of the theme
   issue `Cognition, communication and social bonds in primates'.},

Abstract = {Ambiguity in communicative signals may lead to misunderstandings and
   thus reduce the effectiveness of communication, especially in
   unpredictable interactions such as between closely matched rivals or
   those with a weak social bond. Therefore, signals used in these
   circumstances should be less ambiguous, more stereotyped and more
   intense. To test this prediction, we measured facial movements of
   crested macaques (Macaca nigra) during spontaneous social interaction,
   using the Facial Action Coding System for macaques (MaqFACS). We used
   linear mixed models to assess whether facial movement intensity and
   variability varied according to the interaction outcome, the
   individuals' dominance relationship and their social bond. Movements
   were least intense and most variable in affiliative contexts, and more
   intense in interactions between individuals who were closely matched in
   terms of dominance rating. We found no effect of social bond strength.
   Our findings provide evidence for a reduction in ambiguity of facial
   behaviour in risky social situations but do not demonstrate any
   mitigating effect of social relationship quality. The results indicate
   that the ability to modify communicative signals may play an important
   role in navigating complex primate social interactions.This article is

Abstract = {The evolution of language has fascinated anthropologists, psychologists
   and biologists for centuries, seeking to infer language origins from the
   communication of primates, our closest living relatives. Capacity for
   intentional signalling is a key feature of transition to language in our
   hominin ancestors, facilitating complex social dynamics in complex
   social groups. However whether vocal, gestural and bimodal signals are
   differentiated according to intentional use and hence complex sociality
   has not been studied, making unclear the modality of language evolution.
   We addressed this question in wild chimpanzees. We found that larger
   social network size was associated with a larger network of gestural but
   not vocal or bimodal signals. Response waiting was more common in
   association with gestures than vocalizations, but elaborations were more
   common in vocal than gestural or bimodal signals. Overall, chimpanzees
   were more likely to manage weak social bonds through vocalizations,
   whereas strong social bonds were managed through gestures and bimodal
   signals. However, when social bonds were weak, gestures accompanied by
   response waiting were more likely to elicit approaches than
   vocalizations accompanied by elaboration, which elicited avoidance. This
   suggests that gestures were the primary modality of language evolution
   and that the use of more sophisticated gestural signalling led to
   evolution of complex social groups of hominin ancestors.This article is

Volume = {377},

Abstract = {The endemic lemurs of Madagascar (Lemuriformes: Primates) exhibit great
   social and communicative diversity. Given their independent evolutionary
   history, lemurs provide an excellent opportunity to identify fundamental
   principles in the coevolution of social and communicative traits. We
   conducted comparative phylogenetic analyses to examine patterns of
   interspecific variation among measures of social complexity and
   repertoire sizes in the vocal, olfactory and visual modality, while
   controlling for environmental factors such as habitat and number of
   sympatric species. We also examined potential trade-offs in signal
   evolution as well as coevolution between body mass or brain size and
   communicative complexity. Repertoire sizes in the vocal, olfactory and
   visual modality correlated positively with group size, but not with
   environmental factors. Evolutionary changes in social complexity
   presumably antedated corresponding changes in communicative complexity.
   There was no trade-off in the evolution of signals in different
   modalities and neither body mass nor brain size correlated with any
   repertoire size. Hence, communicative complexity coevolved with social
   complexity across different modalities, possibly to service social
   relationships flexibly and effectively in pair- and group-living
   species. Our analyses shed light on the requirements and adaptive
   possibilities in the coevolution of core elements of social organization
   and social structure in a basal primate lineage.This article is part of

Abstract = {Compared to other animals, humans supposedly excel at voluntarily
   controlling and strategically displaying emotional signals. Yet, new
   data shows that nonhuman great apes' emotion expressions may also be
   subject to voluntary control. A key context to further explore this is
   during post-conflict (PC) periods, where signalling by distressed
   victims may influence bystander responses, including the offering of
   consolation. To address this, our study investigates the signalling
   behaviour of sanctuary-living bonobo victims following aggression and
   its relation to audience composition and PC interactions. Results show
   that the production of paedomorphic signals by victims (regardless of
   age) increased their chances of receiving consolation. In adults, the
   production of such signals additionally reduced the risk of renewed
   aggression from opponents. Signal production also increased with
   audience size, yet strategies differed by age: while immatures reduced
   signalling in proximity of close-social partners, adults did so
   especially after receiving consolation. These results suggest that
   bonobos can flexibly adjust their emotion signalling to influence the
   outcome of PC events, and that this tendency has a developmental
   trajectory. Overall, these findings highlight the potential role that
   flexible emotion communication played in the sociality of our last
   common ancestor with Pan.This article is part of the theme issue

Abstract = {Examining the links between intentional communication and social
   relationships provides insights into the cognitive skills needed to
   manage a differentiated set of social bonds. Great apes gesture
   intentionally, but how this intentionality relates to sociality is still
   unclear. Stress in the form of dominant audience members inhibits
   understanding of intentions, downgrading cognition to understanding of
   behaviour, but intentional communication may enable social bonding in
   stressful conditions. We examined the associations between gestural
   communication, sociality, stress and the outcome of interactions in wild
   chimpanzees. Social network size was positively associated with
   intentional but not non-intentional communication. When a dominant
   bystander was present with whom the recipient was weakly bonded, and
   gesturing was non-intentional, recipients produced avoidance response
   toward signallers to whom they were weakly bonded, indicating
   understanding of behaviour. Signallers used intentional gestures more
   frequently to recipients who were stressed, and intentional gestures
   evoked approach behaviour by the recipients, indicating understanding of
   intentionality. These results suggest that the presence of dominant
   bystanders is stressful, inhibiting understanding of intentionality.
   However, intentional gestures facilitate social bonding by allowing
   understanding of intentions. The cognitive skills underpinning
   intentional gestures may therefore play a key role in enabling primates
   to meet the demands of sociality.This article is part of the theme issue

Abstract = {Characterizing non-human primate social complexity and its cognitive
   bases has proved challenging. Using principal component analyses, we
   show that primate social, ecological and reproductive behaviours
   condense into two components: socioecological complexity (including most
   social and ecological variables) and reproductive cooperation
   (comprising mainly a suite of behaviours associated with pairbonded
   monogamy). We contextualize these results using a meta-analysis of 44
   published analyses of primate brain evolution. These studies yield two
   main consistent results: cognition, sociality and cooperative behaviours
   are associated with absolute brain volume, neocortex size and neocortex
   ratio, whereas diet composition and life history are consistently
   associated with relative brain size. We use a path analysis to evaluate
   the causal relationships among these variables, demonstrating that
   social group size is predicted by the neocortex, whereas ecological
   traits are predicted by the volume of brain structures other than the
   neocortex. That a range of social and technical behaviours covary, and
   are correlated with social group size and brain size, suggests that
   primate cognition has evolved along a continuum resulting in an
   increasingly flexible, domain-general capacity to solve a range of
   socioecological challenges culminating in a capacity for, and reliance
   on, innovation and social information use in the great apes and humans.

Abstract = {Pelagic fauna is expected to be impacted under climate change according
   to ecosystem simulations. However, the direction and magnitude of the
   impact is still uncertain and still not corroborated by
   observation-based statistical studies. Here we compile a global
   underwater sonar database and 20 ocean climate projections to predict
   the future distribution of sound-scattering fauna around the world's
   oceans. We show that global pelagic fauna will be seriously compromised
   by the end of the twenty-first century if we continue under the current
   greenhouse emission scenario. Low and mid latitudes are expected to lose
   from 3\% to 22\% of animal biomass due to the expansion of
   low-productive systems, while higher latitudes would be populated by
   present-day temperate fauna, supporting results from ecosystem
   simulations. We further show that strong mitigation measures to contain
   global warming below 2 degrees C would reduce these impacts to less than
   half.},

Abstract = {Plasticity enhances species fitness and survival under climate change.
   Ocean acidification poses a potential threat to copepods, a major
   zooplankton group that serves as a key link between the lower and higher
   trophic levels in the marine environment, yet the mechanisms underlying
   different adaptive responses remain poorly understood. Here we show that
   although elevated CO2 can exert negative effects on reproduction of
   Paracyclopina nana, multigenerational plasticity can enable recovery
   after three generations. By integrating the methylome and transcriptome
   with the draft genome and undertaking DNA methylation treatments, we
   demonstrate the vital role of epigenetic modifications in ocean
   acidification responses and identify regions associated with
   reproductive resilience. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation
   might play an important role in enhancing species fitness of copepods
   and that failing to consider phenotypic plasticity could lead to
   overestimation of species' vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Temperature drives global ocean patterns of biodiversity, shaping
   thermal niches through thresholds of thermal tolerance. Global warming
   is predicted to change thermal range bounds, yet research has primarily
   focused on temperature at the sea surface, while knowledge of changes
   through the depths of the water column is lacking. Here, using daily
   observations from ocean sites and model simulations, we track shifts in
   ocean temperatures, focusing on the emergence of thermal ranges whose
   future lower bounds exceed current upper bounds. These emerge below 50 m
   depth as early as similar to 2040 with high anthropogenic emissions, yet
   are delayed several decades for reduced emission scenarios. By 2100,
   concomitant changes in both lower and upper boundaries can expose
   pelagic ecosystems to thermal environments never experienced before.
   These results suggest the redistribution of marine species might differ
   across depth, highlighting a much more complex picture of the impact of
   climate change on marine ecosystems.},

Title = {Conformity in mate choice, the overlooked social component of animal and
   human culture},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1},
Pages = {132-149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although conformity as a major driver for human cultural evolution is a
   well-accepted and intensely studied phenomenon, its importance for
   non-human animal culture has been largely overlooked until recently.
   This limited for decades the possibility of studying the roots of human
   culture. Here, we provide a historical review of the study of conformity
   in both humans and non-human animals. We identify gaps in knowledge and
   propose an evolutionary route towards the sophisticated cultural
   processes that characterize humanity. A landmark in the study of
   conformity is Solomon Asch's famous experiment on humans in 1955. By
   contrast, interest in conformity among evolutionary biologists has only
   become salient since the turn of the new millennium. A striking result
   of our review is that, although studies of conformity have examined many
   biological contexts, only one looked at mate choice. This is surprising
   because mate choice is probably the only context in which conformity has
   self-reinforcing advantages across generations. Within a metapopulation,
   i.e. a group of subpopulations connected by dispersing individuals,
   dispersers able to conform to the local preference for a given type of
   mate have a strong and multigenerational fitness advantage. This is
   because once females within one subpopulation locally show a bias for
   one type of males, immigrant females who do not conform to the local
   trend have sons, grandsons, etc. of the non-preferred phenotype, which
   negatively and cumulatively affects fitness over generations in a
   process reminiscent of the Fisher runaway process. This led us to
   suggest a sex-driven origin of conformity, indicating a possible
   evolutionary route towards animal and human culture that is rooted in
   the basic, and thus ancient, social constraints acting on mating
   preferences within a metapopulation. In a generic model, we show that
   dispersal among subpopulations within a metapopulation can effectively
   maintain independent Fisher runaway processes within subpopulations,
   while favouring the evolution of social learning and conformity at the
   metapopulation scale; both being essential for the evolution of
   long-lasting local traditions. The proposed evolutionary route to social
   learning and conformity casts surprising light on one of the major
   processes that much later participated in making us human. We further
   highlight several research avenues to define the spectrum of conformity
   better, and to account for its complexity. Future studies of conformity
   should incorporate experimental manipulation of group majority. We also
   encourage the study of potential links between conformity and mate
   copying, animal aggregations, and collective actions. Moreover,
   validation of the sex-driven origin of conformity will rest on the
   capacity of human and evolutionary sciences to investigate jointly the
   origin of social learning and conformity. This constitutes a stimulating
   common agenda and militates for a rapprochement between these two
   currently largely independent research areas.},

Abstract = {Stress responses, which are mediated by the neurogenic system (NS) and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis help vertebrates maintain
   physiological homeostasis. Fight-or-flight responses are activated by
   the NS, which releases norepinephrine/noradrenaline and
   epinephrine/adrenaline in response to immediate stressors, whilst the
   HPA axis releases glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol and
   corticosterone) to help mitigate allostatic load. There have been many
   studies on stress responses of captive animals, but they are not truly
   reflective of typical ranges or the types of stressors encountered by
   free-ranging wildlife, such as responses and adaptation to environmental
   change, which are particularly important from a conservation
   perspective. As stress can influence the composition of age and sex
   classes of free-ranging populations both directly and indirectly,
   ecological research must be prioritised towards more vulnerable taxa.
   Generally, large predators tend to be particularly at risk of
   anthropogenically driven population declines because they exhibit
   reduced behavioural plasticity required to adapt to changing landscapes
   and exist in reduced geographic ranges, have small population sizes, low
   fecundity rates, large spatial requirements and occupy high trophic
   positions. As a keystone species with a long history of coexistence with
   humans in highly anthropogenic landscapes, there has been growing
   concern about how humans influence bear behaviour and physiology, via
   numerous short- and long-term stressors. In this review, we synthesise
   research on the stress response in free-ranging bear populations and
   evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of current methodology in
   measuring stress in bears to identify the most effective metrics for
   future research. Particularly, we integrate research that utilised
   haematological variables, cardiac monitors and Global Positioning System
   (GPS) collars, serum/plasma and faecal glucocorticoid concentrations,
   hair cortisol levels, and morphological metrics (primarily skulls) to
   investigate the stress response in ursids in both short- and long-term
   contexts. We found that in free-ranging bears, food availability and
   consumption have the greatest influence on individual stress, with mixed
   responses to anthropogenic influences. Effects of sex and age on stress
   are also mixed, likely attributable to inconsistent methods. We
   recommend that methodology across all stress indicators used in
   free-ranging bears should be standardised to improve interpretation of
   results and that a wider range of species should be incorporated in
   future studies.},

Title = {Tactics of evasion: strategies used by signallers to deter eavesdropping
   enemies from exploiting communication systems},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},

Pages = {222-242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Eavesdropping predators, parasites and parasitoids exploit signals
   emitted by their prey and hosts for detection, assessment, localization
   and attack, and in the process impose strong selective pressures on the
   communication systems of the organisms they exploit. Signallers have
   evolved numerous anti-eavesdropper strategies to mitigate the trade-off
   between the costs imposed from signal exploitation and the need for
   conspecific communication. Eavesdropper strategies fall along a
   continuum from opportunistic to highly specialized, and the tightness of
   the eavesdropper-signaller relationship results in differential
   pressures on communication systems. A wide variety of anti-eavesdropper
   strategies mitigate the trade-off between eavesdropper exploitation and
   conspecific communication. Antagonistic selection from eavesdroppers can
   result in diverse outcomes including modulation of signalling displays,
   signal structure, and evolutionary loss or gain of a signal from a
   population. These strategies often result in reduced signal
   conspicuousness and in decreased signal ornamentation. Eavesdropping
   enemies, however, can also promote signal ornamentation. While less
   common, this alternative outcome offers a unique opportunity to dissect
   the factors that may lead to different evolutionary pathways. In
   addition, contrary to traditional assumptions, no sensory modality is
   completely `safe' as eavesdroppers are ubiquitous and have a broad array
   of sensory filters that allow opportunity for signal exploitation. We
   discuss how anthropogenic change affects interactions between
   eavesdropping enemies and their victims as it rapidly modifies
   signalling environments and community composition. Drawing on diverse
   research from a range of taxa and sensory modalities, we synthesize
   current knowledge on anti-eavesdropper strategies, discuss challenges in
   this field and highlight fruitful new directions for future research.
   Ultimately, this review offers a conceptual framework to understand the
   diverse strategies used by signallers to communicate under the pressure
   imposed by their eavesdropping enemies.},

Abstract = {Primary visual cortices in many mammalian species exhibit modular and

   The role of inherited traits as opposed to environmental influences in
   determining this organization remains unclear. Here, we characterize the
   cortical organization of an Australian marsupial, revealing pinwheel
   organization resembling that of eutherian carnivores and primates but
   distinctly different from the simpler salt-and-pepper arrangement of
   eutherian rodents and rabbits. The divergence of marsupials from
   eutherians 160 million years ago and the later emergence of rodents and
   rabbits suggest that the salt-and-pepper structure is not the primitive
   ancestral form. Rather, the genetic code that enables complex pinwheel
   formation is likely widespread, perhaps extending back to the common
   therian ancestors of modern mammals.},

Abstract = {The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary
   specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. We
   assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult
   human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell
   subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several
   that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial
   species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal,
   glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by
   human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide
   somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in
   dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular
   differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric
   risk gene FOXP2, which is human-specific in microglia and
   primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a
   comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and
   divergent features in anthropoid primates.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases are an increasing threat to coral reefs, resulting
   in altered community structure and hindering the functional
   contributions of disease-susceptible species. We exposed seven
   reef-building coral species from the Caribbean to white plague disease
   and determined processes involved in (i) lesion progression, (ii)
   within-species gene expression plasticity, and (iii) expression-level
   adaptation among species that lead to differences in disease risk. Gene
   expression networks enriched in immune genes and cytoskeletal
   arrangement processes were correlated to lesion progression rates.
   Whether or not a coral developed a lesion was mediated by plasticity in
   genes involved in extracellular matrix maintenance, autophagy, and
   apoptosis, while resistant coral species had constitutively higher
   expression of intracellular protein trafficking. This study offers
   insight into the process involved in lesion progression and within- and
   between-species dynamics that lead to differences in disease risk that
   is evident on current Caribbean reefs.},

Volume = {98},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The evolution of language has been investigated by several research
   communities, including biologists and linguists, striving to highlight
   similar linguistic capacities across species. To date, however, no
   consensus exists on the linguistic capacities of non-human species.
   Major controversies remain on the use of linguistic terminology,
   analysis methods and behavioural data collection. The field of `animal
   linguistics' has emerged to overcome these difficulties and attempt to
   reach uniform methods and terminology. This primer is a tutorial review
   of `animal linguistics'. It describes the linguistic concepts of
   semantics, pragmatics and syntax, and proposes minimal criteria to be
   fulfilled to claim that a given species displays a particular linguistic
   capacity. Second, it reviews relevant methods successfully applied to
   the study of communication in animals and proposes a list of useful
   references to detect and overcome major pitfalls commonly observed in
   the collection of animal behaviour data. This primer represents a step
   towards mutual understanding and fruitful collaborations between
   linguists and biologists.},

Title = {Perils of ingesting harmful prey by advanced snakes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1},
Pages = {263-283},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The advanced snakes (Alethinophidia) include the extant snakes with a
   highly evolved head morphology providing increased gape and jaw
   flexibility. Along with other physiological and morphological
   adaptations, this allows them to immobilize, ingest, and transport prey
   that may be disproportionately large or presents danger to the predator
   from bites, teeth, horns, or spines. Reported incidents of snakes
   failing to consume prey and being injured or killed during feeding
   mostly reflect information in the form of natural-history notes. Here we
   provide the first extensive review of such incidents, including 101
   publications describing at least 143 cases of mortality (including six
   of `multiple individuals') caused by ingestion or attempted consumption
   of injurious prey. We also report on 15 previously unpublished injurious
   feeding incidents from the USA, Austria, and Bulgaria, including
   mortality of five juvenile piscivorous dice snakes (Natrix tessellata)
   from a single location. Occurrences are spread across taxa, with
   mortality documented for at least 73 species from eight families and 45
   genera. Incidents were generally well represented within each of three
   major categories: oversized prey (40.6\%), potentially harmful prey
   (40.6\%), and predator's behavioural/mechanical errors (18.9\%). Reptile
   (33\%) and fish (26\%) prey caused disproportionately high mortality
   compared to mammals (16\%). Feeding can be dangerous throughout a
   snake's life, with the later stages of feeding likely being more
   perilous. The number of reports has increased over time, and the data
   seem biased towards localities with a higher number of field-working
   herpetologists. We propose a standardized framework, comprising a set of
   basic information that should ideally be collected and published, and
   which could be useful as a template for future data collection,
   reporting, and analyses. We conclude that incidents of mortality during
   feeding are likely to be more common than previously assumed, and this
   hypothesis has implications for the ecology of persistence where
   populations are impacted by changing trophic environments.},

Title = {The early diversification of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii):

Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1},
Pages = {284-315},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Actinopterygii makes up half of living vertebrate diversity, and study
   of fossil members during their Palaeozoic rise to dominance has a long
   history of descriptive work. Although research interest into Palaeozoic
   actinopterygians has increased in recent years, broader patterns of
   diversity and diversity dynamics remain critically understudied. Past
   studies have investigated macroevolutionary trends in Palaeozoic
   actinopterygians in a piecemeal fashion, variably using existing
   compendia of vertebrates or literature-based searches. Here, we present
   a comprehensive occurrence-based dataset of actinopterygians spanning
   the whole of the Palaeozoic. We use this to produce the first
   through-Palaeozoic trends in genus and species counts for
   Actinopterygii. Diversity through time generally tracks metrics for
   sampling, while major taxonomic problems pervading the Palaeozoic
   actinopterygian record obscure diversity trends. Many described species
   are concentrated in several particularly problematic `waste-basket'
   genera, hiding considerable morphological and taxonomic diversity. This
   taxonomic confusion also feeds into a limited understanding of
   phylogenetic relationships. A heavy sampling bias towards Europe and
   North America exists in both occurrence databases and available
   phylogenetic matrices, with other regions underrepresented despite
   yielding important data. Scrutiny of the extent to which spatial biases
   influence the actinopterygian record is lacking, as is research on other
   forms of bias. Low richness in some time periods may be linked to
   geological biases, while the effects of taphonomic biases on Palaeozoic
   actinopterygians have not yet been investigated. Efforts are already
   underway both to redescribe poorly defined taxa and to describe taxa
   from underrepresented regions, helping to address taxonomic issues and
   accuracy of occurrence data. New methods of sampling standardisation
   utilising up-to-date occurrence databases will be critical in teasing
   apart biological changes in diversity and those resulting from bias.
   Lastly, continued phylogenetic work will enable the use of phylogenetic
   comparative methods to elucidate the origins of actinopterygian
   biogeography and subsequent patterns of radiation throughout their rise
   to dominate aquatic faunas.},

Abstract = {Variation in group size is ubiquitous in social animals, but explaining
   the range of group sizes seen in nature remains challenging.(1-3)
   Group-living species occur most frequently in climatically unpredictable
   environments, such that the costs and benefits of sociality may change
   from year to year.(4-6) It is, therefore, possible that variation in
   climate may help to maintain a range of group sizes, but this hypothesis
   is rarely tested empirically.(7,8) Here, we examine selection on
   breeding group size in the greater ani (Crotophaga major), a tropical
   bird that nests in cooperative groups containing multiple co-breeders
   and non-breeding helpers.(9) We found that larger groups experience
   lower nest predation (due to cooperative nest defense) but suffer higher
   nest-ling starvation (due to intra-clutch competition). Long-term data
   revealed that the relative magnitude of these costs and benefits depends
   on climate, with frequent changes across years in the strength and
   direction of selection on group size. In wet years, individual
   reproductive success was higher in large groups than in small groups,
   whereas the opposite was true in dry years. This was partly a
   consequence of competition among nestlings in large clutches, which
   suffered significantly higher mortality in dry years than in wet years.
   Aver-aged over the 13-year study period, annual reproductive success was
   approximately equal for females in small and large groups. These results
   suggest that temporal changes in the direction of selection may help
   explain the persistence of a range of group sizes and that a full
   understanding of the selective pressures shaping sociality requires
   long-term fitness data.},

Title = {Wildlife trade targets colorful birds and threatens the aesthetic value
   of nature},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {19},
Pages = {4299+},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {A key component of nature's contribution to people is aesthetic
   value.(1,2) Charismatic species rally public support and bolster
   conservation efforts.(3,4) However, an insidious aspect to humanity's
   valuation of nature is that high value also drives wildlife trade,(5,6)
   which can spearhead the demise of prized species.(7-9) Here, we explore
   the antagonistic roles of aesthetic value in biodiversity conservation
   by using novel metrics of color to evaluate the aesthetics of the most
   speciose radiation of birds: passerines (i.e., the perching birds). We
   identify global color hotspots for passerines and highlight the breadth
   of color in the global bird trade. The tropics emerge as an epicentre of
   color, encompassing 91\% and 65\% of the world's most diverse and most
   uniquely colored passerine assemblages, respectively. We show that the
   pet trade, which currently affects 30\% of passerines (1,408/5,266),
   traverses the avian phylogeny and targets clusters of related species
   that are uniquely colored. We identify an additional 478 species at risk
   of future trade based on their coloration and phylogenetic relationship
   to currently traded species-together totaling 1,886 species traded, a
   34\% increase. By modeling future extinctions based on species' current
   threat status, we predict localized losses of color diversity and
   uniqueness in many avian communities, undermining their aesthetic value
   and muting nature's color palette. Given the distribution of color and
   the association of unique colors with threat and trade, proactive
   regulation of the bird trade is crucial to conserving charismatic
   biodiversity, alongside recognition and celebration of color hotspots.},

Title = {Evolutionary rescue of phosphomannomutase deficiency in yeast models of
   human disease},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The most common cause of human congenital disorders of glycosylation
   (CDG) are mutations in the phosphomannomutase gene PMM2, which affect
   protein N-linked glycosylation. The yeast gene SEC53 encodes a homolog
   of human PMM2. We evolved 384 populations of yeast harboring one of two
   human-disease-associated alleles, sec53-V238M and sec53-F126L, or
   wild-type SEC53. We find that after 1000 generations, most populations
   compensate for the slow-growth phenotype associated with the sec53
   human-disease-associated alleles. Through whole-genome sequencing we
   identify compensatory mutations, including known SEC53 genetic
   interactors. We observe an enrichment of compensatory mutations in other
   genes whose human homologs are associated with Type 1 CDG, including
   PGM1, which encodes the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase in yeast. By
   genetic reconstruction, we show that evolved pgm1 mutations are dominant
   and allele-specific genetic interactors that restore both protein
   glycosylation and growth of yeast harboring the sec53-V238M allele.
   Finally, we characterize the enzymatic activity of purified Pgm1 mutant
   proteins. We find that reduction, but not elimination, of Pgm1 activity
   best compensates for the deleterious phenotypes associated with the
   sec53-V238M allele. Broadly, our results demonstrate the power of
   experimental evolution as a tool for identifying genes and pathways that
   compensate for human-disease-associated alleles.},

Abstract = {The authors establish machine learning models to identify multifactor
   tipping points of global marine phytoplankton. They show that
   temperature and carbon dioxide dominate risks, and project crossing
   tipping points in tropical area production (50\%) and resistance (41\%)
   by 2100 under high emissions.
   Globally, anthropogenic climate change is threatening marine species.
   However, whether and how global marine phytoplankton, which represent
   the base of marine food webs, will exceed their tipping points under
   multiple climate factors remain unclear. Here, by establishing machine
   learning models, we identified the tipping points of global marine
   phytoplankton production and resistance under eight environmental
   stressors. Phytoplankton production and resistance are affected by
   multiple factors and the temperature and partial pressure of carbon
   dioxide dominate the risks for reaching their tipping points. If the
   current emission scenario continues, 50\% (40-61\% at 90\% confidence)
   and 41\% (2-80\% at 90\% confidence) of tropical areas would reach the
   tipping points of ongoing phytoplankton production and resistance
   decline, respectively, in 2100. Compared with single- or few-factor
   studies, machine learning (for example, ensemble machine learning)
   provides a powerful and realistic solution for policy-makers facing
   large-scale ecological responses to global climate changes under
   multiple environmental stressors.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1052+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Alterations of marine species' ranges with climate change are often
   attributed to oxygen limitation in warming oceans. Here we report unique
   metabolic temperature sensitivities for the myriad of vertically
   migrating oceanic species that daily cross depth-related gradients in
   temperature and oxygen. In these taxa, selection favours high metabolic
   activity for predator-prey interactions in warm shallow water and
   hypoxia tolerance in the cold at depth. These diverging selective
   pressures result in thermal insensitivity of oxygen supply capacity and
   enhanced thermal sensitivity of active metabolic rate. Aerobic scope is
   diminished in the cold, well beyond thermodynamic influences and
   regardless of ambient oxygen levels, explaining the native distributions
   of tropical migrators and their recent range expansions following
   warming events. Cold waters currently constitute an energetic barrier to
   latitudinal range expansion in vertical migrators. As warming due to
   climate change approaches, and eventually surpasses, temperatures seen
   during past warming events, this energetic barrier will be relieved.
   The authors report on the metabolic sensitivities of vertically
   migrating oceanic species to temperature and oxygen. They show that
   cold, rather than warmth, acts as an energetic barrier to these species,
   facilitating latitudinal range expansion under changing climate.},

Abstract = {Choanoflagellates and sponges feed by filtering microscopic particles
   from water currents created by the flagella of microvillar collar
   complexes situated on the cell bodies of the solitary or colonial
   choanoflagellates and on the choanocytes in sponges. The filtering
   mechanism has been known for more than a century, but only recently has
   the filtering process been studied in detail and also modelled, so that
   a detailed picture of the water currents has been obtained. In the
   solitary and most of the colonial choanoflagellates, the water flows
   freely around the cells, but in some forms, the cells are arranged in an
   open meshwork through which the water can be pumped. In the sponges, the
   choanocytes are located in choanocyte chambers (or choanocyte areas)
   with separate incurrent and excurrent canals/pores located in a larger
   body, which enables a fixed pattern of water currents through the collar
   complexes. Previous theories for the origin of sponges show evolutionary
   stages with choanocyte chambers without any opening or with only one
   opening, which makes separation of incurrent and excurrent impossible,
   and such stages must have been unable to feed. Therefore a new theory is
   proposed, which shows a continuous evolutionary lineage in which all
   stages are able to feed by means of the collar complexes.},

   while bacterial populations are identified by population genetics. These
   assignments are species specific, and depend on the practitioner. Legacy
   multilocus sequence typing is commonly used to identify sequence types
   (STs) and clusters (ST Complexes). However, these approaches are not
   adequate for the millions of genomic sequences from bacterial pathogens
   that have been generated since 2012. EnteroBase
   (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk) automatically clusters core genome
   MLST allelic profiles into hierarchical clusters (HierCC) after
   assembling annotated draft genomes from short-read sequences. HierCC
   clusters span core sequence diversity from the species level down to
   individual transmission chains. Here we evaluate HierCC's ability to
   correctly assign 100 000s of genomes to the species/subspecies and
   population levels for Salmonella, Escherichia, Clostridoides, Yersinia,
   Vibrio and Streptococcus. HierCC assignments were more consistent with
   maximum-likelihood super-trees of core SNPs or presence/absence of
   accessory genes than classical taxonomic assignments or 95\% ANI.
   However, neither HierCC nor ANI were uniformly consistent with classical
   taxonomy of Streptococcus. HierCC was also consistent with legacy
   eBGs/ST Complexes in Salmonella or Escherichia and with O serogroups in
   Salmonella. Thus, EnteroBase HierCC supports the automated
   identification of and assignment to species/subspecies and populations
   for multiple genera.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue
   `Genomic population structures of microbial pathogens'.},

Abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids is a threat to
   human and animal health. Phylogenies of bacteria and their plasmids
   contain clues regarding the frequency of plasmid transfer events, as
   well as the co-evolution of plasmids and their hosts. However, whole
   genome sequencing data from diverse ecological or clinical bacterial
   samples are rarely used to study plasmid phylogenies and resistance gene
   transfer. This is partially due to the difficulty of extracting plasmids
   from short-read sequencing data. Here, we use both short- and long-read
   sequencing data of 24 clinical extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
   (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli to estimate chromosomal and plasmid
   phylogenies. We compare the impact of different sequencing and assembly
   methodologies on these phylogenies and on the inference of horizontal
   gene transfer. We find that chromosomal phylogenies can be estimated
   robustly with all methods, whereas plasmid phylogenies have more
   variable topology and branch lengths across the methods used.
   Specifically, hybrid methods that use long reads to resolve short-read
   assemblies (HybridSPAdes and Unicycler) perform better than those that
   started from long reads during assembly graph generation (Canu). By
   contrast, the inference of plasmid and antibiotic resistance gene
   transfer using a parsimony-based criterion is mostly robust to the
   choice of sequencing and assembly method. This article is part of a
   discussion meeting issue `Genomic population structures of microbial
   pathogens'.},

Abstract = {Bottom-up approaches to systems biology rely on constructing a
   mechanistic basis for the biochemical and genetic processes that
   underlie cellular functions. Genome-scale network reconstructions of
   metabolism are built from all known metabolic reactions and metabolic
   genes in a target organism. A network reconstruction can be converted
   into a mathematical format and thus lend itself to mathematical
   analysis. Genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism enable a systems
   approach to characterize the pan and core metabolic capabilities of the
   Escherichia genus. In this work, GEMs were constructed for 222
   representative strains of Escherichia across HC1100 levels spanning the
   known Escherichia phylogeny. The models were used to study Escherichia
   metabolic diversity and speciation on a large scale. The results show
   that unique strain-specific metabolic capabilities correspond to
   different species and nutrient niches. This work is a first step towards
   a curated reconstruction of pan-Escherichia metabolism.This article is
   part of a discussion meeting issue `Genomic population structures of

Abstract = {To meet the growing food demand while addressing the multiple challenges
   of exacerbating phosphorus (P) pollution and depleting P rock
   reserves(1-15), P use efficiency (PUE, the ratio of productive P output
   to P input in a defined system) in crop production needs to be improved.
   Although many efforts have been devoted to improving nutrient management
   practices on farms, few studies have examined the historical
   trajectories of PUE and their socioeconomic and agronomic drivers on a
   national scale(1,2,6,7,11,16,17). Here we present a database of the P
   budget (the input and output of the crop production system) and PUE by
   country and by crop type for 1961-2019, and examine the substantial
   contribution of several drivers for PUE, such as economic development
   stages and crop portfolios. To address the P management challenges, we
   found that global PUE in crop production must increase to 68-81\%, and
   recent trends indicate some meaningful progress towards this goal.
   However, P management challenges and opportunities in croplands vary
   widely among countries.
   The historical and spatial patterns of the phosphorus budget and
   phosphorus use efficiency by country and crop type are reported, and
   used to determine phosphorus pollution and scarcity challenges.},

Abstract = {Soils are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems(1). However,
   unlike for plants and animals, a global assessment of hotspots for soil
   nature conservation is still lacking(2). This hampers our ability to
   establish nature conservation priorities for the multiple dimensions
   that support the soil system: from soil biodiversity to ecosystem
   services. Here, to identify global hotspots for soil nature
   conservation, we performed a global field survey that includes
   observations of biodiversity (archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists and
   invertebrates) and functions (critical for six ecosystem services) in
   615 composite samples of topsoil from a standardized survey in all
   continents. We found that each of the different ecological dimensions of
   soils-that is, species richness (alpha diversity, measured as amplicon
   sequence variants), community dissimilarity and ecosystem
   services-peaked in contrasting regions of the planet, and were
   associated with different environmental factors. Temperate ecosystems
   showed the highest species richness, whereas community dissimilarity
   peaked in the tropics, and colder high-latitudinal ecosystems were
   identified as hotspots of ecosystem services. These findings highlight
   the complexities that are involved in simultaneously protecting multiple
   ecological dimensions of soil. We further show that most of these
   hotspots are not adequately covered by protected areas (more than 70\%),
   and are vulnerable in the context of several scenarios of global change.
   Our global estimation of priorities for soil nature conservation
   highlights the importance of accounting for the multidimensionality of
   soil biodiversity and ecosystem services to conserve soils for future
   generations.},

Title = {Early life stressful experiences escalate aggressive behavior in
   adulthood via changes in transthyretin expression and function},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Escalated and inappropriate levels of aggressive behavior referred to as
   pathological in psychiatry can lead to violent outcomes with detrimental
   impact on health and society. Early life stressful experiences might
   increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in
   adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide
   prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of
   peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting
   escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant
   behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known
   thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated
   aggressive behavior in males. Brain-region-specific long-term changes in
   Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident
   in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being
   unaltered. Ttr promoter methylation marks were also altered being
   hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex
   corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, Ttr knockdown in
   hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without
   PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH-responsive genes
   (Nrgn, Trh, and Hr). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced
   Ttr gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in
   next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful
   experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by
   modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target
   in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.},

Abstract = {The evolution of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenases
   (Rubiscos) that discriminate strongly between their substrate carbon
   dioxide and the undesired side substrate dioxygen was an important event
   for photosynthetic organisms adapting to an oxygenated environment. We
   use ancestral sequence reconstruction to recapitulate this event. We
   show that Rubisco increased its specificity and carboxylation efficiency
   through the gain of an accessory subunit before atmospheric oxygen was
   present. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we retrace how
   this subunit was gained and became essential. Our work illuminates the
   emergence of an adaptation to rising ambient oxygen levels, provides a
   template for investigating the function of interactions that have
   remained elusive because of their essentiality, and sheds light on the
   determinants of specificity in Rubisco.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},

Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Spider silks are among the toughest known materials and thus provide
   models for renewable, biodegradable, and sustainable biopolymers.
   However, the entirety of their diversity still remains elusive, and
   silks that exceed the performance limits of industrial fibers are
   constantly being found. We obtained transcriptome assemblies from 1098
   species of spiders to comprehensively catalog silk gene sequences and
   measured the mechanical, thermal, structural, and hydration properties
   of the dragline silks of 446 species. The combination of these silk
   protein genotype-phenotype data revealed essential contributions of
   multicomponent structures with major ampullate spidroin 1 to 3 paralogs
   in high-performance dragline silks and numerous amino acid motifs
   contributing to each of the measured properties. We hope that our global
   sampling, comprehensive testing, integrated analysis, and open data will
   provide a solid starting point for future biomaterial designs.},

Title = {Factors influencing terrestriality in primates of the Americas and

Abstract = {Among mammals, the order Primates is exceptional in having a high
   taxonomic richness in which the taxa are arboreal, semiterrestrial, or
   terrestrial. Although habitual terrestriality is pervasive among the
   apes and African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), it is largely absent
   among monkeys of the Americas (platyrrhines), as well as galagos,
   lemurs, and lorises (strepsirrhines), which are mostly arboreal.
   Numerous ecological drivers and species-specific factors are suggested
   to set the conditions for an evolutionary shift from arboreality to
   terrestriality, and current environmental conditions may provide
   analogous scenarios to those transitional periods. Therefore, we
   investigated predominantly arboreal, diurnal primate genera from the
   Americas and Madagascar that lack fully terrestrial taxa, to determine
   whether ecological drivers (habitat canopy cover, predation risk,
   maximum temperature, precipitation, primate species richness, human
   population density, and distance to roads) or species-specific traits
   (bodymass, group size, and degree of frugivory) associate with increased
   terrestriality. We collated 150,961 observation hours across 2,227
   months from 47 species at 20 sites in Madagascar and 48 sites in the
   Americas. Multiple factors were associated with ground use in these
   otherwise arboreal species, including increased temperature, a decrease
   in canopy cover, a dietary shift away from frugivory, and larger group
   size. These factors mostly explain intraspecific differences in
   terrestriality. As humanity modifies habitats and causes climate change,
   our results suggest that species already inhabiting hot, sparsely
   canopied sites, and exhibiting more generalized diets, are more likely
   to shift toward greater ground use.},

Abstract = {Success stories are rare in conservation science, hindered also by the
   research-implementation gap, where scientific insights rarely inform
   practice and practical implementation is rarely evaluated
   scientifically. Amphibian population declines, driven by multiple
   stressors, are emblematic of the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Habitat
   creation is a straightforward conservation action that has been shown to
   locally benefit amphibians, as well as other taxa, but does it benefit
   entire amphibian communities at large spatial scales? Here, we evaluate
   a landscape-scale pond-construction program by fitting dynamic occupancy
   models to 20 y of monitoring data for 12 pond-breeding amphibian species
   in the Swiss state Aargau, a densely populated area of the Swiss
   lowlands with intensive land use. After decades of population declines,
   the number of occupied ponds increased statewide for 10 out of 12
   species, while one species remained stable and one species further
   declined between 1999 and 2019. Despite regional differences, in 77\% of
   all 43 regional metapopulations, the colonization and subsequent
   occupation of new ponds stabilized (14\%) or increased (63\%)
   metapopulation size. Likely mechanisms include increased habitat
   availability, restoration of habitat dynamics, and increased
   connectivity between ponds. Colonization probabilities reflected
   species-specific preferences for characteristics of ponds and their
   surroundings, which provides evidence-based information for future pond
   construction targeting specific species. The relatively simple but
   landscape-scale and persistent conservation action of constructing
   hundreds of new ponds halted declines and stabilized or increased the
   state-wide population size of all but one species, despite ongoing
   pressures from other stressors in a human-dominated landscape.},

Title = {Worms and gills, plates and spines: the evolutionary origins and
   incredible disparity of deuterostomes revealed by fossils, genes, and
   development},

Abstract = {Deuterostomes are the major division of animal life which includes sea
   stars, acorn worms, and humans, among a wide variety of ecologically and
   morphologically disparate taxa. However, their early evolution is poorly
   understood, due in part to their disparity, which makes identifying
   commonalities difficult, as well as their relatively poor early fossil
   record. Here, we review the available morphological, palaeontological,
   developmental, and molecular data to establish a framework for exploring
   the origins of this important and enigmatic group. Recent fossil
   discoveries strongly support a vermiform ancestor to the group
   Hemichordata, and a fusiform active swimmer as ancestor to Chordata. The
   diverse and anatomically bewildering variety of forms among the early
   echinoderms show evidence of both bilateral and radial symmetry. We
   consider four characteristics most critical for understanding the form
   and function of the last common ancestor to Deuterostomia: Hox gene
   expression patterns, larval morphology, the capacity for
   biomineralization, and the morphology of the pharyngeal region. We posit
   a deuterostome last common ancestor with a similar antero-posterior gene
   regulatory system to that found in modern acorn worms and
   cephalochordates, a simple planktonic larval form, which was later
   elaborated in the ambulacrarian lineage, the ability to secrete calcium
   minerals in a limited fashion, and a pharyngeal respiratory region
   composed of simple pores. This animal was likely to be motile in adult
   form, as opposed to the sessile origins that have been historically
   suggested. Recent debates regarding deuterostome monophyly as well as
   the wide array of deuterostome-affiliated problematica further suggest
   the possibility that those features were not only present in the last
   common ancestor of Deuterostomia, but potentially in the ur-bilaterian.
   The morphology and development of the early deuterostomes, therefore,
   underpin some of the most significant questions in the study of metazoan
   evolution.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {42},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {The ``trophic downgrading of planet Earth{''} refers to the systematic
   decline of the world's largest vertebrates. However, our understanding
   of why megafauna extinction risk varies through time and the importance
   of site- or species-specific factors remain unclear. Here, we unravel
   the unexpected variability in remaining terrestrial megafauna
   assemblages across 10 Southeast Asian tropical forests. Consistent with
   global trends, every landscape experienced Holocene and/or Anthropocene
   megafauna extirpations, and the four most disturbed landscapes
   experienced 2.5 times more extirpations than the six least disturbed
   landscapes. However, there were no consistent size- or guild-related
   trends, no two tropical forests had identical assemblages, and the
   abundance of four species showed positive relationships with forest
   degradation and humans. Our results suggest that the region's megafauna
   assemblages are the product of a convoluted geoclimatic legacy
   interacting with modern disturbances and that some megafauna may persist
   in degraded tropical forests near settlements with sufficient poaching
   controls.},

Abstract = {Long-term analyses of biodiversity data highlight a `biodiversity
   conservation paradox': biological communities show substantial species
   turnover over the past century(1,2), but changes in species richness are
   marginal(1,3-5). Most studies, however, have focused only on the
   incidence of species, and have not considered changes in local
   abundance. Here we asked whether analysing changes in the cover of plant
   species could reveal previously unrecognized patterns of biodiversity
   change and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms. We compiled
   and analysed a dataset of 7,738 permanent and semi-permanent vegetation
   plots from Germany that were surveyed between 2 and 54 times from 1927
   to 2020, in total comprising1,794 species of vascular plants. We found
   that decrements in cover, averaged across all species and plots,
   occurred more often than increments; that the number of species that
   decreased in cover was higher than the number of species that increased;
   and that decrements were more equally distributed among losers than were
   gains among winners. Null model simulations confirmed that these trends
   do not emerge by chance, but are the consequence of species-specific
   negative effects of environmental changes. In the long run, these trends
   might result in substantial losses of species at both local and regional
   scales. Summarizing the changes by decade shows that the inequality in
   the mean change in species cover of losers and winners diverged as early
   as the 1960s. We conclude that changes in species cover in communities
   represent an important but understudied dimension of biodiversity change
   that should more routinely be considered in time-series analyses.},

Title = {Ion regulation at gills precedes gas exchange and the origin of

Abstract = {Gas exchange and ion regulation at gills have key roles in the evolution
   ofvertebrates(1-4). Gills are hypothesized to have first acquired these
   important homeostatic functions from the skin in stem vertebrates,
   facilitating the evolution of larger, more-active modes oflife(2,3,5).
   However, this hypothesis lacks functional support in relevant taxa. Here
   we characterize the function ofgills and skin in a vertebrate (lamprey
   ammocoete; Entosphen us tridentatus), a cephalochordate (amphioxus;
   Branch iostomafloridae) and a hemichordate (acorn worm; Saccoglossus
   kowaleuskii) with the presumed burrowing, filter-feeding traits
   ofvertebrate ancestors(6-9). We provide functional support for a
   vertebrate origin ofgas exchange at the gills with increasing body size
   and activity, as direct measurements in vivo reveal that gills are the
   dominant site ofgas exchange only in ammocoetes, and only with
   increasing body size or challenges to oxygen supply and demand.
   Conversely, gills of all threetaxa are implicated in ion regulation.
   Ammocoetegills are responsible for all ion flux at all body sizes,
   whereas molecular markers for ion regulation are higher in the gillsthan
   in the skin of amphioxus and acorn worms. This suggeststhat ion
   regulation at gills has an earlier origin than gas exchange that is
   unrelated to vertebrate size and activity-perhaps at the very inception
   of pharyngeal pores in stem deuterostomes.},

   wolf populations across North America that vary in the prevalence of CDV
   and the allele that makes coats black, longitudinal data from
   Yellowstone National Park, and modeling. We found that the frequency of
   CDV outbreaks generates fluctuating selection that results in
   heterozygote advantage that in turn affects the frequency of the black

Title = {The best of two worlds: ecology and evolution of ambophilous plants},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {391-420},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ambophily, the mixed mode of wind and insect pollination is still poorly
   understood, even though it has been known to science for over 130 years.
   While its presence has been repeatedly inferred, experimental data
   remain regrettably rare. No specific suite of morphological or
   ecological characteristics has yet been identified for ambophilous
   plants and their ecology and evolution remain uncertain. In this review
   we summarise and evaluate our current understanding of ambophily,
   primarily based on experimental studies. A total of 128 ambophilous
   species - including several agriculturally important crops - have been
   reported from most major habitat types worldwide, but this probably
   represents only a small subset of ambophilous species. Ambophilous
   species have evolved both from wind- and insect-pollinated ancestors,
   with insect-pollinated ancestors mostly representing pollination by
   small, generalist flower visitors. We compiled floral and reproductive
   traits for known ambophilous species and compared our results to traits
   of species pollinated either by wind or by small generalist insects
   only. Floral traits were found to be heterogeneous and strongly overlap
   especially with those of species pollinated by small generalist insects,
   which are also the prominent pollinator group for ambophilous plants. A
   few ambophilous species are only pollinated by specialised bees or
   beetles in addition to pollination by wind. The heterogeneity of floral
   traits and high similarity to generalist small insect-pollinated species
   lead us to conclude that ambophily is not a separate pollination
   syndrome but includes species belonging to different insect- as well as
   wind-pollination syndromes. Ambophily therefore should be regarded as a
   pollination mode. We found that a number of ecological factors promoted
   the evolution of ambophily, including avoidance of pollen limitation and
   self-pollination, spatial flower interference and population density.
   However, the individual ecological factors favouring the transition to
   ambophily vary among species depending on species distribution, habitat,
   population structure and reproductive system. Finally, a number of
   experimental studies in combination with observations of floral traits
   of living and fossil species and dated phylogenies may indicate
   evolutionary stability. In some clades ambophily has likely prevailed
   for millions of years, for example in the castanoid clade of the
   Fagaceae.},

Title = {Rapid growth preceded gigantism in sauropodomorph evolution},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4501+},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Sauropod dinosaurs include the largest land animals to have walked the
   earth, mostly weighing 10-70 tons (e.g., Sander et al.1 and Carballido
   et al.2). Osteohistology suggests that derived physiological traits
   evolved near the origin of sauropod gigantism, including both rapid and
   uninterrupted growth from juvenile to adult with little developmental
   plasticity.1,3,4 This differs from the slower, seasonally interrupted
   growth of their direct ancestors, as evident in most non-sauropodan
   sauropodomorphs, which also show developmental plasticity in some
   groups. Accelerated but seasonally interrupted growth is present in
   Lessemsauridae, the sister clade to Sauropoda, which also attained giant
   adult body sizes (>10 tons).5 These observations suggest a correlation
   between giant size and accelerated growth. However, testing this
   evolutionary connec-tion has been limited by the incomplete
   understanding of the growth patterns in some of the closest non-giant
   relatives of sauropods. We present the osteohistology of two such taxa,
   Aardonyx celestae and Sefapano-saurus zatronensis. Both exhibit highly
   vascularized woven-parallel complexes, with fibrolamellar complexes
   during early to mid-ontogeny, containing regular growth marks. These
   observations provide strong evidence for rapid but seasonally
   interrupted growth with limited developmental plasticity (indicated by
   the regular spacing of growth marks). Combined with our review of early
   branching sauropodomorph osteohistology, these results show that highly
   accelerated growth rates originated among smaller, non-sauropodan
   sauro-podomorphs weighing 1 to 2 tons but preceded the origins of giant
   size (>10 tons). Therefore, the capacity for rapid bone tissue
   formation, a derived aspect of rapid growth seen in sauropods, did not
   evolve specif-ically to enable giant body sizes but may have been a
   prerequisite for them.},

Title = {Rapid evolution of pollen and pistil traits as a response to sexual
   selection in the post-pollination phase of mating},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4465+},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Sexual selection is the basis of some of the most striking phenotypic
   variation in nature.1,2 In animals, sexual selection in males can act on
   traits that improve access to mates prior to copulation,3-8 but also on
   sperm traits filtered by sperm competition,9-14 or female choice
   expressed simply by the morphology and physi-ology of genital
   tracts.14-16 Although long overlooked as a mode of selection on plant
   traits, sexual selection should act on land plants too because they are
   anisogamous: males produce more, and smaller, gametes than females.17-19
   Numerical asymmetry in gamete production is thought to play a central
   role in selection on traits that affect pollen transfer to mates,20,21
   but very little is known about how pollen competition or cryptic female
   choice might affect the evolution of traits expressed after
   pollination.22,23 Here, we report the divergence of pollen and pistil
   traits of the dioecious wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua
   dur-ing evolution over three generations between populations at low
   versus high plant density, corresponding to low versus higher levels of
   polyandry;24 we expected selection under higher polyandry to strengthen
   compe-tition among pollen donors for fertilizing ovules. We found that
   populations at high density evolved faster -growing pollen tubes (an
   equivalent of greater sperm velocity), greater expression of pollen
   proteins involved in pollen growth, and larger stigmas (a trait likely
   enhancing the number of pollen donors and thus competi-tion for ovules).
   Our results identify the post-pollination phase of plant mating as an
   important arena for the action of sexual selection.},

Abstract = {Butterflies have variable sets of spectral photoreceptors that underlie
   colour vision. The photoreceptor organization may be optimized for the
   detection of body coloration. Fritillaries (Argynnini) are nymphalid
   butterflies exhibiting varying degrees of sexual dimorphism in wing
   coloration. In two sister species, the females have orange (Argynnis
   paphia) and dark wings (Argynnis sagana), respectively, while the males
   of both species have orange wings with large patches of
   pheromone-producing androconia. In spite of the differences in female
   coloration, the eyes of both species exhibit an identical sexual
   dimorphism. The female eyeshine is uniform yellow, while the males have
   a complex retinal mosaic with yellow and red-reflecting ommatidia. We
   found the basic set of ultraviolet-, blue- and green-peaking
   photoreceptors in both sexes. Males additionally have three more
   photoreceptor classes, peaking in green, yellow and red, respectively.
   The latter is the basal R9, indirectly measured through
   hyperpolarizations in the green-peaking R1-2. In many nymphalid tribes,
   including the closely related Heliconiini, the retinal mosaic is complex
   in both sexes. We hypothesize that the simple mosaic of female Argynnini
   is a secondary reduction, possibly driven by the use of olfaction for
   intraspecific recognition, whereas vision remains the primary sense for
   the task in the males.This article is part of the theme issue
   `Understanding colour vision: molecular, physiological, neuronal and
   behavioural studies in arthropods'.},

Abstract = {Modern behavioural scientists have come to acknowledge that individual
   animals may respond differently to the same stimuli and that the quality
   of welfare and lived experience can affect behavioural responses.
   However, much of the foundational research in behavioural science lacked
   awareness of the effect of both welfare and individuality on data,
   bringing their results into question. This oversight is rarely addressed
   when citing seminal works as their findings are considered crucial to
   our understanding of animal behaviour. Furthermore, more recent research
   may reflect this lack of awareness by replication of earlier methods -
   exacerbating the problem. The purpose of this review is threefold.
   First, we critique seminal papers in animal behaviour as a model for
   re-examining past experiments, attending to gaps in knowledge or concern
   about how welfare may have affected results. Second, we propose a means
   to cite past and future research in a way that is transparent and
   conscious of the abovementioned problems. Third, we propose a method of
   transparent reporting for future behaviour research that (i) improves
   replicability, (ii) accounts for individuality of non-human
   participants, and (iii) considers the impact of the animals' welfare on
   the validity of the science. With this combined approach, we aim both to
   advance the conversation surrounding behaviour scholarship while also
   serving to drive open engagement in future science.},

Title = {Environmental signal in the evolutionary diversification of bird
   skeletons},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {611},
Number = {7935},
Pages = {306+},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Characterizing how variation in the tempo and mode of evolution has
   structured the phenotypic diversity of extant species is a central goal
   of macroevolution(1-3). However, studies are typically limited to a
   handful of traits(4-6), providing incomplete information. We analyse
   morphological diversification in living birds, an ecologically diverse
   group(7), documenting structural scales from `pan-skeletal' proportions
   down to the localized three-dimensional shape changes of individual
   bones. We find substantial variation in evolutionary modes among avian
   subgroups and among skeletal parts, indicating widespread mosaicism and
   possible differences in the structure of the macroevolutionary landscape
   across Earth's main environments. Water-linked groups, especially
   Aequorlitornithes (waterbirds), have repeatedly explored a large portion
   of their total morphospace, emphasizing variation in body proportions
   and in the shape of bones close to the body core, which are functionally
   related to the mechanics of locomotion(8). By contrast, landbirds
   (Inopinaves) evolved distinct, group-specific body forms early in the
   aftermath of the K-Pg and subsequently emphasized local shape variation,
   especially in the head and distal limb bones, which interact more
   directly with the environment. Passerines, which comprise more than half
   of all bird species, show a conservative evolutionary dynamic that
   resulted in low disparity across all skeletal parts. Evidence for early
   establishment of the morphospace of living birds is clear for some
   skeletal parts, including beaks and the combined skeletal morphology.
   However, we find little evidence for early partitioning of that
   morphospace, contrary to more specific predictions of `niche-filling'
   models(1,9). Nevertheless, early divergence among broad environmental
   types may have caused an early divergence of evolutionary modes,
   suggesting an important role for environmental divergence in structuring
   the radiation of crown-group birds.},

Abstract = {Temperature affects the rate of all biochemical processes in

   rate within the stressful temperature range are extremely temperature
   sensitive, such that heat failure increases by more than 100\% per

   123 rates across 112 species). The extreme thermal sensitivity of heat
   failure rates implies that the projected increase in the frequency and
   intensity of heatwaves can exacerbate heat mortality for many
   ectothermic species with severe and disproportionate consequences.
   Combining the extreme thermal sensitivities with projected increases in
   maximum temperatures globally(6), we predict that moderate warming
   scenarios can increase heat failure rates by 774\% (terrestrial) and
   180\% (aquatic) by 2100. This finding suggests that we are likely to
   underestimate the potential impact of even a modest global warming
   scenario.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Biodiversity on Earth is shaped by abiotic perturbations and rapid
   diversifications. At the same time, there are arguments that
   biodiversity is bounded and regulated via biotic interactions.
   Evaluating the role and relative strength of diversity regulation is
   crucial for interpreting the ongoing biodiversity changes. We have
   analyzed Phanerozoic fossil record using public databases and new
   approaches for identifying the causal dependence of origination and
   extinction rates on environmental variables and standing diversity.
   While the effect of environmental factors on origination and extinction
   rates is variable and taxon specific, the diversity dependence of the
   rates is almost universal across the studied taxa. Origination rates are
   dependent on instantaneous diversity levels, while extinction rates
   reveal delayed diversity dependence. Although precise mechanisms of
   diversity dependence may be complex and difficult to recover, global
   regulation of diversity via negative diversity dependence of lineage
   diversification seems to be a common feature of the biosphere, with
   profound consequences for understanding current biodiversity crisis.},

Title = {Barriers to gene flow in the deepest ocean ecosystems: Evidence from
   global population genomics of a cosmopolitan amphipod},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {43},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {The deepest marine ecosystem, the hadal zone, hosts endemic biodiversity
   resulting from geographic isolation and environmental selection
   pressures. However, the pan-ocean distribution of some fauna challenges
   the concept that the hadal zone is a series of isolated island-like
   habitats. Whether this remains true at the population genomic level is
   untested. We investigated phylogeographic patterns of the amphipod,
   Bathycallisoma schellenbergi, from 12 hadal features across the Pacific,
   Atlantic, Indian, and Southern oceans and analyzed genome-wide
   single-nucleotide poly-morphism markers and two mitochondrial regions.
   Despite a cosmopolitan distribution, populations were highly restricted
   to individual features with only limited gene flow between
   topographically connected features. This lack of connectivity suggests
   that populations are on separate evolutionary trajectories, with
   evidence of potential cryptic speciation at the Atacama Trench.
   Together, this global study demonstrates that the shallower ocean floor
   separating hadal features poses strong barriers to dispersal, driving
   genetic isolation and creating pockets of diversity to conserve.},

Abstract = {Both gradual and extreme weather changes trigger complex ecological
   responses in river ecosystems. It is still unclear to what extent trend
   or event effects alter biodiversity and functioning in river ecosystems,
   adding considerable uncertainty to predictions of their future dynamics.
   Using a comprehensive database of 71 published studies, we show that
   event - but not trend - effects associated with extreme changes in water
   flow and temperature substantially reduce species richness. Furthermore,
   event effects - particularly those affecting hydrological dynamics - on
   biodiversity and primary productivity were twice as high as impacts due
   to gradual changes. The synthesis of the available evidence reveals that
   event effects induce regime shifts in river ecosystems, particularly
   affecting organisms such as invertebrates. Among extreme weather events,
   dryness associated with flow interruption caused the largest effects on
   biota and ecosystem functions in rivers. Effects on ecosystem functions
   (primary production, organic matter decomposition and respiration) were
   asymmetric, with only primary production exhibiting a negative response
   to extreme weather events. Our meta-analysis highlights the
   disproportionate impact of event effects on river biodiversity and
   ecosystem functions, with implications for the long-term conservation
   and management of river ecosystems. However, few studies were available
   from tropical areas, and our conclusions therefore remain largely
   limited to temperate river systems. Further efforts need to be directed
   to assemble evidence of extreme events on river biodiversity and
   functioning.},

Abstract = {In species with separate sexes, females and males often differ in their
   morphology, physiology and behaviour. Such sex-specific traits are
   functionally linked to variation in reproductive competition, mate
   choice and parental care, which have all been linked to sex roles. At
   the 150th anniversary of Darwin's theory on sexual selection, the
   question of why patterns of sex roles vary within and across species
   remains a key topic in behavioural and evolutionary ecology. New
   theoretical, experimental and comparative evidence suggests that
   variation in the adult sex ratio (ASR) is a key driver of variation in
   sex roles. Here, we first define and discuss the historical emergence of
   the sex role concept, including recent criticisms and rebuttals. Second,
   we review the various sex ratios with a focus on ASR, and explore its
   theoretical links to sex roles. Third, we explore the causes, and
   especially the consequences, of biased ASRs, focusing on the results of
   correlational and experimental studies of the effect of ASR variation on
   mate choice, sexual conflict, parental care and mating systems, social
   behaviour, hormone physiology and fitness. We present evidence that
   animals in diverse societies are sensitive to variation in local ASR,
   even on short timescales, and propose explanations for conflicting
   results. We conclude with an overview of open questions in this field
   integrating demography, life history and behaviour.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Globally, habitat loss has been deemed a major threat to wetland bird
   populations. However, the underlying mechanism of population declines
   and variations in the birds' vulnerability throughout their annual cycle
   is challenging to determine, yet critical for development of targeted
   conservation strategies. Over seven years, landscape water availability
   explained occupancy of breeding territories best when breeding
   performance, migratory performance, and annual survival of the
   White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) population in eastern Mongolia were
   studied. Also, the hatching success of eggs was positively correlated
   with water availability in addition to plant productivity. High ambient
   temperatures and large numbers of herder families (and hence more
   livestock) negatively affected hatching success. High water availability
   at Luan, a major stopover site increased migration speed during the
   cranes' northbound migration to their breeding grounds. In contrast,
   when water conditions were favorable, the birds stayed longer at the
   stopover site during southbound migration. Increased human density
   reduced the use of the stopover site during northbound migration.
   Finally, cranes arrived early at the breeding grounds when ambient
   temperature was high in northeast Mongolia. Combining these findings
   with historical trends in key environmental factors on their breeding
   grounds explains the general decline observed in this population of
   cranes in recent decades. Extrapolating our findings with future climate
   predictions, the outlook seems poor unless urgent action is taken.
   Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying White-naped Crane population
   decline in eastern Mongolia identified in this paper should improve the
   effectiveness of these actions.},

Title = {The trophic niche of subterranean populations of Speleomantes italicus},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {The determination of a species trophic niche can clarify its functional
   role within a food web and how prey resources are used in relation with
   the spatial and temporal variability of environmental conditions. This
   information may result particularly useful for the implementation of
   conservation plans of endangered species having a cryptic behaviour or
   living in places difficult to be surveyed. Here we present the first
   long-term study on the trophic niche of the Italian cave salamander
   Speleomantes italicus, a strictly protected facultative cave species
   that seasonally exploits surface environments (e.g., forested areas) as
   well as both natural and artificial subterranean environments. We
   analysed the diet variation of six populations of S. italicus inhabiting
   natural caves, surveyed 24 times in a full year. During the surveys, all
   sampled individuals were subjected to stomach flushing and the ingested
   prey were identified and enumerated; furthermore, salamanders' body
   condition was also evaluated. The results of the analyses provided the
   first comprehensive, year-round assessment of the diet for a
   Speleomantes species. Remarkable divergences in terms of trophic niche
   and body condition were observed between the studied populations. We
   found a discrepancy in the foraging activity of the populations located
   in different areas; specifically, the individuals that experienced
   sub-optimal microclimatic conditions poorly performed in foraging.
   Furthermore, we found temporal and spatial variability in the body
   condition of individuals. Our study highlighted a remarkably high
   spatial and temporal divergence in the trophic habits of conspecific
   populations, a feature that may represent one of the major factors
   promoting the variability of multiple population traits.},

Abstract = {The ``mental number line{''} (MNL) is a form of spatial numeric
   representation that associates small and large numbers with the left and
   right spaces, respectively. This spationumeric organization can be found
   in adult humans and has been related to cultural factors such as writing
   and reading habits. Yet, both human newborns and birds order numbers
   consistently with an MNL, thus raising the question of whether culture
   is a main explanation for MNL. Here, we explored the numeric sense of
   honey bees and show that after being trained to associate numbers with a
   sucrose reward, they order numbers not previously experienced from left
   to right according to their magnitude. Importantly, the location of a
   number on that scale varies with the reference number previously trained
   and does not depend on low-level cues present on numeric stimuli. We
   provide a series of neural explanations for this effect based on the
   extensive knowledge accumulated on the neural underpinnings of visual
   processing in honey bees and conclude that the MNL is a form of numeric
   representation that is evolutionarily conserved across nervous systems
   endowed with a sense of number, irrespective of their neural complexity.},

Title = {Influence of mating strategies on seminal material investment in crabs},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Reproduction involves high energetic costs which are related to
   behaviour and gamete production. In females energy allocation to gamete
   production has been well documented. However, estimations of male
   investment in seminal material are scarce. The present study aims to
   assess and compare male investment in four brachyuran species by
   determining biochemical substrates present in the vasa deferentia to
   subsequently estimate energetic investment during the reproductive
   cycle. We identified two groups with contrasting energy investments. Two
   species, Homalaspis plana and Romaleon setosum, showed high investment
   due to significant quantities of proteins and lipids. Both species are
   characterised by large and complex vasa deferentia, and the formation of
   a remarkably large sperm plug deposited to the female after copulation
   as a sperm competition avoidance strategy. In contrast, Metacarcinus
   edwardsii and Taliepus dentatus invested little energy in their
   smaller-sized and simpler vasa deferentia. Morpho-functional traits may
   play a key role in determining the investment, which may also be
   influenced by mechanisms (i.e. mating tactics) to prevent sperm
   competition and the intensity of polygyny. This study emphasises the
   high amount of energy males invest in seminal material and highlights
   the diversity of mating strategies in Brachyura, which are reflected
   even on the physiological level.},

Title = {Light competition drives herbivore and nutrient effects on plant
   diversity},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {611},
Number = {7935},
Pages = {301+},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Enrichment of nutrients and loss of herbivores are assumed to cause a
   loss of plant diversity in grassland ecosystems because they increase
   plant cover, which leads to a decrease of light in the understory(1-3).
   Empirical tests of the role of competition for light in natural systems
   are based on indirect evidence, and have been a topic of debate for the
   last 40 years. Here we show that experimentally restoring light to
   understory plants in a natural grassland mitigates the loss of plant
   diversity that is caused by either nutrient enrichment or the absence of
   mammalian herbivores. The initial effect of light addition on restoring
   diversity under fertilization was transitory and outweighed by the
   greater effect of herbivory on light levels, indicating that herbivory
   is a major factor that controls diversity, partly through light. Our
   results provide direct experimental evidence, in a natural system, that
   competition for light is a key mechanism that contributes to the loss of
   biodiversity after cessation of mammalian herbivory. Our findings also
   show that the effects of herbivores can outpace the effects of
   fertilization on competition for light. Management practices that target
   maintaining grazing by native or domestic herbivores could therefore
   have applications in protecting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems,
   because they alleviate competition for light in the understory.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Pages = {507+},

Abstract = {Although precipitation patterns have long been known to shape plant
   distributions(1), the effect of changing climate on the interactions of
   species and therefore community composition is far less understood(2,3).
   Here, we explored how changes in precipitation alter competitive
   dynamics via direct effects on individual species, as well as by the
   changing strength of competitive interactions between species, using an
   annual grassland community in California. We grew plants under ambient
   and reduced precipitation in the field to parameterize a competition
   model(4) with which we quantified the stabilizing niche and fitness
   differences that determine species coexistence in each rainfall regime.
   We show that reduced precipitation had little direct effect on species
   grown alone, but it qualitatively shifted predicted competitive outcomes
   for 10 of 15 species pairs. In addition, species pairs that were
   functionally more similar were less likely to experience altered
   outcomes, indicating that functionally diverse communities may be most
   threatened by changing interactions. Our results highlight how important
   it is to account for changes to species interactions when predicting
   species and community response to global change.},

Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {The pathways that impact longevity in the wake of dietary restriction
   (DR) remain still ill-defined. Most studies have focused on nutrient
   limitation and perturbations of energy metabolism. We showed that the
   L-threonine was elevated in Caenorhabditis elegans under DR, and that
   L-threonine supplementation increased its healthspan. Using metabolic
   and transcriptomic profiling in worms that were fed with RNAi to induce
   loss of key candidate mediators. L-threonine supplementation and
   loss-of-threonine dehydrogenaseincreased the healthspan by attenuating
   ferroptosis in a ferritin-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analysis
   showed that FTN-1 encoding ferritin was elevated, implying FTN-1 is an
   essential mediator of longevity promotion. Organismal ferritin levels
   were positively correlated with chronological aging and L-threonine
   supplementation protected against age-associated ferroptosis through the
   DAF-16 and HSF-1 pathways. Our investigation uncovered the role of a
   distinct and universal metabolite, L-threonine, in DR-mediated
   improvement in organismal healthspan, suggesting it could be an
   effective intervention for preventing senescence progression and
   age-induced ferroptosis.
   How dietary restriction increases longevity is still not fully
   understood. Here, the authors demonstrate that L-threonine is an
   essential mediator of dietary restriction that prevents age-induced
   ferroptosis and that dietary supplementation promotes healthy ageing.},

Title = {Investigation of the spermathecal morphology, reproductive strategy and
   fate of stored spermatozoa in three important thysanopteran species},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {In insects, females can keep sperm capable of fertilisation over a long
   period with the help of the spermatheca. The effectiveness of storing
   fertile sperm is expected to reflect in the reproductive strategy and,
   thus, the morphology of the involved organs. In this work, we focused on
   the relationship between reproduction and morphology in the haplodiploid
   Thysanoptera, especially if a loss of these traits occurs under
   thelytoky. The spermathecal morphology and the fate of stored
   spermatozoa were studied by microscopic techniques (high-resolution
   x-ray computed tomography and transmission electron microscopy) in three
   species with different reproductive modes and lifestyles (Suocerathrips
   linguis, Echinothrips americanus, Hercinothrips femoralis). Mating
   experiments were conducted to analyse the use of the transferred sperm
   in the thelytokous H. femoralis. Results show that the spermathecae are
   relatively simple, which can be explained by the availability of sperm
   and the short lifespan of the females. However, the spermatheca in H.
   femoralis seems to be vestigial compared to the arrhenotokous species
   and females do not use sperm for fertilisation. No substantial change
   was observed in the structure of spermatozoa, despite an enlargement of
   the sperm organelles being measured during storage in all three species.
   The results of this work demonstrate differences in the morphology of
   the spermatheca, especially concerning the reproduction mode, promoting
   the understanding of the complex interaction between morphology and
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {Animals' space requirements may vary according to life-history and
   social considerations. We observed 516 wild adult Asian elephants from
   both sexes, over 9 years, to investigate how life-history traits and
   social behavior influence protected-area (PA) use at Udawalawe National
   Park, Sri Lanka. Male PA-use, quantified in terms of average
   between-sightings-interval (BSI), was significantly influenced by the
   interaction of age class and motivational state (i.e. reproduction vs.
   foraging). Musth lengthened with age, with a median of 24.5 days for
   ages 21-30, 32.5 days for ages 31-40, and 45 days for those > 40. A
   minority (11\%) used it exclusively during musth, while others used it
   exclusively for foraging (44\%) or both (45\%). Males using it in both
   states and older musth-only males were more likely to be seen across
   years. There were 16 social communities containing between 2-22 adult
   females. Females' BSI was significantly influenced by social ties, but
   this relationship was weak, because members of social communities do not
   necessarily disperse together, resulting in high individual variation in
   space-use. Inter-annual variability in sightings among individuals of
   both sexes indicates that around 3/4 of the population is likely
   non-residential across years, challenging the prevailing
   fortress-conservation paradigm of wildlife management.},

Title = {Effects of vessel traffic and ocean noise on gray whale stress hormones},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Human use of marinescapes is rapidly increasing, especially in populated
   nearshore regions where recreational vessel traffic can be dense. Marine
   animals can have a physiological response to such elevated human
   activity that can impact individual health and population dynamics. To
   understand the physiological impacts of vessel traffic on baleen whales,
   we investigated the adrenal stress response of gray whales (Eschrichtius
   robustus) to variable vessel traffic levels through an assessment of
   fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGC) concentrations. This analysis was
   conducted at the individual level, at multiple temporal scales (1-7
   days), and accounted for factors that may confound fGC: sex, age,
   nutritional status, and reproductive state. Data were collected in
   Oregon, USA, from June to October of 2016-2018. Results indicate
   significant correlations between fGC, month, and vessel counts from the
   day prior to fecal sample collection. Furthermore, we show a significant
   positive correlation between vessel traffic and underwater ambient noise
   levels, which indicates that noise produced by vessel traffic may be a
   causal factor for the increased fGC. This study increases knowledge of
   gray whale physiological response to vessel traffic and may inform
   management decisions regarding regulations of vessel traffic activities
   and thresholds near critical whale habitats.},

Abstract = {The near-universal genetic code defines the correspondence between
   codons in genes and amino acids in proteins. We refactored the structure
   of the genetic code in Escherichia coli and created orthogonal genetic
   codes that restrict the escape of synthetic genetic information into
   natural life. We developed orthogonal and mutually orthogonal horizontal
   gene transfer systems, which permit the transfer of genetic information
   between organisms that use the same genetic code but restrict the
   transfer of genetic information between organisms that use different
   genetic codes. Moreover, we showed that locking refactored codes into
   synthetic organisms completely blocks invasion by mobile genetic
   elements, including viruses, which carry their own translation factors
   and successfully invade organisms with canonical and compressed genetic
   codes.},

Abstract = {Arctic fires can release large amounts of carbon from permafrost
   peatlands. Satellite observations reveal that fires burned similar to
   4.7 million hectares in 2019 and 2020, accounting for 44\% of the total
   burned area in the Siberian Arctic for the entire 1982-2020 period. The
   summer of 2020 was the warmest in four decades, with fires burning an
   unprecedentedly large area of carbon-rich soils. We show that factors of
   fire associated with temperature have increased in recent decades and
   identified a near-exponential relationship between these factors and
   annual burned area. Large fires in the Arctic are likely to recur with
   climatic warming before mid-century, because the temperature trend is
   reaching a threshold in which small increases in temperature are
   associated with exponential increases in the area burned.},

Abstract = {Male and female unisexual flowers evolved from hermaphroditic ancestors,
   and control of flower sex is useful for plant breeding. We isolated a
   female-to-male sex transition mutant in melon and identified the causal
   gene as the carpel identity gene CRABS CLAW (CRC). We show that the
   master regulator of sex determination in cucurbits, the transcription
   factor WIP1 whose expression orchestrates male flower development,
   recruits the corepressor TOPLESS to the CRC promoter to suppress its
   expression through histone deacetylation. Impairing TOPLESS-WIP1
   physical interaction leads to CRC expression, carpel determination, and
   consequently the expression of the stamina inhibitor, the
   aminocyclopropane-1carboxylic acid synthase 7 (CmACS7), leading to
   female flower development. Our findings suggest that sex genes evolved
   to interfere with flower meristematic function, leading to unisexual
   flower development.},

Abstract = {Understanding the distribution patterns of threatened species is central
   to conservation. The Amazonian distribution of the northern tiger cat
   (N-tiger cat, Leopardus tigrinus) and its interspecific relationship
   with the ocelot, its potential intraguild killer, are intriguing. Here,
   we combined presence/absence records with species distribution models
   (SDMs) to determine N-tiger cat occurrence in the Amazon. We also
   modeled ocelot density from 46 published estimates. The N-tiger cat's
   presence in the Amazon was negatively influenced by ocelot density and
   net primary productivity and positively influenced by savannas and
   precipitation in the driest month. The best-fitting model predicted
   highly patchy N-tiger cat occurrence over an area of 236,238.67 km(2),
   almost exclusively in savanna enclaves. Additionally, 312,348 camera
   trap-days at 49 sites in the Amazon revealed no N-tiger cats. The ocelot
   densities were significantly higher in areas with denser vegetation
   cover and warmer habitats, with predicted densities >= 0.6 ind/km(2)
   throughout most of the biome. The lowest ocelot densities (<= 0.06
   ind/km(2)) were observed along the predicted range of N-tiger cats. Our
   findings highlight that the N-tiger cat's presence in the Amazon is
   restricted to savannas and highly influenced by ocelot density,
   emphasizing the importance of including species interactions in SDMs.},

Title = {Trophic provisioning and parental trade-offs lead to successful
   reproductive performance in corals after a bleaching event},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Warming ocean temperatures are severely compromising the health and
   resilience of coral reefs worldwide. Coral bleaching can affect coral
   physiology and the energy available for corals to reproduce. Mechanisms
   associated with reproductive allocation in corals are poorly understood,
   especially after a bleaching event occurs. Using isotopic labeling
   techniques, we traced the acquisition and allocation of carbon from
   adults to gametes by autotrophy and heterotrophy in previously bleached
   and non-bleached Montipora capitata and Porites compressa corals.
   Experiments revealed that both species: (1) relied only on autotrophy to
   allocate carbon to gametes, while heterotrophy was less relied upon as a
   carbon source; (2) experienced a trade-off with less carbon available
   for adult tissues when provisioning gametes, especially when previously
   bleached; and (3) used different strategies for allocating carbon to
   gametes. Over time, M. capitata allocated 10\% more carbon to gametes
   despite bleaching by limiting the allocation of carbon to adult tissues,
   with 50-80\% less carbon allocated to bleached compared to non-bleached
   colonies. Over the same time period, P. compressa maintained carbon
   allocation to adult tissues, before allocating carbon to gametes. Our
   study highlights the importance of autotrophy for carbon allocation from
   adult corals to gametes, and species-specific differences in carbon
   allocation depending on bleaching susceptibility.},

Title = {Ornamental roses for conservation of leafcutter bee pollinators},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Pollinator conservation is a global priority. Efforts are taken to
   restore pollinators by improving flower resources, a crucial driver of
   pollinator diversity and population growth. It helped gardening and
   landscaping supply chains, which introduced lists of bee-friendly plants
   and bee hotels, yet, desirable results seem distant. One shortcoming of
   the present schemes is that they lack a cohesive planning for nesting
   opportunities and nesting provisions for wild solitary bees, the crucial
   pollinators of crop and wild plants. We tested whether the world's
   popular ornamental plant, rose (Rosa chinensis Jacq.)-a hitherto
   unlisted bee-friendly plant-can aid in conserving leafcutter bees, which
   require fresh leaves for constructing nest cells. We surveyed 2360 rose
   plants in 136 sites in rural and urban places and lowlands and highlands
   of south (8 degrees N-12 degrees N) and northeastern India (26 degrees
   N-27 degrees N) for the characteristic notches the bees leave on foraged
   leaves. We reared brood constructed with rose and non-rose leaves to
   examine the brood success rate. About a quarter of all the roses
   surveyed had the notches of leafcutter bees on the leaves. However, the
   proportion of cut roses varied considerably among sites. Bees used roses
   much higher in urban areas and lowlands than in rural areas and
   highlands. The selection of plants was negatively associated with
   pesticide application. The brood success rate was 100\% for the brood
   that was constructed by the leaves of rose and non-rose plants. Rose
   flowers do not support bees, but rose leaves indeed do. We recommend
   rose plants in leafcutter bee conservation and restoration schemes,
   particularly in urban environment.},

Title = {A short exposure to a semi-natural habitat alleviates the honey bee hive
   microbial imbalance caused by agricultural stress},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Honeybee health and the species' gut microbiota are interconnected. Also
   noteworthy are the multiple niches present within hives, each with
   distinct microbiotas and all coexisting, which we termed ``apibiome{''}.
   External stressors (e.g. anthropization) can compromise microbial
   balance and bee resilience. We hypothesised that (1) the bacterial
   communities of hives located in areas with different degrees of
   anthropization differ in composition, and (2) due to interactions
   between the multiple microbiomes within the apibiome, changes in the
   community of a niche would impact the bacteria present in other hive
   sections. We characterised the bacterial consortia of different niches
   (bee gut, bee bread, hive entrance and internal hive air) of 43 hives
   from 3 different environments (agricultural, semi-natural and natural)
   through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Agricultural samples presented
   lower community evenness, depletion of beneficial bacteria, and
   increased recruitment of stress related pathways (predicted via
   PICRUSt2). The taxonomic and functional composition of gut and hive
   entrance followed an environmental gradient. Arsenophonus emerged as a
   possible indicator of anthropization, gradually decreasing in abundance
   from agriculture to the natural environment in multiple niches.
   Importantly, after 16 days of exposure to a semi-natural landscape hives
   showed intermediate profiles, suggesting alleviation of microbial
   dysbiosis through reduction of anthropization.},

Title = {Genomic analysis reveals cryptic diversity in aphelids and sheds light
   on the emergence of Fungi},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {21},
Pages = {4607+},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, molecular phylogenetics has reshaped our
   understanding of the fungal tree of life by unraveling a hitherto
   elusive diversity of the protistan relatives of Fungi. Aphelida
   constitutes one of these novel deep branches that precede the emergence
   of osmotrophic fungal lifestyle and hold particular signif-icance as the
   pathogens of algae. Here, we obtain and analyze the genomes of aphelid
   species Amoeboa-phelidium protococcarum and Amoeboaphelidium
   occidentale. Genomic data unmask the vast divergence between these
   species, hidden behind their morphological similarity, and reveal hybrid
   genomes with a com-plex evolutionary history in two strains of A.
   protococcarum. We confirm the proposed sister relationship be-tween
   Aphelida and Fungi using phylogenomic analysis and chart the reduction
   of characteristic proteins involved in phagocytic activity in the
   evolution of Holomycota. Annotation of aphelid genomes demonstrates the
   retention of actin nucleation-promoting complexes associated with
   phagocytosis and amoeboid motility and also reveals a conspicuous
   expansion of receptor-like protein kinases, uncharacteristic of fungal
   line-ages. We find that aphelids possess multiple
   carbohydrate-processing enzymes that are involved in fungal cell wall
   synthesis but do not display rich complements of algal
   cell-wall-processing enzymes, suggesting an independent origin of fungal
   plant-degrading capabilities. Aphelid genomes show that the emergence of
   Fungi from phagotrophic ancestors relied on a common cell wall synthetic
   machinery but required a different set of proteins for digestion and
   interaction with the environment.},

Title = {Social interactions lead to motility-induced phase separation in fire
   ants},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Some active matter systems as they evolve, can be characterized by
   spatially varying density, with some regions that are dense and
   immobile, and other regions with lower density that accommodate most
   mobile particles. The authors show that this phenomenon can also be
   observed as an effect of the social interactions between fire ants.
   Collections of fire ants are a form of active matter, as the ants use
   their internal metabolism to self-propel. In the absence of aligning
   interactions, theory and simulations predict that active matter with
   spatially dependent motility can undergo motility-induced phase
   separation. However, so far in experiments, the motility effects that
   drive this process have come from either crowding or an external
   parameter. Though fire ants are social insects that communicate and
   cooperate in nontrivial ways, we show that the effect of their
   interactions can also be understood within the framework of
   motility-induced phase separation. In this context, the slowing down of
   ants when they approach each other results in an effective attraction
   that can lead to space-filling clusters and an eventual formation of
   dynamical heterogeneities. These results illustrate that
   motility-induced phase separation can provide a unifying framework to
   rationalize the behavior of a wide variety of active matter systems.},

Abstract = {In 2019, in southern Italy (Campania) there was an outbreak of a sap
   beetle infesting stored walnut fruits. A monitoring activity started to
   assess the spread and impact of the pest in walnut orchards and in
   warehouses, and an integrative characterization led to identify the
   beetle as Carpophilus truncatus. This species has been in Europe for a
   long time, rare and harmless until recently. We show also that this
   species is the same recently recorded in other two continents, Latin
   America and Australia, where it is causing massive damage on walnut and
   almond fruits. The sharing of a mitochondrial haplotype among
   populations recorded on three continents suggests that a worldwide
   invasion might be ongoing. A Geographic Profiling approach has
   determined that the more virulent population was first introduced in
   Italy, and the climate conditions of areas where C. truncatus is
   currently widespread and harmful indicate that the entire walnuts world
   production is in jeopardy as this species could adapt to any of the main
   walnut and almond production areas.},

Title = {A large-scale dataset reveals taxonomic and functional specificities of
   wild bee communities in urban habitats of Western Europe},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Wild bees are declining, mainly due to the expansion of urban habitats
   that have led to land-use changes. Effects of urbanization on wild bee
   communities are still unclear, as shown by contrasting reports on their
   species and functional diversities in urban habitats. To address this
   current controversy, we built a large dataset, merging 16 surveys
   carried out in 3 countries of Western Europe during the past decades,
   and tested whether urbanization influences local wild bee taxonomic and
   functional community composition. These surveys encompassed a range of
   urbanization levels, that were quantified using two complementary
   metrics: the proportion of impervious surfaces and the human population
   density. Urban expansion, when measured as a proportion of impervious
   surfaces, but not as human population density, was significantly and
   negatively correlated with wild bee community species richness.
   Taxonomic dissimilarity of the bee community was independent of both
   urbanization metrics. However, occurrence rates of functional traits
   revealed significant differences between lightly and highly urbanized
   communities, for both urbanization metrics. With higher human population
   density, probabilities of occurrence of above-ground nesters, generalist
   and small species increased. With higher soil sealing, probabilities of
   occurrence of above-ground nesters, generalists and social bees
   increased as well. Overall, these results, based on a large European
   dataset, suggest that urbanization can have negative impacts on wild bee
   diversity. They further identify some traits favored in urban
   environments, showing that several wild bee species can thrive in
   cities.},

Title = {Sperm tendency to agglutinate in motile bundles in relation to sperm
   competition and fertility duration in chickens},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {A unique sperm behavior was observed in Egyptian chickens. Sperm showed
   a tendency to agglutinate forming motile thread-like bundles. Sperm
   agglutination behavior, kinematics, and some morphometric measures were
   studied in relation to sperm competition and fertility duration in
   Sharkasi and Dandarawi chickens. Sperm tendency to agglutinate was
   assessed by examining sperm morphology using scanning electron
   microscopy, Acridine orange-stained semen smears using fluorescence
   microscopy, and recording videos of sperm under phase contrast
   microscope. Sperm velocity and morphometric measures were evaluated
   using image-J software. To assess sperm competition, Sharkasi and
   Dandarawi hens were artificially inseminated by semen pools possessing
   equal number of Sharaksi and Dandarawi sperm. Artificial insemination
   was repeated ten times. The eggs obtained were incubated, and the
   hatchlings were discriminated as descending from Sharkasi or Dandarawi
   fathers according to their phenotype. To assess the fertility duration,
   Sharkasi and Dandarawi hens were inseminated by semen collected from
   roosters of the same strain. Eggs were collected for a period of 28 days
   post-insemination and incubated. Sharkasi spermatozoa showed higher
   tendency to agglutinate forming longer and thicker motile bundles. No
   significant differences were observed in sperm curvilinear and straight
   line velocity and in sperm morphometric measures between Sharkasi and
   Dandarawi chickens. Sharkasi roosters fathered 81.6\% and 67.7\% of the
   hatchlings produced by Sharkasi and Dandarawi mothers, respectively. The
   fertility period in Sharkasi and Dandarawi was 22 and 14 days,
   respectively. We suggest that the differences seen in sperm
   competitiveness and fertility duration can be attributed to sperm
   agglutination behavior.},

Title = {Factors influencing lion movements and habitat use in the western

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Protected areas that restrict human activities can enhance wildlife
   habitat quality. Efficacy of protected areas can be improved with
   increased protection from illegal activities and presence of buffer
   protected areas that surround a core protected area. Habitat value of
   protected areas also can be affected by seasonal variation in
   anthropogenic pressures. We examined seasonal space use by African lions
   (Panthera leo) within a core protected area, Serengeti National Park,
   Tanzania, and surrounding buffer protected areas with varying protection
   strengths. We used lion locations in logistic regression models during
   wet and dry seasons to estimate probability of use in relation to
   protection strength, distance to protected area edge, human and
   livestock density, distance to roads and rivers, and land cover. Lions
   used strongly protected buffer areas over the core protected area and
   unprotected areas, and moved away from protected area boundaries toward
   the core protected area when buffer protected areas had less protection.
   Lions avoided high livestock density in the wet season and high human
   density in the dry season. Increased strength of protection can decrease
   edge effects on buffer areas and help maintain habitat quality of core
   protected areas for lions and other wildlife species.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The breeding of threatened species in captivity for release is a central
   tool in conservation biology. Given gloomy predictions for biodiversity
   trends in the Anthropocene, captive breeding will play an increasingly
   important role in preventing future extinctions. Relative to the wild,
   captive environments drastically alter selection pressures on animals.
   Phenotypic change in captive animals in response to these altered
   selection pressures can incur fitness costs post-release, jeopardising
   their potential contribution to population recovery. We explore the ways
   in which captive environments can hinder the expression of wild
   phenotypes. We also stress that the phenotypes of captive-bred animals
   differ from their wild counterparts in multiple ways that remain poorly
   understood. We propose five new research questions relating to the
   impact of captive phenotypes on reintroduction biology. With better use
   of monitoring and experimental reintroductions, a more robust evidence
   base should help inform adaptive management and minimise the phenotypic
   costs of captivity, improving the success of animal reintroductions.},

Abstract = {Despite dramatic advances in genomics, connecting genotypes to
   phenotypes is still challenging. Sexual genetics combined with linkage
   analysis is a powerful solution to this problem but generally
   unavailable in bacteria. We build upon a strong negative selection
   system to invent mass allelic exchange (MAE), which enables
   hybridization of arbitrary (including pathogenic) strains of Escherichia
   coli. MAE reimplements the natural phenomenon of random cross-overs,
   enabling classical linkage analysis. We demonstrate the utility of MAE
   with virulence-related gain-of-function screens, discovering that
   transfer of a single operon from a uropathogenic strain is sufficient
   for enabling a commensal E. coli to form large intracellular bacterial
   collections within bladder epithelial cells. MAE thus enables assaying
   natural allelic variation in E. coli (and potentially other bacteria),
   complementing existing loss-of-function genomic techniques.},

Title = {Baboon perspectives on the ecology and behavior of early human ancestors},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Number = {45},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {For more than 70 y researchers have looked to baboons (monkeys of the
   genus Papio) as a source of hypotheses about the ecology and behavior of
   early hominins (early human ancestors and their close relatives). This
   approach has undergone a resurgence in the last decade as a result of
   rapidly increasing knowledge from experimental and field studies of
   baboons and from archeological and paleontological studies of hominins.
   The result is a rich array of analogies, scenarios, and other stimuli to
   thought about the ecology and behavior of early hominins. The main
   intent here is to illustrate baboon perspectives on early hominins, with
   emphasis on recent developments. This begins with a discussion of
   baboons and hominins as we know them currently and explains the reasons
   for drawing comparisons between them. These include occupation of
   diverse environments, combination of arboreal and terrestrial
   capabilities, relatively large body size, and sexual dimorphism. The
   remainder of the paper illustrates the main points with a small number
   of examples drawn from diverse areas of interest: diet (grasses and
   fish), danger (leopards and crocodiles), social organization (troops and
   multilevel societies), social relationships (male-male, male-female,
   female-female), communication (possible foundations of language),
   cognition (use of social information, comparison of self to others), and
   bipedalism (a speculative developmental hypothesis about the
   neurological basis). The conclusion is optimistic about the future of
   baboon perspectives on early hominins.},

Title = {Population dynamics of Baltic herring since the Viking Age revealed by

   AMERICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},

Abstract = {The world's oceans are currently facing major stressors in the form of
   overexploitation and anthropogenic climate change. The Baltic Sea was
   home to the first ``industrial{''} fishery similar to 800 y ago
   targeting the Baltic herring, a species that is still economically and
   culturally important today. Yet, the early origins of marine industries
   and the long-term ecological consequences of historical and contemporary
   fisheries remain debated. Here, we study long-term population dynamics
   of Baltic herring to evaluate the past impacts of humans on the marine
   environment. We combine modern whole-genome data with ancient DNA (aDNA)
   to identify the earliest-known long-distance herring trade in the
   region, illustrating that extensive fish trade began during the Viking
   Age. We further resolve population structure within the Baltic and
   observe demographic independence for four local herring stocks over at
   least 200 generations. It has been suggested that overfishing at Oresund
   in the 16th century resulted in a demographic shift from autumn-spawning
   to spring-spawning herring dominance in the Baltic. We show that while
   the Oresund fishery had a negative impact on the western Baltic herring
   stock, the demographic shift to spring-spawning dominance did not occur
   until the 20th century. Instead, demographic reconstructions reveal
   population trajectories consistent with expected impacts of
   environmental change and historical reports on shifting fishing targets
   over time. This study illustrates the joint impact of climate change and
   human exploitation on marine species as well as the role historical
   ecology can play in conservation and management policies.},

Title = {Initial impressions of compatibility and mate value predict later dating

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Number = {45},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Romantic first impressions seem to linger, but why? Few studies have
   investigated how romantic desire during initial interactions predicts
   later relational outcomes (e.g., later romantic interest, contact
   attempts) using a design that can tease apart different possible
   mechanisms (e.g., mate value, selectivity, compatibility). Across three
   speed-dating studies (n = 559) with longitudinal follow-ups (including
   college and community samples, and a sample of men who date men), we
   investigated whether different components of initial romantic
   impressions predicted later romantic outcomes and relationship
   initiation. Using the social relations model, we partitioned initial
   desire at speed dating (determined from 6,600+ total dates) into partner
   effects (a date's consensual desirability, e.g., mate value), actor
   effects (a participant's general desirousness, e.g., selectivity), and
   relationship effects (a participant's unique liking for a date over and
   beyond partner and actor effects, e.g., compatibility) to predict later
   evaluations (romantic interest, physical attraction, and desire to know
   better) and behaviors (direct messaging and going on dates).
   Meta-analyses across the three studies showed that, across 6,100+
   follow-up reports, partner and relationship effects were especially
   strong predictors of relationship initiation variables. Consistent with
   evolutionary models of human pair bonding, these findings suggest that
   both consensually desirable traits and unique impressions of
   compatibility have lingering effects on relationship development, even
   from the moment that two potential partners meet.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Number = {45},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {The common intuition among the ecologists of the midtwentieth century
   was that large ecosystems should bemore stable than those with a smaller
   number of species. This view was challenged by Robert May, who found a
   stability bound for randomly assembled ecosystems; they become unstable
   for a sufficiently large number of species. In the present work, we show
   that May's bound greatly changes when the past population densities of a
   species affect its own current density. This is a common feature in real
   systems, where the effects of species' interactions may appear after a
   time lag rather than instantaneously. The local stability of these
   models with self-interaction is described by bounds, which we
   characterize in the parameter space. We find a critical delay curve that
   separates the region of stability fromthat of instability, and
   correspondingly, we identify a critical frequency curve that provides
   the characteristic frequencies of a system at the instability threshold.
   Finally, we calculate analytically the distributions of eigenvalues that
   generalizeWigner's aswell asGirko's laws. Interestingly, we find that,
   for sufficiently large delays, the eigenvalues of a randomly coupled
   system are complex even when the interactions are symmetric.},

Abstract = {Viruses shape microbial communities, food web dynamics, and carbon and
   nutrient cycling in diverse ecosystems. However, little is known about
   the patterns and drivers of viral community composition, particularly in
   soil, precluding a predictive understanding of viral impacts on
   terrestrial habitats. To investigate soil viral community assembly
   processes, here we analyzed 43 soil viromes from a rainfall manipulation
   experiment in a Mediterranean grassland in California. We identified
   5,315 viral populations (viral operational taxonomic units {[}vOTUs]
   with a representative sequence >= 10 kbp) and found that viral community
   composition exhibited a highly significant distance-decay relationship
   within the 200-m(2) field site. This pattern was recapitulated by the
   intrapopulation microheterogeneity trends of prevalent vOTUs (detected
   in >= 90\% of the viromes), which tended to exhibit negative
   correlations between spatial distance and the genomic similarity of
   their predominant allelic variants. Although significant spatial
   structuring was also observed in the bacterial and archaeal communities,
   the signal was dampened relative to the viromes, suggesting differences
   in local assembly drivers for viruses and prokaryotes and/or differences
   in the temporal scales captured by viromes and total DNA. Despite the
   overwhelming spatial signal, evidence for environmental filtering was
   revealed in a protein-sharing network analysis, wherein a group of
   related vOTUs predicted to infect actinobacteria was shown to be
   significantly enriched in low-moisture samples distributed throughout
   the field. Overall, our results indicate a highly diverse, dynamic,
   active, and spatially structured soil virosphere capable of rapid
   responses to changing environmental conditions.},

Title = {Evidence for compositionality in baboons (Papio papio) through the test
   case of negation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Can non-human animals combine abstract representations much like humans
   do with language? In particular, can they entertain a compositional
   representation such as `not blue'? Across two experiments, we
   demonstrate that baboons (Papio papio) show a capacity for
   compositionality. Experiment 1 showed that baboons can entertain
   negative, compositional, representations: they can learn to associate a
   cue with iconically related referents (e.g., a blue patch referring to
   all blue objects), but also to the complement set associated with it
   (e.g., a blue patch referring to all non-blue objects). Strikingly,
   Experiment 2 showed that baboons not only learn to associate a cue with
   iconically related referents, but can learn to associate complex cues
   (composed of the same cue and an additional visual element) with the
   complement object set. Thus, they can learn an operation, instantiated
   by this additional visual element, that can be compositionally combined
   with previously learned cues. These results significantly reduce any
   claim that would make the manipulation and combination of abstract
   representations a solely human privilege.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Cetaceans spend most of their time below the surface of the sea,
   highlighting the importance of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool to
   facilitate understanding and mapping their year-round spatial and
   temporal distributions. To increase our limited knowledge of cetacean
   acoustic detection patterns for the east and west coasts of Gwaii
   Haanas, a remote protected area on Haida Gwaii, BC, Canada, acoustic
   datasets recorded off SGang Gwaay (Sep 2009-May 2011), Gowgaia Slope
   (Jul 2017-Jul 2019), and Ramsay Island (Aug 2018-Aug 2019) were
   analyzed. Comparing overlapping periods of visual surveys and acoustic
   monitoring confirmed presence of 12 cetacean species/species groups
   within the study region. Seasonal patterns were identified for blue,
   fin, humpback, grey and sperm whale acoustic signals. Killer whale and
   delphinid acoustic signals occurred year-round on both coasts of Haida
   Gwaii and showed strong diel variation. Cuvier's, Baird's, beaked whale
   and porpoise clicks, were identified in high-frequency recordings on the
   west coast. Correlations between environmental factors, chlorophyll-a
   and sea surface temperature, and cetacean acoustic occurrence off Gwaii
   Haanas were also examined. This study is the first to acoustically
   monitor Gwaii Haanas waters for an extended continuous period and
   therefore serves as a baseline from which to monitor future changes.},

   lions},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Endangered Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) are renowned for their
   resilience and as a flagship of successful conservation and management.
   Lions dispersing out of the Gir forest have established themselves in
   the coastal habitats for about 25 years. We propose that the home range
   and spatial distribution of lions inhabiting the coastal habitats would
   be distinct from the forested habitats of the protected area. Each
   individual was monitored for an average of 367.2 +/- 99.05 days from
   2019 to 2021. The mean core area was 33.8 km(2) (50\% FK, SE 8.7 km(2))
   and the overall average range was 171.8 km(2) (90\% FK, SE 40.5 km(2)).
   The home ranges were significantly larger for lions residing in the
   coastal area compared to lions in the protected area. The lion
   distribution model was built on MaxEnt, and inputs included location
   fixes of lions and variables, including 18 land use categories and
   Euclidean distance to linear infrastructures and human settlements.
   Lions were shown to use forest habitat patches extensively, followed by
   available habitats around water sources and wasteland. The study
   highlights the importance of corridors connecting to the Gir protected
   area and the importance of coastal forest patches for lion conservation
   and management.},

Abstract = {Fishing activity is closely monitored to an increasing degree, but its
   effects on biodiversity have not received such attention. Using iconic
   and well-studied fish species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, we
   calculate a continuous Red List Index of yearly changes in extinction
   risk over 70 years to track progress toward global sustainability and
   biodiversity targets. We show that this well-established biodiversity
   indicator is highly sensitive and responsive to fishing mortality. After
   similar to 58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective
   fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas
   and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which
   are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial
   species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and
   reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Hydraulic failure as a primary driver of xylem network evolution in

Journal = {SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {378},
Number = {6620},
Pages = {642+},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {The earliest vascular plants had stems with a central cylindrical strand
   of water-conducting xylem, which rapidly diversified into more complex
   shapes. This diversification is understood to coincide with increases in
   plant body size and branching; however, no selection pressure favoring
   xylem strand-shape complexity is known. We show that incremental changes
   in xylem network organization that diverge from the cylindrical
   ancestral form lead to progressively greater drought resistance by
   reducing the risk of hydraulic failure. As xylem strand complexity
   increases, independent pathways for embolism spread become fewer and
   increasingly concentrated in more centrally located conduits, thus
   limiting the systemic spread of embolism during drought. Selection by
   drought may thus explain observed trajectories of xylem strand evolution
   in the fossil record and the diversity of extant forms.},

Abstract = {Effective policies to halt biodiversity loss require knowing which
   anthropogenic drivers are the most important direct causes. Whereas
   previous knowledge has been limited in scope and rigor, here we
   statistically synthesize empirical comparisons of recent driver impacts
   found through a wide-ranging review. We show that land/sea use change
   has been the dominant direct driver of recent biodiversity loss
   worldwide. Direct exploitation of natural resources ranks second and
   pollution third; climate change and invasive alien species have been
   significantly less important than the top two drivers. The oceans, where
   direct exploitation and climate change dominate, have a different driver
   hierarchy from land and fresh water. It also varies among types of
   biodiversity indicators. For example, climate change is a more important
   driver of community composition change than of changes in species
   populations. Stopping global biodiversity loss requires policies and
   actions to tackle all the major drivers and their interactions, not some
   of them in isolation.},

Title = {Influenza A virus reassortment in mammals gives rise to genetically
   distinct within-host subpopulations},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Virus reassortment drives genetic diversity and evolution and is
   governed by intra-host dynamics that are less well understood. Here, the
   authors characterise the within-host dynamics of influenza A virus
   reassortment in swine, ferrets and guinea pigs, considering their
   spatial distribution.
   Influenza A virus (IAV) genetic exchange through reassortment has the
   potential to accelerate viral evolution and has played a critical role
   in the generation of multiple pandemic strains. For reassortment to
   occur, distinct viruses must co-infect the same cell. The
   spatio-temporal dynamics of viral dissemination within an infected host
   therefore define opportunity for reassortment. Here, we used wild type
   and synonymously barcoded variant viruses of a pandemic H1N1 strain to
   examine the within-host viral dynamics that govern reassortment in
   guinea pigs, ferrets and swine. The first two species are
   well-established models of human influenza, while swine are a natural
   host and a frequent conduit for cross-species transmission and
   reassortment. Our results show reassortment to be pervasive in all three
   hosts but less frequent in swine than in ferrets and guinea pigs. In
   ferrets, tissue-specific differences in the opportunity for reassortment
   are also evident, with more reassortants detected in the nasal tract
   than the lower respiratory tract. While temporal trends in viral
   diversity are limited, spatial patterns are clear, with heterogeneity in
   the viral genotypes detected at distinct anatomical sites revealing
   extensive compartmentalization of reassortment and replication. Our data
   indicate that the dynamics of viral replication in mammals allow
   diversification through reassortment but that the spatial
   compartmentalization of variants likely shapes their evolution and
   onward transmission.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Building a resilient and sustainable agricultural sector requires the
   development and implementation of tailored climate change adaptation
   strategies. By focusing on durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum)
   in the Euro-Mediterranean region, we estimate the benefits of adapting
   through seasonal cultivar-selection supported by an idealised
   agro-climate service based on seasonal climate forecasts. The cost of
   inaction in terms of mean yield losses, in 2021-2040, ranges from -7.8\%
   to -5.8\% associated with a 7\% to 12\% increase in interannual
   variability. Supporting cultivar choices at local scale may alleviate
   these impacts and even turn them into gains, from 0.4\% to 5.3\%, as
   soon as the performance of the agro-climate service increases. However,
   adaptation advantages on mean yield may come with doubling the estimated
   increase in the interannual yield variability.
   Climate modelling indicates that ecosystem services could alleviate
   climate change impacts on wheat yield in the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Calcium-mediated rapid movements defend against herbivorous insects in
   Mimosa pudica},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Animals possess specialized systems, e.g., neuromuscular systems, to
   sense the environment and then move their bodies quickly in response.
   Mimosa pudica, the sensitive plant, moves its leaves within seconds in
   response to external stimuli; e.g., touch or wounding. However, neither
   the plant-wide signaling network that triggers these rapid movements nor
   the physiological roles of the movements themselves have been
   determined. Here by simultaneous recording of cytosolic Ca2+ and
   electrical signals, we show that rapid changes in Ca2+ coupled with
   action and variation potentials trigger rapid movements in wounded M.
   pudica. Furthermore, pharmacological manipulation of cytosolic Ca2+
   dynamics and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology revealed that an
   immotile M. pudica is more vulnerable to attacks by herbivorous insects.
   Our findings provide evidence that rapid movements based on propagating
   Ca2+ and electrical signals protect this plant from insect attacks.

Abstract = {Bacterial symbionts, such as Wolbachia species, can manipulate the

   Bacterial symbionts, such as Wolbachia species, can manipulate the
   sexual development and reproduction of their insect hosts. For example,
   Wolbachia infection induces male-specific death in the Asian corn borer
   Ostrinia furnacalis by targeting the host factor Masculinizer (Masc), an
   essential protein for masculinization and dosage compensation in
   lepidopteran insects. Here we identify a Wolbachia protein, designated
   Oscar, which interacts with Masc via its ankyrin repeats. Embryonic
   expression of Oscar inhibits Masc-induced masculinization and leads to
   male killing in two lepidopteran insects, O. furnacalis and the silkworm
   Bombyx mori. Our study identifies a mechanism by which Wolbachia induce
   male killing of host progeny.},

Title = {Altered developmental programs and oriented cell divisions lead to bulky
   bones during salamander limb regeneration},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {There are major differences in duration and scale at which limb
   development and regeneration proceed, raising the question to what
   extent regeneration is a recapitulation of development. We address this
   by analyzing skeletal elements using a combination of micro-CT imaging,
   molecular profiling and clonal cell tracing. We find that, in contrast
   to development, regenerative skeletal growth is accomplished based
   entirely on cartilage expansion prior to ossification, not limiting the
   transversal cartilage expansion and resulting in bulkier skeletal parts.
   The oriented extension of salamander cartilage and bone appear similar
   to the development of basicranial synchondroses in mammals, as we found
   no evidence for cartilage stem cell niches or growth plate-like
   structures during neither development nor regeneration. Both
   regenerative and developmental ossification in salamanders start from
   the cortical bone and proceeds inwards, showing the diversity of schemes
   for the synchrony of cortical and endochondral ossification among
   vertebrates.
   Normal limb development relies on synchronized formation of cartilage
   and bone. Here, the authors show that in salamander limb regeneration
   these processes are decoupled: ossification occurs after the final size
   of regenerating cartilage is reached, allowing fast regeneration and
   leading to bulky bones.},

Title = {Water provisioning increases caged worker bee lifespan and caged worker
   bees are living half as long as observed 50 years ago},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The high loss rates of honey bee colonies drive research for solutions
   aimed to mitigate these losses. While honey bee colonies are
   superorganisms, experiments that measure the response to stressors often
   use caged individuals to allow for inference in a controlled setting. In
   an initial experiment, we showed that caged honey bees provisioned with
   various types of water (deionized, 1\%NaCl in deionized, or tap) have
   greater median lifespans than those that did not. While researching the
   history of water provisioning in cage studies, we observed that the
   median lifespan of caged honey bees has been declining in the US since
   the 1970's, from an average of 34.3 days to 17.7 days. In response to
   this, we again turned to historical record and found a relationship
   between this trend and a decline in the average amount of honey produced
   per colony per year in the US over the last 5 decades. To understand the
   relationship between individual bee lifespan and colony success we used
   an established honey bee population model (BEEHAVE) to simulate the
   predicted effects of decreased worker lifespans. Declines in downstream
   measures of colony population, overall honey production, and colony
   lifespan resulted from reduced worker bee lifespans. Modeled colony
   lifespans allowed us to estimate colony loss rates in a beekeeping
   operation where lost colonies are replaced annually. Resulting loss
   rates were reflective of what beekeepers' experience today, which
   suggests the average lifespan of individual bees plays an important role
   in colony success.},

Title = {Evolution of cross-tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster as a result of
   increased resistance to cold stress},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Cold stress is a critical environmental challenge that affects an
   organism's fitness-related traits. In Drosophila, increased resistance
   to specific environmental stress may lead to increased resistance to
   other kinds of stress. In the present study, we aimed to understand
   whether increased cold stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster can
   facilitate their ability to tolerate other environmental stresses. For
   the current study, we used successfully selected replicate populations
   of D. melanogaster against cold shock and their control population.
   These selected populations have evolved several reproductive traits,
   including increased egg viability, mating frequency, male mating
   ability, ability to sire progenies, and faster recovery for mating
   latency under cold shock conditions. In the present work, we
   investigated egg viability and mating frequency with and without heat
   and cold shock conditions in the selected and their control populations.
   We also examined resistance to cold shock, heat shock, desiccation,
   starvation, and survival post-challenge with Staphylococcus succinus
   subsp. succinus PK-1 in the selected and their control populations.
   After cold-shock treatment, we found a 1.25 times increase in egg
   viability and a 1.57 times increase in mating frequency in the selected
   populations compared to control populations. Moreover, more males (0.87
   times) and females (1.66 times) of the selected populations survived
   under cold shock conditions relative to their controls. After being
   subjected to heat shock, the selected population's egg viability and
   mating frequency increased by 0.30 times and 0.57 times, respectively,
   compared to control populations. Additionally, more selected males (0.31
   times) and females (0.98 times) survived under heat shock conditions
   compared to the control populations. Desiccation resistance slightly
   increased in the females of the selected populations relative to their
   control, but we observed no change in the case of males. Starvation
   resistance decreased in males and females of the selected populations
   compared to their controls. Our findings suggest that the increased
   resistance to cold shock correlates with increased tolerance to heat
   stress, but this evolved resistance comes at a cost, with decreased
   tolerance to starvation.},

Title = {A globally distributed durophagous marine reptile clade supports the
   rapid recovery of pelagic ecosystems after the Permo-Triassic mass
   extinction},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystem recovery after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction
   (PTME) has been extensively studied in the shallow sea, but little is
   known about the nature of this process in pelagic ecosystems.
   Omphalosauridae, an enigmatic clade of open-water durophagous marine
   reptiles, potentially played an important role in the recovery, but
   their fragmentary fossils and uncertain phylogenetic position have
   hindered our understanding of their role in the process. Here we report
   the large basal ichthyosauriform Sclerocormus from the Early Triassic of
   China that clearly demonstrates an omphalosaurid affinity, allowing for
   the synonymy of the recently erected Nasorostra with Omphalosauridae.
   The skull also reveals the anatomy of the unique feeding apparatus of
   omphalosaurids, likely an adaptation for feeding on hard-shelled pelagic
   invertebrates, especially ammonoids. Morphofunctional analysis of jaws
   shows that omphalosaurids occupy the morphospace of marine turtles. Our
   discovery adds another piece of evidence for an explosive radiation of
   marine reptiles into the ocean in the Early Triassic and the rapid
   recovery of pelagic ecosystems after the PTME.
   Further evidence for an explosive marine reptile diversification event
   in the Early Triassic is presented via morphological analysis of a new
   Sclerocormus specimen.},

Title = {Contrasting parental roles shape sex differences in poison frog space
   use but not navigational performance},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically
   interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits
   that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and
   better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters
   that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher
   androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are
   expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for
   disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between
   sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and
   androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals
   in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles
   shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental
   duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from
   their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that
   the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three
   species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative
   behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative
   behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog
   reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily
   navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing
   adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences
   in spatial abilities.},

Title = {Ordovician opabiniid-like animals and the role of the proboscis in
   euarthropod head evolution},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {A crucial step in the evolution of Euarthropoda (chelicerates,
   myriapods, pancrustaceans) was the transition between fossil groups that
   possessed frontal appendages innervated by the first segment of the
   brain (protocerebrum), and living groups with a protocerebral labrum and
   paired appendages innervated by the second brain segment
   (deutocerebrum). Appendage homologies between the groups are
   controversial. Here we describe two specimens of opabiniid-like
   euarthropods, each bearing an anterior proboscis (a fused protocerebral
   appendage), from the Middle Ordovician Castle Bank Biota, Wales, UK.
   Phylogenetic analyses support a paraphyletic grade of stem-group
   euarthropods with fused protocerebral appendages and a posterior-facing
   mouth, as in the iconic Cambrian panarthropod Opabinia. These results
   suggest that the labrum may have reduced from an already-fused
   proboscis, rather than a pair of arthropodized appendages. If some
   shared features between the Castle Bank specimens and radiodonts are
   considered convergent rather than homologous, phylogenetic analyses
   retrieve them as opabiniids, substantially extending the geographic and
   temporal range of Opabiniidae.
   Here, the authors describe two opabiniid-like euarthropods with anterior
   proboscises from the Middle Ordovician Castle Bank Biota, Wales, UK.
   Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these specimens may be sister to
   radiodonts and deuteropods.},

Title = {Two simple movement mechanisms for spatial division of labour in social
   insects},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Ant and honeybee workers specialize on certain tasks and also on zones
   within the nest; but how do they avoid straying into the wrong zone? The
   authors conduct automated tracking experiments following thousands of
   individuals, revealing that workers use context-dependent rules to
   navigate inside the nest.
   Many animal species divide space into a patchwork of home ranges, yet
   there is little consensus on the mechanisms individuals use to maintain
   fidelity to particular locations. Theory suggests that animal movement
   could be based upon simple behavioural rules that use local information
   such as olfactory deposits, or global strategies, such as long-range
   biases toward landmarks. However, empirical studies have rarely
   attempted to distinguish between these mechanisms. Here, we perform
   individual tracking experiments on four species of social insects, and
   find that colonies consist of different groups of workers that inhabit
   separate but partially-overlapping spatial zones. Our trajectory
   analysis and simulations suggest that worker movement is consistent with
   two local mechanisms: one in which workers increase movement diffusivity
   outside their primary zone, and another in which workers modulate
   turning behaviour when approaching zone boundaries. Parallels with other
   organisms suggest that local mechanisms might represent a universal
   method for spatial partitioning in animal populations.},

Title = {Mutagenesis alters sperm swimming velocity in Astyanax cave fish},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that intra ejaculate sperm competition
   screens against the transmission of deleterious alleles, including new
   mutants, from male parent to offspring. Recent investigations have
   established that sperm haploid genotypes can have major effects on sperm
   traits such as cellular robustness, longevity, and fertilization
   success. However, there is no evidence that new mutations can
   meaningfully affect sperm phenotypes. We tested this directly by
   comparing sperm from mutagenized and non-mutagenized control males in
   Astyanax fish. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) to induce single base
   substitutions in spermatogonial stem cells. We looked at swimming
   velocity, an important factor contributing to fertilization success, and
   flagellar length. Variability in swimming velocity was significantly
   higher in sperm from mutagenized males than in control sperm, reflecting
   their increased allelic diversity. In contrast, flagellar length, which
   is fixed during diploid stages of spermatogenesis, was unaffected by ENU
   treatment. We briefly discuss the implications of intra-ejaculate
   screening for maintenance of anisogamy and for outcomes of assisted
   reproductive technology.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Awareness has been raised over the last years on the genetic integrity
   of autochthonous honey bee subspecies. Genomic tools available in Apis
   mellifera can make it possible to measure this information by targeting
   individual honey bee DNA. Honey contains DNA traces from all organisms
   that contributed or were involved in its production steps, including the
   honey bees of the colony. In this study, we designed and tested a
   genotyping by sequencing (GBS) assay to analyse single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) of A. mellifera nuclear genome using environmental
   DNA extracted from honey. A total of 121 SNPs (97 SNPs informative for
   honey bee subspecies identification and 24 SNPs associated with relevant
   traits of the colonies) were used in the assay to genotype honey DNA,
   which derives from thousands of honey bees. Results were integrated with
   information derived from previous studies and whole genome resequencing
   datasets. This GBS method is highly reliable in estimating honey bee SNP
   allele frequencies of the whole colony from which the honey derived.
   This assay can be used to identify the honey bee subspecies of the
   colony that produced the honey and, in turn, to authenticate the
   entomological origin of the honey.},

Title = {Manatee calf call contour and acoustic structure varies by species and
   body size},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Vocal activity and signal characteristics of mammals are driven by
   several factors that result in both stability and plasticity over
   multiple time scales. All three extant species of manatee communicate
   with several calls that are especially important for maintaining contact
   between cows and calves. Determining if calf calls differ across manatee
   species will provide insights into the evolution of species-specific
   acoustic communication traits. We investigated the interspecific
   differences in the vocalizations of calves of Amazonian manatees
   (Trichechus inunguis) and the two subspecies of the West Indian manatee
   (T. manatus). Vocalizations of individual calves were recorded in
   rehabilitation centers in Brazil, Puerto Rico, the United States, and
   Mexico. The acoustic structure of calls produced by manatee calves
   varied between species and with body size. Amazonian manatee calves
   produced shorter calls with multiple notes at higher frequency while
   West Indian calves produced modulated calls that were lower in frequency
   and longer in duration. Smaller West Indian calves produced frequency
   modulated, hill-shaped calls that flattened with an increase in body
   length. Our results provide evidence for divergence in the ontogeny of
   vocalizations across T. manatus and T. inunguis and suggest variation in
   body size contributed to the evolution of differences in the
   characteristics of their calls.},

Title = {A conserved module in the formation of moss midribs and seed plant
   axillary meristems},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Different evolutionary lineages have evolved distinct characteristic
   body plans and anatomical structures, but their origins are largely
   elusive. For example, seed plants evolve axillary meristems to enable
   lateral branching. In moss, the phyllid (leaf) midrib containing
   specialized cells is responsible for water conduction and support.
   Midribs function like vascular tissues in flowering plants but may have
   risen from a different evolutionary path. Here, we demonstrate that
   midrib formation in the model moss Physcomitrium patens is regulated by
   orthologs of Arabidopsis LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LAS), a key regulator of
   axillary meristem initiation. Midribs are missing in loss-of-function
   mutants, and ectopic formation of midrib-like structures is induced in
   overexpression lines. Furthermore, the PpLAS/AtLAS genes have conserved
   functions in the promotion of cell division in both lineages, which
   alleviates phenotypes in both Physcomitrium and Arabidopsis las mutants.
   Our results show that a conserved regulatory module is reused in
   divergent developmental programs, water-conducting and supporting
   tissues in moss, and axillary meristem initiation in seed plants.},

Title = {TENT5 cytoplasmic noncanonical poly(A) polymerases regulate the innate
   immune response in animals},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against pathogens.
   Here, through global transcriptome and proteome analyses, we uncover
   that newly described cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase TENT-5 (terminal
   nucleotidyltransferase 5) enhances the expression of secreted innate
   immunity effector proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. Direct RNA
   sequencing revealed that multiple mRNAs with signal peptide-encoding
   sequences have shorter poly(A) tails in tent-5-deficient worms. Those
   mRNAs are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum where a fraction of
   TENT-5 is present, implying that they represent its direct substrates.
   Loss of tent-5 makes worms more susceptible to bacterial infection.
   Notably, the role of TENT-5 in innate immunity is evolutionarily
   conserved. Its orthologs, TENT5A and TENT5C, are expressed in
   macrophages and induced during their activation. Analysis of macrophages
   devoid of TENT5A/C revealed their role in the regulation of secreted
   proteins involved in defense response. In summary, our study reveals
   cytoplasmic polyadenylation to be a previously unknown component of the
   posttranscriptional regulation of innate immunity in animals.},

Title = {Chimera states among synchronous fireflies},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Systems of oscillators often converge to a state of synchrony when
   sufficiently interconnected. Twenty years ago, the mathematical analysis
   of models of coupled oscillators revealed the possibility for complex
   phases that exhibit a coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous
   clusters, known as ``chimera states.{''} Beyond their recurrence in
   theoretical models, chimeras have been observed under specifically
   designed experimental conditions, yet their emergence in nature has
   remained elusive. Here, we report evidence for the occurrence of
   chimeras in a celebrated realization of natural synchrony: fireflies. In
   video recordings of Photuris frontalis fireflies, we observe, within a
   single swarm, the spontaneous emergence of different groups flashing
   with the same periodicity but with a constant delay between them. From
   the three-dimensional reconstruction of the swarm, we demonstrate that
   these states are stable over time and spatially intertwined. We discuss
   the implications of these findings on the synergy between mathematical
   models and collective behavior.},

Title = {Pathogen spillover driven by rapid changes in bat ecology},
Journal = {NATURE},

Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {During recent decades, pathogens that originated in bats have become an
   increasing public health concern. A major challenge is to identify how
   those pathogens spill over into human populations to generate a pandemic
   threat(1). Many correlational studies associate spillover with changes
   in land use or other anthropogenic stressors(2,3), although the
   mechanisms underlying the observed correlations have not been
   identified(4). One limitation is the lack of spatially and temporally
   explicit data on multiple spillovers, and on the connections among
   spillovers, reservoir host ecology and behaviour and viral dynamics. We
   present 25 years of data on land-use change, bat behaviour and spillover
   of Hendra virus from Pteropodid bats to horses in subtropical Australia.
   These data show that bats are responding to environmental change by
   persistently adopting behaviours that were previously transient
   responses to nutritional stress. Interactions between land-use change
   and climate now lead to persistent bat residency in agricultural areas,
   where periodic food shortages drive clusters of spillovers. Pulses of
   winter flowering of trees in remnant forests appeared to prevent
   spillover. We developed integrative Bayesian network models based on
   these phenomena that accurately predicted the presence or absence of
   clusters of spillovers in each of the 25 years. Our long-term study
   identifies the mechanistic connections between habitat loss, climate and
   increased spillover risk. It provides a framework for examining causes
   of bat virus spillover and for developing ecological countermeasures to
   prevent pandemics.},

Title = {Genetic slippage after sex maintains diversity for parasite resistance
   in a natural host population},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Although parasite-mediated selection is a major driver of host
   evolution, its influence on genetic variation for parasite resistance is
   not yet well understood. We monitored resistance in a large population
   of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna over 8 years, as it underwent
   yearly epidemics of the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa. We observed
   cyclic dynamics of resistance: Resistance increased throughout the
   epidemics, but susceptibility was restored each spring when hosts
   hatched from sexual resting stages. Host resting stages collected across
   the year showed that largely resistant host populations can produce
   susceptible sexual offspring. A genetic model of resistance developed
   for this host-parasite system, based on multiple loci and strong
   epistasis, is in partial agreement with our findings. Our results reveal
   that, despite strong selection for resistance in a natural host
   population, genetic slippage after sexual reproduction can be a strong
   factor for the maintenance of genetic diversity of host resistance.},

Title = {Clustering of vomeronasal receptor genes is required for transcriptional
   stability but not for choice},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Rodents perceive pheromones via vomeronasal receptors encoded by highly
   evolutionarily dynamic Vr and Fpr gene superfamilies. We report here
   that high numbers of V1r pseudogenes are scattered in mammalian genomes,
   contrasting with the clustered organization of functional V1r and Fpr
   genes. We also found that V1r pseudogenes are more likely to be
   expressed when located in a functional V1r gene cluster than when
   isolated. To explore the potential regulatory role played by the
   association of functional vomeronasal receptor genes with their
   clusters, we dissociated the mouse Fpr-rs3 from its native cluster via
   transgenesis. Singular and specific transgenic Fpr-rs3 transcription was
   observed in young vomeronasal neurons but was only transient. Our study
   of natural and artificial dispersed gene duplications uncovers the
   existence of transcription-stabilizing elements not coupled to
   vomeronasal gene units but rather associated with vomeronasal gene
   clusters and thus explains the evolutionary conserved clustered
   organization of functional vomeronasal genes.},

   wing damage},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {46},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Physical injury often impairs mobility, which can have dire consequences
   for survival in animals. Revealing mechanisms of robust biological
   intelligence to prevent system failure can provide critical insights
   into how complex brains generate adaptive movement and inspiration to
   design fault-tolerant robots. For flying animals, physical injury to a
   wing can have severe consequences, as flight is inherently unstable.
   Using a virtual reality flight arena, we studied how flying fruit flies
   compensate for damage to one wing. By combining experimental and
   mathematical methods, we show that flies compensate for wing damage by
   corrective wing movement modulated by closedloop sensing and robust
   mechanics. Injured flies actively increase damping and, in doing so,
   modestly decrease flight performance but fly as stably as uninjured
   flies. Quantifying responses to injury can uncover the flexibility and
   robustness of biological systems while informing the development of
   bio-inspired fault-tolerant strategies.},

Title = {Intensive grassland management disrupts below-ground multi-trophic
   resource transfer in response to drought},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Land use intensification could make soil food webs less able to recover
   from drought. Here, the authors find that intensive grassland management
   impairs recent photosynthate flux to roots and soil biota after drought,
   whereas extensive grassland management buffers the legacy of drought.
   Modification of soil food webs by land management may alter the response
   of ecosystem processes to climate extremes, but empirical support is
   limited and the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we quantify how
   grassland management modifies the transfer of recent photosynthates and
   soil nitrogen through plants and soil food webs during a post-drought
   period in a controlled field experiment, using in situ C-13 and N-15
   pulse-labelling in intensively and extensively managed fields. We show
   that intensive management decrease plant carbon (C) capture and its
   transfer through components of food webs and soil respiration compared
   to extensive management. We observe a legacy effect of drought on C
   transfer pathways mainly in intensively managed grasslands, by
   increasing plant C assimilation and C-13 released as soil CO2 efflux but
   decreasing its transfer to roots, bacteria and Collembola. Our work
   provides insight into the interactive effects of grassland management
   and drought on C transfer pathways, and highlights that capture and
   rapid transfer of photosynthates through multi-trophic networks are key
   for maintaining grassland resistance to drought.},

Volume = {98},

Pages = {567-583},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In internally fertilizing species, sperm transfer is not always
   immediately followed by egg fertilization, and female sperm storage
   (FSS) may occur. FSS is a phenomenon in which females store sperm in a
   specialized organ for periods lasting from a few hours to several years,
   depending on the species. Eusocial hymenopterans (ants, social bees, and
   social wasps) hold the record for FSS duration. In these species, mating
   takes place during a single nuptial flight that occurs early in adult
   life for both sexes; they never mate again. Males die quickly after
   copulation but survive posthumously as sperm stored in their mates'
   spermathecae. Reproductive females, also known as queens, have a much
   longer life expectancy, up to 20 years in some species. Here, we review
   what is currently known about the molecular adaptations underlying the
   remarkable FSS capacities in eusocial hymenopterans. Because sperm
   quality is crucial to the reproductive success of both sexes, we also
   discuss the mechanisms involved in sperm storage and preservation in the
   male seminal vesicles prior to ejaculation. Finally, we propose future
   research directions that should broaden our understanding of this unique
   biological phenomenon.},

Title = {Host biology, ecology and the environment influence microbial biomass

Abstract = {Fish are the most diverse and widely distributed vertebrates, yet little
   is known about the microbial ecology of fishes nor the biological and
   environmental factors that influence fish microbiota. To identify
   factors that explain microbial diversity patterns in a geographical
   subset of marine fish, we analyzed the microbiota (gill tissue, skin
   mucus, midgut digesta and hindgut digesta) from 101 species of Southern
   California marine fishes, spanning 22 orders, 55 families and 83 genera,
   representing similar to 25\% of local marine fish diversity. We compare
   alpha, beta and gamma diversity while establishing a method to estimate
   microbial biomass associated with these host surfaces. We show that body
   site is the strongest driver of microbial diversity while microbial
   biomass and diversity is lowest in the gill of larger, pelagic fishes.
   Patterns of phylosymbiosis are observed across the gill, skin and
   hindgut. In a quantitative synthesis of vertebrate hindguts (569
   species), we also show that mammals have the highest gamma diversity
   when controlling for host species number while fishes have the highest
   percent of unique microbial taxa. The composite dataset will be useful
   to vertebrate microbiota researchers and fish biologists interested in
   microbial ecology, with applications in aquaculture and fisheries
   management.},

Title = {Biological effects of the loss of homochirality in a multicellular
   organism},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Active regulation of chirality, or handedness, is crucial for life.
   Here, the authors describe assays to characterise proteome chirality in
   vivo and show that errors degrade enzyme activity triggering tumour
   formation and reduced lifespan.
   Homochirality is a fundamental feature of all known forms of life,
   maintaining biomolecules (amino-acids, proteins, sugars, nucleic acids)
   in one specific chiral form. While this condition is central to biology,
   the mechanisms by which the adverse accumulation of
   non-l-alpha-amino-acids in proteins lead to pathophysiological
   consequences remain poorly understood. To address how heterochirality
   build-up impacts organism's health, we use chiral-selective in vivo
   assays to detect protein-bound non-l-alpha-amino acids (focusing on
   aspartate) and assess their functional significance in Drosophila. We
   find that altering the in vivo chiral balance creates a `heterochirality
   syndrome' with impaired caspase activity, increased tumour formation,
   and premature death. Our work shows that preservation of homochirality
   is a key component of protein function that is essential to maintain
   homeostasis across the cell, tissue and organ level.},

Title = {Identifying behavioral structure from deep variational embeddings of
   animal motion},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Variational embeddings of animal motion enable automated discovery of
   discrete behavioural motifs as well as their latent dynamics.
   Quantification and detection of the hierarchical organization of
   behavior is a major challenge in neuroscience. Recent advances in
   markerless pose estimation enable the visualization of high-dimensional
   spatiotemporal behavioral dynamics of animal motion. However, robust and
   reliable technical approaches are needed to uncover underlying structure
   in these data and to segment behavior into discrete hierarchically
   organized motifs. Here, we present an unsupervised probabilistic deep
   learning framework that identifies behavioral structure from deep
   variational embeddings of animal motion (VAME). By using a mouse model
   of beta amyloidosis as a use case, we show that VAME not only identifies
   discrete behavioral motifs, but also captures a hierarchical
   representation of the motif's usage. The approach allows for the
   grouping of motifs into communities and the detection of differences in
   community-specific motif usage of individual mouse cohorts that were
   undetectable by human visual observation. Thus, we present a robust
   approach for the segmentation of animal motion that is applicable to a
   wide range of experimental setups, models and conditions without
   requiring supervised or a-priori human interference.},

Title = {Survival fluctuation is linked to precipitation variation during staging

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Understanding how weather conditions affect animal populations is
   essential to foresee population changes in times of global climate
   shifts. However, assessing year-round weather impacts on demographic
   parameters is hampered in migratory animals due to often unknown
   occurrence in space and time. We addressed this by coupling tracking and
   weather data to explain extensive variation in apparent survival across
   19 years in a northern European population of little ringed plovers
   (Charadrius dubius). Over 90\% (n = 21) of tracked individuals followed
   migration routes along the Indo-European flyway to south India. Building
   on capture-recapture histories of nearly 1400 individuals, we found that
   between-year variation in precipitation during post-breeding staging in
   northern South Asia explained 47\% of variation in apparent adult
   survival. Overall, the intensity of the monsoon in South Asia explained
   31-33\% of variability in apparent survival. In contrast, weather
   conditions in breeding, final non-breeding and pre-breeding quarters
   appeared less important in this species. The integration of multi-source
   data seems essential for identifying key regions and periods limiting
   population growth, for forecasting future changes and targeting
   conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is widely used for species
   analysis, while the use of environmental RNA (eRNA) metabarcoding is
   more limited. We conducted comparative eDNA/eRNA metabarcoding of the
   algae and arthropods (aquatic insects) in water samples from Naka River,
   Japan, to evaluate their potential for biological monitoring and water
   quality assessment. Both methods detected various algae and arthropod
   species; however, their compositions were remarkably different from
   those in traditional field surveys (TFSs), indicating low sensitivity.
   For algae, the species composition derived from eDNA and eRNA
   metabarcoding was equivalent. While TFSs focus on attached algae,
   metabarcoding analysis theoretically detects both planktonic and
   attached algae. A recently expanded genomic database for aquatic insects
   significantly contributed to the sensitivity and positive predictivity
   for arthropods. While the sensitivity of eRNA was lower than that of
   eDNA, the positive predictivity of eRNA was higher. The eRNA of
   terrestrial arthropods indicated extremely high or low read numbers when
   compared with eDNA, suggesting that eRNA could be an effective indicator
   of false positives. Arthropod and algae eDNA/eRNA metabarcoding analysis
   enabled water quality estimates from TFSs. The eRNA of algae and
   arthropods could thus be used to evaluate biodiversity and water quality
   and provide insights from ecological surveys.},

Title = {Quantifying thermal cues that initiate mass emigrations in juvenile
   white sharks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {While the function of migration varies among species, environmental
   temperature is known to be one of the most important abiotic variables
   that drive animal migration; however, quantifying the thresholds and
   timing of the cues that influence a mass emigration is difficult, often
   due to lack of monitoring resolution, particularly for large, highly
   mobile species. We used acoustic telemetry tracking and high-resolution
   water temperature data over a relatively large spatial scale (5.5 km(2))
   to identify and quantify a thermal threshold for mass emigration of
   juvenile white sharks. Sixteen tagged sharks were observed to initiate a
   search for warmer water within 10-12 hours of an upwelling event where
   water temperatures dropped below 14 degrees C. Eleven sharks traveled
   similar to 35 km away where they experienced similar cold temperatures
   before returning to the aggregation site within 24 hours. Five days
   following the upwelling event, most sharks emigrated from the site for
   the season. Quantifying movement patterns across different spatial and
   temporal scales is necessary to understand cues and thresholds
   influencing animal migration, which may be greatly affected by climate
   anomalies and climate change, resulting in potential impacts on the
   dynamics of local prey species, management, and conservation policy and
   practice.},

Title = {Consistent diel activity patterns of forest mammals among tropical
   regions},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {An animal's daily use of time (their ``diel activity{''}) reflects their
   adaptations, requirements, and interactions, yet we know little about
   the underlying processes governing diel activity within and among
   communities. Here we examine whether community-level activity patterns
   differ among biogeographic regions, and explore the roles of top-down
   versus bottom-up processes and thermoregulatory constraints. Using data
   from systematic cameratrap networks in 16 protected forests across the
   tropics, we examine the relationships of mammals' diel activity to body
   mass and trophic guild. Also, we assess the activity relationships
   within and among guilds. Apart from Neotropical insectivores, guilds
   exhibited consistent cross-regional activity in relation to body mass.
   Results indicate that thermoregulation constrains herbivore and
   insectivore activity (e.g., larger Afrotropical herbivores are -7 times
   more likely to be nocturnal than smaller herbivores), while bottom-up
   processes constrain the activity of carnivores in relation to
   herbivores, and top-down processes constrain the activity of small
   omnivores and insectivores in relation to large carnivores' activity.
   Overall, diel activity of tropical mammal communities appears shaped by
   similar processes and constraints among regions reflecting body mass and
   trophic guilds.},

Title = {Land-use and climate risk assessment for Earth's wilderness},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {22},

Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Earth's wilderness areas are reservoirs of genetic information and
   carbon storage systems, and are vital to reducing extinction risks.
   Retaining the conservation value of these areas is fundamental to
   achieving global biodiversity conservation goals; however, climate and
   land-use risk can undermine their ability to provide these functions.
   The extent to which wilderness areas are likely to be impacted by these
   drivers has not pre-viously been quantified. Using climate and land-use
   change during baseline (1971-2005) and future (2016- 2050) periods, we
   estimate that these stressors within wilderness areas will increase by
   ca. 60\% and 39\%, respectively, under a scenario of high emission and
   land-use change (SSP5-RCP8.5). Nearly half (49\%) of all wilderness
   areas could experience substantial climate change by 2050 under this
   scenario, potentially limiting their capacity to shelter biodiversity.
   Notable climate (>5 km year -1) and land-use (>0.25 km year -1) changes
   are expected to occur more rapidly in the unprotected wilderness,
   including the edges of the Amazonian wilderness, Northern Russia, and
   Central Africa, which support unique assemblages of species and are
   critical for the preservation of biodiversity. However, an alternative
   scenario of sustainable develop-ment (SSP1-RCP2.6) would attenuate the
   projected climate velocity and land-use instability by 54\% and 6\%,
   respectively. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and preserving the
   remaining intact natural ecosystems can help fortify these bastions of
   biodiversity.},

Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Intact tropical forests have a high conservation value.1 Although
   perceived as wild,2 they have been under long-term human influence.3 As
   global area-based conservation targets increase, the ecological
   contribu-tions of Indigenous peoples through their governance
   institutions and practices4 are gaining mainstream interest. Indigenous
   lands-covering a quarter of Earth's surface5 and overlapping with a
   third of intact forests6-often have reduced deforestation, degradation,
   and carbon emissions, compared with non -pro-tected areas and protected
   areas.7,8 A key question with implications for the design of more
   equitable and effective conservation policies is to understand the
   impacts of Indigenous lands on forest integrity and long-term use, as
   critical measures of ecosystem health included within the post-2020
   Global Biodiversity Framework.9 Using the forest landscape integrity
   index10 and Anthromes11 datasets, we find that high -integrity forests
   tend to be located within the overlap of protected areas and Indigenous
   lands (protected -Indigenous areas). After accounting for location
   biases through statistical matching and regression, protected-Indigenous
   areas had the highest protective effect on forest integrity and the
   lowest land-use intensity relative to Indigenous lands, protected areas,
   and non-protected controls pan-tropically. The pro-tective effect of
   Indigenous lands on forest integrity was lower in Indigenous lands than
   in protected areas and non-protected areas in the Americas and Asia. The
   combined positive effects of state legislation and Indigenous presence
   in protected-Indigenous areas may contribute to maintaining tropical
   forest integrity. Understanding management and governance in
   protected-Indigenous areas can help states to appropriately support
   community-governed lands.},

   behaviors remain largely unknown. We investigated infant care behaviors
   of captive marmosets in family settings and caregiver-infant dyadic
   situations. Marmoset caregivers exhibited individual variations in
   parenting styles, comprised of sensitivity and tolerance toward infants,
   consistently across infants, social contexts and multiple births.
   Seeking the neural basis of these parenting styles, we demonstrated that
   the calcitonin receptor-expressing neurons in the marmoset medial
   preoptic area (MPOA) were transcriptionally activated during infant
   care, as in laboratory mice. Further, site-specific neurotoxic lesions
   of this MPOA subregion, termed the cMPOA, significantly reduced
   alloparental tolerance and total infant carrying, while sparing general
   health and other social or nonsocial behaviors. These results suggest
   that the molecularly-defined neural site cMPOA is responsible for
   mammalian parenting, thus provide an invaluable model to study the
   neural basis of parenting styles in primates.
   Like humans, marmoset caregivers exhibit individual parenting styles.
   Among these, infant tolerance is in part regulated by a subregion of the
   medial preoptic area enriched with calcitonin receptor-expressing
   neurons.},

Title = {Testicular heat stress, a historical perspective and two postulates for

Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {603-622},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Herein, we compare the different experimental regimes used to induce
   testicular heat stress and summarise their impact on sperm production
   and male fertility. Irrespective of the protocol used, scrotal heat
   stress causes loss of sperm production. This is first seen 1-2 weeks
   post heat stress, peaking 4-5 weeks thereafter. The higher the
   temperature, or the longer the duration of heat, the more pronounced
   germ cell loss becomes, within extreme cases this leads to azoospermia.
   The second, and often underappreciated impact of testicular hyperthermia
   is the production of poor-quality spermatozoa. Typically, those cells
   that survive hyperthermia develop into morphologically abnormal and
   poorly motile spermatozoa. While both apoptotic and non-apoptotic
   pathways are known to contribute to hyperthermic germ cell loss, the
   mechanisms leading to formation of poor-quality sperm remain
   unclear.Mechanistically, it is unlikely that testicular hyperthermia
   affects messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance, as a comparison of four
   different mammalian studies shows no consistent single gene changes.
   Using available evidence, we propose two novel models to explain how
   testicular hyperthermia impairs sperm formation. Our first model
   suggests aberrant alternative splicing, while the second model proposes
   a loss of RNA repression. Importantly, neither model requires consistent
   changes in RNA species.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Climate change may be inducing phenological mismatches between trees and
   understory plants. Here, phenological models based on long-term data
   from herbarium specimens indicate that spring ephemeral wildflowers are
   more vulnerable to such mismatches in North America than in Eurasia.
   Temperate understory plant species are at risk from climate change and
   anthropogenic threats that include increased deer herbivory, habitat
   loss, pollinator declines and mismatch, and nutrient pollution. Recent
   work suggests that spring ephemeral wildflowers may be at additional
   risk due to phenological mismatch with deciduous canopy trees. The study
   of this dynamic, commonly referred to as ``phenological escape{''}, and
   its sensitivity to spring temperature is limited to eastern North
   America. Here, we use herbarium specimens to show that phenological
   sensitivity to spring temperature is remarkably conserved for understory
   wildflowers across North America, Europe, and Asia, but that canopy
   trees in North America are significantly more sensitive to spring
   temperature compared to in Asia and Europe. We predict that advancing
   tree phenology will lead to decreasing spring light windows in North
   America while spring light windows will be maintained or even increase
   in Asia and Europe in response to projected climate warming.},

Title = {Genomic signatures of recent convergent transitions to social life in
   spiders},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Sociality has evolved repeatedly in arthropods. Tong et al. compare the
   genomes of 22 spider species with a range of social complexity and eight
   independent origins of sociality, and identify specific genetic changes
   associated with the evolution of sociality in spiders.
   The transition from solitary to social life is a major phenotypic
   innovation, but its genetic underpinnings are largely unknown. To
   identify genomic changes associated with this transition, we compare the
   genomes of 22 spider species representing eight recent and independent
   origins of sociality. Hundreds of genes tend to experience shifts in
   selection during the repeated transition to social life. These genes are
   associated with several key functions, such as neurogenesis, behavior,
   and metabolism, and include genes that previously have been implicated
   in animal social behavior and human behavioral disorders. In addition,
   social species have elevated genome-wide rates of molecular evolution
   associated with relaxed selection caused by reduced effective population
   size. Altogether, our study provides unprecedented insights into the
   genomic signatures of social evolution and the specific genetic changes
   that repeatedly underpin the evolution of sociality. Our study also
   highlights the heretofore unappreciated potential of transcriptomics
   using ethanol-preserved specimens for comparative genomics and
   phylotranscriptomics.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {An analysis of gull wing colour and loading indicates an evolutionary
   trade-off between dark wings and flight capability.
   There are many hypotheses explaining the diversity of colours and
   patterns found in nature, but they are often difficult to examine
   empirically. Recent studies show the dark upperside of gliding birds'
   wings could reduce drag by decreasing the density of surrounding air. It
   may therefore be expected that species with darker wings have less
   efficient morphology than their paler counterparts. I conducted an
   analysis of the Larinae (gulls), which exhibit extreme variation in wing
   (mantle and wingtip) melanization, to test whether wing loading is a
   predictor of wing darkness. I found that, for each standard deviation
   increase in wing loading, mantle darkness is predicted to increase by
   1.2 shades on the Kodak grey scale. Wing loading is also positively
   related to the proportion of black on wingtips. Furthermore, heavier
   species have lower aspect ratio wings, suggesting that dark wings have
   evolved to improve the trade-off between maneuverability and long
   distance flight.},

Title = {The trace metal economy of the coral holobiont: supplies, demands and
   exchanges},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {623-642},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The juxtaposition of highly productive coral reef ecosystems in
   oligotrophic waters has spurred substantial interest and progress in our
   understanding of macronutrient uptake, exchange, and recycling among
   coral holobiont partners (host coral, dinoflagellate endosymbiont,
   endolithic algae, fungi, viruses, bacterial communities). By contrast,
   the contribution of trace metals to the physiological performance of the
   coral holobiont and, in turn, the functional ecology of reef-building
   corals remains unclear. The coral holobiont's trace metal economy is a
   network of supply, demand, and exchanges upheld by cross-kingdom
   symbiotic partnerships. Each partner has unique trace metal requirements
   that are central to their biochemical functions and the metabolic
   stability of the holobiont. Organismal homeostasis and the exchanges
   among partners determine the ability of the coral holobiont to adjust to
   fluctuating trace metal supplies in heterogeneous reef environments.
   This review details the requirements for trace metals in core biological
   processes and describes how metal exchanges among holobiont partners are
   key to sustaining complex nutritional symbioses in oligotrophic
   environments. Specifically, we discuss how trace metals contribute to
   partner compatibility, ability to cope with stress, and thereby to
   organismal fitness and distribution. Beyond holobiont trace metal
   cycling, we outline how the dynamic nature of the availability of
   environmental trace metal supplies can be influenced by a variability of
   abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, light, pH, etc.). Climate change will
   have profound consequences on the availability of trace metals and
   further intensify the myriad stressors that influence coral survival.
   Lastly, we suggest future research directions necessary for
   understanding the impacts of trace metals on the coral holobiont
   symbioses spanning subcellular to organismal levels, which will inform
   nutrient cycling in coral ecosystems more broadly. Collectively, this
   cross-scale elucidation of the role of trace metals for the coral
   holobiont will allow us to improve forecasts of future coral reef
   function.},

Abstract = {Skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical for muscle force
   production and the regulation of important physiological processes
   during growth, regeneration, and remodelling. ECM remodelling is a
   tightly orchestrated process, sensitive to multi-directional tensile and
   compressive stresses and damaging stimuli, and its assessment can convey
   important information on rehabilitation effectiveness, injury, and
   disease. Despite its profound importance, ECM biomarkers are underused
   in studies examining the effects of exercise, disuse, or aging on muscle
   function, growth, and structure. This review examines patterns of short-
   and long-term changes in the synthesis and concentrations of ECM markers
   in biofluids and tissues, which may be useful for describing the time
   course of ECM remodelling following physical activity and disuse. Forces
   imposed on the ECM during physical activity critically affect cell
   signalling while disuse causes non-optimal adaptations, including
   connective tissue proliferation. The goal of this review is to inform
   researchers, and rehabilitation, medical, and exercise practitioners
   better about the role of ECM biomarkers in research and clinical
   environments to accelerate the development of targeted physical activity
   treatments, improve ECM status assessment, and enhance function in
   aging, injury, and disease.},

Title = {Resource sharing is sufficient for the emergence of division of labour},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Division of labour, where members of a group specialise on different
   tasks, is a central feature of many social organisms. Using a
   theoretical model, the authors demonstrate that division of labour can
   emerge spontaneously within a group of entirely identical individuals.
   Division of labour occurs in a broad range of organisms. Yet, how
   division of labour can emerge in the absence of pre-existing
   interindividual differences is poorly understood. Using a simple but
   realistic model, we show that in a group of initially identical
   individuals, division of labour emerges spontaneously if returning
   foragers share part of their resources with other group members. In the
   absence of resource sharing, individuals follow an activity schedule of
   alternating between foraging and other tasks. If non-foraging
   individuals are fed by other individuals, their alternating activity
   schedule becomes interrupted, leading to task specialisation and the
   emergence of division of labour. Furthermore, nutritional differences
   between individuals reinforce division of labour. Such differences can
   be caused by increased metabolic rates during foraging or by dominance
   interactions during resource sharing. Our model proposes a plausible
   mechanism for the self-organised emergence of division of labour in
   animal groups of initially identical individuals. This mechanism could
   also play a role for the emergence of division of labour during the
   major evolutionary transitions to eusociality and multicellularity.},

Abstract = {Mammalian models of human disease are expensive and subject to ethical
   restrictions. Here, we present an independent platform for
   high-throughput screening, using larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca
   sexta, combining diagnostic imaging modalities for a comprehensive
   characterization of aberrant phenotypes. For validation, we use
   bacterial/chemical-induced gut inflammation to generate a colitis-like
   phenotype and identify significant alterations in morphology, tissue
   properties, and intermediary metabolism, which aggravate with disease
   progression and can be rescued by antimicrobial treatment. In
   independent experiments, activation of the highly conserved NADPH
   oxidase DUOX, a key mediator of gut inflammation, leads to similar,
   dose-dependent alterations, which can be attenuated by pharmacological
   interventions. Furthermore, the developed platform could differentiate
   pathogens from mutualistic gastrointestinal bacteria broadening the
   scope of applications also to microbiomics and host-pathogen
   interactions. Overall, larvae-based screening can complement mammals in
   preclinical studies to explore innate immunity and host-pathogen
   interactions, thus representing a substantial contribution to improve
   mammalian welfare.
   Here, combining diagnostic imaging modalities and in vivo assays,
   Windfelder and colleagues established tobacco hornworm larvae Manduca
   sexta as an alternative high-throughput platform to study the innate
   immunity of the gut and host-pathogen interactions. Using the platform,
   the authors identify mediators of gut inflammation, differentiate
   pathogens from gut mutualist bacteria, and demonstrate pharmacological
   interventions.},

Title = {US winter wheat yield loss attributed to compound hot-dry-windy events},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The authors show that in recent decades compound climate extremes (i.e.,
   hot, dry, and windy events) have increased and have reduced winter wheat
   yields in the U.S. Great Plains. The area most affected is the same area
   as that in 1930s Dust Bowl.
   Climate extremes cause significant winter wheat yield loss and can cause
   much greater impacts than single extremes in isolation when multiple
   extremes occur simultaneously. Here we show that compound hot-dry-windy
   events (HDW) significantly increased in the U.S. Great Plains from 1982
   to 2020. These HDW events were the most impactful drivers for wheat
   yield loss, accounting for a 4\% yield reduction per 10 h of HDW during
   heading to maturity. Current HDW trends are associated with yield
   reduction rates of up to 0.09 t ha(-1) per decade and HDW variations are
   atmospheric-bridged with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We quantify
   the ``yield shock{''}, which is spatially distributed, with the losses
   in severely HDW-affected areas, presumably the same areas affected by
   the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Our findings indicate that compound HDW,
   which traditional risk assessments overlooked, have significant
   implications for the U.S. winter wheat production and beyond.},

Title = {Parasitic infection increases risk-taking in a social, intermediate host
   carnivore},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Wolf behavioural, spatial, and serological data over 26 years show that
   wolf territory overlap with areas of high cougar density is a
   significant predictor of T. gondii infection. Further, infection
   increases the likelihood that wolves make high-risk decisions such as
   dispersing and becoming a pack leader.
   Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite capable of infecting any
   warm-blooded species and can increase risk-taking in intermediate hosts.
   Despite extensive laboratory research on the effects of T. gondii
   infection on behaviour, little is understood about the effects of
   toxoplasmosis on wild intermediate host behavior. Yellowstone National
   Park, Wyoming, USA, has a diverse carnivore community including gray
   wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor), intermediate and
   definitive hosts of T. gondii, respectively. Here, we used 26 years of
   wolf behavioural, spatial, and serological data to show that wolf
   territory overlap with areas of high cougar density was an important
   predictor of infection. In addition, seropositive wolves were more
   likely to make high-risk decisions such as dispersing and becoming a
   pack leader, both factors critical to individual fitness and wolf vital
   rates. Due to the social hierarchy within a wolf pack, we hypothesize
   that the behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis may create a feedback loop
   that increases spatial overlap and disease transmission between wolves
   and cougars. These findings demonstrate that parasites have important
   implications for intermediate hosts, beyond acute infections, through
   behavioural impacts. Particularly in a social species, these impacts can
   surge beyond individuals to affect groups, populations, and even
   ecosystem processes.},

Abstract = {Non-perennial rivers and streams - those that periodically cease flowing
   - are critical components of aquatic systems and comprise over half of
   global river and stream systems. We argue for coordinated,
   collaborative, standardized, and open efforts to understand their unique
   biogeochemical behaviour, which is becoming ever more pressing due to
   pronounced shifts between wet and dry as the climate changes.
   Rivers and streams are increasingly drying with climate change and
   biogeochemical impacts may be important. In this comment the authors
   discuss the challenges to the biogeochemistry of non-perennial rivers
   and streams, and what can be done to tackle them.},

Title = {Feather function and the evolution of birds},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {540-566},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The ability of feathers to perform many functions either simultaneously
   or at different times throughout the year or life of a bird is integral
   to the evolutionary history of birds. Many studies focus on single
   functions of feathers, but any given feather performs many functions
   over its lifetime. These functions necessarily interact with each other
   throughout the evolution and development of birds, so our knowledge of
   avian evolution is incomplete without understanding the
   multifunctionality of feathers, and how different functions may act
   synergistically or antagonistically during natural selection. Here, we
   review how feather functions interact with avian evolution, with a focus
   on recent technological and discovery-based advances. By synthesising
   research into feather functions over hierarchical scales (pattern,
   arrangement, macrostructure, microstructure, nanostructure, molecules),
   we aim to provide a broad context for how the adaptability and
   multifunctionality of feathers have allowed birds to diversify into an
   astounding array of environments and life-history strategies. We suggest
   that future research into avian evolution involving feather function
   should consider multiple aspects of a feather, including multiple
   functions, seasonal wear and renewal, and ecological or mechanical
   interactions. With this more holistic view, processes such as the
   evolution of avian coloration and flight can be understood in a broader
   and more nuanced context.},

Abstract = {For more than a century, the origin and evolution of the arthropod head
   and brain have eluded a unifying rationale reconciling divergent
   morphologies and phylogenetic relationships. Here, clarification is
   provided by the fossilized nervous system of the lower Cambrian
   lobopodian Cardiodictyon catenulum, which reveals an unsegmented head
   and brain comprising three cephalic domains, distinct from the metameric
   ventral nervous system serving its appendicular trunk. Each domain
   aligns with one of three components of the foregut and with a pair of
   head appendages. Morphological correspondences with stemgroup arthropods
   and alignments of homologous gene expression patterns with those of
   extant panarthropods demonstrate that cephalic domains of C. catenulum
   predate the evolution of the euarthropod head yet correspond to
   neuromeres defining brains of living chelicerates and mandibulates.},

Abstract = {Grazing represents the most extensive use of land worldwide. Yet its
   impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive
   interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and
   biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously.
   Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show
   that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and
   biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental
   ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing
   pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and speciespoor
   drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder
   and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and
   local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of
   dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure.},

Title = {Increased fire activity under high atmospheric oxygen concentrations is
   compatible with the presence of forests},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Throughout Earth's history, the abundance of oxygen in our atmosphere
   has varied, but by how much remains debated. Previously, an upper limit
   for atmospheric oxygen has been bounded by assumptions made regarding
   the fire window: atmospheric oxygen concentrations higher than 30-40\%
   would threaten the regeneration of forests in the present world. Here we
   have tested these assumptions by adapting a Dynamic Global Vegetation
   Model to run over high atmospheric oxygen concentrations. Our results
   show that whilst global tree cover is significantly reduced under high
   O-2 concentrations, forests persist in the wettest parts of the low and
   high latitudes and fire is more dependent on fuel moisture than O-2
   levels. This implies that the effect of fire on suppressing global
   vegetation under high O-2 may be lower than previously assumed and
   questions our understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulating the
   abundance of oxygen in our atmosphere, with moisture as a potentially
   important factor.
   This study shows that fire activity under high atmospheric oxygen
   concentrations does not remove or prevent regeneration of present-day
   global forests, contradicting a long-term assumption used to define the
   upper limit of oxygen through time.},

Title = {Plant genetic diversity affects multiple trophic levels and trophic
   interactions},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Plant intraspecific diversity genetic diversity could affect also other
   trophic levels. This meta-analysis shows that increasing plant genetic
   diversity improves the performance of plants and natural enemies of
   herbivores, while decreasing the performance of plant antagonists.
   Intraspecific genetic diversity is an important component of
   biodiversity. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated positive
   effects of plant genetic diversity on plant performance. However, it has
   remained unclear whether plant genetic diversity generally increases
   plant performance by reducing the pressure of plant antagonists across
   trophic levels for different plant life forms, ecosystems and climatic
   zones. Here, we analyse 4702 effect sizes reported in 413 studies that
   consider effects of plant genetic diversity on trophic groups and their
   interactions. We found that that increasing plant genetic diversity
   decreased the performance of plant antagonists including invertebrate
   herbivores, weeds, plant-feeding nematodes and plant diseases, while
   increasing the performance of plants and natural enemies of herbivores.
   Structural equation modelling indicated that plant genetic diversity
   increased plant performance partly by reducing plant antagonist
   pressure. These results reveal that plant genetic diversity often
   influences multiple trophic levels in ways that enhance natural pest
   control in managed ecosystems and consumer control of plants in natural
   ecosystems for sustainable plant production.},

Title = {A diverse Ediacara assemblage survived under low-oxygen conditions},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {The Ediacaran biota were soft-bodied organisms, many with enigmatic
   phylogenetic placement and ecology, living in marine environments
   between 574 and 539 million years ago. Some studies hypothesize a
   metazoan affinity and aerobic metabolism for these taxa, whereas others
   propose a fundamentally separate taxonomic grouping and a reliance on
   chemoautotrophy. To distinguish between these hypotheses and test the
   redox-sensitivity of Ediacaran organisms, here we present a
   high-resolution local and global redox dataset from carbonates that
   contain in situ Ediacaran fossils from Siberia. Cerium anomalies are
   consistently >1, indicating that local environments, where a diverse
   Ediacaran assemblage is preserved in situ as nodules and carbonaceous
   compressions, were pervasively anoxic. Additionally, delta U-238 values
   match other terminal Ediacaran sections, indicating widespread marine
   euxinia. These data suggest that some Ediacaran biotas were tolerant of
   at least intermittent anoxia, and thus had the capacity for a
   facultatively anaerobic lifestyle. Alternatively, these soft-bodied
   Ediacara organisms may have colonized the seafloor during brief
   oxygenation events not recorded by redox proxy data. Broad temporal
   correlations between carbon, sulfur, and uranium isotopes further
   highlight the dynamic redox landscape of Ediacaran-Cambrian evolutionary
   events.
   Geochemical data from sedimentary rocks in Siberia indicate that members
   of the soft-bodied Ediacara biota (the earliest macroscopic life on
   Earth) were tolerant of low-oxygen conditions, suggesting they had the
   capacity for anaerobic metabolisms.},

Title = {Fossil bone histology reveals ancient origins for rapid juvenile growth
   in tetrapods},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Patterns of growth throughout the lifetime of an animal reflect critical
   life history traits such as reproductive timing, physiology, and
   ecological interactions. The ancestral growth pattern for tetrapods has
   traditionally been described as slow-to-moderately paced, akin to modern
   amphibians, with fast growth and high metabolic rates considered a
   specialized physiological trait of amniotes. Here, we present bone
   histology from an ontogenetic series of the Early Carboniferous stem
   tetrapod Whatcheeria deltae, and document evidence of fibrolamellar
   bone-primary bone tissue associated with fast growth. Our data indicate
   that Whatcheeria juveniles grew rapidly and reached skeletal maturity
   quickly, allowing them to occupy a large-bodied predator niche in their
   paleoenvironment. This life history strategy contrasts with those
   described for other stem tetrapods and indicates that a diversity of
   growth patterns existed at the origins of tetrapod diversification.
   Importantly, Whatcheeria marks an unexpectedly early occurrence of
   fibrolamellar bone in Tetrapoda, both temporally and phylogenetically.
   These findings reveal that elevated juvenile growth is not limited to
   amniotes, but has a deep history in the tetrapod clade and may have
   played a previously unrecognized role in the tetrapod invasion of land.
   Osteohistology from a growth series of Whatcheeria, an Early
   Carboniferous stem tetrapod, indicates rapid juvenile growth dating back
   to tetrapod origins.},

Title = {Solutions to fire and shade: resprouting, growing tall and the origin of
   Eurasian temperate broadleaved forest},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {643-661},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tree species of Eurasian broadleaved forest possess two divergent trait
   syndromes with contrasting patterns of resource allocation adapted to
   different selection environments: short-stature basal resprouters that
   divert resources to a bud bank adapted to frequent and severe
   disturbances such as fire and herbivory, and tall trees that delay
   reproduction by investing in rapid height growth to escape shading.
   Drawing on theory developed in savanna ecosystems, we propose a
   conceptual framework showing that the possession of contrasting trait
   syndromes is essential for the persistence of broadleaved trees in an
   open ecosystem that burns. Consistent with this hypothesis, trees of
   modern Eurasian broadleaved forest bear a suite of traits that are
   adaptive to surface and crown-fire regimes. We contend that limited
   opportunities in grassland restricts recruitment to disturbance-free
   refugia, and en masse establishment creates a wooded environment where
   shade limits the growth of light-demanding savanna plants. Rapid height
   growth, which involves investment in structural support and the switch
   from a multi-stemmed to a monopodial growth form, is adaptive in this
   shaded environment. Although clustering reduces surface fuel loads,
   these establishment nuclei are vulnerable to high-intensity crown fires.
   The lethal effects of canopy fire are avoided by seasonal leaf shedding,
   and aerial resprouting enhances rapid post-fire recovery of
   photosynthetic capacity. While these woody formations satisfy the
   structural definition of forest, their constituents are clearly derived
   from savanna. Contrasting trait syndromes thus represent the shift from
   consumer to resource regulation in savanna ecosystems. Consistent with
   global trends, the diversification of most contemporary broadleaved taxa
   coincided with the spread of grasslands, a surge in fire activity and a
   decline in wooded ecosystems in the late Miocene-Pliocene. Recognition
   that Eurasian broadleaved forest has savanna origins and persists as an
   alternative state with adjacent grassy ecosystems has far-reaching
   management implications in accordance with functional rather than
   structural criteria. Shade is a severe constraint to the regeneration
   and growth of both woody and herbaceous growth forms in
   consumer-regulated ecosystems. However, these ecosystems are highly
   resilient to disturbance, an essential process that maintains diversity
   especially among the species-rich herbaceous component that is
   vulnerable to shading when consumer behaviour is altered.},

Title = {Evolutionary origins of the prolonged extant squamate radiation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Here, the authors present two well preserved fossil lizard skulls from
   the Late Jurassic of North America. These fossils, placed at the base of
   the clade Pan-Scincoidea, suggest that squamates had a wide geographic
   distribution and preserve characteristics that show the complex early
   evolutionary history of squamate anatomy.
   Squamata is the most diverse clade of terrestrial vertebrates. Although
   the origin of pan-squamates lies in the Triassic, the oldest undisputed
   members of extant clades known from nearly complete, uncrushed material
   come from the Cretaceous. Here, we describe three-dimensionally
   preserved partial skulls of two new crown lizards from the Late Jurassic
   of North America. Both species are placed at the base of the skink,
   girdled, and night lizard clade Pan-Scincoidea, which consistently
   occupies a position deep inside the squamate crown in both morphological
   and molecular phylogenies. The new lizards show that several features
   uniting pan-scincoids with another major lizard clade, the
   pan-lacertoids, in trees using morphology were convergently acquired as
   predicted by molecular analyses. Further, the palate of one new lizard
   bears a handful of ancestral saurian characteristics lost in nearly all
   extant squamates, revealing an underappreciated degree of complex
   morphological evolution in the early squamate crown. We find strong
   evidence for close relationships between the two new species and
   Cretaceous taxa from Eurasia. Together, these results suggest that early
   crown squamates had a wide geographic distribution and experienced
   complicated morphological evolution even while the Rhynchocephalia, now
   solely represented by the tuatara, was the dominant clade of
   lepidosaurs.},

   Laudakia vulgaris},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {During sleep our brain switches between two starkly different brain
   states - slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. While
   this two-state sleep pattern is abundant across birds and mammals, its
   existence in other vertebrates is not universally accepted, its
   evolutionary emergence is unclear and it is undetermined whether it is a
   fundamental property of vertebrate brains or an adaptation specific to
   homeotherms. To address these questions, we conducted
   electrophysiological recordings in the Agamid lizard, Laudakia vulgaris
   during sleep. We found clear signatures of two-state sleep that resemble
   the mammalian and avian sleep patterns. These states switched
   periodically throughout the night with a cycle of similar to 90 seconds
   and were remarkably similar to the states previously reported in Pogona
   vitticeps. Interestingly, in contrast to the high temperature
   sensitivity of mammalian states, state switches were robust to large
   variations in temperature. We also found that breathing rate,
   micro-movements and eye movements were locked to the REM state as they
   are in mammals. Collectively, these findings suggest that two-state
   sleep is abundant across the agamid family, shares physiological
   similarity to mammalian sleep, and can be maintain in poikilothems,
   increasing the probability that it existed in the cold-blooded ancestor
   of amniotes.},

Title = {Current trends suggest most Asian countries are unlikely to meet future
   biodiversity targets on protected areas},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Aichi Target 11 committed governments to protect >= 17\% of their
   terrestrial environments by 2020, yet it was rarely achieved, raising
   questions about the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework goal to
   protect 30\% by 2030. Asia is a challenging continent for such targets,
   combining high biodiversity with dense human populations. Here, we
   evaluated achievements in Asia against Aichi Target 11. We found that
   Asia was the most underperforming continent globally, with just 13.2\%
   of terrestrial protected area (PA) coverage, averaging 14.1 +/- SE 1.8\%
   per country in 2020. 73.1\% of terrestrial ecoregions had <17\%
   representation and only 7\% of PAs even had an assessment of management
   effectiveness. We found that a higher agricultural land in 2015 was
   associated with lower PA coverage today. Asian countries also showed a
   remarkably slow average annual pace of 0.4 +/- SE 0.1\% increase of PA
   extent. These combined lines of evidence suggest that the ambitious 2030
   targets are unlikely to be achieved in Asia unless the PA coverage to
   increase 2.4-5.9 times faster. We provided three recommendations to
   support Asian countries to meet their post-2020 biodiversity targets:
   complete reporting and the wider adoption ``other effective area-based
   conservation measures{''}; restoring disturbed landscapes; and
   bolstering transboundary PAs.
   Asia is shown to be behind in meeting the Aichi Target 11 under the
   Convention on Biological Diversity and current trends indicate that 2030
   targets are unlikely to be achieved with severe impact on biodiversity.},

Title = {The evolution of plant proton pump regulation via the R domain may have
   facilitated plant terrestrialization},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPases are the electrogenic proton pumps that
   export H+ from plant and fungal cells to acidify the surroundings and
   generate a membrane potential. Plant PM H+-ATPases are equipped with a
   C-terminal autoinhibitory regulatory (R) domain of about 100 amino acid
   residues, which could not be identified in the PM H+-ATPases of green
   algae but appeared fully developed in immediate streptophyte algal
   predecessors of land plants. To explore the physiological significance
   of this domain, we created in vivo C-terminal truncations of
   autoinhibited PM H+-ATPase2 (AHA2), one of the two major isoforms in the
   land plant Arabidopsis thaliana. As more residues were deleted, the
   mutant plants became progressively more efficient in proton extrusion,
   concomitant with increased expansion growth and nutrient uptake.
   However, as the hyperactivated AHA2 also contributed to stomatal pore
   opening, which provides an exit pathway for water and an entrance
   pathway for pests, the mutant plants were more susceptible to biotic and
   abiotic stresses, pathogen invasion and water loss, respectively. Taken
   together, our results demonstrate that pump regulation through the R
   domain is crucial for land plant fitness and by controlling growth and
   nutrient uptake might have been necessary already for the successful
   water-to-land transition of plants.
   Phylogenetic analyses and physiological experiments indicate that the
   regulatory domain of plant proton pumps could have been key in the plant
   transition to land from water.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Streamlining a body is a major adaptation for aquatic animals to move
   efficiently in the water. Whereas diving birds are well known to have
   streamlined bodies, such body shapes have not been documented in
   non-avian dinosaurs. It is primarily because most known non-avian
   theropods are terrestrial, barring a few exceptions. However, clear
   evidence of streamlined bodies is absent even in the purported
   semiaquatic groups. Here we report a new theropod, Natovenator
   polydontus gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. The
   new specimen includes a well-preserved skeleton with several articulated
   dorsal ribs that are posterolaterally oriented to streamline the body as
   in diving birds. Additionally, the widely arched proximal rib shafts
   reflect a dorsoventrally compressed ribcage like aquatic reptiles. Its
   body shape suggests that Natovenator was a potentially capable swimming
   predator, and the streamlined body evolved independently in separate
   lineages of theropod dinosaurs.},

Abstract = {As forest demographics are altered by the global decline of old trees
   and reforestation efforts, younger trees are expected to have an
   increasingly important influence on carbon sequestration and forest
   ecosystem functioning. However, the relative resilience of these younger
   trees to climate change stressors is poorly understood. Here we examine
   age-dependent drought sensitivity of over 20,000 individual trees across
   five continents and show that younger trees in the upper canopy layer
   have larger growth reductions during drought. Angiosperms show greater
   age differences than gymnosperms, and age-dependent sensitivity is more
   pronounced in humid climates compared with more arid regions. However,
   younger canopy-dominant trees also recover more quickly from drought.
   The future combination of increased drought events and an increased
   proportion of younger canopy-dominant trees suggests a larger adverse
   impact on carbon stocks in the short term, while the higher resilience
   of younger canopy-dominant trees could positively affect carbon stocks
   over time.},

Abstract = {There is considerable uncertainty regarding which ecosystems are most
   vulnerable to warming. Current understanding of organismal sensitivity
   is largely centred on species-level assessments that do not consider
   variation across populations. Here we used meta-analysis to quantify
   upper thermal tolerance variation across 305 populations from 61
   terrestrial, freshwater, marine and intertidal taxa. We found strong
   differentiation in heat tolerance across populations in marine and
   intertidal taxa but not terrestrial or freshwater taxa. This is counter
   to the expectation that increased connectivity in the ocean should
   reduce intraspecific variation. Such adaptive differentiation in the
   ocean suggests there may be standing genetic variation at the species
   level to buffer climate impacts. Assessments of vulnerability to warming
   should account for variation in thermal tolerance among populations (or
   the lack thereof) to improve predictions about climate vulnerability.},

Title = {Ecological integrity of tropical secondary forests: concepts and
   indicators},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Naturally regenerating forests or secondary forests (SFs) are a
   promising strategy for restoring large expanses of tropical forests at
   low cost and with high environmental benefits. This expectation is
   supported by the high resilience of tropical forests after natural
   disturbances, yet this resilience can be severely reduced by human
   impacts. Assessing the characteristics of SFs and their ecological
   integrity (EI) is essential to evaluating their role for conservation,
   restoration, and provisioning of ecosystem services. In this study, we
   aim to propose a concept and indicators that allow the assessment and
   classification of the EI of SFs. To this end, we review the literature
   to assess how EI has been addressed in different ecosystems and which
   indicators of EI are most commonly used for tropical forests. Building
   upon this knowledge we propose a modification of the concept of EI to
   embrace SFs and suggest indicators of EI that can be applied to
   different successional stages or stand ages. Additionally, we relate
   these indicators to ecosystem service provision in order to support the
   practical application of the theory. EI is generally defined as the
   ability of ecosystems to support and maintain composition, structure and
   function similar to the reference conditions of an undisturbed
   ecosystem. This definition does not consider the temporal dynamics of
   recovering ecosystems, such as SFs. Therefore, we suggest incorporation
   of an optimal successional trajectory as a reference in addition to the
   old-growth forest reference. The optimal successional trajectory
   represents the maximum EI that can be attained at each successional
   stage in a given region and enables the evaluation of EI at any given
   age class. We further suggest a list of indicators, the main ones being:
   compositional indicators (species diversity/richness and indicator
   species); structural indicators (basal area, heterogeneity of basal area
   and canopy cover); function indicators (tree growth and mortality); and
   landscape proxies (landscape heterogeneity, landscape connectivity).
   Finally, we discuss how this approach can assist in defining the value
   of SF patches to provide ecosystem services, restore forests and
   contribute to ecosystem conservation.},

Title = {The kin selection theory of genomic imprinting and modes of reproduction

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {677-695},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Genomic imprinting is known from flowering plants and mammals but has
   not been confirmed for the Hymenoptera even though the eusocial
   Hymenoptera are prime candidates for this peculiar form of gene
   expression. Here, the kin selection theory of genomic imprinting is
   reviewed and applied to the eusocial Hymenoptera. The evidence for
   imprinting in eusocial Hymenoptera with the typical mode of
   reproduction, involving the sexual production of diploid female
   offspring, which develop into workers or gynes, and the arrhenotokous
   parthenogenesis of haploid males, is also reviewed briefly. However, the
   focus of this review is how atypical modes of reproduction, involving
   thelytokous parthenogenesis, hybridisation and androgenesis, may also
   select for imprinting. In particular, naturally occurring hybridisation
   in several genera of ants may provide useful tests of the role of kin
   selection in the evolution of imprinting. Hybridisation is expected to
   disrupt the coadaptation of antagonistically imprinted loci, and thus
   affect the phenotypes of hybrids. Some of the limited data available on
   hybrid worker reproduction and on colony sex ratios support predictions
   about patterns of imprinting derived from kin selection theory.},

Title = {Active DNA demethylation of developmental cis-regulatory regions
   predates vertebrate origins},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {48},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {DNA methylation {[}5-methylcytosine (5mC)] is a repressive
   gene-regulatory mark required for vertebrate embryo -genesis. Genomic
   5mC is tightly regulated through the action of DNA methyltransferases,
   which deposit 5mC, and ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which
   participate in its active removal through the formation of
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). TET enzymes are essential for mammalian
   gastrulation and activation of verte-brate developmental enhancers;
   however, to date, a clear picture of 5hmC function, abundance, and
   genomic distribution in nonvertebrate lineages is lacking. By using
   base-resolution 5mC and 5hmC quantification during sea urchin and
   lancelet embryogenesis, we shed light on the roles of nonvertebrate 5hmC
   and TET enzymes. We find that these invertebrate deuterostomes use TET
   enzymes for targeted demethylation of regulatory regions associated with
   developmental genes and show that the complement of identified
   5hmC-regulated genes is conserved to vertebrates. This work demonstrates
   that active 5mC removal from regulatory regions is a common feature of
   deuterostome embryogenesis suggestive of an unexpected deep conservation
   of a major gene-regulatory module.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's biota is hyperdiverse and includes exceptional levels of
   endemicity. We review the current state of knowledge on Madagascar's
   past and current terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity by compiling
   and presenting comprehensive data on species diversity, endemism, and
   rates of species description and human uses, in addition to presenting
   an updated and simplified map of vegetation types. We report a
   substantial increase of records and species new to science in recent
   years; however, the diversity and evolution of many groups remain
   practically unknown (e.g., fungi and most invertebrates). Digitization
   efforts are increasing the resolution of species richness patterns and
   we highlight the crucial role of field- and collections-based research
   for advancing biodiversity knowledge and identifying gaps in our
   understanding, particularly as species richness corresponds closely to
   collection effort. Phylogenetic diversity patterns mirror that of
   species richness and endemism in most of the analyzed groups. We
   highlight humid forests as centers of diversity and endemism because of
   their role as refugia and centers of recent and rapid radiations.
   However, the distinct endemism of other areas, such as the
   grassland-woodland mosaic of the Central Highlands and the spiny forest
   of the southwest, is also biologically important despite lower species
   richness. The documented uses of Malagasy biodiversity are manifold,
   with much potential for the uncovering of new useful traits for food,
   medicine, and climate mitigation. The data presented here showcase
   Madagascar as a unique `` living laboratory{''} for our understanding of
   evolution and the complex interactions between people and nature. The
   gathering and analysis of biodiversity data must continue and accelerate
   if we are to fully understand and safeguard this unique subset of
   Earth's biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's unique biota is heavily affected by human activity and is
   under intense threat. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on
   the conservation status of Madagascar's terrestrial and freshwater
   biodiversity by presenting data and analyses on documented and predicted
   species-level conservation statuses, the most prevalent and relevant
   threats, ex situ collections and programs, and the coverage and
   comprehensiveness of protected areas. The existing terrestrial protected
   area network in Madagascar covers 10.4\% of its land area and includes
   at least part of the range of the majority of described native species
   of vertebrates with known distributions (97.1\% of freshwater fishes,
   amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals combined) and plants (67.7\%).
   The overall figures are higher for threatened species (97.7\% of
   threatened vertebrates and 79.6\% of threatened plants occurring within
   at least one protected area). International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments and Bayesian neural network analyses
   for plants identify overexploitation of biological resources and
   unsustainable agriculture as themost prominent threats to biodiversity.
   We highlight five opportunities for action at multiple levels to ensure
   that conservation and ecological restoration objectives, programs, and
   activities take account of complex underlying and interacting factors
   and produce tangible benefits for the biodiversity and people of
   Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Legume-rhizobium symbiosis in root nodules fixes nitrogen to satisfy the
   plant's nitrogen demands. The nodules' demand for energy is thought to
   determine nitrogen fixation rates. How this energy state is sensed to
   modulate nitrogen fixation is unknown. Here, we identified two soybean
   (Glycine max) cystathionine b-synthase domain-containing proteins,
   nodule AMP sensor 1 (GmNAS1) and NAS1-associated protein 1 (GmNAP1). In
   the high-nodule energy state, GmNAS1 and GmNAP1 form homodimers that
   interact with the nuclear factor-Y C (NF-YC) subunit (GmNFYC10a) on
   mitochondria and reduce its nuclear accumulation. Less nuclear GmNFYC10a
   leads to lower expression of glycolytic genes involved in pyruvate
   production, which modulates phosphoenolpyruvate allocation to favor
   nitrogen fixation. Insight into these pathways may help in the design of
   leguminous crops that have improved carbon use, nitrogen fixation, and
   growth.},

Abstract = {Animals navigate using various sensory information to guide their
   movement. Miniature tracking devices now allow documenting animals'
   routes with high accuracy. Despite this detailed description of animal
   movement, how animals translate sensory information to movement is
   poorly understood. Recent machine learning advances now allow addressing
   this question with unprecedented statistical learning tools. We
   harnessed this power to address visual-based navigation in fruit bats.
   We used machine learning and trained a convolutional neural network to
   navigate along a bat's route using visual information that would have
   been available to the real bat, which we collected using a drone. We
   show that a simple feed-forward network can learn to guide the agent
   towards a goal based on sensory input, and can generalize its learning
   both in time and in space. Our analysis suggests how animals could
   potentially use visual input for navigation and which features might be
   useful for this purpose.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is causing a rapid redistribution of life
   on Earth, particularly in the ocean, with profound implications for
   humans. Yet warming-driven range shifts are known to be influenced by a
   variety of factors whose combined effects are still little understood.
   Here, we use scientist-verified out-of-range observations from a
   national citizen-science initiative to assess the combined effect of
   long-term warming, climate extremes (i.e., heatwaves and cold spells),
   ocean currents, and species traits on early stages of marine range
   extensions in two warming `hotspot' regions of southern Australia. We
   find effects of warming to be contingent upon complex interactions with
   the strength of ocean currents and their mutual directional agreement,
   as well as species traits. Our study represents the most comprehensive
   account to date of factors driving early stages of marine species
   redistributions, providing important evidence for the assessment of the
   vulnerability of marine species distributions to climate change.},

Title = {Species-specific song responses emerge as a by-product of tuning to the

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Oscine birds preferentially respond to certain sounds over others from
   an early age, which focuses subse-quent learning onto sexually relevant
   songs.1-3 Songs vary both across species and, due to cultural evolution,
   among populations of the same species. As a result, early song responses
   are expected to be shaped by se-lection both to avoid the fitness costs
   of cross-species learning4 and to promote learning of population
   -typical songs.5 These sources of selection are not mutually exclusive
   but can result in distinct geographic patterns of song responses in
   juvenile birds: if the risks of interspecific mating are the main driver
   of early song discrimination, then discrimination should be strongest
   where closely related species co-occur.4 In contrast, if early
   discrimination primarily facilitates learning local songs, then it
   should be tuned to songs typical of the local dialect.5-7 Here, we
   experimentally assess the drivers of song discrimination in nestling
   pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). We first demonstrate that early
   discrimination against the songs of the closely related collared
   flycatcher (F. albicollis) is not strongly affected by co-occurrence.
   Second, across six European populations, we show that nestlings' early
   song responses are tuned to their local song dialect and that responses
   to the songs of collared flycatchers are similarly weak as to those of
   other conspecific dialects. Taken together, these findings provide clear
   experimental support for the hypothesis that cultural evolution, in
   conjunction with associated learning predispositions, drives the
   emergence of pre-mating reproductive barriers.},

Abstract = {Endophytic oviposition behavior, the insertion of eggs into plant
   tissues, represents a sophisticated repro-ductive strategy of insects.1
   This process is accomplished by employing a specialized egg-laying
   device, the ovipositor, that effectively protects eggs through plant
   tissue concealment.2,3 Endophytic oviposition behavior is currently
   common in many lineages of several major, extant insect orders,
   principally Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), Orthoptera (katydids
   and grasshoppers), Hemiptera (cicadas, aphids, scale in-sects,
   whiteflies, leafhoppers, and bugs), Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera
   (moths), and Hymenoptera (saw-flies).3,4 Based on the occurrences of egg
   insertion damage and associated scar tissue expressed in fossil plant
   stems and leaves, endophytic ovipositional behavior is presumed to have
   emerged as early as the Early Pennsylvanian Period.5 However, for
   impression fossils, egg morphology and surrounding scar tissue can be
   difficult to discern on plants, often resulting in ovipositional damage
   that may be assigned to exophytic (eggs laid on plant surfaces) or to
   endophytic behavior.6-9 This ambiguity is due to the spatial
   relationships and his-tological mingling of ovipositional damage and
   enveloping scars with adjoining plant-host tissues. Here, we describe
   body fossils of insect eggs within ginkgophyte leaves from the Upper
   Triassic of China. Feeding damage from an egg-predatory insect commonly
   occurs on these eggs, as some eggs bear up to several feeding punctures.
   We provide exceptional body-fossil evidence for resource use of a host
   plant by an ovipositing insect and unravel the earliest-known tritrophic
   cascade of a host plant, an ovipositing insect, and an egg-predatory
   insect.},

Abstract = {Insects comprise more than a million species and many authors have
   attempted to explain this success by evolutionary innovations. A much
   overlooked evolutionary novelty of insects is the serosa, an
   extraembryonic epithelium around the yolk and embryo. We have shown
   previously that this epithelium provides innate immune protection to
   eggs of the beetle Tribolium castaneum. It remained elusive, however,
   whether this immune competence evolved in the Tribolium lineage or is
   ancestral to all insects. Here, we expand our studies to two
   hemimetabolous insects, the bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and the swarming
   grasshopper Locusta migratoria. For Oncopeltus, RNA sequencing reveals
   an extensive response upon infection, including the massive upregulation
   of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We demonstrate antimicrobial activity
   of these peptides using in vitro bacterial growth assays and describe
   two novel AMP families called Serosins and Ovicins. For both insects,
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction shows immune competence of the
   eggs when the serosa is present, and in situ hybridizations demonstrate
   that immune gene expression is localized in the serosa. This first
   evidence from hemimetabolous insect eggs suggests that immune competence
   is an ancestral property of the serosa. The evolutionary origin of the
   serosa with its immune function might have facilitated the spectacular
   radiation of the insects.This article is part of the theme issue
   `Extraembryonic tissues: exploring concepts, definitions and functions
   across the animal kingdom'.},

Title = {Mesothelial fusion mediates chorioallantoic membrane formation},

Abstract = {In amniotic vertebrates (birds, reptiles and mammals), an extraembryonic
   structure called the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) functions as
   respiratory organ for embryonic development. The CAM is derived from
   fusion between two pre-existing membranes, the allantois, a hindgut
   diverticulum and a reservoir for metabolic waste, and the chorion which
   marks the embryo's external boundary. Modified CAM in eutherian mammals,
   including humans, gives rise to chorioallantoic placenta. Despite its
   importance, little is known about cellular and molecular mechanisms
   mediating CAM formation and maturation. In this work, using the avian
   model, we focused on the early phase of CAM morphogenesis when the
   allantois and chorion meet and initiate fusion. We report here that
   chicken chorioallantoic fusion takes place when the allantois reaches
   the size of 2.5-3.0 mm in diameter and in about 6 hours between E3.75
   and E4. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analyses suggested
   that before fusion, in both the allantois and chorion, an
   epithelial-shaped mesothelial layer is present, which dissolves after
   fusion, presumably by undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The
   fusion process per se, however, is independent of allantoic growth,
   circulation, or its connection to the developing mesonephros. Mesoderm
   cells derived from the allantois and chorion can intermingle
   post-fusion, and chorionic ectoderm cells exhibit a specialized
   sub-apical intercellular interface, possibly to facilitate infiltration
   of allantois-derived vascular progenitors into the chorionic ectoderm
   territory for optimal oxygen transport. Finally, we investigated
   chorioallantoic fusion-like process in primates, with limited numbers of
   archived human and fresh macaque samples. We summarize the similarities
   and differences of CAM formation among different amniote groups and
   propose that mesothelial epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediates
   chorioallantoic fusion in most amniotic vertebrates. Further study is
   needed to clarify tissue morphogenesis leading to chorioallantoic fusion
   in primates. Elucidating molecular mechanisms regulating mesothelial
   integrity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition will also help
   understand mesothelial diseases in the adult, including mesothelioma,
   ovarian cancer and fibrosis.This article is part of the theme issue

Title = {Comparing the potential for maternal-fetal signalling in oviparous and
   viviparous lizards},

Abstract = {The evolution of a placenta requires several steps including changing
   the timing of reproductive events, facilitating nutrient exchange, and
   the capacity for maternal-fetal communication. To understand the
   evolution of maternal-fetal communication, we used ligand-receptor gene
   expression as a proxy for the potential for cross-talk in a live-bearing
   lizard (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii) and homologous tissues in a related
   egg-laying lizard (Lampropholis guichenoti). Approximately 70\% of
   expressed ligand/receptor genes were shared by both species. Gene
   ontology (GO) analysis showed that there was no GO-enrichment in the
   fetal membranes of the egg-laying species, but live-bearing fetal
   tissues were significantly enriched for 50 GO-terms. Differences in
   enrichment suggest that the evolution of viviparity involved reinforcing
   specific signalling pathways, perhaps to support fetal control of
   placentation. One identified change was in transforming growth factor
   beta signalling. Using immunohistochemistry, we show the production of
   the signalling molecule inhibin beta B (INHBB) occurs in viviparous
   fetal membranes but was absent in closely related egg-laying tissues,
   suggesting that the evolution of viviparity may have involved changes to
   signalling via this pathway. We argue that maternal-fetal signalling
   evolved through co-opting expressed signalling molecules and recruiting
   new signalling molecules to support the complex developmental changes
   required to support a fetus in utero.This article is part of the theme

Title = {Gamete dimorphism of the isogamous green alga (Chlamydomonas

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The gametes of chlorophytes differ morphologically even in isogamy and
   are divided into two types (alpha and beta) based on the mating type- or
   sex-specific asymmetric positioning of the mating structure (cell fusion
   apparatus) with respect to the flagellar beat plane and eyespot,
   irrespective of the difference in gamete size. However, the relationship
   between this morphological trait and the mating type or sex
   determination system is unclear. Using mating type-reversed strains of
   the isogamous alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, produced by deletion or
   introduction of the mating type-determining gene MID, we revealed that
   the positioning of the mating structure is associated with conversion of
   mating types (mt(-) and mt(+)), implying that this trait is regulated by
   MID. Moreover, the dominant mating type is associated with the type beta
   phenotype, as in the chlorophyte species Ulva prolifera. Our findings
   may provide a genetic basis for mating type- or sex-specific asymmetric
   positioning of the chlorophyte mating structure.},

Title = {Microbial predators form a new supergroup of eukaryotes},

Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Molecular phylogenetics of microbial eukaryotes has reshaped the tree of
   life by establishing broad taxonomic divisions, termed supergroups, that
   supersede the traditional kingdoms of animals, fungi and plants, and
   encompass a much greater breadth of eukaryotic diversity(1). The vast
   majority of newly discovered species fall into a small number of known
   supergroups. Recently, however, a handful of species with no clear
   relationship to other supergroups have been described(2-4), raising
   questions about the nature and degree of undiscovered diversity, and
   exposing the limitations of strictly molecular-based exploration. Here
   we report ten previously undescribed strains of microbial predators
   isolated through culture that collectively form a diverse new supergroup
   of eukaryotes, termed Provora. The Provora supergroup is genetically,
   morphologically and behaviourally distinct from other eukaryotes, and
   comprises two divergent clades of predators-Nebulidia and
   Nibbleridia-that are superficially similar to each other, but differ
   fundamentally in ultrastructure, behaviour and gene content. These
   predators are globally distributed in marine and freshwater
   environments, but are numerically rare and have consequently been
   overlooked by molecular-diversity surveys. In the age of high-throughput
   analyses, investigation of eukaryotic diversity through culture remains
   indispensable for the discovery of rare but ecologically and
   evolutionarily important eukaryotes.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Industrial wastewater discharge, agricultural production, marine
   shipping, oil extraction, and other activities have caused serious
   marine pollution, including microplastics, petroleum and its products,
   heavy metals, pesticides, and other organics. Efficiency of
   bioremediation of marine pollutions may be limited by high salt
   concentrations (> 1\%, w/v), which can cause an apparent loss of
   microbial activities. In this study, functional promoters P1, P2-1, and
   P2-2 censoring salt stress were isolated and identified from a Vibrio
   natriegens strain Vmax. Three salt-induced degradation models were
   constructed to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), chlorpyrifos
   (CP), and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) using the marine strain Vmax.
   The engineered strains are efficient for degradation of the
   corresponding substrates, with the degradation rates at 15 mg/L PET in 8
   d, 50 mg/L CP in 24 h, and 1 mg/L HBCDs in 4 h, respectively. In
   addition, an immobilization strategy for recycling and reusing of
   engineered strains was realized by expressing the chitin-binding protein
   GbpA. This study may help answer the usage of rapidly growing marine
   bacteria such as V. natriegens Vmax to degrade marine pollution
   efficiently.},

Abstract = {North America has experienced a massive increase in cropland use since
   1800, accompanied more recently by the intensification of agricultural
   practices. Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples
   spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect
   of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across
   the native range of the common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), a
   now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed
   strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts
   in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in
   the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was
   facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping
   genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the
   success of this weed in the 21st century.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Even optimistic climate scenarios predict catastrophic consequences for
   coral reef ecosystems by 2100. Understanding how reef connectivity,
   biodiversity and resilience are shaped by climate variability would
   improve chances to establish sustainable management practices. In this
   regard, ecoregionalization and connectivity are pivotal to designating
   effective marine protected areas. Here, machine learning algorithms and
   physical intuition are applied to sea surface temperature anomaly data
   over a twenty-four-year period to extract ecoregions and assess
   connectivity and bleaching recovery potential in the Coral Triangle and
   surrounding oceans. Furthermore, the impacts of the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) on biodiversity and resilience are quantified. We
   find that resilience is higher for reefs north of the Equator and that
   the extraordinary biodiversity of the Coral Triangle is dynamic in time
   and space, and benefits from ENSO. The large-scale exchange of genetic
   material is enhanced between the Indian Ocean and the Coral Triangle
   during La Nina years, and between the Coral Triangle and the central
   Pacific in neutral conditions. Through machine learning the outstanding
   biodiversity of the Coral Triangle, its evolution and the increase of
   species richness are contextualized through geological times, while
   offering new hope for monitoring its future.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that biodiversity drives ecosystem
   functioning, yet how biodiversity loss alters ecosystems functioning and
   stability in the long-term lacks experimental evidence. We report
   temporal effects of species richness on community productivity,
   stability, species asynchrony, and complementarity, and how the
   relationships among them change over 17 years in a grassland
   biodiversity experiment. Productivity declined more rapidly in less
   diverse communities resulting in temporally strengthening positive
   effects of richness on productivity, complementarity, and stability. In
   later years asynchrony played amore important role in increasing
   community stability as the negative effect of richness on population
   stability diminished. Only during later years did species
   complementarity relate to species asynchrony. These results show that
   species complementarity and asynchrony can take more than a decade to
   develop strong stabilizing effects on ecosystem functioning in diverse
   plant communities. Thus, the mechanisms stabilizing ecosystem
   functioning change with community age.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures cause coral bleaching and reef degradation.
   However, coral may have strategies to survive by reproducing more

   thermal stress on fecundity and fitness in the reef-building coral
   Acropora tenuis. Fragments from the same colony are subjected to control
   temperature (-27.5 degrees C) or heat stress (-31 degrees C) for ten
   days. We then examine the fecundity of adults (egg number and size) and
   the thermal tolerance of larvae and recruits (survival rates, growth,
   and size). The stressed fragments show a trade-off in egg production, an
   increase in egg number but a decrease in size. In addition, larvae and
   recruits from the stressed colony show marginally higher survival rates
   in the higher water temperature but do not differ in the control
   condition. Therefore, corals produce more heat-resistant larvae and
   recruits after they experience heat stress, which may improve coral reef
   resilience.},

Title = {Logged tropical forests have amplified and diverse ecosystem energetics},
Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {612},

Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are widely recognized as being immensely
   important for their biodiversity and high biomass(1). Conversely, logged
   tropical forests are usually characterized as degraded ecosystems(2).
   However, whether logging results in a degradation in ecosystem functions
   is less clear: shifts in the strength and resilience of key ecosystem
   processes in large suites of species have rarely been assessed in an
   ecologically integrated and quantitative framework. Here we adopt an
   ecosystem energetics lens to gain new insight into the impacts of
   tropical forest disturbance on a key integrative aspect of ecological
   function: food pathways and community structure of birds and mammals. We
   focus on a gradient spanning old-growth and logged forests and oil palm
   plantations in Borneo. In logged forest there is a 2.5-fold increase in
   total resource consumption by both birds and mammals compared to that in
   old-growth forests, probably driven by greater resource accessibility
   and vegetation palatability. Most principal energetic pathways maintain
   high species diversity and redundancy, implying maintained resilience.
   Conversion of logged forest into oil palm plantation results in the
   collapse of most energetic pathways. Far from being degraded ecosystems,
   even heavily logged forests can be vibrant and diverse ecosystems with
   enhanced levels of ecological function.},

Title = {The ephemeral resource patch concept},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {3},
Pages = {697-726},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ephemeral resource patches (ERPs) - short lived resources including
   dung, carrion, temporary pools, rotting vegetation, decaying wood, and
   fungi - are found throughout every ecosystem. Their short-lived dynamics
   greatly enhance ecosystem heterogeneity and have shaped the evolutionary
   trajectories of a wide range of organisms - from bacteria to insects and
   amphibians. Despite this, there has been no attempt to distinguish ERPs
   clearly from other resource types, to identify their shared
   spatiotemporal characteristics, or to articulate their broad ecological
   and evolutionary influences on biotic communities. Here, we define ERPs
   as any distinct consumable resources which (i) are homogeneous
   (genetically, chemically, or structurally) relative to the surrounding
   matrix, (ii) host a discrete multitrophic community consisting of
   species that cannot replicate solely in any of the surrounding matrix,
   and (iii) cannot maintain a balance between depletion and renewal, which
   in turn, prevents multiple generations of consumers/users or reaching a
   community equilibrium. We outline the wide range of ERPs that fit these
   criteria, propose 12 spatiotemporal characteristics along which ERPs can
   vary, and synthesise a large body of literature that relates ERP
   dynamics to ecological and evolutionary theory. We draw this knowledge
   together and present a new unifying conceptual framework that
   incorporates how ERPs have shaped the adaptive trajectories of
   organisms, the structure of ecosystems, and how they can be integrated
   into biodiversity management and conservation. Future research should
   focus on how inter- and intra-resource variation occurs in nature - with
   a particular focus on resource x environment x genotype interactions.
   This will likely reveal novel adaptive strategies, aid the development
   of new eco-evolutionary theory, and greatly improve our understanding of
   the form and function of organisms and ecosystems.},

Title = {Dental form and function in the early feeding diversification of
   dinosaurs},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {50},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Dinosaurs evolved a remarkable diversity of dietary adaptations
   throughout the Mesozoic, but the origins of different feeding modes are
   uncertain, especially the multiple origins of herbivory. Feeding habits
   of early di-nosaurs have mostly been inferred from qualitative
   comparisons of dental morphology with extant analogs. Here, we use
   biomechanical and morphometric methods to investigate the dental
   morphofunctional diversity of early dinosaurs in comparison with extant
   squamates and crocodylians and predict their diets using machine
   learning classification models. Early saurischians/theropods are
   consistently classified as carnivores. Sauropo-domorphs underwent a
   dietary shift from faunivory to herbivory, experimenting with diverse
   diets during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, and early ornithischians
   were likely omnivores. Obligate herbivory was a late evolu-tionary
   innovation in both clades. Carnivory is the most plausible ancestral
   diet of dinosaurs, but omnivory is equally likely under certain
   phylogenetic scenarios. This early dietary diversity was fundamental in
   the rise of dinosaurs to ecological dominance.},

Title = {Wild chimpanzee behavior suggests that a savanna- mosaic habitat did not

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Bipedalism, a defining feature of the human lineage, is thought to have
   evolved as forests retreated in the late Miocene-Pliocene. Chimpanzees
   living in analogous habitats to early hominins offer a unique
   opportunity to investigate the ecological drivers of bipedalism that
   cannot be addressed via the fossil record alone. We inves-tigated
   positional behavior and terrestriality in a savanna-mosaic community of
   chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Issa Valley,
   Tanzania as the first test in a living ape of the hypothesis that
   wooded, savanna habitats were a catalyst for terrestrial bipedalism.
   Contrary to widely accepted hypotheses of increased terres-triality
   selecting for habitual bipedalism, results indicate that trees remained
   an essential component of the hominin adaptive niche, with bipedalism
   evolving in an arboreal context, likely driven by foraging strategy.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {50},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Although theory identifies coextinctions as a main driver of
   biodiversity loss, their role at the planetary scale has yet to be
   estimated. We subjected a global model of interconnected terrestrial
   vertebrate food webs to future (2020-2100) climate and land-use changes.
   We predict a 17.6\% (+/- 0.16\% SE) average reduction of local
   verte-brate diversity globally by 2100, with coextinctions increasing
   the effect of primary extinctions by 184.2\% (+/- 10.9\% SE) on average
   under an intermediate emissions scenario. Communities will lose up to a
   half of ecological interactions, thus reducing trophic complexity,
   network connectance, and community resilience. The model reveals that
   the extreme toll of global change for vertebrate diversity might be of
   secondary importance com-pared to the damages to ecological network
   structure.},

Abstract = {Availability of a contiguous chromosome-level genome assembly is the
   foundational step to develop genome-based studies in American mink
   (Neogale vison). The main objective of this study was to provide a high
   quality chromosome-level genome assembly for American mink. An initial
   draft of the genome assembly was generated using 2,884,047 PacBio long
   reads. Integration of Hi-C data into the initial draft led to an
   assembly with 183 scaffolds and scaffold N50 of 220 Mb. This gap-free
   genome assembly of American mink (ASM\_NN\_V1) had a length of 2.68 Gb
   in which about 98.6\% of the whole genome was covered by 15 chromosomes.
   In total, 25,377 genes were predicted across the American mink genome
   using the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. In addition, gene
   orthology, demographic history, synteny blocks, and phylogenetic
   relationships were studied in connection with the genomes of other
   related Carnivora. Furthermore, population-based statistics of 100
   sequenced mink were presented using the newly assembled genome.
   Remarkable improvements were observed in genome contiguity, the number
   of scaffolds, and annotation compared to the first draft of mink genome
   assembly (NNQGG.v01). This high-quality genome assembly will support the
   development of efficient breeding strategies as well as conservation
   programs for American mink.},

Title = {Suppression of flavivirus transmission from animal hosts to mosquitoes
   with a mosquito-delivered vaccine},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Zoonotic viruses circulate in the natural reservoir and sporadically
   spill over into human populations, resulting in endemics or pandemics.
   We previously found that the Chaoyang virus (CYV), an insect-specific
   flavivirus (ISF), is replication-defective in vertebrate cells. Here, we
   develope a proof-of-concept mosquito-delivered vaccine to control the
   Zika virus (ZIKV) within inaccessible wildlife hosts using CYV as the
   vector. The vaccine is constructed by replacing the pre-membrane and
   envelope (prME) proteins of CYV with those of ZIKV, assigned as
   CYV-ZIKV. CYV-ZIKV replicates efficiently in Aedes mosquitoes and
   disseminates to the saliva, with no venereal or transovarial
   transmission observed. To reduce the risk of CYV-ZIKV leaking into the
   environment, mosquitoes are X-ray irradiated to ensure 100\%
   infertility, which does not affect the titer of CYV-ZIKV in the saliva.
   Immunization of mice via CYV-ZIKV-carrying mosquito bites elicites
   robust and persistent ZIKV-specific immune responses and confers
   complete protection against ZIKV challenge. Correspondingly, the
   immunized mice could no longer transmit the challenged ZIKV to naive
   mosquitoes. Therefore, immunization with an ISF-vectored vaccine via
   mosquito bites is feasible to induce herd immunity in wildlife hosts of
   ZIKV. Our study provides a future avenue for developing a
   mosquito-delivered vaccine to eliminate zoonotic viruses in the sylvatic
   cycle.},

Abstract = {Marine tetrapods occupy important roles in modern marine ecosystems and
   often gather in large aggrega-tions driven by patchy prey
   distribution,1,2 social or reproductive behaviors,3,4 or oceanographic
   factors.5 Here, we show that similar grouping behaviors evolved in an
   early marine tetrapod lineage, documented by dozens of specimens of the
   giant ichthyosaur Shonisaurus in the Luning Formation in West Union
   Canyon, Nevada, USA.6,7 A concentration of at least seven skeletons
   closely preserved on a single bedding plane received the bulk of
   previous attention. However, many more specimens are preserved
   across-106 square meters and-200 stratigraphic meters of outcrop
   representing an estimated >105-6 years. Unlike other
   marine-tetrapod-rich deposits, this assemblage is essentially monotaxic;
   other vertebrate fossils are excep-tionally scarce. Large individuals
   are disproportionately abundant, with the exception of multiple neonatal
   or embryonic specimens, indicating an unusual demographic composition
   apparently lacking intermediate -sized juveniles or subadults. Combined
   with geological evidence, our data suggest that dense aggregations of
   Shonisaurus inhabited this moderately deep, low-diversity, tropical
   marine environment for millennia dur-ing the latest Carnian Stage of the
   Late Triassic Period (237-227 Ma). Thus, philopatric grouping behavior
   in marine tetrapods, potentially linked to reproductive activity, has an
   antiquity of at least 230 million years.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Ocean warming is killing corals, but heat-tolerant populations exist; if
   protected, they could replenish affected reefs naturally or through
   restoration. Palau's Rock Islands experience consistently higher
   temperatures and extreme heatwaves, yet their diverse coral communities
   bleach less than those on Palau's cooler outer reefs. Here, we combined
   genetic analyses, bleaching histories and growth rates of Porites cf.
   lobata colonies to identify thermally tolerant genotypes, map their
   distribution, and investigate potential growth trade-offs. We identified
   four genetic lineages of P. cf. lobata. On Palau's outer reefs, a
   thermally sensitive lineage dominates. The Rock Islands harbor two
   lineages with enhanced thermal tolerance; one of which shows no
   consistent growth trade-off and also occurs on several outer reefs. This
   suggests that the Rock Islands provide naturally tolerant larvae to
   neighboring areas. Finding and protecting such sources of
   thermally-tolerant corals is key to reef survival under 21(st) century
   climate change.},

Title = {A new confuciusornithid bird with a secondary epiphyseal ossification
   reveals phylogenetic changes in confuciusornithid flight mode},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {The confuciusornithids are the earliest known beaked birds, and
   constitute the only species-rich clade of Early Cretaceous pygostylian
   birds that existed prior to the cladogenesis of Ornithothoraces. Here,
   we report a new confuciusornithid species from the Lower Cretaceous of
   western Liaoning, northeastern China. Compared to other
   confuciusornithids, this new species and the recently reported Yangavis
   confucii both show evidence of stronger flight capability, although the
   wings of the two taxa differ from one another in many respects. Our
   aerodynamic analyses under phylogeny indicate that varying modes of
   flight adaptation emerged across the diversity of confuciusornithids,
   and to a lesser degree over the course of their ontogeny, and
   specifically suggest that both a trend towards improved flight
   capability and a change in flight strategy occurred in confuciusornithid
   evolution. The new confuciusornithid differs most saliently from other
   Mesozoic birds in having an extra cushion-like bone in the first digit
   of the wing, a highly unusual feature that may have helped to meet the
   functional demands of flight at a stage when skeletal growth was still
   incomplete. The new find strikingly exemplifies the morphological,
   developmental and functional diversity of the first beaked birds.},

Title = {The molecular evolution of spermatogenesis across mammals},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {613},
Number = {7943},
Pages = {308+},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {The testis produces gametes through spermatogenesis and evolves rapidly
   at both the morphological and molecular level in mammals(1-6), probably
   owing to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively
   successful(7). However, the molecular evolution of individual
   spermatogenic cell types across mammals remains largely uncharacterized.
   Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome
   data for testes from 11 species that cover the three main mammalian
   lineages (eutherians, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the
   evolutionary outgroup), and include seven primates. We find that the
   rapid evolution of the testis was driven by accelerated fixation rates
   of gene expression changes, amino acid substitutions and new genes in
   late spermatogenic stages, probably facilitated by reduced pleiotropic
   constraints, haploid selection and transcriptionally permissive
   chromatin. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes
   across species and conserved expression programs controlling ancestral
   spermatogenic processes. Genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia
   (germ cells fuelling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli (somatic support)
   cells accumulated on X chromosomes during evolution, presumably owing to
   male-beneficial selective forces. Further work identified transcriptomal
   differences between X- and Y-bearing spermatids and uncovered that
   meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation (MSCI) also occurs in monotremes and
   hence is common to mammalian sex-chromosome systems. Thus, the mechanism
   of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, which underlies MSCI, is
   an ancestral mammalian feature. Our study illuminates the molecular
   evolution of spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and
   provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across
   mammals.},

Title = {Significance of NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of auxin
   biosynthetic enzymes in maintaining auxin homeostasis in Arabidopsis
   thaliana},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The auxin IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) plays key roles in regulating plant
   growth and development, which depends on an intricate homeostasis that
   is determined by the balance between its biosynthesis, metabolism and
   transport. YUC flavin monooxygenases catalyze the rate-limiting step of
   auxin biosynthesis via IPyA (indole pyruvic acid) and are critical
   targets in regulating auxin homeostasis. Despite of numerous reports on
   the transcriptional regulation of YUC genes, little is known about those
   at the post-translational protein level. Here, we show that loss of
   function of CKRC3/TCU2, the auxiliary subunit (Naa25) of Arabidopsis
   NatB, and/or of its catalytic subunit (Naa20), NBC, led to
   auxin-deficiency in plants. Experimental evidences show that CKRC3/TCU2
   can interact with NBC to form a NatB complex, catalyzing the N-terminal
   acetylation (NTA) of YUC proteins for their intracellular stability to
   maintain normal auxin homeostasis in plants. Hence, our findings provide
   significantly new insight into the link between protein NTA and auxin
   biosynthesis in plants.},

Title = {Simultaneous invasion decouples zebra mussels and water clarity},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our
   understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their
   outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their
   significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large
   lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in
   invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term
   (2000-2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem
   shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native
   crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and
   productivity (-93\% and -91\%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton
   abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an
   unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake.
   Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native
   herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced
   zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due
   to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton
   abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary
   production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals
   the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on
   food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued
   ecosystem service.},

   pine carbohydrate D-pinitol in a beetle-fungus invasive complex},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {51},

Abstract = {The red turpentine beetle (RTB) is one of the most destructive invasive
   pests in China and solely consumes pine phloem containing high amounts
   of D-pinitol. Previous studies reported that D-pinitol exhibits
   deterrent effects on insects. However, it remains unknown how insects
   overcome D-pinitol during their host plant adaptation. We found that
   D-pinitol had an antagonistic effect on RTB, which mainly relied on
   gallery microbes to degrade D- pinitol to enhance host adaptation with
   mutualistic Leptographium procerum and two symbiotic bacteria, Erwinia
   and Serratia, responsible for this degradation. Genomic, transcriptomic,
   and functional investigations revealed that all three microbes can
   metabolize D-pinitol via different branches of the inositol pathway. Our
   results collectively highlight the contributions of symbiotic microbes
   in RTB's adaptation to living on pine, thereby facilitating outbreaks of
   RTB in China. These findings further enrich our knowledge of symbiotic
   invasions and contribute to the further understanding of plant-insect
   interactions.},

Abstract = {Transparency in animals is a complex form of camouflage involving
   mechanisms that reduce light scattering and absorption throughout the
   organism. In vertebrates, attaining transparency is difficult because
   their circulatory system is full of red blood cells (RBCs) that strongly
   attenuate light. Here, we document how glassfrogs overcome this
   challenge by concealing these cells from view. Using photoacoustic
   imaging to track RBCs in vivo, we show that resting glassfrogs increase
   transparency two-to threefold by removing similar to 89\% of their RBCs
   from circulation and packing them within their liver. Vertebrate
   transparency thus requires both see-through tissues and active
   mechanisms that ``clear{''} respiratory pigments from these tissues.
   Furthermore, glassfrogs' ability to regulate the location, density, and
   packing of RBCs without clotting offers insight in metabolic,
   hemodynamic, and blood-clot research.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {After three decades of coral research on the impacts of climate change,
   there is a wide consensus on the adverse effects of heat-stress, but the
   impacts of ocean acidification (OA) are not well established. Using a
   review of published studies and an experimental analysis, we confirm the
   large species-specific component of the OA response, which predicts
   moderate impacts on coral physiology and pigmentation by 2100
   (scenario-B1 or SSP2-4.5), in contrast with the severe disturbances
   induced by only +2 \& DEG;C of thermal anomaly. Accordingly, global
   warming represents a greater threat for coral calcification than OA. The
   incomplete understanding of the moderate OA response relies on
   insufficient attention to key regulatory processes of these symbioses,
   particularly the metabolic dependence of coral calcification on algal
   photosynthesis and host respiration. Our capacity to predict the future

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Volume = {5},

Month = {DEC 26},
Abstract = {The systematics of the Cricetid genus Neodon have long been fraught with
   uncertainty due to sampling issues and a lack of comprehensive datasets.
   To gain better insights into the phylogeny and evolution of Neodon, we
   systematically sampled Neodon across the Hengduan and Himalayan
   Mountains, which cover most of its range in China. Analyses of skulls,
   teeth, and bacular structures revealed 15 distinct patterns
   corresponding to 15 species of Neodon. In addition to morphological
   analyses, we generated a high-quality reference genome for the mountain
   vole and generated whole-genome sequencing data for 47 samples.
   Phylogenomic analyses supported the recognition of six new species,
   revealing a long-term underestimation of Neodon diversity. We further
   identified positively selected genes potentially related to
   high-elevation adaptation. Together, our results illuminate how climate
   change caused the plateau to become the centre of Neodon origin and
   diversification and how mountain voles have adapted to the hypoxic
   high-altitude plateau environment.},

Title = {The ecological drivers and consequences of wildlife trade},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {3},
Pages = {775-791},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least
   24\% of terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can
   have profound impacts on species extinction risk and selection within
   populations. We draw together the first review of characteristics known
   to drive species use - identifying species with larger body sizes,
   greater abundance, increased rarity or certain morphological traits
   valued by consumers as being particularly prevalent in trade. We then
   review the ecological implications of this trade-driven selection,
   revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection and populations
   for traded species, which includes selection against desirable traits.
   Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and
   trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points,
   which can result in species being harvested to extinction and has the
   potential to alter source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem
   repercussions from trade-induced declines include altered seed dispersal
   networks, trophic cascades, long-term compositional changes in plant
   communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and the introduction of
   harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple scales with
   diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation
   actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including
   regulatory and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based
   interventions, captive breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation
   translocations and trophic rewilding. We highlight three emergent
   research themes at the intersection of trade and community ecology: (1)
   functional impacts of trade; (2) altered provisioning of ecosystem
   services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed diseases. Outside of the
   primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for traded species,
   we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader consequences
   for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying
   sustainability.},

Title = {A standalone incompatible insect technique enables mosquito suppression
   in the urban subtropics},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {The strong suppression of Aedes albopictus on two Guangzhou islands in
   China has been successfully achieved by releasing males with an
   artificial triple-Wolbachia infection. However, it requires the use of
   radiation to sterilize residual females to prevent population
   replacement. To develop a highly effective tool for dengue control, we
   tested a standalone incompatible insect technique (IIT) to control A.
   albopictus in the urban area of Changsha, an inland city where dengue
   recently emerged. Male mosquitoes were produced in a mass rearing
   facility in Guangzhou and transported over 670 km under low temperature
   to the release site. After a once-per-week release with high numbers of
   males (phase I) and a subsequent twice-per-week release with low numbers
   of males (phase II), the average numbers of hatched eggs and female
   adults collected weekly per trap were reduced by 97\% and 85\%,
   respectively. The population suppression caused a 94\% decrease in
   mosquito biting at the release site compared to the control site.
   Remarkably, this strong suppression was achieved using only 28\% of the
   number of males released in a previous trial. Despite the lack of
   irradiation to sterilize residual females, no triple-infected mosquitoes
   were detected in the field post release based on the monitoring of adult
   and larval A. albopictus populations for two years, indicating that
   population replacement was prevented. Our results support the
   feasibility of implementing a standalone IIT for dengue control in urban
   areas.},

Title = {Animals in flow - towards the scientific study of intrinsic reward in
   animals},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {3},
Pages = {792-806},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The concept of flow, a state of complete absorption in an intrinsically
   rewarding activity, has played a pivotal role in advancing notions of
   human well-being beyond minimising suffering towards promoting
   flourishing and thriving. While flow has played a fundamental role in
   human positive psychology, it has not yet been explored in non-human
   animals, leaving an enormous void in our understanding of intrinsic
   motivation in animals. As ethology and related fields keep progressing
   in uncovering complex cognitive and affective capacities of non-human
   animals, we propose the time is ripe to translate the concept of flow to
   animals. We start by embedding flow in the topic of intrinsic motivation
   and describe its impact on positive human psychology and potentially
   positive animal welfare. We then disambiguate flow from related concepts
   discussed in the animal literature. Next, we derive experimental
   approaches in animals from the canonical characteristics of flow in
   humans and provide guidelines for both inducing and assessing flow by
   focusing on two characteristics that do not necessarily depend on
   self-report, namely resistance to distraction and time distortion. Not
   all aspects of the human flow experience are (yet) translatable, but
   those that are may improve quality of life in captive non-human animals.},

Title = {Parabrachial-to-parasubthalamic nucleus pathway mediates fear-induced
   suppression of feeding in male mice},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Feeding behavior is adaptively regulated by external and internal
   environment, such that feeding is suppressed when animals experience
   pain, sickness, or fear. While the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPB)
   plays key roles in nociception and stress, neuronal pathways involved in
   feeding suppression induced by fear are not fully explored. Here, we
   investigate the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), located in the lateral
   hypothalamus and critically involved in feeding behaviors, as a target
   of lPB projection neurons. Optogenetic activation of lPB-PSTN terminals
   in male mice promote avoidance behaviors, aversive learning, and
   suppressed feeding. Inactivation of the PSTN and lPB-PSTN pathway
   reduces fear-induced feeding suppression. Activation of PSTN neurons
   expressing pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a
   neuropeptide enriched in the PSTN, is sufficient for inducing avoidance
   behaviors and feeding suppression. Blockade of PACAP receptors impaires
   aversive learning induced by lPB-PSTN photomanipulation. These findings
   indicate that lPB-PSTN pathway plays a pivotal role in fear-induced
   feeding suppression.},
