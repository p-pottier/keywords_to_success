Abstract = {Rhubarb is the collective name for various perennial plants from the
   genus Rheum L. and the Polygonaceae family. They are one of the most
   ancient, commonly used, and important herbs in traditional Chinese
   medicine. Rhubarb is a major source of anthraquinones, but how they are
   synthesized remains largely unknown. Here, we generate a genome sequence
   assembly of one important medicinal rhubarb R. tanguticum at the
   chromosome level, with 2.76 Gb assembled into 11 chromosomes. The genome
   is shaped by two recent whole-genome duplication events and recent
   bursts of retrotransposons. Metabolic analyses show that the major
   anthraquinones are mainly synthesized in its roots. Transcriptomic
   analysis reveals a co-expression module with a high correlation to
   anthraquinone biosynthesis that includes key chalcone synthase genes.
   One CHS, four CYP450 and two BGL genes involved in secondary metabolism
   show significantly upregulated expression levels in roots compared with
   other tissues and clustered in the co-expression module, which implies
   that they may also act as candidate genes for anthraquinone
   biosynthesis. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic
   bases of anthraquinone biosynthesis that will facilitate improved
   breeding practices and agronomic properties for rhubarb in the future.},

Title = {A new ape from Turkiye and the radiation of late Miocene hominines},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Fossil apes from the eastern Mediterranean are central to the debate on
   African ape and human (hominine) origins. Current research places them
   either as hominines, as hominins (humans and our fossil relatives) or as
   stem hominids, no more closely related to hominines than to pongines
   (orangutans and their fossil relatives). Here we show, based on our
   analysis of a newly identified genus, Anadoluvius, from the 8.7 Ma site
   of Corakyerler in central Anatolia, that Mediterranean fossil apes are
   diverse, and are part of the first known radiation of early members of
   the hominines. The members of this radiation are currently only
   identified in Europe and Anatolia; generally accepted hominins are only
   found in Africa from the late Miocene until the Pleistocene. Hominines
   may have originated in Eurasia during the late Miocene, or they may have
   dispersed into Eurasia from an unknown African ancestor. The diversity
   of hominines in Eurasia suggests an in situ origin but does not exclude
   a dispersal hypothesis.},

Title = {wMel <i>Wolbachia</i> alters female post-mating behaviors and physiology
   in the dengue vector mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i>},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Globally invasive Aedes aegypti disseminate numerous arboviruses that
   impact human health. One promising method to control Ae. aegypti
   populations is transinfection with Wolbachia pipientis, which naturally
   infects similar to 40-52\% of insects but not Ae. aegypti.
   Transinfection of Ae. aegypti with the wMel Wolbachia strain induces
   cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), allows infected individuals to invade
   native populations, and inhibits transmission of medically relevant
   arboviruses by females. Female insects undergo post-mating physiological
   and behavioral changes-referred to as the female post-mating response
   (PMR)-required for optimal fertility. PMRs are typically elicited by
   male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) transferred with sperm during mating
   but can be modified by other factors, including microbiome composition.
   Wolbachia has modest effects on Ae. aegypti fertility, but its influence
   on other PMRs is unknown. Here, we show that Wolbachia influences female
   fecundity, fertility, and re-mating incidence and significantly extends
   the longevity of virgin females. Using proteomic methods to examine the
   seminal proteome of infected males, we found that Wolbachia moderately
   affects SFP composition. However, we identified 125 paternally
   transferred Wolbachia proteins, but the CI factor proteins (Cifs) were
   not among them. Our findings indicate that Wolbachia infection of Ae.
   aegypti alters female PMRs, potentially influencing control programs
   that utilize Wolbachia-infected individuals.},

Title = {Bacterial bioindicators enable biological status classification along
   the continental Danube river},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems and their
   predictable diversity patterns across space and time, biomonitoring
   tools for status assessment relying on these organisms are widely
   lacking. This is partly due to insufficient data and models to identify
   reliable microbial predictors. Here, we show metabarcoding in
   combination with multivariate statistics and machine learning allows to
   identify bacterial bioindicators for existing biological status
   classification systems. Bacterial beta-diversity dynamics follow
   environmental gradients and the observed associations highlight
   potential bioindicators for ecological outcomes. Spatio-temporal links
   spanning the microbial communities along the river allow accurate
   prediction of downstream biological status from upstream information.
   Network analysis on amplicon sequence veariants identify as good
   indicators genera Fluviicola, Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, and
   Rhodoluna, and reveal informational redundancy among taxa, which
   coincides with taxonomic relatedness. The redundancy among bacterial
   bioindicators reveals mutually exclusive taxa, which allow accurate
   biological status modeling using as few as 2-3 amplicon sequence
   variants. As such our models show that using a few bacterial amplicon
   sequence variants from globally distributed genera allows for biological
   status assessment along river systems.
   Bacterial communities sampled over 2,600 km of the River Danube revealed
   the predictability of downstream river conditions from upstream
   microbiota, with variance and prevalence of dominant taxa linked to
   environmental gradients, unveiling potential bioindicators.},

Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Analysis of the coronal gyrus from 7 fossil and 31 extant carnivorans
   suggests that one of the earliest pinnipeds, Potamotherium, may have
   relied on its whiskers when foraging.
   Pinnipeds (seals and related species) use their whiskers to explore
   their environment and locate their prey. Today they live mostly in
   marine habitats and are adapted for a highly specialised amphibious
   lifestyle with their flippers for locomotion and a hydrodynamically
   streamlined body. The earliest pinnipeds, however, lived on land and in
   freshwater habitats, much like mustelids today. Here we reconstruct the
   underwater foraging behaviour of one of these earliest pinnipeds
   (Potamotherium), focusing in particular on how it used its whiskers
   (vibrissae). For this purpose, we analyse the coronal gyrus of the brain
   of 7 fossil and 31 extant carnivorans. This region receives
   somatosensory input from the head. Our results show that the reliance on
   whiskers in modern pinnipeds is an ancestral feature that favoured
   survival of stem pinnipeds in marine habitats. This study provides
   insights into an impressive ecological transition in carnivoran
   evolution: from terrestrial to amphibious marine species. Adaptations
   for underwater foraging were crucial for this transition.},

Abstract = {Studies of soft-shelled turtles show that behavioral thermoregulation

   Reptile embryos can move inside eggs to seek optimal thermal conditions,
   falsifying the traditional assumption that embryos are simply passive

   thermoregulatory behavior remains a contentious topic. Here we
   demonstrate that behavioral thermoregulation by turtle embryos shortened
   incubation periods which may reduce the duration of exposure to
   dangerous environments, decreased egg mortality imposed by lethally high
   temperatures, and synchronized hatching which reduces predation risk.
   Our study provides empirical evidence that behavioral thermoregulation

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {An extensive, world-wide Helicobacter pylori methylome dataset suggests
   that natural selection could fine-tune the epigenetic landscape by
   configuring methyltransferases and their recognition sequences.
   The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, the leading cause of gastric
   cancer, is genetically highly diverse and harbours a large and variable
   portfolio of restriction-modification systems. Our understanding of the
   evolution and function of DNA methylation in bacteria is limited. Here,
   we performed a comprehensive analysis of the methylome diversity in H.
   pylori, using a dataset of 541 genomes that included all known
   phylogeographic populations. The frequency of 96 methyltransferases and
   the abundance of their cognate recognition sequences were strongly
   influenced by phylogeographic structure and were inter-correlated,
   positively or negatively, for 20\% of type II methyltransferases. Low
   density motifs were more likely to be affected by natural selection, as
   reflected by higher genomic instability and compositional bias.
   Importantly, direct correlation implied that methylation patterns can be
   actively enriched by positive selection and suggests that specific sites
   have important functions in methylation-dependent phenotypes. Finally,
   we identified lineage-specific selective pressures modulating the
   contraction and expansion of the motif ACGT, revealing that the genetic
   load of methylation could be dependent on local ecological factors.
   Taken together, natural selection may shape both the abundance and
   distribution of methyltransferases and their specific recognition
   sequences, likely permitting a fine-tuning of genome-encoded functions
   not achievable by genetic variation alone.},

Abstract = {Soon after whales originated from small terrestrial artiodactyl
   ancestors, basal stem forms (archaeocetes) came to inhabit more
   specialized aquatic ecologies and underwent a tremendous adaptive
   radiation that culminated in the adoption of a fully aquatic lifestyle.
   This adaptive strategy is first documented by the geographically
   widespread extinct family Basilosauridae. Here we report a new
   basilosaurid genus and species, Tutcetus rayanensis, from the middle
   Eocene of Fayum, Egypt. This new whale is not only the smallest known
   basilosaurid, but it is also one of the oldest records of this family
   from Africa. Tutcetus allows us to further test hypotheses regarding
   basilosaurids' early success in the aquatic ecosystem, which lasted into
   the latest Eocene, and their ability to outcompete amphibious stem
   whales and opportunistically adapt to new niches after they completely
   severed their ties to the land. Tutcetus also significantly expands the
   size range of the basilosaurids and reveals new details about their life
   histories, phylogeny, and paleobiogeography.

Title = {Prosocial behavior in competitive fish: the case of the archerfish},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Archerfish, competitive by nature, are found to prefer targets that
   reward both themselves and their tankmates when the payoff is equal,
   providing an example of prosocial behavior.
   Humans are social creatures, demonstrate prosocial behaviors, and are
   sensitive to the actions and consequent payoff of others. This social
   sensitivity has also been found in many other species, though not in
   all. Research has suggested that prosocial tendencies are more
   pronounced in naturally cooperative species whose social structure
   requires a high level of interdependence and allomaternal care. The
   present study challenges this assumption by demonstrating, in a
   laboratory setting, that archerfish, competitive by nature, preferred
   targets rewarding both themselves and their tankmates, but only when the
   payoff was equal. With no tankmate on the other side of the partition,
   they exhibited no obvious preference. Finding evidence for prosocial
   behavior and negative responses to unequal distribution of reward to the
   advantage of the other fish suggests that in a competitive social
   environment, being prosocial may be the most adaptive strategy for
   personal survival, even if it benefits others as well.},

Abstract = {The translocation of individuals around the world is leading to rising
   incidences of anthropogenic hybridization, particularly between domestic
   and wild congeners. We apply a landscape genomics approach for thousands
   of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) samples across continental and island
   populations to determine the result of over a century of supplementation
   practices. We establish that a single domestic game-farm mallard breed
   is the source for contemporary release programs in Eurasia and North
   America, as well as for established feral populations in New Zealand and
   Hawaii. In particular, we identify central Europe and eastern North
   America as epicenters of ongoing anthropogenic hybridization, and
   conclude that the release of game-farm mallards continues to affect the
   genetic integrity of wild mallards. Conversely, self-sustaining feral
   populations in New Zealand and Hawaii not only show strong
   differentiation from their original stock, but also signatures of local
   adaptation occurring in less than a half-century since game-farm mallard
   releases have ceased. We conclude that `wild' is not singular, and that
   even feral populations are capable of responding to natural processes.
   Although considered paradoxical to biological conservation,
   understanding the capacity for wildness among feral and feral admixed
   populations in human landscapes is critical as such interactions
   increase in the Anthropocene.

Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Generation of a complete catalog of transposable elements in the lima
   bean genome provides insight into the two independent domestication
   events that occurred in the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of this
   species.
   The domestication process in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) involves
   two independent events, within the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools.
   This makes lima bean an excellent model to understand convergent
   evolution. The mechanisms of adaptation followed by Mesoamerican and
   Andean landraces are largely unknown. Genes related to these adaptations
   can be selected by identification of selective sweeps within gene pools.
   Previous genetic analyses in lima bean have relied on Single Nucleotide
   Polymorphism (SNP) loci, and have ignored transposable elements (TEs).
   Here we show the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 61 lima
   bean accessions to characterize a genomic variation database including
   TEs and SNPs, to associate selective sweeps with variable TEs and to
   predict candidate domestication genes. A small percentage of genes under
   selection are shared among gene pools, suggesting that domestication
   followed different genetic avenues in both gene pools. About 75\% of TEs
   are located close to genes, which shows their potential to affect gene
   functions. The genetic structure inferred from variable TEs is
   consistent with that obtained from SNP markers, suggesting that TE
   dynamics can be related to the demographic history of wild and
   domesticated lima bean and its adaptive processes, in particular
   selection processes during domestication.},

   the MaSp genes of E. davidi may represent an early stage of MaSp and
   MiSp genes in other true spiders, while CrSp shares a common origin with
   AgSp and PySp but differ from MaSp. Altogether, this study contributes
   to addressing the limited availability of genomic sequences from
   Hypochilidae spiders, and provides a valuable resource for investigating
   the genomic evolution of spiders.
   The assembly of the E. davidi genomic sequence suggests that E. davidi

Abstract = {Conservation genomics often relies on non-invasive methods to obtain DNA
   fragments which limit the power of multi-omic analyses for threatened
   species. Here, we report multi-omic analyses based on a well-preserved
   great bustard individual (Otis tarda, Otidiformes) that was found dead
   in the mountainous region in Gansu, China. We generate a near-complete
   genome assembly containing only 18 gaps scattering in 8 out of the 40
   assembled chromosomes. We characterize the DNA methylation landscape
   which is correlated with GC content and gene expression. Our
   phylogenomic analysis suggests Otidiformes and Musophagiformes are
   sister groups that diverged from each other 46.3 million years ago. The
   genetic diversity of great bustard is found the lowest among the four
   available Otidiformes genomes, possibly due to population declines
   during past glacial periods. As one of the heaviest migratory birds,
   great bustard possesses several expanded gene families related to
   cardiac contraction, actin contraction, calcium ion signaling
   transduction, as well as positively selected genes enriched for
   metabolism. Finally, we identify an extremely young evolutionary stratum
   on the sex chromosome, a rare case among birds. Together, our study
   provides insights into the conservation genomics, adaption and
   chromosome evolution of the great bustard.
   A near-complete genome assembly generated from a well-preserved great
   bustard provides further insight into the evolutionary history of this
   vulnerable bird species.},

Title = {Coevolution of the <i>Tlx</i> homeobox gene with medusa development
   (Cnidaria: Medusozoa)},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Cnidarians display a wide diversity of life cycles. Among the main
   cnidarian clades, only Medusozoa possesses a swimming life cycle stage
   called the medusa, alternating with a benthic polyp stage. The medusa
   stage was repeatedly lost during medusozoan evolution, notably in the
   most diverse medusozoan class, Hydrozoa. Here, we show that the presence
   of the homeobox gene Tlx in Cnidaria is correlated with the presence of
   the medusa stage, the gene having been lost in clades that ancestrally
   lack a medusa (anthozoans, endocnidozoans) and in medusozoans that
   secondarily lost the medusa stage. Our characterization of Tlx
   expression indicate an upregulation of Tlx during medusa development in
   three distantly related medusozoans, and spatially restricted expression
   patterns in developing medusae in two distantly related species, the
   hydrozoan Podocoryna carnea and the scyphozoan Pelagia noctiluca. These
   results suggest that Tlx plays a key role in medusa development and that
   the loss of this gene is likely linked to the repeated loss of the
   medusa life cycle stage in the evolution of Hydrozoa.
   Analysis of the homeobox gene Tlx across cnidarian genomes highlights
   the presence of Tlx only in clades featuring the medusa life cycle
   stage, linking the loss of the gene to loss of the medusa in Hydrozoa
   evolution.},

Title = {The genome of the glasshouse plant noble rhubarb (<i>Rheum nobile</i>)
   provides a window into alpine adaptation},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Glasshouse plants are species that trap warmth via specialized
   morphology and physiology, mimicking a human glasshouse. In the
   Himalayan alpine region, the highly specialized glasshouse morphology
   has independently evolved in distinct lineages to adapt to intensive UV
   radiation and low temperature. Here we demonstrate that the glasshouse
   structure - specialized cauline leaves - is highly effective in
   absorbing UV light but transmitting visible and infrared light, creating
   an optimal microclimate for the development of reproductive organs. We
   reveal that this glasshouse syndrome has evolved at least three times
   independently in the rhubarb genus Rheum. We report the genome sequence
   of the flagship glasshouse plant Rheum nobile and identify key genetic
   network modules in association with the morphological transition to
   specialized glasshouse leaves, including active secondary cell wall
   biogenesis, upregulated cuticular cutin biosynthesis, and suppression of
   photosynthesis and terpenoid biosynthesis. The distinct cell wall
   organization and cuticle development might be important for the
   specialized optical property of glasshouse leaves. We also find that the
   expansion of LTRs has likely played an important role in noble rhubarb
   adaptation to high elevation environments. Our study will enable
   additional comparative analyses to identify the genetic basis underlying
   the convergent occurrence of glasshouse syndrome.
   A high-quality genome assembly and phylogenetic analysis for the
   glasshouse plant, Rheum nobile, shed light on its evolutionary history
   and ability to adapt to intensive UV radiation in a low-temperature,
   alpine environment.},

Abstract = {A metagenomic analysis of 757 sewage samples from 101 countries suggests
   that global differences in some species might be caused by regional
   environmental selection.
   Most investigations of geographical within-species differences are
   limited to focusing on a single species. Here, we investigate global
   differences for multiple bacterial species using a dataset of 757
   metagenomics sewage samples from 101 countries worldwide. The
   within-species variations were determined by performing genome
   reconstructions, and the analyses were expanded by gene focused
   approaches. Applying these methods, we recovered 3353 near complete (NC)
   metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) encompassing 1439 different MAG
   species and found that within-species genomic variation was in 36\% of
   the investigated species (12/33) coherent with regional separation.
   Additionally, we found that variation of organelle genes correlated less
   with geography compared to metabolic and membrane genes, suggesting that
   the global differences of these species are caused by regional
   environmental selection rather than dissemination limitations. From the
   combination of the large and globally distributed dataset and in-depth
   analysis, we present a wide investigation of global within-species
   phylogeny of sewage bacteria. The global differences found here
   emphasize the need for worldwide data sets when making global
   conclusions.},

Title = {Competitive hierarchies in bryozoan assemblages mitigate network
   instability by keeping short and long feedback loops weak},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Competitive hierarchies between species in bryozoan assemblages are
   shown to mitigate network instability by keeping short and long feedback
   loops weak.
   Competitive hierarchies in diverse ecological communities have long been
   thought to lead to instability and prevent coexistence. However, system
   stability has never been tested, and the relation between hierarchy and
   instability has never been explained in complex competition networks
   parameterised with data from direct observation. Here we test model
   stability of 30 multispecies bryozoan assemblages, using estimates of
   energy loss from observed interference competition to parameterise both
   the inter- and intraspecific interactions in the competition networks.
   We find that all competition networks are unstable. However, instability
   is mitigated considerably by asymmetries in the energy loss rates
   brought about by hierarchies of strong and weak competitors. This
   asymmetric organisation results in asymmetries in the interaction
   strengths, which reduces instability by keeping the weight of short
   (positive) and longer (positive and negative) feedback loops low. Our
   results support the idea that interference competition leads to
   instability and exclusion but demonstrate that this is not because of,
   but despite, competitive hierarchy.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Although humans have long been predators with enduring nutritive and
   cultural relationships with their prey, seldom have conservation
   ecologists considered the divergent predatory behavior of contemporary,
   industrialized humans. Recognizing that the number, strength and
   diversity of predator-prey relationships can profoundly influence
   biodiversity, here we analyze humanity's modern day predatory
   interactions with vertebrates and estimate their ecological
   consequences. Analysing IUCN `use and trade' data for similar to 47,000
   species, we show that fishers, hunters and other animal collectors prey
   on more than a third (similar to 15,000 species) of Earth's vertebrates.
   Assessed over equivalent ranges, humans exploit up to 300 times more
   species than comparable non-human predators. Exploitation for the pet
   trade, medicine, and other uses now affects almost as many species as
   those targeted for food consumption, and almost 40\% of exploited
   species are threatened by human use. Trait space analyses show that
   birds and mammals threatened by exploitation occupy a disproportionally
   large and unique region of ecological trait space, now at risk of loss.
   These patterns suggest far more species are subject to human-imposed
   ecological (e.g., landscapes of fear) and evolutionary (e.g., harvest
   selection) processes than previously considered. Moreover, continued
   over-exploitation will likely bear profound consequences for
   biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {An overview of coral reefs across East and Southeast Asia spanning
   >24,000 surveys in almost 2,000 sites finds that coral and macroalgal
   cover are surprisingly stable through time, though correlated
   environmental variables reveal hidden impact.
   Coral reefs in the Central Indo-Pacific region comprise some of the most
   diverse and yet threatened marine habitats. While reef monitoring has
   grown throughout the region in recent years, studies of coral reef
   benthic cover remain limited in spatial and temporal scales. Here, we
   analysed 24,365 reef surveys performed over 37 years at 1972 sites
   throughout East Asia by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network using
   Bayesian approaches. Our results show that overall coral cover at
   surveyed reefs has not declined as suggested in previous studies and
   compared to reef regions like the Caribbean. Concurrently, macroalgal
   cover has not increased, with no indications of phase shifts from coral
   to macroalgal dominance on reefs. Yet, models incorporating
   socio-economic and environmental variables reveal negative associations
   of coral cover with coastal urbanisation and sea surface temperature.
   The diversity of reef assemblages may have mitigated cover declines thus
   far, but climate change could threaten reef resilience. We recommend
   prioritisation of regionally coordinated, locally collaborative
   long-term studies for better contextualisation of monitoring data and
   analyses, which are essential for achieving reef conservation goals.},

Abstract = {This study generates genome assemblies for seven major haplogroups of
   the human Y chromosome at a unique resolution that overcomes the
   structurally complex regions within. These data enable the detection and
   profiling of epigenetic modifications among the considered haplogroups.
   Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have allowed the
   generation and curation of more complete genome assemblies, enabling the
   analysis of traditionally neglected chromosomes, such as the human Y
   chromosome (chrY). Native DNA was sequenced on a MinION Oxford Nanopore
   Technologies sequencing device to generate genome assemblies for seven
   major chrY human haplogroups. We analyzed and compared the chrY
   enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective
   sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome
   sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create
   assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive
   and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific
   structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using
   short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this
   technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications among the
   considered haplogroups. Altogether, we provide a framework to study
   complex genomic regions with a simple, fast, and affordable methodology
   that could be applied to larger population genomics datasets.},

Abstract = {The coexistence of three sexual phenotypes (male, female and bisexual)
   in a single species, `trioecy', is rarely found in diploid organisms

   sex phenotypes of P. starrii to reveal a reorganization of the ancestral
   sex-determining regions (SDRs) in the sex chromosomes: the male and
   bisexual phenotypes had the same ``male SDR{''} with paralogous gene
   expansions of the male-determining gene MID, whereas the female
   phenotype had a ``female SDR{''} with transposition of the
   female-specific gene FUS1 to autosomal regions. Although the male and
   bisexual sex phenotypes had the identical male SDR and harbored
   autosomal FUS1, MID and FUS1 expression during sexual reproduction
   differed between them. Thus, the coexistence of three sex phenotypes in
   P. starrii is possible.

Abstract = {Climate change is an important driver of range shifts and community
   composition changes. Still, little is known about how the responses are
   influenced by the combination of land use, species interactions and

   butterfly species in Sweden and Finland and show that cumulative species
   richness has increased with increasing temperature over the past 120
   years. Average provincial species richness increased by 64\% (range
   15-229\%), from 46 to 70. The rate and direction of range expansions
   have not matched the temperature changes, in part because colonisations
   have been modified by other climatic variables, land use and vary
   according to species characteristics representing ecological
   generalisation and species interactions. Results emphasise the role of a
   broad ecological filtering, whereby a mismatch between environmental
   conditions and species preferences limit the ability to disperse and
   establish populations in emerging climates and novel areas, with
   potentially widespread implications for ecosystem functioning.

Title = {Illuminance-tuned collective motion in fish},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {We experimentally investigate the role of illumination on the collective
   dynamics of a large school (ca. 50 individuals) of Hemigrammus
   rhodostomus. The structure of the group, defined using two order
   parameters, is quantified while progressively altering the visual range
   of the fish through controlled cycles of ambient light intensity. We
   show that, at low light levels, the individuals within the group are
   unable to form a cohesive group, while at higher illuminance the degree
   of alignment of the school correlates with the light intensity. When
   increasing the illuminance, the school structure is successively
   characterized by a polarized state followed by a highly regular and
   stable rotational configuration (milling). Our study shows that vision
   is necessary to achieve cohesive collective motion for free swimming
   fish schools, while the short-range lateral line sensing is insufficient
   in this situation. The present experiment therefore provides new
   insights into the interaction mechanisms that govern the emergence and
   intensity of collective motion in biological systems.
   The collective schooling behaviour of rummy-nose tetra fish is
   associated with light intensity, moving from a state of disorder through
   polarization and then into rotational milling as light intensity
   increases.},

Title = {Multigenic resistance to <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> in wild grapes
   (<i>Vitis</i> sps.) and its implications within a changing climate},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterium that infects crops like grapevines,
   coffee, almonds, citrus and olives. There is little understanding of the
   genes that contribute to plant resistance, the genomic architecture of
   resistance, and the potential role of climate in shaping resistance, in
   part because major crops like grapevines (Vitis vinifera) are not
   resistant to the bacterium. Here we study a wild grapevine species, V.
   arizonica, that segregates for resistance. Using genome-wide
   association, we identify candidate resistance genes.
   Resistance-associated kmers are shared with a sister species of V.
   arizonica but not with more distant species, suggesting that resistance
   evolved more than once. Finally, resistance is climate dependent,
   because individuals from low ( < 10 degrees C) temperature locations in
   the wettest quarter were typically susceptible to infection, likely
   reflecting a lack of pathogen pressure in colder climates. In fact,
   climate is as effective a predictor of resistance phenotypes as some
   genetic markers. We extend our climate observations to additional crops,
   predicting that increased pathogen pressure is more likely for
   grapevines and almonds than some other susceptible crops.
   Potential resistance genes for Xylella fastidiosa in wild grapes are
   identified and resistance is shown to be climate dependent.},

Title = {Shared community effects and the non-genetic maternal environment shape
   cortisol levels in wild chimpanzees},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Mechanisms of inheritance remain poorly defined for many
   fitness-mediating traits, especially in long-lived animals with
   protracted development. Using 6,123 urinary samples from 170 wild
   chimpanzees, we examined the contributions of genetics, non-genetic
   maternal effects, and shared community effects on variation in cortisol
   levels, an established predictor of survival in long-lived primates.
   Despite evidence for consistent individual variation in cortisol levels
   across years, between-group effects were more influential and made an
   overwhelming contribution to variation in this trait. Focusing on
   within-group variation, non-genetic maternal effects accounted for 8\%
   of the individual differences in average cortisol levels, significantly
   more than that attributable to genetic factors, which was
   indistinguishable from zero. These maternal effects are consistent with
   a primary role of a shared environment in shaping physiology. For
   chimpanzees, and perhaps other species with long life histories,
   community and maternal effects appear more relevant than genetic
   inheritance in shaping key physiological traits.
   In wild chimpanzees, shared community and non-genetic maternal effects
   are determined to be a more powerful force compared to genetic
   inheritance in shaping urinary cortisol levels.},
