Abstract = {Animal coloration is one of the most conspicuous aspects of
   human-perceived organismal diversity, yet also one of the least
   understood. In particular, explaining why species have specific colors
   (e.g., blue vs. red) has proven elusive. Here, we quantify for nearly
   all bird species, the proportion of the body covered by each of 12
   human-visible color categories, and test whether existing theory can
   predict the direction of color evolution. The most common colors are
   black, white, gray and brown, while the rarest are green, blue, purple,
   and red. Males have more blue, purple, red, or black, whereas females
   have more yellow, brown, or gray. Sexual dichromatism is partly due to
   sexual selection favoring ornamental colors in males but not in females.
   However, sexual selection also correlated positively with brown in both
   sexes. Strong social selection favors red and black, colors used in
   agonistic signaling, with the strongest effects in females. Reduced
   predation risk selects against cryptic colors (e.g., brown) and favors
   specific ornamental colors (e.g., black). Nocturnality is mainly
   associated with brown. The effects of habitat use support the sensory
   drive theory for camouflage and signaling. Darker colors are more common
   in species living in wet and cold climates, matching ecogeographical
   rules. Our study unambiguously supports existing theories of color
   evolution across an entire class of vertebrates, but much variation
   remains unexplained.},

Abstract = {Herbivorous arthropods are the most diverse group of multicellular
   organisms on Earth. The most discussed drivers of their inordinate
   taxonomic and functional diversity are high niche availability
   associated with the diversity of host plants and dense niche packing due
   to host partitioning among herbivores. However, the relative
   contributions of these two factors to dynamics in the diversity of
   herbivores throughout Earth's history remain unresolved. Using fossil
   data on herbivore-induced leaf damage from across the Cenozoic, we infer
   quantitative bipartite interaction networks between plants and
   functional feeding types of herbivores. We fit a general model of
   diversity to these interaction networks and discover that host
   partitioning among functional groups of herbivores contributed twice as
   much to herbivore functional diversity as host diversity. These findings
   indicate that niche packing primarily shaped the dynamics in the
   functional diversity of herbivores during the past 66 my. Our study
   highlights how the fossil record can be used to test fundamental
   theories of biodiversity and represents a benchmark for assessing the
   drivers of herbivore functional diversity in modern ecosystems.},

Abstract = {``Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity{''} is the second
   official aim of the current UN Ocean Decade (2021 to 2030) calling for
   the identification and protection of critical marine habitats. However,
   data to inform policy are often lacking altogether or confined to recent
   times, preventing the establishment of long -term baselines. The unique
   insights gained from combining bioarchaeology (palaeoproteomics, stable
   isotope analysis) with contemporary data (from satellite tracking)
   identified habitats which sea turtles have been using in the Eastern
   Mediterranean over five millennia. Specifically, our analysis of
   archaeological green turtle (Chelonia mydas) bones revealed that they
   likely foraged on the same North African seagrass meadows as their
   modern -day counterparts. Here, millennia -long foraging habitat
   fidelity has been directly demonstrated, highlighting the significance
   (and long -term dividends) of protecting these critical coastal habitats
   that are especially vulnerable to global warming. We highlight the
   potential for historical ecology to inform policy in safeguarding
   critical marine habitats.SignificanceThe persistence of most species and
   their key habitats is intimately tied together. Sea turtles famously
   exhibit a strong fidelity to their natal rookery where they return to
   nest. While satellite tracking has provided evidence of foraging -ground
   fidelity, this approach is limited to a small number of turtles observed
   over a few years. Incorporating the bioarchaeological record, we found
   that Mediterranean green turtles have been utilizing the same North
   African seagrass meadows for at least-3,000 y. This enables site
   fidelity to be established at the generational level, uncovering habitat
   significance over timescales beyond the Anthropocene. Our results
   validate this concept and open the possibility of its application to
   other species, facilitating species management, thus informing
   biodiversity conservation.},

Abstract = {Pelvic morphology exhibits a particular sexual dimorphism in humans,
   which reflects obstetrical constraints due to the tight fit between
   neonates and mothers. Huseynov et al. {[}Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
   113, 5227-5232 (2016)] showed that in humans, pelvic sexual dimorphism
   is greatest around the age of highest fertility, and it becomes less
   marked in association with menopause in females. They proposed that this
   reflects changes of obstetrical versus locomotor functional demands in
   females. It remains unknown whether such developmental adjustment of the
   pelvic morphology is unique to humans. Macaques exhibit human -like
   cephalopelvic proportions, but they lack menopause and usually maintain
   fertility throughout adulthood. Here, we track pelvic development in
   Japanese macaques from neonate to advanced ages using computed
   tomography -based data. We show that female pelvic morphology changes
   throughout adult life, reaching the obstetrically most favorable shape
   at advanced ages rather than around primiparity. We hypothesize that
   pelvic morphology in Japanese macaques is developmentally adjusted to
   childbirth at advanced ages, where obstetrical risks are potentially
   higher than at younger ages. Our data contribute to the growing evidence
   that the female primate pelvis changes its morphology during the whole
   lifespan, pos-sibly adjusting for changing functional demands during
   adulthood.},

Title = {Echoes of ancient introgression punctuate stable genomic lineages in the

   AMERICA},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Studies investigating the evolution of flowering plants have long
   focused on isolating mechanisms such as pollinator specificity. Some
   recent studies have proposed a role for introgressive hybridization
   between species, recognizing that isolating processes such as pollinator
   specialization may not be complete barriers to hybridization. Occasional
   hybridization may therefore lead to distinct yet reproductively
   connected lineages. We investigate the balance between introgression and
   reproductive isolation in a diverse clade using a densely sampled
   phylogenomic study of fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae). Codiversification
   with specialized pollinating wasps (Agaonidae) is recognized as a major
   engine of fig diversity, leading to about 850 species. Nevertheless,
   some studies have focused on the importance of hybridization in Ficus,
   highlighting the consequences of pollinator sharing. Here, we employ
   dense taxon sampling (520 species) throughout Moraceae and 1,751 loci to
   investigate phylogenetic relationships and the prevalence of
   introgression among species throughout the history of Ficus. We present
   a well-resolved phylogenomic backbone for Ficus, providing a solid
   foundation for an updated classification. Our results paint a picture of
   phylogenetically stable evolution within lineages punctuated by
   occasional local introgression events likely mediated by local
   pollinator sharing, illustrated by clear cases of cytoplasmic
   introgression that have been nearly drowned out of the nuclear genome
   through subsequent lineage fidelity. The phylogenetic history of figs
   thus highlights that while hybridization is an important process in
   plant evolution, the mere ability of species to hybridize locally does
   not necessarily translate into ongoing introgression between distant
   lineages, particularly in the presence of obligate plant-pollinator
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Night-migratory songbirds have a light-dependent magnetic compass sense,
   the mechanism of which is thought to depend on the photochemical
   formation of radical pairs in cryptochrome (Cry) proteins located in the
   retina. The finding that weak radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields
   can prevent birds from orienting in the Earth's magnetic field has been
   regarded as a diagnostic test for this mechanism and as a potential
   source of information on the identities of the radicals. The maximum
   frequency that could cause such disorientation has been predicted to lie
   between 120 and 220 MHz for a flavin-tryptophan radical pair in Cry.
   Here we show that the magnetic orientation capabilities of Eurasian
   blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) are not affected by RF noise in the
   frequency bands 140 to 150 MHz and 235 to 245 MHz. From a consideration
   of its internal magnetic interactions, we argue that RF field effects on
   a flavin-containing radical -pair sensor should be approximately
   independent of frequency up to 116 MHz and that birds' sensitivity to RF
   disorientation should fall by about two orders of magnitude when the
   frequency exceeds 116 MHz. Taken together with our earlier finding that
   75 to 85 MHz RF fields disrupt the magnetic orientation of blackcaps,
   these results provide compelling evidence that the magnetic compass of
   migratory birds operates by a radical pair mechanism.},

Title = {Demographic consequences of phenological asynchrony for North American

Abstract = {Changes in phenology in response to ongoing climate change have been
   observed in numerous taxa around the world. Differing rates of
   phenological shifts across trophic levels have led to concerns that
   ecological interactions may become increasingly decoupled in time, with
   potential negative consequences for populations. Despite widespread
   evidence of phenological change and a broad body of supporting theory,
   large -scale multitaxa evidence for demographic consequences of
   phenological asynchrony remains elusive. Using data from a continental
   -scale bird-banding program, we assess the impact of phenological
   dynamics on avian breeding productivity in 41 species of migratory and
   resident North American birds breeding in and around forested areas. We
   find strong evidence for a phenological optimum where breeding
   productivity decreases in years with both particularly early or late
   phenology and when breeding occurs early or late relative to local
   vegetation phenology. Moreover, we demonstrate that landbird breeding
   phenology did not keep pace with shifts in the timing of vegetation
   green -up over a recent 18-y period, even though avian breeding
   phenology has tracked green -up with greater sensitivity than arrival
   for migratory species. Species whose breeding phenology more closely
   tracked green -up tend to migrate shorter distances (or are resident
   over the entire year) and breed earlier in the season. These results
   showcase the broadest -scale evidence yet of the demographic impacts of
   phenological change. Future climate change-associated phenological
   shifts will likely result in a decrease in breeding productivity for
   most species, given that bird breeding phenology is failing to keep pace
   with climate change.},

Title = {The evolution of archaeal flagellar filaments},

Abstract = {Flagellar motility has independently arisen three times during
   evolution: in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the
   supercoiled flagellar filaments are composed largely of a single
   protein, bacterial or archaeal flagellin, although these two proteins
   are not homologous, while in eukaryotes, the flagellum contains hundreds
   of proteins. Archaeal flagellin and archaeal type IV pilin are
   homologous, but how archaeal flagellar filaments (AFFs) and archaeal
   type IV pili (AT4Ps) diverged is not understood, in part, due to the
   paucity of structures for AFFs and AT4Ps. Despite having similar
   structures, AFFs supercoil, while AT4Ps do not, and supercoiling is
   essential for the function of AFFs. We used cryo-electron microscopy to
   determine the atomic structure of two additional AT4Ps and reanalyzed
   previous structures. We find that all AFFs have a prominent 10 -strand
   packing, while AT4Ps show a striking structural diversity in their
   subunit packing. A clear distinction between all AFF and all AT4P
   structures involves the extension of the N-terminal \& alpha;- helix
   with polar residues in the AFFs. Additionally, we characterize a
   flagellar- like AT4P from Pyrobaculum calidifontis with filament and
   subunit structure similar to that of AFFs which can be viewed as an
   evolutionary link, showing how the structural diversity of AT4Ps likely
   allowed for an AT4P to evolve into a supercoiling AFF.SignificanceAs
   Dobzhansky stated, nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of
   evolution. But, creationists have used the bacterial flagellar system as
   an example of ``irreducible complexity,{''} arguing that it could never
   have evolved from a simpler system. In archaea, a flagellar motility
   system arose independently from that in bacteria and is thus an example
   of convergent evolution. However, little has been known about the
   evolution of either the bacterial or archaeal flagellar system. We show
   how the archaeal flagellum likely evolved from simpler archaeal type IV
   pili, taking advantage of the structural diversity among the archaeal
   type IV pili to build a flagellar filament that supercoils. It is the
   supercoiled filament that generates thrust when rotated.},

Abstract = {Milk production is an ancient adaptation that unites all mammals. Milk
   contains a microbiome that can contribute to offspring health and
   microbial-immunological development. We generated a comprehensive milk
   microbiome dataset (16S rRNA gene) for the class Mammalia, representing
   47 species from all placental superorders, to determine processes
   structuring milk microbiomes. We show that across Mammalia, milk exposes
   offspring to maternal bacterial and archaeal symbionts throughout
   lactation. Deterministic processes of environmental selection accounted
   for 20\% of milk microbiome assembly processes; milk microbiomes were
   similar from mammals with the same host superorder (Afrotheria,
   Laurasiathera, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra: 6\%), environment
   (marine captive, marine wild, terrestrial captive, and terrestrial wild:
   6\%), diet (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, and insectivore: 5\%), and
   milk nutrient content (sugar, fat, and protein: 3\%). We found that diet
   directly and indirectly impacted milk microbiomes, with indirect effects
   being mediated by milk sugar content. Stochastic processes, such as
   ecological drift, accounted for 80\% of milk microbiome assembly
   processes, which was high compared to mammalian gut and mammalian skin
   microbiomes (69\% and 45\%, respectively). Even amid high stochasticity
   and indirect effects, our results of direct dietary effects on milk
   micro biomes provide support for enteromammary trafficking, representing
   a mechanism by which bacteria are transferred from the mother's gut to
   mammary gland and then to offspring postnatally. The microbial species
   present in milk reflect both selective pressures and stochastic
   processes at the host level, exemplifying various ecological and
   evolutionary factors acting on milk microbiomes, which, in turn, set the
   stage for offspring health and development.},

Volume = {120},

Abstract = {The evolution of the extinct megatooth shark, Otodus megalodon, and its
   close phylogenetic relatives remains enigmatic. A central question
   persists regarding the thermophysiological origins of these large
   predatory sharks through geologic time, including whether O. megalodon
   was ectothermic or endothermic (including regional endothermy), and
   whether its thermophysiology could help to explain the iconic shark's
   gigantism and eventual demise during the Pliocene. To address these
   uncertainties, we present unique geochemical evidence for
   thermoregulation in O. megalodon from both clumped isotope
   paleothermometry and phosphate oxygen isotopes. Our results show that O.
   megalodon had an overall warmer body temperature compared with its
   ambient environment and other coexisting shark species, providing
   quantitative and experimental support for recent biophysical modeling
   studies that suggest endothermy was one of the key drivers for gigantism
   in O. megalodon and other lamniform sharks. The gigantic body size with
   high metabolic costs of having high body temperatures may have
   contributed to the vulnerability of Otodus species to extinction when
   compared to other sympatric sharks that survived the Pliocene epoch.},

Abstract = {Human caregivers interacting with children typically modify their speech
   in ways that promote attention, bonding, and language acquisition.
   Although this ``motherese,{''} or child-directed communication (CDC),
   occurs in a variety of human cultures, evidence among nonhuman species
   is very rare. We looked for its occurrence in a nonhuman mam-malian
   species with long -term mother-offspring bonds that is capable of vocal
   production learning, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).
   Dolphin signature whistles provide a unique opportunity to test for CDC
   in nonhuman animals, because we are able to quantify changes in the same
   vocalizations produced in the presence or absence of calves. We
   ana-lyzed recordings made during brief catch- and-release events of wild
   bottlenose dolphins in waters near Sarasota Bay, Florida, United States,
   and found that females produced signature whistles with significantly
   higher maximum frequencies and wider frequency ranges when they were
   recorded with their own dependent calves vs. not with them. These
   differences align with the higher fundamental frequencies and wider
   pitch ranges seen in human CDC. Our results provide evidence in a
   nonhuman mammal for changes in the same vocaliza-tions when produced in
   the presence vs. absence of offspring, and thus strongly support
   convergent evolution of motherese, or CDC, in bottlenose dolphins. CDC
   may function to enhance attention, bonding, and vocal learning in
   dolphin calves, as it does in human children. Our data add to the
   growing body of evidence that dolphins provide a powerful animal model
   for studying the evolution of vocal learning and language.},

Abstract = {Understanding the claustrum's functions has recently progressed thanks
   to new ana-tomical and behavioral studies in rodents, which suggest that
   it plays an important role in attention, salience detection, slow- wave
   generation, and neocortical network synchronization. Nevertheless,
   knowledge about the origin and development of the claustrum, especially
   in primates, is still limited. Here, we show that neurons of rhesus
   macaque claustrum primordium are generated between embryonic day E48 and
   E55 and express some neocortical molecular markers, such as NR4A2,
   SATB2, and SOX5. However, in the early stages, it lacks TBR1 expression,
   which separates it from other surrounding telencephalic structures. We
   also found that two waves of neurogenesis (E48 and E55) in the
   claustrum, corresponding to the birthdates of layers 6 and 5 of the
   insular cortex, establish a ``core{''} and ``shell{''} cytoarchitecture,
   which is potentially a basis for differential circuit formation and
   could influence information processing under-lying higher cognitive
   functions of the claustrum. In addition, parvalbumin-positive
   interneurons are the dominant interneuron type in the claustrum in fetal
   macaque, and their maturation is independent of that in the overlaying
   neocortex. Finally, our study reveals that the claustrum is likely not a
   continuance of subplate neurons of the insular cortex, but an
   independent pallial region, suggesting its potentially unique role in
   cognitive control.},

Title = {Unraveling female communication through scent marks in the Norway rat},

   AMERICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {120},
Number = {25},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Chemical communication by females remains poorly understood, with most
   attention focused on female advertisement of sexual receptivity to males
   or mother-offspring communication. However, in social species, scents
   are likely to be important for mediat-ing competition and cooperation
   between females determining individual reproductive success. Here, we
   explore chemical signaling by female laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus)
   to test i) whether females target their deployment of scent information
   differentially according to their sexual receptivity and the genetic
   identity of both female and male conspecifics signaling in the local
   environment and ii) whether females are attracted to gain the same or
   different information from female scents compared to males. Consistent
   with targeting of scent information to colony members of similar genetic
   background, female rats increased scent marking in response to scents
   from females of the same strain. Females also suppressed scent marking
   in response to male scent from a genetically for-eign strain while
   sexually receptive. Proteomic analysis of female scent deposits revealed
   a complex protein profile, contributed from several sources but
   dominated by clitoral gland secretion. In particular, female scent marks
   contained a series of clitoral-derived hydrolases and proteolytically
   truncated major urinary proteins (MUPs). Manipulated blends of clitoral
   secretion and urine from estrus females were strongly attractive to both
   sexes, while voided urine alone stimulated no interest. Our study
   reveals that information about female receptive status is shared between
   females as well as with males, while clitoral secretions containing a
   complex set of truncated MUPs and other proteins play a key role in
   female communication.},

Title = {The developmental basis for scaling of mammalian tooth size},

Abstract = {When evolution leads to differences in body size, organs generally scale
   along. A well -known example of the tight relationship between organ and
   body size is the scaling of mammalian molar teeth. To investigate how
   teeth scale during development and evolution, we compared molar
   development from initiation through final size in the mouse and the rat.
   Whereas the linear dimensions of the rat molars are twice that of the
   mouse molars, their shapes are largely the same. Here, we focus on the
   first lower molars that are considered the most reliable dental proxy
   for size-related patterns due to their low within-species variability.
   We found that scaling of the molars starts early, and that the rat molar
   is patterned equally as fast but in a larger size than the mouse molar.
   Using transcriptomics, we discovered that a known regulator of body
   size, insulin -like growth factor 1 (Igf1), is more highly expressed in
   the rat molars compared to the mouse molars. Ex vivo and in vivo mouse
   models demonstrated that modulation of the IGF pathway reproduces
   several aspects of the observed scaling process. Furthermore, analysis
   of IGF1-treated mouse molars and computational modeling indicate that
   IGF signaling scales teeth by simultaneously enhancing growth and by
   inhibiting the cusp-patterning program, thereby providing a relatively
   simple mechanism for scaling teeth during development and evolution.
   Finally, comparative data from shrews to elephants suggest that this
   scaling mechanism regulates the minimum tooth size possible, as well as
   the patterning potential of large teeth.},

Abstract = {Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are critical agricultural pollinators as
   well as model organisms for research on development, behavior, memory,
   and learning. The parasite Nosema ceranae, a common cause of honey bee
   colony collapse, has developed resistance to small-molecule
   therapeutics. An alternative long-term strategy to combat Nosema
   infection is therefore urgently needed, with synthetic biology offering
   a potential solution. Honey bees harbor specialized bacterial gut
   symbionts that are transmitted within hives. Previously, these have been
   engineered to inhibit ectoparasitic mites by expressing double-stranded
   RNA (dsRNA) targeting essential mite genes, via activation of the mite
   RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. In this study, we engineered a honey
   bee gut symbiont to express dsRNA targeting essential genes of N.
   ceranae via the parasite's own RNAi machinery. The engineered symbiont
   sharply reduced Nosema proliferation and improved bee survival following
   the parasite challenge. This protection was observed in both newly
   emerged and older forager bees. Furthermore, engineered symbionts were
   transmitted among cohoused bees, suggesting that introducing engineered
   symbionts to hives could result in colony-level protection.},

Abstract = {Thousands of insect species have been introduced outside of their native
   ranges, and some of them strongly impact ecosystems and human societies.
   Because a large fraction of insects feed on or are associated with
   plants, nonnative plants provide habitat and resources for invading
   insects, thereby facilitating their establishment. Furthermore, plant
   imports represent one of the main pathways for accidental nonna-tive
   insect introductions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that plant
   invasions precede and promote insect invasions. We found that
   geographical variation in current non -native insect flows was best
   explained by nonnative plant flows dating back to 1900 rather than by
   more recent plant flows. Interestingly, nonnative plant flows were a
   better predictor of insect invasions than potentially confounding
   socioeconomic variables. Based on the observed time lag between plant
   and insect invasions, we estimated that the global insect invasion debt
   consists of 3,442 region-level intro-ductions, representing a potential
   increase of 35\% of insect invasions. This debt was most important in
   the Afrotropics, the Neotropics, and Indomalaya, where we expect a 10 to
   20-fold increase in discoveries of new nonnative insect species.
   Overall, our results highlight the strong link between plant and insect
   invasions and show that limiting the spread of nonnative plants might be
   key to preventing future invasions of both plants and insects.},

Abstract = {Movement synchronization between individuals has been implicated in
   reinforcing their cohesion. How might such interindividual motor
   entrainment be controlled by the social brain? The answer remains
   elusive owing largely to the lack of suitable animal models in which
   direct neural recordings are available. Here, we show that macaque
   monkeys exhibit social motor entrainment without human prompting. We
   found that repetitive arm movements for horizontal bar sliding were
   phase coherent between two monkeys. The nature of motor entrainment was
   specific to animal pairs, consistent across days, dependent on visual
   inputs, and affected by social hierarchy. Notably, the entrainment was
   diminished when paired with prerecorded movies of a monkey making the
   same movements or bar motion alone. These findings demon-strate that
   motor entrainment is facilitated by real-time social exchanges,
   providing a behavioral platform to study the neural basis of potentially
   evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that support group cohesion.},

Title = {Phylogenomic comparative methods: Accurate evolutionary inferences in
   the presence of gene tree discordance},

   AMERICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {120},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods have long been a mainstay of
   evolutionary biology, allowing for the study of trait evolution across
   species while accounting for their common ancestry. These analyses
   typically assume a single, bifurcating phylogenetic tree describing the
   shared history among species. However, modern phylogenomic analyses have
   shown that genomes are often composed of mosaic histories that can
   disagree both with the species tree and with each other-so- called
   discordant gene trees. These gene trees describe shared histories that
   are not captured by the species tree, and therefore that are unaccounted
   for in classic comparative approaches. The application of standard
   comparative methods to species histories containing discordance leads to
   incorrect inferences about the timing, direction, and rate of evolution.
   Here, we develop two approaches for incorporating gene tree histories
   into comparative methods: one that constructs an updated phylogenetic
   variance-covariance matrix from gene trees, and another that applies
   Felsenstein's pruning algorithm over a set of gene trees to calculate
   trait histories and likelihoods. Using simulation, we demonstrate that
   our approaches generate much more accurate estimates of tree- wide rates
   of trait evolution than standard methods. We apply our methods to two
   clades of the wild tomato genus Solanum with varying rates of
   discordance, demonstrating the contribution of gene tree discordance to
   variation in a set of floral traits. Our approaches have the potential
   to be applied to a broad range of classic inference problems in
   phylogenetics, including ancestral state reconstruction and the
   inference of lineage- specific rate shifts.},

Title = {Rise of<i> Ruppia</i> in Chesapeake Bay: Climate change-driven turnover
   of foundation species creates new threats and management opportunities},

   AMERICA},

Abstract = {Global change has converted many structurally complex and ecologically
   and eco-nomically valuable coastlines to bare substrate. In the
   structural habitats that remain, climate-tolerant and opportunistic
   species are increasing in response to environmental extremes and
   variability. The shifting of dominant foundation species identity with
   climate change poses a unique conservation challenge because species
   vary in their responses to environmental stressors and to management.
   Here, we combine 35 y of watershed modeling and biogeochemical water
   quality data with species compre-hensive aerial surveys to describe
   causes and consequences of turnover in seagrass foundation species
   across 26,000 ha of habitat in the Chesapeake Bay. Repeated marine
   heatwaves have caused 54\% retraction of the formerly dominant eelgrass
   (Zostera marina) since 1991, allowing 171\% expansion of the
   temperature-tolerant widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima) that has likewise
   benefited from large-scale nutrient reductions. However, this phase
   shift in dominant seagrass identity now presents two significant shifts
   for management: Widgeongrass meadows are not only respon-sible for
   rapid, extensive recoveries but also for the largest crashes over the
   last four decades; and, while adapted to high temperatures, are much
   more susceptible than eelgrass to nutrient pulses driven by springtime
   runoff. Thus, by selecting for rapid post-disturbance recolonization but
   low resistance to punctuated freshwater flow disturbance, climate change
   could threaten the Chesapeake Bay seagrass' ability to provide
   consistent fishery habitat and sustain functioning over time. We
   demonstrate that understanding the dynamics of the next generation of
   foundation species is a critical management priority, because shifts
   from relatively stable habitat to high interannual variability can have
   far-reaching consequences across marine and ter-restrial ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Declines in European bird populations are reported for decades but the
   direct effect of major anthropogenic pressures on such declines remains
   unquantified. Causal relationships between pressures and bird population
   responses are difficult to identify as pressures interact at different
   spatial scales and responses vary among species. Here, we uncover direct
   relationships between population time-series of 170 common bird species,
   monitored at more than 20,000 sites in 28 European countries, over 37 y,
   and four widespread anthropogenic pressures: agricultural
   intensification, change in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature
   change over the last decades. We quantify the influence of each pressure
   on population time-series and its importance relative to other
   pressures, and we identify traits of most affected species. We find that
   agricultural intensification, in particular pesticides and fertiliser
   use, is the main pressure for most bird population declines, especially
   for invertebrate feeders. Responses to changes in forest cover,
   urbanisation and temperature are more species-specific. Specifically,
   forest cover is associated with a positive effect and growing
   urbanisation with a negative effect on population dynamics, while
   temperature change has an effect on the dynamics of a large number of
   bird populations, the magnitude and direction of which depend on
   species' thermal preferences. Our results not only confirm the pervasive
   and strong effects of anthropogenic pressures on common breeding birds,
   but quantify the relative strength of these effects stressing the urgent
   need for transformative changes in the way of inhabiting the world in
   European countries, if bird populations shall have a chance of
   recovering.},

Title = {Chitin utilization by marine picocyanobacteria and the evolution of a

Abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the most
   abundant photosynthetic cells in the oceans, are generally thought to
   have a primarily single-celled and free-living lifestyle. However, while
   studying the ability of picocyanobacteria to supplement photosynthetic
   carbon fixation with the use of exogenous organic carbon, we found the
   widespread occurrence of genes for breaking down chitin, an abundant
   source of organic carbon that exists primarily as particles. We show
   that cells that encode a chitin degradation pathway display chitin
   degradation activity, attach to chitin particles, and show enhanced
   growth under low light conditions when exposed to chitosan, a partially
   deacetylated soluble form of chitin. Marine chitin is largely derived
   from arthropods, which underwent major diversifications 520 to 535 Mya,
   close to when marine picocyanobacteria are inferred to have appeared in
   the ocean. Phylogenetic analyses confirm that the chitin utilization
   trait was acquired at the root of marine picocyanobacteria. Together
   this leads us to postulate that attachment to chitin particles allowed
   benthic cyanobacteria to emulate their mat-based lifestyle in the water
   column, initiating their expansion into the open ocean, seeding the rise
   of modern marine ecosystems. Subsequently, transitioning to a
   constitutive planktonic life without chitin associations led to cellular
   and genomic streamlining along a major early branch within
   Prochlorococcus. Our work highlights how the emergence of associations
   between organisms from different trophic levels, and their coevolution,
   creates opportunities for colonizing new environments. In this view, the
   rise of ecological complexity and the expansion of the biosphere are
   deeply intertwined processes.},

Abstract = {Effective conservation of ecological communities requires accurate and
   up-to-date information about whether species are persisting or declining
   to extinction. The persistence of an ecological community is supported
   by its underlying network of species interactions. While the persistence
   of the network supporting the whole community is the most relevant scale
   for conservation, in practice, only small subsets of these networks can
   be monitored. There is therefore an urgent need to establish links
   between the small snapshots of data conservationists can collect, and
   the ``big picture{''} conclusions about ecosystem health demanded by
   policymakers, scientists, and societies. Here, we show that the
   persistence of small subnetworks (motifs) in isolation-that is, their
   persistence when considered separately from the larger network of which
   they are a part-is a reliable probabilistic indicator of the persistence
   of the network as a whole. Our methods show that it is easier to detect
   if an ecological community is not persistent than if it is persistent,
   allowing for rapid detection of extinction risk in endangered systems.
   Our results also justify the common practice of predicting ecological
   persistence from incomplete surveys by simulating the population
   dynamics of sampled subnetworks. Empirically, we show that our
   theoretical predictions are supported by data on invaded networks in
   restored and unrestored areas, even in the presence of environmental
   variability. Our work suggests that coordinated action to aggregate
   information from incomplete sampling can provide a means to rapidly
   assess the persistence of entire ecological networks and the expected
   success of restoration strategies.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {120},

Abstract = {The extraordinary number of species in the tropics when compared to the
   extra tropics is probably the most prominent and consistent pattern in
   biogeography, suggesting that overarching processes regulate this
   diversity gradient. A major challenge to characterizing which processes
   are at play relies on quantifying how the frequency and determinants of
   tropical and extra-tropical speciation, extinction, and dispersal events
   shaped evolutionary radiations. We address this question by developing
   and applying spatiotemporal phylogenetic and paleontological models of
   diversification for tetrapod species incorporating paleoenvironmental
   variation. Our phylogenetic model results show that area, energy, or
   species richness did not uniformly affect speciation rates across
   tetrapods and dispute expectations of a latitudinal gradient in
   speciation rates. Instead, both neontological and fossil evidence
   coincide in underscoring the role of extra-tropical extinctions and the
   outflow of tropical species in shaping biodiversity. These
   diversification dynamics accurately predict present-day levels of
   species richness across latitudes and uncover temporal idiosyncrasies
   but spatial generality across the major tetrapod radiations.},

Abstract = {Although over 50 y have passed since W. D. Hamilton articulated kin
   selection (observed direct fitness) declined while the number of young
   parented by related cobreeders (observed indirect fitness effect)
   increased with cobreeding coalition size. Combining these two factors,
   the observed inclusive fitness effect of cobreeding was greater than
   breeding singly for males, while the pattern for females depended on
   whether fitness was age-weighted, as females breeding singly accrued
   greater fitness at younger ages than cobreeding females. Accounting for
   the fitness birds would have obtained by breeding singly, however,
   lifetime inclusive fitness effects declined with coalition size for
   males, but were greater for females breeding as duos compared to
   breeding singly, due largely to indirect fitness effects of kin. Our
   analyses provide a road map for, and demonstrate the importance of,
   quantifying indirect fitness as a powerful evolutionary force
   contributing to the costs and benefits of social behaviors.},

Abstract = {Biological and social systems are structured at multiple scales, and the
   incentives of individuals who interact in a group may diverge from the
   collective incentive of the group as a whole. Mechanisms to resolve this
   tension are responsible for profound transitions in evolutionary
   history, including the origin of cellular life, multicellular life, and
   even societies. Here, we synthesize a growing literature that extends
   evolutionary game theory to describe multilevel evolutionary dynamics,
   using nested birth-death processes and partial differential equations to
   model natural selection acting on competition within and among groups of
   individuals. We analyze how mechanisms known to promote cooperation
   within a single group-including assortment, reciprocity, and population
   structure-alter evolutionary outcomes in the presence of competition
   among groups. We find that population structures most conducive to
   cooperation in multiscale systems can differ from those most conducive
   within a single group. Likewise, for competitive interactions with a
   continuous range of strategies we find that among-group selection may
   fail to produce socially optimal outcomes, but it can nonetheless
   produce second-best solutions that balance individual incentives to
   defect with the collective incentives for cooperation. We conclude by
   describing the broad applicability of multiscale evolutionary models to
   problems ranging from the production of diffusible metabolites in
   microbes to the management of common resources in human societies.},
