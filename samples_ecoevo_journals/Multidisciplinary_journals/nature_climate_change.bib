Abstract = {Reducing the risk of maladaptation is critical to successful climate
   adaptation, yet such dichotomy hampers nuanced assessments of adaptation
   outcomes. The authors provide a framework to assess relevant dimensions
   of adaptation outcomes on a continuum and apply it to various adaptation
   options.
   Adaptation is increasing across all sectors globally. Yet, the
   effectiveness of adaptation is inadequate, and examples of maladaptation
   are increasing. To reduce the risk of maladaptation, we propose the
   framework, Navigating the Adaptation-Maladaptation continuum (NAM). This
   framework is composed of six criteria relating to outcomes of adaptation
   for ecosystems, the climate (greenhouse gases emissions) and social
   systems (transformational potential) as well as equity-related outcomes
   for low-income populations, women/girls and marginalized ethnic groups.
   We apply the NAM framework to a set of representative adaptation options
   showing that considerable variation exists in the potential for
   adaptation or the risk of maladaptation. We suggest that decision-makers
   assess adaptation interventions against the NAM framework criteria and
   prioritize responses that reduce the risk of maladaptation.},

   mitigating air pollution in polluted regions},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Pages = {943+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cloud droplet number concentrations are often assumed to depend linearly
   on atmospheric aerosols (in log-log space). Here the authors show that
   this relationship is instead sigmoid, which delays additional warming
   due to air pollution mitigation by 20-30 years in heavily polluted
   regions.
   Aerosol-cloud interactions contribute substantially to uncertainties in
   anthropogenic forcing, in which the sensitivity of cloud droplet number
   concentration (N-d) to aerosol plays a central role. Here we use
   satellite observations to show that the aerosol-N-d relation (in log-log
   space) is not linear as commonly assumed. Instead, the N-d sensitivity
   decreases at large aerosol concentrations due to the transition from
   aerosol-limited to updraft-limited regime, making the widely used linear
   method problematic. A sigmoidal transition is shown to adequately fit
   the data. When using this revised relationship, the additional warming
   that arises from air pollution mitigation is delayed by two to three
   decades in heavily polluted locations, compared to the linear
   relationship. This cloud-mediated climate penalty will manifest markedly
   starting around 2025 in China and 2050 in India after applying the
   strongest air quality policy, underlining the urgency of mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Verification of reported fossil fuel emissions is critical for tracking
   the progress of the Paris Agreement. Here, a simple model suggests the
   stability of the sensitivity of net carbon exchange to climate and
   carbon dioxide forcing and validates reported global emissions with
   improved accuracy.
   The interannual to decadal variability in natural carbon sinks limits
   the explanation of recent changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here
   we account for interannual and decadal variability using a simple
   quasi-mechanistic model of the net land carbon exchange with terms
   scaling with atmospheric CO2 and a weighted spatial average of
   temperature anomalies. This approach reduces the unexplained residual in
   Earth's carbon cycle budget from \& PLUSMN;0.76 GtC per year obtained
   using process models to \& PLUSMN;0.50 GtC per year, with the largest
   improvements on decadal timescales despite assuming constant dynamics.
   Our findings reveal remarkable stability of the carbon cycle and allow
   verification of reported global emissions to within 4.4\% (95\%
   confidence level) over the five-year stocktake cycle of the Paris
   Agreement-half the uncertainty reported previously.},

Title = {Evaluating fossil fuel companies' alignment with 1.5 °C climate pathways},

Abstract = {Limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 \& DEG;C requires an
   unprecedented reduction in fossil fuel use, along with large-scale
   deployment of CO2 capture and storage. To track the fossil fuel industry
   and companies against 1.5 \& DEG;C-consistent pathways, we propose a new
   methodology that complements existing methodologies in four main ways:
   (1) it uses publicly available data; (2) focuses on absolute fossil fuel
   production (as a proxy for embedded emissions) rather than carbon
   intensities associated with their use; (3) includes coal that is
   commonly excluded; and (4) is applicable regardless of whether the
   company has set a target. By applying this method, we evaluated the 142
   largest producers of coal, oil and gas against three 1.5 \& DEG;C IPCC
   Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-1.9 and SSP5-1.9) from
   2014 and the International Energy Agency's Net Zero Emissions pathway
   from 2020. Between 2014 and 2020, 64\%, 63\% and 70\% of coal, oil and
   gas companies, respectively, produced more than their production budgets
   under the IPCC's middle-of-the-road (SSP2-1.9) Paris Agreement-compliant
   scenario. In addition, if the 142 companies we examined continued their
   average growth rate trends from 2010 to 2018, they would produce up to
   68\%, 42\% and 53\% more than their cumulative production budgets for
   coal, oil and gas, respectively, by 2050. By providing such simple
   metrics, based on publicly available data, our method offers
   stakeholders a way of easily tracking and comparing the performance of
   different fossil fuel producers against climate goals.
   Fossil fuel companies need to align their activities with the climate
   goals and reduce their production rapidly. This research based on an
   updated methodology shows that these companies would produce more than
   their cumulative production budgets by 2050 if the recent trend
   continues.},

Abstract = {The authors define the time of emergence-the time at which climate
   change signals emerge from the noise of ecosystem variability-for the
   great tit Parus major. They show that the time of emergence differs
   across levels, occurring earlier at the population level rather than at
   the trait or vital rate levels.
   Threats to species under climate change can be understood as a time at
   which the signal of climate change in ecological processes emerges from
   the noise of ecosystem variability, defined as `time of emergence'
   (ToE). Here we show that ToE for the great tit (Parus major) will occur
   earlier at the level of population size than trait (laying date) and
   vital rates (survival, recruitment) under the RCP 8.5 scenario,
   suggesting an amplified climate change signal at the population level.
   ToE thus varies across levels of biological organization that filter
   trends and variability in climate differently. This has implications for
   the detection of climate impacts on wild species, as a shift in
   population size may precede changes in traits and vital rates. Further
   work would need to identify the ecological level that may experience an
   earlier detection of the climate signal for species with contrasting
   life histories, climate trends and variability.},

   Climate adaptation and dispersal can determine a species' response to

   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We use climate-associated genotypes to identify
   population-level adaptation and model maladaptation with and without
   dispersal and find that contemporary populations in southwestern ranges
   are the most vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability cannot be
   mitigated by dispersal to more suitable niches because of climate
   maladaptation and landscape barriers. Overall, combined multiple climate
   change risk estimates in coevolving species can be used to improve
   climate change vulnerability assessments beyond what can be learned from

Abstract = {The planned relocation of entire communities to less hazard-exposed
   destinations is an increasingly salient climate change adaptation
   strategy but often results in maladaptive livelihood outcomes. There
   needs to be understanding of how planning decisions affect
   outcomes-relocated people's access to sustainable livelihoods, including
   physical, economic, natural, human, social and cultural assets. Here,
   drawing on data from 14 completed flood-related relocation cases, we use
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and find that planning
   decisions, alone and taken together, contributed to sustainable
   livelihood outcomes. Relocation processes initiated and driven by
   community members had better outcomes than government-driven processes,
   adding a global comparative perspective to prior findings. Speed and
   transfer dynamics were also critical, with different implications for
   small and large communities. As a result, multiple pathways of planning
   decisions can lead to better outcomes, highlighting potential entry
   points for policy to promote more sustainable and people-centred planned
   relocation.
   Planned relocation can be an adaptation approach to avoid damages from
   increasing natural hazards yet concerns over maladaptive outcomes
   remain. Based on flood-related relocation cases, this study highlights
   the importance of community engagement in enabling sustainable
   livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Macroclimatic changes are impacting ecosystems worldwide. However, a
   large portion of terrestrial species live under conditions where impacts
   of macroclimate change are buffered, such as in the shade of trees, and

   impacts on forest biodiversity, while canopy opening amplifies
   macroclimate change impacts. A cross-continental transplant experiment

   heating and irradiation treatments was used to parametize 25-m
   resolution mechanistic demographic distribution models and project the
   current and future distributions of 12 common understorey plant species,

   These results highlight microclimates and forest density as powerful

Abstract = {Climate-induced extreme events could lead to drastic socioeconomic
   consequences, including altered cooperation behaviours. With survey
   experiments among Iraqi and Syrian refugees, this study finds drought
   experience could reduce altruism and group identity function as the key
   moderator.
   Previous research on climate change impact regularly considers conflict
   outcomes, thereby disregarding cooperative behaviour such as altruism.
   Drought has the potential to fuel inter-ethnic cleavages, thus
   contributing to conflicts. Yet this runs against resilience arguments
   suggesting people who experience environmental hardship are more
   cooperative. Here we examine altruism in survey experiments in a natural
   setting among refugees from Syria and Iraq. We match survey responses to
   observational data on drought and socioeconomic variables. Our findings
   speak to both arguments. First, we show that drought exposure is
   associated with decreased altruism for survey respondents generally. We
   further show how group identity moderates the relationship between
   drought and altruism. Our results suggest a decrease in altruism due to
   drought is much larger when the target of altruism is presented as a
   member of an antagonistic ethno-religious outgroup.},

Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are essential for carbon-neutral cities,

   neutrality requires city-led climate action plans that incorporate both

   particularly on commonly overlooked indirect pathways, for example,
   human behavioural interventions and resource savings. Assuming maximum
   theoretical implementation, NBS in the residential, transport and
   industrial sectors could reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25\%.
   Spatially prioritizing different types of NBS in 54 major European Union
   cities could reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions by on average 17.4\%.
   Coupling NBS with other existing measures in Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios could reduce total carbon emissions by
   57.3\% in 2030, with both indirect pathways and sequestration. Our
   results indicate that carbon neutrality will be near for some pioneering
   cities by 2030, while three can achieve it completely.
   Effective spatial allocation of the nature-based solutions is important
   for city mitigation through various pathways. This Analysis allocates
   prioritized urban nature-based solutions to major European cities and

Abstract = {Given that the global fleet of coal-fired power plants is mostly new,
   coal-biomass co-firing power plants with retrofitted carbon capture and
   storage (CBECCS) are regarded as a promising option for CO2 emissions
   reduction. However, the effectiveness of CBECCS remains largely
   unexplored. Here we develop a comprehensive assessment framework
   featuring a macro power system combined with spatially explicit biomass
   sources, coal-fired units and geological storage sites. We apply this
   framework to investigate the spatiotemporal deployment of CBECCS in
   China. The results indicate that a transition to CBECCS in 2025 could
   supply 0.97 GtCO(2) yr(-1) sequestration potential, with 90\% at a
   levelized cost between \$30 and \$50 tCO(2)(-1). A higher CO2 mitigation
   of 1.6 Gtyr(-1) could be achieved in 2040 by increasing the unit
   utilization hours, corresponding to a cumulative contribution of 41.2
   GtCO(2) over the period 2025-2060. This study provides a useful
   reference for transforming coal-dominated power systems.
   Coal-biomass co-firing power plants with retrofitted carbon capture and

   diminished by atmospheric feedbacks},

Abstract = {Simulations using land surface models suggest future increases in Arctic
   methane emissions to be limited by the thaw-induced drying of permafrost
   landscapes. Here we use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model to
   show that this constraint may be weaker than previously thought owing to
   compensatory atmospheric feedbacks. In two sets of extreme scenario
   simulations, a modification of the permafrost hydrology resulted in
   diverging hydroclimatic trajectories that, however, led to comparable
   methane fluxes. While a wet Arctic showed almost twice the wetland area
   compared with an increasingly dry Arctic, the latter featured greater
   substrate availability due to higher temperatures resulting from reduced
   evaporation, diminished cloudiness and more surface solar radiation.
   Given the limitations of present-day models and the potential model
   dependence of the atmospheric response, our results provide merely a
   qualitative estimation of these effects, but they suggest that
   atmospheric feedbacks play an important role in shaping future Arctic
   methane emissions.
   Future Arctic methane emissions may be less dependent on soil hydrology.
   Here, this study indicates that if the high latitudes maintain wet
   conditions, the cooling effects could limit the increase in methane,
   resulting in emissions similar to a warmer dry scenario with a higher
   substrate availability.},

Title = {Soil organic carbon stocks potentially at risk of decline with organic
   farming expansion},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 29},
Abstract = {The authors simulated the impact of organic farming expansion on soil
   organic carbon. They found that soil organic carbon stock may be at risk
   of decline if the complete conversion to organic farming does not
   involve additional practices such as widespread cover cropping and
   residue recycling.
   Organic farming is often considered a strategy that increases croplands'
   soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. However, organic farms currently occupy
   only a small fraction of cropland, and it is unclear how the full-scale
   expansion of organic farming will impact soil carbon inputs and SOC
   stocks. Here we use a spatially explicit biogeochemical model to show
   that the complete conversion of global cropland to organic farming
   without the use of cover crops and plant residue (normative scenario)
   will result in a 40\% reduction of global soil carbon input and 9\%
   decline in SOC stock. An optimal organic scenario that supports
   widespread cover cropping and enhanced residue recycling will reduce
   global soil carbon input by 31\%, and SOC can be preserved after 20 yr
   following conversion to organic farming. These results suggest that
   expanding organic farming might reduce the potential for soil carbon
   sequestration unless appropriate farming practices are implemented.},

Abstract = {Although Greenland is a hub for climate science, the climate perceptions
   of Greenland's predominantly Indigenous population have remained largely
   unstudied. Here we present two nationally representative surveys and
   show that Greenlanders are more likely than residents of top
   oil-producing Arctic countries to perceive that climate change is
   happening and about twice as likely to have personally experienced its
   effects. However, half are unaware that climate change is human-caused
   and those who are most affected appear to be least aware. Personal
   experience and awareness of human-induced climate change diverge along
   an Inuit cultural dimension. Indigenous identity positively predicts
   climate change experience, whereas subsistence occupation and no
   post-primary education negatively predict attribution beliefs. Despite
   Greenland's centrality to climate research, we uncover a gap between the
   scientific consensus and Kalaallit views of climate change, particularly
   among youth. This science-society gulf has implications for local
   climate adaptation, science communication and knowledge exchange between
   generations, institutions and communities.
   Greenland is at the heart of climate research, yet the related

Title = {Bioenergy-induced land-use-change emissions with sectorally fragmented
   policies},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Controlling bioenergy-induced land-use-change emissions is key to
   exploiting bioenergy for climate change mitigation. However, the effect
   of different land-use and energy sector policies on specific bioenergy
   emissions has not been studied so far. Using the global integrated
   assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE, we derive a biofuel emission factor (EF)
   for different policy frameworks. We find that a uniform price on
   emissions from both sectors keeps biofuel emissions at 12 kg CO2 GJ(-1).
   However, without land-use regulation, the EF increases substantially (64
   kg CO2 GJ(-1) over 80 years, 92 kg CO2 GJ(-1) over 30 years). We also
   find that comprehensive coverage (>90\%) of carbon-rich land areas
   worldwide is key to containing land-use emissions. Pricing emissions
   indirectly on the level of bioenergy consumption reduces total emissions
   by cutting bioenergy demand but fails to reduce the average EF. In the
   absence of comprehensive and timely land-use regulation, bioenergy thus
   may contribute less to climate change mitigation than assumed
   previously.
   Bioenergy has been widely viewed as an alternative for fossil fuels and
   an option for carbon dioxide removal, but there are doubts given the
   induced land-use changes. This study shows the importance of uniform
   regulation and comprehensive coverage of carbon-rich areas in reducing
   total emissions.},

Volume = {13},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Warming affects forest soil denitrification and nitrogen losses. The
   authors show that temperature enhances nitrous oxide and dinitrogen but
   varies by soil; temperature sensitivities are similar across soils but
   are higher for dinitrogen, suggesting complete denitrification in a
   warmer climate.
   Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2) emissions from
   denitrification are crucial to the nitrogen (N) cycle. However, the
   temperature sensitivities (Q(10)) of gaseous N losses in forest soils
   are poorly understood, with implications for prediction of N cycle
   responses to warming. Here, we quantify temperature sensitivities of
   denitrification-derived potential N2O and N-2 production. Using soils
   from 18 forest sites in China along a 4,000 km north-south transect we
   find that N2O and N-2 production rates increased with temperature, with
   large variations across soils. In contrast, the Q(10) values for N2O
   (2.1 \& PLUSMN; 0.5) and N-2 (2.6 \& PLUSMN; 0.6) were similar across
   soils. N-2 was more sensitive to temperature than N2O, suggesting that
   warming could promote complete denitrification. Moreover, the Q(10) for
   denitrification (2.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.5) was comparable to Q(10) for aquatic
   sediments. This finding of universal temperature sensitivity of gaseous
   N losses from denitrification will facilitate modelling N losses in
   response to warming globally.},

Abstract = {Increasing individual awareness could help communities better prepare

   The increasing impacts of climate change instigate the need for

   frontline of climate risks to be involved in planning and selecting
   strategies. Here we appraise a pilot process using participatory systems

   climate impacts and (2) context-relevant interventions to protect
   households and communities while (3) considering synergies and
   trade-offs with other socially desirable outcomes. We tested the pilot
   process in communities in the Lower Volta Basin in Ghana, the Assam
   region in India and Southern England. From participants' perspectives,
   the process increased awareness of and preparedness for climate change
   impacts and raised essential learning points for upscaling citizen-led

Abstract = {Genetic adaptation may be an important response to climate change, but
   limited examples of climate adaptation in wild populations exist.
   Comparing genetic data from historical bird specimens and contemporary
   individuals, the authors show shifts consistent with adaptation to
   climate change.
   To cope with climate change, species may shift their distributions or
   adapt in situ to changing environmental conditions. However, clear
   examples of genetic changes via adaptation are limited. We explore
   evolutionary responses to climate change in the endangered southwestern
   willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) through whole-genome
   comparisons between historical specimens, collected from 1888 to 1909
   near San Diego, California, United States, and contemporary individuals
   from across the breeding range. Genomic analyses revealed that
   introgression into San Diego increased adaptive potential over time and
   shifted genome-wide population structure towards that of neighbouring
   populations. In contrast, loci linked to climate (dew point temperature
   and precipitation) shifted away from neighbouring populations and in a
   direction consistent with adaptation to climate change in southern
   California. This research highlights the role of admixture in
   facilitating adaptive shifts through its impact on genome-wide genetic
   variation and represents one of the few studies to document climate
   adaptation in a wild population.},

Abstract = {Dense-water formation around Antarctica could be reduced as climate
   change alters sea-ice formation and circulation patterns. This study
   shows there has been an over 40\% reduction in dense-water formation in
   the Weddell Sea since 1992, which could affect global overturning
   circulation.
   Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is pivotal for oceanic heat and carbon
   sequestrations on multidecadal to millennial timescales. The Weddell Sea
   contributes nearly a half of global AABW through Weddell Sea Deep Water
   and denser underlying Weddell Sea Bottom Water that form on the
   continental shelves via sea-ice production. Here we report an observed
   30\% reduction of Weddell Sea Bottom Water volume since 1992, with the
   largest decrease in the densest classes. This is probably driven by a
   multidecadal reduction in dense-water production over southern
   continental shelf associated with a >40\% decline in the sea-ice
   formation rate. The ice production decrease is driven by northerly wind
   trend, related to a phase transition of the Interdecadal Pacific
   Oscillation since the early 1990s, superposed by Amundsen Sea Low
   intrinsic variability. These results reveal key influences on exported
   AABW to the Atlantic abyss and their sensitivity to large-scale,

Abstract = {The Arctic has been suggested to see seasonally ice-free conditions
   within two-to-three decades under high-emissions scenarios. However, the
   time of emergence of the first ice-free month remains uncertain due to a
   wide range of estimates for Arctic climate sensitivity to anthropogenic
   forcing. Here, we propose a recalibration of the sea ice and Greenland
   ice sheet response to climate change, based on the finding that the
   sensitivity of the Arctic cryosphere to atmospheric circulation in
   climate models substantially differs from the observed one. Assuming
   that Arctic climate sensitivity of models recalibrated by observations
   remains unchanged in coming decades, this approach yields a delay in the
   projected timing of the first September sea-ice-free Arctic and
   widespread Greenland melting of roughly a decade compared to the
   uncalibrated ensemble. This indicates the importance of accounting for
   the role of large-scale atmospheric forcing and circulation changes in
   Arctic climate change.
   When the Arctic will be seasonally sea ice free is highly uncertain.
   Here, the authors use the Arctic's response to atmospheric circulation
   to recalibrate models and show that sea-ice-free conditions are delayed
   by a decade compared to the original ensemble.},

Abstract = {Achieving global carbon neutrality will lead to a low-warming future and

   mitigation pathways can bring positive feedback that enhances and
   stabilizes solar and wind energy production.
   Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy provide carbon-free renewable
   energy to reach ambitious global carbon-neutrality goals, but their
   yields are in turn influenced by future climate change. Here, using a
   bias-corrected large ensemble of multi-model simulations under an
   envisioned post-pandemic green recovery, we find a general enhancement
   in solar PV over global land regions, especially in Asia, relative to
   the well-studied baseline scenario with modest climate change
   mitigation. Our results also show a notable west-to-east
   interhemispheric shift of wind energy by the mid-twenty-first century,
   under the two global carbon-neutral scenarios. Both solar PV and wind
   energy are projected to have a greater temporal stability in most land
   regions due to deep decarbonization. The co-benefits in enhancing and
   stabilizing renewable energy sources demonstrate a beneficial feedback
   in achieving global carbon neutrality and highlight Asian regions as a

   effective way to change both attitudes and behaviour around climate
   change.
   Modifying attitudes and behaviours related to climate change is
   difficult. Attempts to offer information, appeal to values and norms or
   enact policies have shown limited success. Here we examine whether
   participation in a climate prediction market can shift attitudes by
   having the market act as a non-partisan adjudicator and by prompting
   participants to put their `money where their mouth is'. Across two field
   studies, we show that betting on climate events alters: (1)
   participants' concern about climate change, (2) support for remedial
   climate action and (3) knowledge about climate issues. While the effects
   were dependent on participants' betting performance in Study 1, they
   were independent of betting outcomes in Study 2. Overall, our findings
   suggest that climate prediction markets could offer a promising path to
   changing people's climate-related attitudes and behaviour.},

Abstract = {Economists often dominate public climate policy discussions, such as
   those on the proper social discount rate and optimal climate pathways.
   This Article shows that philosophers, experts in underlying ethical
   matters, generally agree with economists but put more weight on various
   normative considerations.
   The estimated value to society from climate change mitigation is highly
   sensitive to the long-term social discount rate. Governmental
   discounting guidance has almost exclusively been influenced by
   economists, although it is not clear that they possess any special
   expertise on intergenerational ethics. Here, by contrast, we report the
   views of philosophers, who are the most trained in ethical matters. We
   show that, as a group, these experts offer strong support for a real
   social discount rate of 2\%, a value that is also predominantly backed
   by economists. We find multidisciplinary support for climate policy
   paths in line with the United Nations climate targets when views on
   discounting determinants are applied within a recent update of the DICE
   integrated assessment model. However, this apparent agreement hides
   important differences in views on how the ethics of intergenerational
   welfare can be better incorporated into climate policy evaluation.},

Abstract = {Antarctic bottom water (AABW), a key component of ocean circulation,
   provides oxygen to the deep ocean. This work shows that AABW transport
   reduced over the past decades in the Australian Antarctic Basin,
   weakening the abyssal overturning circulation and decreasing deep ocean
   oxygen.
   Dense water formed near Antarctica, known as Antarctic bottom water
   (AABW), drives deep ocean circulation and supplies oxygen to the abyssal
   ocean. Observations show that AABW has freshened and contracted since
   the 1960s, yet the drivers of these changes and their impact remain
   uncertain. Here, using observations from the Australian Antarctic Basin,
   we show that AABW transport reduced by 4.0 Sv between 1994 and 2009,
   during a period of strong freshening on the continental shelf. An
   increase in shelf water salinity between 2009 and 2018, previously
   linked to transient climate variability, drove a partial recovery (2.2
   Sv) of AABW transport. Over the full period (1994 to 2017), the net
   slowdown of -0.8 +/- 0.5 Sv decade(-1) thinned well-oxygenated layers,
   driving deoxygenation of -3 +/- 2 mu mol kg(-1) decade(-1). These
   findings demonstrate that freshening of Antarctic shelf waters weakens
   the lower limb of the abyssal overturning circulation and reduces deep
   ocean oxygen content.},

Title = {Very short-lived halogens amplify ozone depletion trends in the tropical
   lower stratosphere},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In contrast to the general stratospheric ozone recovery following
   international agreements, recent observations show an ongoing net ozone
   depletion in the tropical lower stratosphere (LS). This depletion is
   thought to be driven by dynamical transport accelerated by global
   warming, while chemical processes have been considered to be
   unimportant. Here we use a chemistry-climate model to demonstrate that
   halogenated ozone-depleting very short-lived substances (VSLS) chemistry
   may account for around a quarter of the observed tropical LS negative
   ozone trend in 1998-2018. VSLS sources include both natural and
   anthropogenic emissions. Future projections show the persistence of the
   currently unaccounted for contribution of VSLS to ozone loss throughout
   the twenty-first century in the tropical LS, the only region of the
   global stratosphere not projecting an ozone recovery by 2100. Our
   results show the need for mitigation strategies of anthropogenic VSLS
   emissions to preserve the present and future ozone layer in low
   latitudes.
   In contrast to the overall recovery of stratospheric ozone, ozone
   depletion in the tropical lower stratosphere has been ongoing over
   recent years. Here the authors show that currently unregulated
   halogenated ozone-depleting very short-lived substances play a key role
   in this ongoing depletion.},
