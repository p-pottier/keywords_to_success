Abstract = {Dinosaurs and pterosaurs have remarkable diversity and disparity through
   most of the Mesozoic Era1-3. Soon after their origins, these reptiles
   diversified into a number of long-lived lineages, evolved unprecedented
   ecologies (for example, flying, large herbivorous forms) and spread
   across Pangaea4,5. Recent discoveries of dinosaur and pterosaur
   precursors6-10 demonstrated that these animals were also speciose and
   widespread, but those precursors have few if any well-preserved skulls,
   hands and associated skeletons11,12. Here we present a well-preserved
   partial skeleton (Upper Triassic, Brazil) of the new lagerpetid
   Venetoraptor gassenae gen. et sp. nov. that offers a more comprehensive
   look into the skull and ecology of one of these precursors. Its skull
   has a sharp, raptorial-like beak, preceding that of dinosaurs by around
   80 million years, and a large hand with long, trenchant claws that
   firmly establishes the loss of obligatory quadrupedalism in these
   precursor lineages. Combining anatomical information of the new species
   with other dinosaur and pterosaur precursors shows that morphological
   disparity of precursors resembles that of Triassic pterosaurs and
   exceeds that of Triassic dinosaurs. Thus, the `success' of pterosaurs
   and dinosaurs was a result of differential survival among a broader pool
   of ecomorphological variation. Our results show that the morphological
   diversity of ornithodirans started to flourish among early-diverging
   lineages and not only after the origins of dinosaurs and pterosaurs.
   A well-preserved partial skeleton (Upper Triassic, Brazil) of the new
   lagerpetid Venetoraptor gassenae gen. et sp. nov. offers a more
   comprehensive look into the skull and ecology of dinosaur and pterosaur
   precursors.},

Title = {Future emergence of new ecosystems caused by glacial retreat},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {620},

Pages = {562+},

Abstract = {Glacier shrinkage and the development of post-glacial ecosystems related
   to anthropogenic climate change are some of the fastest ongoing
   ecosystem shifts, with marked ecological and societal cascading
   consequences(1-6). Yet, no complete spatial analysis exists, to our
   knowledge, to quantify or anticipate this important changeover(7,8).
   Here we show that by 2100, the decline of all glaciers outside the
   Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets may produce new terrestrial, marine
   and freshwater ecosystems over an area ranging from the size of Nepal
   (149,000 +/- 55,000 km2) to that of Finland (339,000 +/- 99,000 km2).
   Our analysis shows that the loss of glacier area will range from 22 +/-
   8\% to 51 +/- 15\%, depending on the climate scenario. In deglaciated
   areas, the emerging ecosystems will be characterized by extreme to mild
   ecological conditions, offering refuge for cold-adapted species or
   favouring primary productivity and generalist species. Exploring the
   future of glacierized areas highlights the importance of glaciers and
   emerging post-glacial ecosystems in the face of climate change,
   biodiversity loss and freshwater scarcity. We find that less than half
   of glacial areas are located in protected areas. Echoing the recent
   United Nations resolution declaring 2025 as the International Year of
   Glaciers' Preservation(9) and the Global Biodiversity Framework(10), we
   emphasize the need to urgently and simultaneously enhance climate-change
   mitigation and the in situ protection of these ecosystems to secure
   their existence, functioning and values.},

Title = {Coral reefs benefit from reduced land-sea impacts under ocean warming},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},

Number = {7979},
Pages = {536+},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are being fundamentally restructured by local
   human impacts and climate-driven marine heatwaves that trigger mass
   coral bleaching and mortality(1). Reducing local impacts can increase
   reef resistance to and recovery from bleaching(2). However, resource
   managers lack clear advice on targeted actions that best support coral
   reefs under climate change(3) and sector-based governance means most
   land- and sea-based management efforts remain siloed(4). Here we combine
   surveys of reef change with a unique 20-year time series of land-sea
   human impacts that encompassed an unprecedented marine heatwave in
   Hawai'i. Reefs with increased herbivorous fish populations and reduced
   land-based impacts, such as wastewater pollution and urban runoff, had
   positive coral cover trajectories predisturbance. These reefs also
   experienced a modest reduction in coral mortality following severe heat
   stress compared to reefs with reduced fish populations and enhanced
   land-based impacts. Scenario modelling indicated that simultaneously
   reducing land-sea human impacts results in a three- to sixfold greater
   probability of a reef having high reef-builder cover four years
   postdisturbance than if either occurred in isolation. International
   efforts to protect 30\% of Earth's land and ocean ecosystems by 2030 are
   underway(5). Our results reveal that integrated land-sea management
   could help achieve coastal ocean conservation goals and provide coral
   reefs with the best opportunity to persist in our changing climate.},

Title = {Intrinsic dopamine and acetylcholine dynamics in the striatum of mice},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {621},
Number = {7979},
Pages = {543+},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {External rewards such as food and money are potent modifiers of
   behaviour(1,2). Pioneering studies established that these salient
   sensory stimuli briefly interrupt the tonic discharge of neurons that
   produce the neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh):
   midbrain DA neurons (DANs) fire a burst of action potentials that
   broadly elevates DA in the striatum(3,4) at the same time that striatal
   cholinergic interneurons (CINs) produce a characteristic pause in
   firing(5,6). These phasic responses are thought to create unique,
   temporally limited conditions that motivate action and promote
   learning(7-11). However, the dynamics of DA and ACh outside explicitly
   rewarded situations remain poorly understood. Here we show that
   extracellular DA and ACh levels fluctuate spontaneously and periodically
   at a frequency of approximately 2 Hz in the dorsal striatum of mice and
   maintain the same temporal relationship relative to one another as that
   evoked by reward. We show that this neuromodulatory coordination does
   not arise from direct interactions between DA and ACh within the
   striatum. Instead, we provide evidence that periodic fluctuations in
   striatal DA are inherited from midbrain DANs, while striatal ACh
   transients are driven by glutamatergic inputs, which act to locally
   synchronize the spiking of CINs. Together, our findings show that
   striatal neuromodulatory dynamics are autonomously organized by
   distributed extra-striatal afferents. The dominance of intrinsic rhythms
   in DA and ACh offers new insights for explaining how reward-associated
   neural dynamics emerge and how the brain motivates action and promotes
   learning from within.},

Title = {The recovery of European freshwater biodiversity has come to a halt},

Abstract = {Owing to a long history of anthropogenic pressures, freshwater
   ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to biodiversity loss(1).
   Mitigation measures, including wastewater treatment and
   hydromorphological restoration, have aimed to improve environmental
   quality and foster the recovery of freshwater biodiversity(2). Here,
   using 1,816 time series of freshwater invertebrate communities collected
   across 22 European countries between 1968 and 2020, we quantified
   temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity and their
   responses to environmental pressures and gradients. We observed overall
   increases in taxon richness (0.73\% per year), functional richness
   (2.4\% per year) and abundance (1.17\% per year). However, these
   increases primarily occurred before the 2010s, and have since plateaued.
   Freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were
   less likely to experience recovery. Communities at sites with faster
   rates of warming had fewer gains in taxon richness, functional richness
   and abundance. Although biodiversity gains in the 1990s and 2000s
   probably reflect the effectiveness of water-quality improvements and
   restoration projects, the decelerating trajectory in the 2010s suggests
   that the current measures offer diminishing returns. Given new and
   persistent pressures on freshwater ecosystems, including emerging
   pollutants, climate change and the spread of invasive species, we call
   for additional mitigation to revive the recovery of freshwater
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Migratory songbirds have the remarkable ability to extract directional
   information from the Earth's magnetic field(1,2). The exact mechanism of
   this light-dependent magnetic compass sense, however, is not fully
   understood. The most promising hypothesis focuses on the quantum spin
   dynamics of transient radical pairs formed in cryptochrome proteins in
   the retina(3-5). Frustratingly, much of the supporting evidence for this
   theory is circumstantial, largely because of the extreme challenges
   posed by genetic modification of wild birds. Drosophila has therefore
   been recruited as a model organism, and several influential reports of
   cryptochrome-mediated magnetic field effects on fly behaviour have been
   widely interpreted as support for a radical pair-based mechanism in
   birds(6-23). Here we report the results of an extensive study testing
   magnetic field effects on 97,658 flies moving in a two-arm maze and on
   10,960 flies performing the spontaneous escape behaviour known as
   negative geotaxis. Under meticulously controlled conditions and with
   vast sample sizes, we have been unable to find evidence for magnetically
   sensitive behaviour in Drosophila. Moreover, after reassessment of the
   statistical approaches and sample sizes used in the studies that we
   tried to replicate, we suggest that many-if not all-of the original
   results were false positives. Our findings therefore cast considerable
   doubt on the existence of magnetic sensing in Drosophila and thus
   strongly suggest that night-migratory songbirds remain the organism of
   choice for elucidating the mechanism of light-dependent
   magnetoreception.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five years since foundational publications on valuing ecosystem
   services for human well-being(1,2), addressing the global biodiversity
   crisis(3) still implies confronting barriers to incorporating nature's
   diverse values into decision-making. These barriers include powerful
   interests supported by current norms and legal rules such as property
   rights, which determine whose values and which values of nature are
   acted on. A better understanding of how and why nature is (under)valued
   is more urgent than ever(4). Notwithstanding agreements to incorporate
   nature's values into actions, including the Kunming-Montreal Global
   Biodiversity Framework (GBF)(5) and the UN Sustainable Development
   Goals(6), predominant environmental and development policies still
   prioritize a subset of values, particularly those linked to markets, and
   ignore other ways people relate to and benefit from nature(7). Arguably,
   a `values crisis' underpins the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss
   and climate change(8), pandemic emergence(9) and socio-environmental
   injustices(10). On the basis of more than 50,000 scientific
   publications, policy documents and Indigenous and local knowledge
   sources, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
   Services (IPBES) assessed knowledge on nature's diverse values and
   valuation methods to gain insights into their role in policymaking and
   fuller integration into decisions(7,11). Applying this evidence,
   combinations of values-centred approaches are proposed to improve
   valuation and address barriers to uptake, ultimately leveraging
   transformative changes towards more just (that is, fair treatment of
   people and nature, including inter- and intragenerational equity) and
   sustainable futures.},

Title = {Fennoscandian tree-ring anatomy shows a warmer modern than medieval

Abstract = {Earth system models and various climate proxy sources indicate global
   warming is unprecedented during at least the Common Era(1). However,
   tree-ring proxies often estimate temperatures during the Medieval
   Climate Anomaly (950-1250 ce) that are similar to, or exceed, those
   recorded for the past century(2,3), in contrast to simulation
   experiments at regional scales(4). This not only calls into question the
   reliability of models and proxies but also contributes to uncertainty in
   future climate projections(5). Here we show that the current climate of
   the Fennoscandian Peninsula is substantially warmer than that of the
   medieval period. This highlights the dominant role of anthropogenic
   forcing in climate warming even at the regional scale, thereby
   reconciling inconsistencies between reconstructions and model
   simulations. We used an annually resolved 1,170-year-long tree-ring

Abstract = {Einkorn (Triticum monococcum) was the first domesticated wheat species,
   and was central to the birth of agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution
   in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago(1,2). Here we generate
   and analyse 5.2-Gb genome assemblies for wild and domesticated einkorn,
   including completely assembled centromeres. Einkorn centromeres are
   highly dynamic, showing evidence of ancient and recent centromere shifts
   caused by structural rearrangements. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of
   a diversity panel uncovered the population structure and evolutionary
   history of einkorn, revealing complex patterns of hybridizations and
   introgressions after the dispersal of domesticated einkorn from the
   Fertile Crescent. We also show that around 1\% of the modern bread wheat
   (Triticum aestivum) A subgenome originates from einkorn. These resources
   and findings highlight the history of einkorn evolution and provide a
   basis to accelerate the genomics-assisted improvement of einkorn and
   bread wheat.},

Title = {A heavyweight early whale pushes the boundaries of vertebrate morphology},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {620},
Number = {7975},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The fossil record of cetaceans documents how terrestrial animals
   acquired extreme adaptations and transitioned to a fully aquatic
   lifestyle(1,2). In whales, this is associated with a substantial
   increase in maximum body size. Although an elongate body was acquired
   early in cetacean evolution(3), the maximum body mass of baleen whales
   reflects a recent diversification that culminated in the blue whale(4).
   More generally, hitherto known gigantism among aquatic tetrapods evolved
   within pelagic, active swimmers. Here we describe Perucetus colossus-a
   basilosaurid whale from the middle Eocene epoch of Peru. It displays, to
   our knowledge, the highest degree of bone mass increase known to date,
   an adaptation associated with shallow diving(5). The estimated skeletal
   mass of P. colossus exceeds that of any known mammal or aquatic
   vertebrate. We show that the bone structure specializations of aquatic
   mammals are reflected in the scaling of skeletal fraction (skeletal mass
   versus whole-body mass) across the entire disparity of amniotes. We use
   the skeletal fraction to estimate the body mass of P. colossus, which
   proves to be a contender for the title of heaviest animal on record.
   Cetacean peak body mass had already been reached around 30 million years
   before previously assumed, in a coastal context in which primary
   productivity was particularly high.},

Abstract = {Wildlife trade is a multibillion-dollar industry(1) targeting a
   hyperdiversity of species(2) and can contribute to major declines in
   abundance(3). A key question is understanding the global hotspots of
   wildlife trade for phylogenetic (PD) and functional (FD) diversity,
   which underpin the conservation of evolutionary history(4), ecological
   functions(5) and ecosystem services benefiting humankind(6). Using a
   global dataset of traded bird and mammal species, we identify that the
   highest levels of traded PD and FD are from tropical regions, where high
   numbers of evolutionary distinct and globally endangered species in
   trade occur. The standardized effect size (ses) of traded PD and FD also
   shows strong tropical epicentres, with additional hotspots of mammalian
   ses.PD in the eastern United States and ses.FD in Europe. Large-bodied,
   frugivorous and canopy-dwelling birds and large-bodied mammals are more
   likely to be traded whereas insectivorous birds and diurnally foraging
   mammals are less likely. Where trade drives localized extinctions(3),
   our results suggest substantial losses of unique evolutionary lineages
   and functional traits, with possible cascading effects for communities
   and ecosystems(5,7). Avoiding unsustainable exploitation and lost
   community integrity requires targeted conservation efforts, especially
   in hotspots of traded phylogenetic and functional diversity.},

Abstract = {Social anthropology and ethnographic studies have described kinship
   systems and networks of contact and exchange in extant populations(1-4).
   However, for prehistoric societies, these systems can be studied only
   indirectly from biological and cultural remains. Stable isotope data,
   sex and age at death can provide insights into the demographic structure
   of a burial community and identify local versus non-local childhood
   signatures, archaeogenetic data can reconstruct the biological
   relationships between individuals, which enables the reconstruction of
   pedigrees, and combined evidence informs on kinship practices and
   residence patterns in prehistoric societies. Here we report ancient DNA,
   strontium isotope and contextual data from more than 100 individuals
   from the site Gurgy `les Noisats' (France), dated to the western
   European Neolithic around 4850-4500 bc. We find that this burial
   community was genetically connected by two main pedigrees, spanning
   seven generations, that were patrilocal and patrilineal, with evidence
   for female exogamy and exchange with genetically close neighbouring
   groups. The microdemographic structure of individuals linked and
   unlinked to the pedigrees reveals additional information about the
   social structure, living conditions and site occupation. The absence of
   half-siblings and the high number of adult full siblings suggest that
   there were stable health conditions and a supportive social network,
   facilitating high fertility and low mortality(5). Age-structure
   differences and strontium isotope results by generation indicate that
   the site was used for just a few decades, providing new insights into
   shifting sedentary farming practices during the European Neolithic.},

Abstract = {The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is where buildings and wildland
   vegetation meet or intermingle(1,2). It is where human-environmental
   conflicts and risks can be concentrated, including the loss of houses
   and lives to wildfire, habitat loss and fragmentation and the spread of
   zoonotic diseases(3). However, a global analysis of the WUI has been
   lacking. Here, we present a global map of the 2020 WUI at 10 m
   resolution using a globally consistent and validated approach based on
   remote sensing-derived datasets of building area(4) and wildland
   vegetation(5). We show that the WUI is a global phenomenon, identify
   many previously undocumented WUI hotspots and highlight the wide range
   of population density, land cover types and biomass levels in different
   parts of the global WUI. The WUI covers only 4.7\% of the land surface
   but is home to nearly half its population (3.5 billion). The WUI is
   especially widespread in Europe (15\% of the land area) and the
   temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome (18\%). Of all people living
   near 2003-2020 wildfires (0.4 billion), two thirds have their home in
   the WUI, most of them in Africa (150 million). Given that wildfire
   activity is predicted to increase because of climate change in many
   regions(6), there is a need to understand housing growth and vegetation
   patterns as drivers of WUI change.},

Abstract = {Human-specific genomic changes contribute to the unique functionalities
   of the human brain(1-5). The cellular heterogeneity of the human
   brain(6,7) and the complex regulation of gene expression highlight the
   need to characterize human-specific molecular features at cellular
   resolution. Here we analysed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and
   single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with
   sequencing datasets for human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque brain
   tissue from posterior cingulate cortex. We show a human-specific
   increase of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and a decrease of mature
   oligodendrocytes across cortical tissues. Human-specific regulatory
   changes were accelerated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and we
   highlight key biological pathways that may be associated with the
   proportional changes. We also identify human-specific regulatory changes
   in neuronal subtypes, which reveal human-specific upregulation of FOXP2
   in only two of the neuronal subtypes. We additionally identify hundreds
   of new human accelerated genomic regions associated with human-specific
   chromatin accessibility changes. Our data also reveal that FOS::JUN and
   FOX motifs are enriched in the human-specifically accessible chromatin
   regions of excitatory neuronal subtypes. Together, our results reveal
   several new mechanisms underlying the evolutionary innovation of human
   brain at cell-type resolution.},

Title = {Indirect effects shape species fitness in coevolved mutualistic networks},
Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {Ecological interactions are one of the main forces that sustain Earth's
   biodiversity. A major challenge for studies of ecology and evolution is
   to determine how these interactions affect the fitness of species when
   we expand from studying isolated, pairwise interactions to include
   networks of interacting species1-4. In networks, chains of effects
   caused by a range of species have an indirect effect on other species
   they do not interact with directly, potentially affecting the fitness
   outcomes of a variety of ecological interactions (such as mutualism)5-7.
   Here we apply analytical techniques and numerical simulations to 186
   empirical mutualistic networks and show how both direct and indirect
   effects alter the fitness of species coevolving in these networks.
   Although the fitness of species usually increased with the number of
   mutualistic partners, most of the fitness variation across species was
   driven by indirect effects. We found that these indirect effects prevent
   coevolving species from adapting to their mutualistic partners and to
   other sources of selection pressure in the environment, thereby
   decreasing their fitness. Such decreases are distributed in a
   predictable way within networks: peripheral species receive more
   indirect effects and experience higher reductions in fitness than
   central species. This topological effect was also evident when we
   analysed an empirical study of an invasion of pollination networks by
   honeybees. As honeybees became integrated as a central species within
   networks, they increased the contribution of indirect effects on several
   other species, reducing their fitness. Our study shows how and why
   indirect effects can govern the adaptive landscape of species-rich
   mutualistic assemblages.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are losing the capacity to sustain their biological
   functions(1). In addition to other well-known stressors, such as
   climatic change and overfishing(1), plastic pollution is an emerging
   threat to coral reefs, spreading throughout reef food webs(2), and
   increasing disease transmission and structural damage to reef
   organisms(3). Although recognized as a global concern(4), the
   distribution and quantity of plastics trapped in the world's coral reefs
   remains uncertain(3). Here we survey 84 shallow and deep coral
   ecosystems at 25 locations across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian ocean
   basins for anthropogenic macrodebris (pollution by human-generated
   objects larger than 5 centimetres, including plastics), performing 1,231
   transects. Our results show anthropogenic debris in 77 out of the 84
   reefs surveyed, including in some of Earth's most remote and
   near-pristine reefs, such as in uninhabited central Pacific atolls.
   Macroplastics represent 88\% of the anthropogenic debris, and, like
   other debris types, peak in deeper reefs (mesophotic zones at 30-150
   metres depth), with fishing activities as the main source of plastics in
   most areas. These findings contrast with the global pattern observed in
   other nearshore marine ecosystems, where macroplastic densities decrease
   with depth and are dominated by consumer items(5). As the world moves
   towards a global treaty to tackle plastic pollution(6), understanding
   its distribution and drivers provides key information to help to design
   the strategies needed to address this ubiquitous threat.},

Title = {Assembly of functional diversity in an oceanic island flora},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Oceanic island floras are well known for their morphological
   peculiarities and exhibit striking examples of trait evolution(1-3).
   These morphological shifts are commonly attributed to insularity and are
   thought to be shaped by the biogeographical processes and evolutionary
   histories of oceanic islands(2,4). However, the mechanisms through which
   biogeography and evolution have shaped the distribution and diversity of
   plant functional traits remain unclear5. Here we describe the functional
   trait space of the native flora of an oceanic island (Tenerife, Canary
   Islands, Spain) using extensive field and laboratory measurements, and
   relate it to global trade-offs in ecological strategies. We find that
   the island trait space exhibits a remarkable functional richness but
   that most plants are concentrated around a functional hotspot dominated
   by shrubs with a conservative life-history strategy. By dividing the
   island flora into species groups associated with distinct
   biogeographical distributions and diversification histories, our results
   also suggest that colonization via long-distance dispersal and the
   interplay between inter-island dispersal and archipelago-level
   speciation processes drive functional divergence and trait space
   expansion. Contrary to our expectations, speciation via cladogenesis has
   led to functional convergence, and therefore only contributes marginally
   to functional diversity by densely packing trait space around shrubs. By
   combining biogeography, ecology and evolution, our approach opens new
   avenues for trait-based insights into how dispersal, speciation and
   persistence shape the assembly of entire native island floras.},

Title = {Evolution of a minimal cell},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {620},
Number = {7972},
Pages = {122+},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Possessing only essential genes, a minimal cell can reveal mechanisms
   and processes that are critical for the persistence and stability of
   life(1,2). Here we report on how an engineered minimal cell(3,4)
   contends with the forces of evolution compared with the Mycoplasma
   mycoides non-minimal cell from which it was synthetically derived.
   Mutation rates were the highest among all reported bacteria, but were
   not affected by genome minimization. Genome streamlining was costly,
   leading to a decrease in fitness of greater than 50\%, but this deficit
   was regained during 2,000 generations of evolution. Despite selection
   acting on distinct genetic targets, increases in the maximum growth rate
   of the synthetic cells were comparable. Moreover, when performance was
   assessed by relative fitness, the minimal cell evolved 39\% faster than
   the non-minimal cell. The only apparent constraint involved the
   evolution of cell size. The size of the non-minimal cell increased by
   80\%, whereas the minimal cell remained the same. This pattern reflected
   epistatic effects of mutations in ftsZ, which encodes a
   tubulin-homologue protein that regulates cell division and
   morphology(5,6). Our findings demonstrate that natural selection can
   rapidly increase the fitness of one of the simplest autonomously growing
   organisms. Understanding how species with small genomes overcome
   evolutionary challenges provides critical insights into the persistence
   of host-associated endosymbionts, the stability of streamlined chassis
   for biotechnology and the targeted refinement of synthetically
   engineered cells(2,7-9).},

Abstract = {Many cephalopods escape detection using camouflage(1). This behaviour
   relies on a visual assessment of the surroundings, on an interpretation
   of visual-texture statistics(2-4) and on matching these statistics using
   millions of skin chromatophores that are controlled by motoneurons
   located in the brain(5-7). Analysis of cuttlefish images proposed that
   camouflage patterns are low dimensional and categorizable into three
   pattern classes, built from a small repertoire of components(8-11).
   Behavioural experiments also indicated that, although camouflage
   requires vision, its execution does not require feedback(5,12,13),
   suggesting that motion within skin-pattern space is stereotyped and
   lacks the possibility of correction. Here, using quantitative
   methods(14), we studied camouflage in the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis
   as behavioural motion towards background matching in skin-pattern space.
   An analysis of hundreds of thousands of images over natural and
   artificial backgrounds revealed that the space of skin patterns is
   high-dimensional and that pattern matching is not stereotypedeach search
   meanders through skin-pattern space, decelerating and accelerating
   repeatedly before stabilizing. Chromatophores could be grouped into
   pattern components on the basis of their covariation during
   camouflaging. These components varied in shapes and sizes, and overlay
   one another. However, their identities varied even across transitions
   between identical skin-pattern pairs, indicating flexibility of
   implementation and absence of stereotypy. Components could also be
   differentiated by their sensitivity to spatial frequency. Finally, we
   compared camouflage to blanching, a skin-lightening reaction to
   threatening stimuli. Pattern motion during blanching was direct and
   fast, consistent with open-loop motion in low-dimensional pattern space,
   in contrast to that observed during camouflage.},

Title = {A tripartite rheostat controls self-regulated host plant resistance to

Abstract = {Plants deploy receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich
   repeat receptors to confer host plant resistance (HPR) to herbivores1.
   These gene-for-gene interactions between insects and their hosts have
   been proposed for more than 50 years2. However, the molecular and
   cellular mechanisms that underlie HPR have been elusive, as the identity
   and sensing mechanisms of insect avirulence effectors have remained
   unknown. Here we identify an insect salivary protein perceived by a
   plant immune receptor. The BPH14-interacting salivary protein (BISP)
   from the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) is secreted into
   rice (Oryza sativa) during feeding. In susceptible plants, BISP targets
   O. satvia RLCK185 (OsRLCK185; hereafter Os is used to denote O.
   satvia-related proteins or genes) to suppress basal defences. In
   resistant plants, the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor
   BPH14 directly binds BISP to activate HPR. Constitutive activation of
   Bph14-mediated immunity is detrimental to plant growth and productivity.
   The fine-tuning of Bph14-mediated HPR is achieved through direct binding
   of BISP and BPH14 to the selective autophagy cargo receptor OsNBR1,
   which delivers BISP to OsATG8 for degradation. Autophagy therefore
   controls BISP levels. In Bph14 plants, autophagy restores cellular
   homeostasis by downregulating HPR when feeding by brown planthoppers
   ceases. We identify an insect saliva protein sensed by a plant immune
   receptor and discover a three-way interaction system that offers
   opportunities for developing high-yield, insect-resistant crops.},

Abstract = {In the ongoing debates about eukaryogenesis-the series of evolutionary
   events leading to the emergence of the eukaryotic cell from prokaryotic
   ancestors-members of the Asgard archaea play a key part as the closest
   archaeal relatives of eukaryotes(1). However, the nature and
   phylogenetic identity of the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea and
   eukaryotes remain unresolved(2-4). Here we analyse distinct phylogenetic
   marker datasets of an expanded genomic sampling of Asgard archaea and
   evaluate competing evolutionary scenarios using state-of-the-art
   phylogenomic approaches. We find that eukaryotes are placed, with high
   confidence, as a well-nested clade within Asgard archaea and as a sister
   lineage to Hodarchaeales, a newly proposed order within
   Heimdallarchaeia. Using sophisticated gene tree and species tree
   reconciliation approaches, we show that analogous to the evolution of
   eukaryotic genomes, genome evolution in Asgard archaea involved
   significantly more gene duplication and fewer gene loss events compared
   with other archaea. Finally, we infer that the last common ancestor of
   Asgard archaea was probably a thermophilic chemolithotroph and that the
   lineage from which eukaryotes evolved adapted to mesophilic conditions
   and acquired the genetic potential to support a heterotrophic lifestyle.
   Our work provides key insights into the prokaryote-to-eukaryote
   transition and a platform for better understanding the emergence of
   cellular complexity in eukaryotic cells.},

Abstract = {A central goal in ecology is to understand what maintains species
   diversity in local communities. Classic ecological theory(1,2) posits
   that niches dictate the maximum number of species that can coexist in a
   community and that the richness of observed species will be below this
   maximum only where immigration is very low. A new alternative
   theory(3,4) is that niches, instead, dictate the minimum number of
   coexisting species and that the richness of observed species will
   usually be well above this because of ongoing immigration. We conducted
   an experimental test to discriminate between these two unified theories
   using a manipulative field experiment with tropical intertidal
   communities. We found, consistent with the new theory, that the
   relationship of species richness to immigration rate stabilized at a low
   value at low immigration rates and did not saturate at high immigration
   rates. Our results suggest that tropical intertidal communities have low
   niche diversity and are typically in a dispersal-assembled regime where
   immigration is high enough to overfill the niches. Observational data
   from other studies(3,5) suggest that these conclusions may generalize to
   other ecological systems. Our new experimental approach can be adapted
   for other systems and be used as a `niche detector' and a tool for
   assessing when communities are niche versus dispersal assembled.},

Abstract = {Life history, the schedule of when and how fast organisms grow, die and
   reproduce, is a critical axis along which species differ from each
   other1-4. In parallel, competition is a fundamental mechanism that
   determines the potential for species coexistence(5-8). Previous models
   of stochastic competition have demonstrated that large numbers of
   species can persist over long timescales, even when competing for a
   single common resource(9-12), but how life history differences between
   species increase or decrease the possibility of coexistence and,
   conversely, whether competition constrains what combinations of life
   history strategies complement each other remain open questions. Here we
   show that specific combinations of life history strategy optimize the
   persistence times of species competing for a single resource before one
   species overtakes its competitors. This suggests that co-occurring
   species would tend to have such complementary life history strategies,
   which we demonstrate using empirical data for perennial plants.},

Title = {Antagonistic circuits mediating infanticide and maternal care in female
   mice},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {618},

Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {In many species, including mice, female animals show markedly different
   pup-directed behaviours based on their reproductive state(1,2). Naive
   wild female mice often kill pups, while lactating female mice are
   dedicated to pup caring(3,4). The neural mechanisms that mediate
   infanticide and its switch to maternal behaviours during motherhood
   remain unclear. Here, on the basis of the hypothesis that maternal and
   infanticidal behaviours are supported by distinct and competing neural
   circuits(5,6), we use the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a key site for
   maternal behaviours(7-11), as a starting point and identify three
   MPOA-connected brain regions that drive differential negative
   pup-directed behaviours. Functional manipulation and in vivo recording
   reveal that oestrogen receptor a (ESR1)-expressing cells in the
   principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNSTpr(ESR1))
   are necessary, sufficient and naturally activated during infanticide in
   female mice. MPOA(ESR1) and BNSTpr(ESR1) neurons form reciprocal
   inhibition to control the balance between positive and negative
   infant-directed behaviours. During motherhood, MPOA(ESR1) and
   BNSTpr(ESR1) cells change their excitability in opposite directions,
   supporting a marked switch of female behaviours towards the young.},

Title = {Ancient gene linkages support ctenophores as sister to other animals},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {618},
Number = {7963},
Pages = {110+},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {A central question in evolutionary biology is whether sponges or
   ctenophores (comb jellies) are the sister group to all other animals.
   These alternative phylogenetic hypotheses imply different scenarios for
   the evolution of complex neural systems and other animal-specific
   traits(1-6). Conventional phylogenetic approaches based on morphological
   characters and increasingly extensive gene sequence collections have not
   been able to definitively answer this question(7-11). Here we develop
   chromosome-scale gene linkage, also known as synteny, as a phylogenetic
   character for resolving this question(12). We report new
   chromosome-scale genomes for a ctenophore and two marine sponges, and
   for three unicellular relatives of animals (a choanoflagellate, a
   filasterean amoeba and an ichthyosporean) that serve as outgroups for
   phylogenetic analysis. We find ancient syntenies that are conserved
   between animals and their close unicellular relatives. Ctenophores and
   unicellular eukaryotes share ancestral metazoan patterns, whereas
   sponges, bilaterians, and cnidarians share derived chromosomal
   rearrangements. Conserved syntenic characters unite sponges with
   bilaterians, cnidarians, and placozoans in a monophyletic clade to the
   exclusion of ctenophores, placing ctenophores as the sister group to all
   other animals. The patterns of synteny shared by sponges, bilaterians,
   and cnidarians are the result of rare and irreversible chromosome
   fusion-and-mixing events that provide robust and unambiguous
   phylogenetic support for the ctenophore-sister hypothesis. These
   findings provide a new framework for resolving deep, recalcitrant
   phylogenetic problems and have implications for our understanding of
   animal evolution.},
