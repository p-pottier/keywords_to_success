Title = {Carbon balance of plywood from a social reforestation program in
   Indonesia},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Social reforestation programs plant trees on degraded, uncultivated land
   in low-income regions to allow the local population to generate income
   from selling wood products and-in case of agroforestry systems-to grow
   food. For fundraising it is of interest to demonstrate not only positive
   social impacts but also environmental ones. Proving negative greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions would allow the programs to enter the market for
   carbon offsetting projects and liberate further funding. In a case
   study, a social reforestation program in Kalimantan, Indonesia, is
   analyzed. GHG emissions (according to ISO 14067, PAS 2050 and EU ILCD
   Handbook for LCA) of the main product, laminated veneer lumber plywood,
   are determined as 622 and 21 kg CO2-e/m(3) for short-term and long-term
   (above 100 years) plywood use, respectively. Switching to lignin-based
   resins and renewable electricity could reduce emissions down to - 363 kg
   CO2-e/m(3) for long-term use. The analyzed agroforestry system produces
   almost carbon-neutral plywood today and could be climate positive in the
   mid-term.},

   EWMA statistic with application to wheat production},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {The extended exponential weighted moving average (EEWMA) statistic is a
   memory type statistic that uses past observations along with the current
   information for the estimation of a population parameter to improve the
   efficiency of the estimators. This study utilized the EEWMA statistic to
   estimate the population mean with a suitable auxiliary variable. The
   ratio and product estimators are proposed for the surveys that are
   time-based by using current information along with that information. The
   approximate mean square errors are computed for the proposed memory type
   estimators and mathematical comparison is discussed to demonstrate the
   efficiency of the estimator. The simulation study was carried out to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed memory type estimators. It can
   be seen from the results that the efficiency of the estimator enhances
   by utilizing the current sample as well as past information. A real-life
   example is presented to illustrate the usage of proposed estimators.},

Title = {Land use and land cover (LULC) performance modeling using machine
   learning algorithms: a case study of the city of Melbourne, Australia},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Accurate spatial information on Land use and land cover (LULC) plays a
   crucial role in city planning. A widely used method of obtaining
   accurate LULC maps is a classification of the categories, which is one
   of the challenging problems. Attempts have been made considering
   spectral (Sp), statistical (St), and index-based (Ind) features in
   developing LULC maps for city planning. However, no work has been
   reported to automate LULC performance modeling for their robustness with
   machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this paper, we design seven schemes
   and automate the LULC performance modeling with six ML algorithms-Random
   Forest, Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel, Support Vector
   Machine with Radial basis function kernel, Artificial Neural Network,
   Naive Bayes, and Generalised Linear Model for the city of Melbourne,
   Australia on Sentinel-2A images. Experimental results show that the
   Random Forest outperforms remaining ML algorithms in the classification
   accuracy (0.99) on all schemes. The robustness and statistical analysis
   of the ML algorithms (for example, Random Forest imparts over 0.99
   F1-score for all five categories and p value =0.05 from Wilcoxon ranked
   test over accuracy measures) against varying training splits demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Thus, providing a robust
   measure of LULC maps in city planning.},

Title = {Statistical parametric and non-parametric control charts for monitoring
   residential water consumption},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {The adoption of strategies for monitoring water consumption is essential
   for water resources management, contributing to the promotion of the
   sustainability in the water sector. Statistical process control (SPC)
   charts, which are widely used in the industrial sector, are statistical
   methods developed to improve the quality of products and processes. The
   application of this method has reached other areas over the last decades
   and has recently been identified as an option for environmental
   monitoring. In this context, the application of SPC charts emerges as an
   option for water consumption monitoring, whether in a building or an
   urban scale. Thus, this article aims to analyze the application of
   statistical process control charts in the monitoring of water
   consumption of two housing compounds in Joinville, southern Brazil. The
   methodological procedures include the use of the Shewhart and the EWMA
   control charts in addition to the non-parametric alternative, the
   EWMA-SN, assessing the effectiveness of these techniques in detecting
   water leaks in residential apartment buildings. The data sets, obtained
   through a telemetry metering system from the water utility, represent a
   period of 243 days. The results show that control charts are a powerful
   tool in identifying changes in water consumption patterns, with the EWMA
   chart flagging the leaks sooner.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {It is important to evaluate the slope ecological restoration effect for
   diagnosing the slope restoration state in time. Several soft computing
   methods require experts to determine the index weight, which will affect
   the rationality of the evaluation results. Moreover, they are all static
   evaluation methods and cannot reflect the time effect of restoration.
   Therefore, a dynamic evaluation method has been proposed without
   determining the index weight based on Cosine Similarity and Markov
   Chain. Several cases were applied to prove the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. The results presented that the results of this method
   are more consistent with the actual situations and can reflect the
   variability of the restoration effect. Finally, the sensitivity of
   indexes under different ecological restoration methods was analyzed. The
   results show that the core link of the restoration method was consistent
   with the sensitivity result. The proposed method provides a basis for
   optimizing the restoration methods.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Chitinase-producing fungi have now engrossed attention as one of the
   potential agents for the control of insect pests. Entomopathogenic fungi
   are used in different regions of the world to control economically
   important insects. However, the role of fungal chitinases are not well
   studied in their infection mechanism to insects. In this study,
   Chitinase of entomopathogenic fungi Trichoderma longibrachiatum was
   evaluated to control Aphis gossypii. For this purpose, fungal chitinase
   (Chit1) gene from the genomic DNA of T. longibrachiatum were isolated,
   amplified and characterised. Genomic analysis of the amplified Chit1
   showed that this gene has homology to family 18 of glycosyl hydrolyses.
   Further, Chit1 was expressed in the cotton plant for transient
   expression through the Geminivirus-mediated gene silencing vector
   derived from Cotton Leaf Crumple Virus (CLCrV). Transformed cotton
   plants showed greater chitinase activity than control, and they were
   resistant against nymphs and adults of A. gossypii. About 38.75\% and
   21.67\% mortality of both nymphs and adults, respectively, were observed
   by using Chit1 of T. longibrachiatum. It is concluded that T.
   longibrachiatum showed promising results in controlling aphids by
   producing fungal chitinase in cotton plants and could be used as an
   effective method in the future.},

Abstract = {Soil salinity adversely limits crop and soil health, and this can be
   reversed by cropping systems where species exclude salts and activate
   microbial nutrient cycling. A randomized complete block design
   experiment was established in Laayoune-Morocco to evaluate the influence
   of irrigated grass pea and barley monocrops or combined together in
   50-50\% and 70-30\% mixtures against soil salinity and CO2-C flux in
   sites with varying salinity. Site by treatment interaction significantly
   influenced (p < 0.05) soil salinity and CO2-C flux. Salinity reduced by
   37 to 68 dS m(-1) in highly saline soils across season regardless of
   treatment and barley monocrop retained the least salinity (15 dS m(-1)).
   Same applied to sites with low (1 to 2 dS m(-1)) and medium (2 to 5 dS
   m(-1)) salinity although less pronounced. The 70-30\% grass pea, barley
   mixture maintained the greatest CO2-C flux in soils with low salinity
   and marginally enhancing soil active carbon (130 to 229 mg kg(-1) soil)
   in different sites. Increasingly saline water filled pore space
   devastated CO2-C flux, although this process recovered under barley at
   extreme salinity. Overall, barley in mixture with grass pea can
   alleviate salinity and accelerate microbial carbon sequestration if
   irrigation is modulated in shallow desertic soils.},

Title = {Effects of plant growth regulators and sucrose on proliferation and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Embryogenic tissue (ET) is important for genetic modification and plant
   re-generation. The proliferation ability and vigor of ET are crucial for
   plant propagation via somatic embryogenesis. In this study, ET was
   induced from mature zygotic embryos in blue spruce (Picea pungens
   Engelm.). There were significant differences in ET induction between two
   provenances, i.e. 78.8 \& PLUSMN; 12.5\% and 62.50 \& PLUSMN; 12.8\%
   respectively. Effects of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D),
   6-Benzyl amino-purine (6-BA) and/or sucrose on ET proliferation and
   somatic embryo (SE) maturation were further investigated with four cell
   lines. The highest ET proliferation rate reached 1473.7 \& PLUSMN;
   556.0\% biweekly. Concentrations of 2,4-D or 6-BA applied at tissue
   proliferation stage impacted SE maturation among the cell lines, whereas
   sucrose showed less effects. The highest rate, 408 \& PLUSMN; 230 mature
   SEs/g FW, was achieved in SE maturation cultures. This research
   demonstrated that the culture conditions, i.e. the specific

Title = {Evaluation of secondary sexual dimorphism of the dioecious <i>Amaranthus
   palmeri</i> under abiotic stress},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The evolution of secondary sex-specific traits of dioecious species
   under abiotic stress conditions has received limited research,
   especially in the case of Amaranthus palmeri, a fast adapting and highly
   competing plant. Here, we have examined the interactive effects of
   abiotic stress on mineral accumulation, chlorophyll a and b content, and
   the operating capacity of Photosystem II (PSII) in both male and female
   A. palmeri plants grown under three different intensities of white
   light, and under N, K or P deficiency. Mineral profiling of the leaves
   and stems (with inflorescence) highlighted intra- and intersexual
   differences in their accumulation pattern and mineral associations.
   Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were different between the male and the
   female plants, being slightly lower in the latter, at high light
   intensity towards maturity, or under K or P deficiency. Further, slight,
   although statistically significant differences were recorded in the
   chlorophyll a/b ratio, which was lower at the higher light intensity in
   the female, over that in the male, plants towards maturity. Chlorophyll
   fluorescence parameters, i.e., steady state and maximum fluorescence
   increased under high light intensity, whereas the PSII operating
   efficiency decreased in the female plants, indicating reduced PSII
   capacity. Sex-specific differences in A. palmeri showed a differential
   response to stressful conditions because of differences in their
   ontogeny and physiology, and possibly due to the cost of reproduction.
   We suggest that the breeding system of dioecious species has weaknesses
   that can be used for the ecological management of dioecious weeds
   without relying on the use of herbicides.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Significant pathogens that have resurfaced in humans originate from
   transmission from animal to human populations. In the Americas, yellow
   fever cases in humans are usually associated with spillover from
   non-human primates via mosquitoes. The present study characterized the
   prevalence of the yellow fever vector Haemagogus leucocelaenus in Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil. The Atlantic Forest fragment chosen is an area of
   translocation of the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), where
   10 ovitraps were installed to collect mosquito eggs in Fazenda Tres
   Irmaos, at Silva Jardim city, from March 2020 to October 2022. A total
   of 1514 eggs were collected, of which 1153 were viable; 50\% belonged to
   medically important mosquito species and 24\% to the yellow fever vector
   species, Hg. leucocelaenus. The months of December 2020 (n = 252),
   November 2021 (n = 188), and January 2022 (n = 252) had the highest
   densities of this vector. Haemagogus leucocelaenus was positively
   correlated with temperature (r = 0.303) and humidity (r = 0.48), with
   eggs hatching up to the 15th immersion with higher abundance of females.
   Implementing mosquito monitoring for arbovirus activity can help protect
   both the golden lion tamarin and human populations from the threat of
   arbovirus transmission.},

Title = {Soil erosion and hydroclimatic hazards in major African port cities: the
   case study of Tangier},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Land degradation and soil erosion are becoming increasingly problematic
   in Africa's rapidly developing urban areas, particularly in Major Port
   Cities. Uncontrolled expansion and human pressures are hindering
   planning, adaptation, and conservation efforts. To understand the extent
   of these issues, this study combined morphometric analysis, soil loss
   calculation, field monitoring, and remote sensing and GIS tools to
   assess soil erosion in the Metropolis of Tangier (Morocco) located at
   the confluence of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean at the
   Strait of Gibraltar. The study relied on data from 13 rain gauge
   stations, official reports, and remote sensing acquisitions, as well as
   field observations. Results showed an average soil erosion rate of 24.2
   t/ha/year, equivalent to an annual soil loss of 588,051 t/year. This
   high rate was largely due to areas with a high erosion risk (99.8\%),
   covering only 8.3\% of the territory, which were characterized by
   recently burned topsoil, fallow land, and steep slopes. These areas
   included both uncontrolled neighbourhoods and areas for planned urban
   and industrial expansion, posing a threat to the landscape's
   sustainability and socio-economic prospects. The morphometric analysis
   revealed its high vulnerability to erosion and degradation, with the
   highest soil loss rates observed in the eastern and western regions. The
   study also found that flash floods caused by hydroclimatic hazards can
   lead to significant damage to infrastructure and equipment, particularly
   in western sub-basins and mountainous regions. In conclusion, the use of
   remote sensing and GIS technologies provided valuable insights into the
   physical characteristics and vulnerability of the Tangier Metropolis to
   land degradation and soil erosion. These findings emphasize the need for
   effective land management practices and conservation measures to
   mitigate the impacts of land degradation and soil erosion in the face of
   climate change. This information is crucial for decision-makers and
   stakeholders to develop strategies to address these pressing issues.},

Title = {Inducing factors and deformation mechanism of the Zhangjiacitang
   landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Landslides are the most widely distributed geological hazards in the
   Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). Understanding the deformation
   mechanism and evolution of landslides is of great significance for their
   prevention and control. In this study, we focused on the Zhangjiacitang
   landslide, a typical bank landslide in the TGRA. We analyzed the
   relationship between landslide deformation and water level fluctuations
   and rainfall, based on accumulated displacement monitoring data, to
   clarify their triggering factors and deformation mechanism. The results
   show that the Zhangjiacitang landslide is a large-scale accumulation
   landslide. Under the influence of cyclic water level fluctuations and
   periodic rainfall, the accumulated displacement-time curve shows a
   ``stepped{''} characteristic. Heavy rainfall emerged as the primary
   factor influencing the deformation of the Zhangjiacitang landslide,
   leading to substantial deformation throughout different periods. The
   deformation of the landslide exhibited a positive correlation with the
   intensity of rainfall. In contrast, the impact of water level changes on
   the landslide deformation was more intricate. A rapid water level drop
   (> 0.3 m/d) tended to intensify the landslide deformation, while the
   slow water level drop period (< 0.3 m/d) did not exhibit such an effect.
   This study emphasizes the need for closely monitoring the landslide
   status during heavy rainfall periods and rapid water level decline
   periods. The findings of this study provide a certain reference for
   landslide monitoring, early warning, prevention and control in the TGRA.},

Abstract = {The accuracy assessment of land cover data is of significant value to
   accurately monitor and objectively reproduce spatio-temporal dynamic
   changes to land surface landscapes. In this study, the interpretation
   and applicability of CCI, MCD, and CGLS long time-series land cover data
   products for China were evaluated via consistency analysis and a
   confusion matrix system using NLUD-C periodic products as reference
   data. The results showed that CGLS had the highest overall accuracy,
   Kappa coefficient, and area consistency in the continuous time-series
   evaluation, followed by MCD, whereas CCI had the worst performance. For
   the accuracy assessment of subdivided land cover types, the three
   products could accurately describe the distribution of forest land in
   China with a high recognition level, but their recognition ability for
   water body and construction land was poor. Among the other types, CCI
   could better identify cropland, MCD for grassland, and CGLS for unused
   land. Based on these evaluation results and characteristics of the data
   products, we developed suitable selection schemes for users with

Title = {Foliar particulate matter retention and toxic trace element accumulation
   of six roadside plant species in a subtropical city},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {As a major source of air pollution, particulate matter (PM) and
   associated toxic trace elements pose potentially serious threats to
   human health and environmental safety. As is known that plants can
   reduce air PM pollution. However, the relationship between PM of
   different sizes and toxic trace elements in foliar PM is still unclear.
   This study was performed to explore the association between PM of
   different sizes (PM2.5, PM10, PM>10) and toxic trace elements (As, Al,
   Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe, Pb) as well as the correlation among toxic trace
   elements of six roadside plant species (Cinnamomum camphora, Osmanthus
   fragrans, Magnolia grandiflora, Podocarpus macrophyllus, Loropetalum
   chinense var. rubrum and Pittosporum tobira) in Changsha, Hunan
   Province, China. Results showed that P. macrophyllus had the highest
   ability to retain PM, and C. camphora excelled in retaining PM2.5. The
   combination of P. macrophyllus and C. camphora was highly recommended to
   be planted in the subtropical city to effectively reduce PM. The toxic
   trace elements accumulated in foliar PM varied with plant species and PM
   size. Two-way ANOVA showed that most of the toxic trace elements were
   significantly influenced by plant species, PM size, and their
   interactions (P < 0.05). Additionally, linear regression and correlation
   analyses further demonstrated the homology of most toxic trace elements
   in foliar PM, i.e., confirming plants as predictors of PM sources as
   well as environmental monitoring. These findings contribute to urban air
   pollution control and landscape configuration optimization.},

Title = {Emergent community architecture despite distinct diversity in the global
   whale shark (<i>Rhincodon typus</i>) epidermal microbiome},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Microbiomes confer beneficial physiological traits to their host, but
   microbial diversity is inherently variable, challenging the relationship
   between microbes and their contribution to host health. Here, we compare
   the diversity and architectural complexity of the epidermal microbiome
   from 74 individual whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) across five
   aggregations globally to determine if network properties may be more
   indicative of the microbiome-host relationship. On the premise that
   microbes are expected to exhibit biogeographic patterns globally and
   that distantly related microbial groups can perform similar functions,
   we hypothesized that microbiome co-occurrence patterns would occur
   independently of diversity trends and that keystone microbes would vary
   across locations. We found that whale shark aggregation was the most
   important factor in discriminating taxonomic diversity patterns.
   Further, microbiome network architecture was similar across all
   aggregations, with degree distributions matching Erdos-Renyi-type
   networks. The microbiome-derived networks, however, display modularity
   indicating a definitive microbiome structure on the epidermis of whale
   sharks. In addition, whale sharks hosted 35 high-quality metagenome
   assembled genomes (MAGs) of which 25 were present from all sample
   locations, termed the abundant `core'. Two main MAG groups formed,
   defined here as Ecogroup 1 and 2, based on the number of genes present
   in metabolic pathways, suggesting there are at least two important
   metabolic niches within the whale shark microbiome. Therefore, while
   variability in microbiome diversity is high, network structure and core
   taxa are inherent characteristics of the epidermal microbiome in whale
   sharks. We suggest the host-microbiome and microbe-microbe interactions
   that drive the self-assembly of the microbiome help support a
   functionally redundant abundant core and that network characteristics
   should be considered when linking microbiomes with host health.},

Title = {Development of sex-linked markers for gender identification of
   <i>Actinidia arguta</i>},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {The fruit of the dioecious plant Actinidia arguta has become a great
   attraction recently. It has long been difficult to distinguish the
   genders of hybrid seedlings before flowering, therefore increasing the
   expenditures of breeding. To produce reliable molecular marker for
   gender identification, this research utilized whole-genome re-sequencing
   of 15 males and 15 females from an 8-year-old cross population to
   develop gender specific markers. P51 and P11 were identified as
   sex-linked markers after verification. Both of these markers, according
   to the PCR results, only amplified a single band in male samples. These
   two markers were tested in 97 hybrids (52 females and 45 males) and 31
   wild individuals (13 females and 18 males), with an accuracy of 96.88\%
   and 96.09\%, correspondingly. This research also verified the
   universalities of the two markers in Actinidia chinensis samples, and it
   could be inferred from the PCR results that neither marker was
   applicable to A. chinensis samples. The BLAST results of the two markers
   demonstrated that the two markers were closely aligned with different
   parts of the Y male-specific region of A. chinensis genome, thus they
   were likely to be useful for the research on the mechanism of sex
   determination of A. arguta. The two male-linked makers, P51 and P11,
   have already been used in sex-identification of A. arguta seedlings.},

Title = {A brighter shade of future climate on Himalayan musk deer <i>Moschus
   leucogaster</i>},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is classified as an endangered
   species by IUCN with a historically misunderstood distribution due to
   misidentification with other species of musk deer, Moschus spp. Taking
   advantage of recent genetic analyses confirming the species of various
   populations in Nepal and China, we produced an accurate estimate of the
   species' current and future distribution under multiple climate change
   scenarios. We collected high-quality occurrence data using systematic
   surveys of various protected areas of Nepal to train species
   distribution models. The most influential determinants of the
   distribution of Himalayan musk deer were precipitation of the driest
   quarter, temperature seasonality, and annual mean temperature. These
   variables, and precipitation in particular, determine the vegetation
   type and structure in the Himalaya, which is strongly correlated with
   the distribution of Himalayan musk deer. We predicted suitable habitats
   between the Annapurna and Kanchenjunga region of Nepal Himalaya as well
   as the adjacent Himalaya in China. Under multiple climate change
   scenarios, the vast majority (85-89\%) of current suitable sites are
   likely to remain suitable and many new areas of suitable habitat may
   emerge to the west and north of the current species range in Nepal and
   China. Two-thirds of current and one-third of future suitable habitats
   are protected by the extensive network of protected areas in Nepal. The
   projected large gains in suitable sites may lead to population expansion
   and conservation gains, only when the threat of overexploitation and
   population decline is under control.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {The role of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in Asian hydrological climate is
   crucial, yet there is a lack of quantitative estimates regarding its
   impact on snowfall in China. Some opinions suggest that the TP functions
   as a large barrier that obstructs cold outbreaks, protecting southern
   China from severe snowstorms. Through topography experiments with and
   without the TP, our study suggests that the TP's presence results in a
   60\% decrease in snowfall in northern China by significantly reducing
   moisture. In contrast, it promotes a 1500\% increase in snowfall in
   southern China, particularly from November to March, by drawing cold air
   from the north and moisture from the south to southern China. The
   presence of TP significantly enhances winter relative humidity in
   southern China, causing discomfort for humans. This research refutes
   some trending views and improves our understanding of the TP's role in
   China's winter climate.},

   California},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Nest defense in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a complex collective
   behavior modulated by various interacting social, environmental, and
   genetic factors. Scutellata-hybrid ({''}Africanized{''}) honey bees are
   usually considered to be far more defensive than European honey bees
   which are therefore preferred for commercial and hobbyist beekeeping. In
   the most recent zone of scutellata hybridization, the southern USA, the
   degree to which this defensiveness differs among current strains, and
   the extent to which defensiveness varies across a season has not been
   measured. We quantified the levels of A. m. scutellata ancestry in
   colonies and conducted a seasonal assessment (May through November) of
   colony nest defensiveness in feral scutellata-hybrid and a popular
   lineage of European honey bee commonly used in managed environments
   (sold as A. mellifera ligustica) hives at two apiaries in Southern
   California. Standard measures of defensiveness were low in both
   scutellata-hybrid and European colonies during May. Defensiveness
   increased during the later months of the study in scutellata-hybrid
   colonies. Most measures of defensiveness did not increase in managed
   colonies. Defensiveness in the scutellata-hybrids appears lower than
   what has been previously documented in Brazil and Mexico, possibly due
   to their lower proportion of A. m. scutellata ancestry.},

   potassium, magnesium determined by the Egner-Riehm, Mehlich 3 and Yanai
   methods. The purpose of the article is to compare soil element
   extraction by three different methods under struvite fertilization and
   its use in soybean cultivation. The application of these methods
   indicated an unambiguous increase in soil Mg content after struvite
   application. Broadcast soybean fertilization affected the phosphorus
   content of the soil. The results of the study indicated that different
   extraction methods presented different contents of P from soil. The
   content of available phosphorus was circa 122-156 mg kg(-1) dm,
   35.4-67.5 mg kg(-1) dm and 100-159 mg kg(-1) dm according to the
   Mehlich, Yanai and Egner-Riehm methods, respectively. A positive
   correlation was found between the content of Mg and K in soil determined
   by the Mehlich 3 and Yanai methods, which may suggest that the Yanai
   method could be introduced into standard soil chemical analysis in
   Poland. Such a correlation was not found for phosphorus, which is a
   difficult element to determine due to the multitude of factors affecting
   its availability.},

Title = {Regional differences in water beetle communities networks settling in
   dystrophic lakes in northern Poland},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The relationships between the species that form the networks in small
   dystrophic lakes remain poorly recognised. To investigate and better
   understand the functioning of beetle communities in different
   ecosystems, we created three network models that we subjected to graph
   network analysis. This approach displays correlation-based networks of
   connections (edges) between objects (nodes) by evaluating the features
   of the whole network and the attributes of nodes and edges in the
   context of their roles, expressed by centrality metrics. We used this
   method to determine the importance of specific species in the networks
   and the interspecific relationships. Our analyses are based on faunal
   material collected from 25 dystrophic lakes in three regions of northern
   Poland. We found a total of 104 species representing different
   ecological elements and functional trophic groups. We have shown that
   the network of relationships between the biomass of species differs
   considerably in the three study regions. The Kashubian Lakeland had the
   highest cohesion and density, while the network in the Suwalki Lakeland
   was the thinnest and most heterogeneous, which might be related to the
   fractal structure and the degree of development of the studied lakes.
   Small-bodied predators that congregated in different clusters with
   species with similar ecological preferences dominated all networks. We
   found the highest correlations in the Masurian Lakeland, where we
   obtained the highest centralisation of the network. Small tyrphophiles
   typically occupied the central places in the network, while the
   periphery of the network consisted of clusters with different habitat
   preferences, including large predators. The species that were most
   important for network cohesion and density were mainly tyrphophilous
   species, such as Anacaena lutescens, Hygrotus decoratus, Enochrus
   melanocephalus and Hydroporus neglectus. The values of attributes
   determining the role of species in community networks were influenced by
   both biotic and environmental factors.},

Abstract = {The Early Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits of India are known for their
   diverse sauropod fauna, while little is known from the Middle and Late
   Jurassic. Here we report the first ever remains of a dicraeosaurid
   sauropod from India, Tharosaurus indicus gen. et sp. nov., from the
   Middle Jurassic (early-middle Bathonian) strata of Jaisalmer Basin,
   western India. Known from elements of the axial skeleton, the new taxon
   is phylogenetically among the earlier-diverging dicraeosaurids, and its
   stratigraphic age makes it the earliest known diplodocoid globally.
   Palaeobiogeographic considerations of Tharosaurus, seen in conjunction
   with the other Indian Jurassic sauropods, suggest that the new Indian
   taxon is a relic of a lineage that originated in India and underwent
   rapid dispersal across the rest of Pangaea. Here we emphasize the
   importance of Gondwanan India in tracing the origin and early
   evolutionary history of neosauropod dinosaurs.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Brassica napus, a versatile crop with significant socioeconomic
   importance, serves as a valuable source of nutrition for humans and
   animals while also being utilized in biodiesel production. The expansion
   potential of B. napus is profoundly influenced by climatic variations,
   yet there remains a scarcity of studies investigating the correlation
   between climatic factors and its distribution. This research employs
   CLIMEX to identify the current and future ecological niches of B. napus
   under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, utilizing the Access 1.0 and
   CNRM-CM5 models for the time frame of 2040-2059. Additionally, a
   sensitivity analysis of parameters was conducted to determine the
   primary climatic factors affecting B. napus distribution and model
   responsiveness. The simulated outcomes demonstrate a satisfactory
   alignment with the known current distribution of B. napus, with 98\% of
   occurrence records classified as having medium to high climatic
   suitability. However, the species displays high sensitivity to thermal
   parameters, thereby suggesting that temperature increases could trigger
   shifts in suitable and unsuitable areas for B. napus, impacting regions
   such as Canada, China, Brazil, and the United States.},

Title = {A retrospective study on antibacterial treatments for koalas infected

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Chlamydiosis remains the leading infectious disease and is one of the
   key factors responsible for the dramatic reduction of koala populations
   in South-East Queensland (SEQ) and New South Wales (NSW) regions of
   Australia. Possible infection outcomes include blindness, infertility,
   painful cystitis, and death if left untreated. Studies have reported the
   treatment efficacy of chloramphenicol and doxycycline, which are the two
   most commonly administered treatments in diseased koalas, in clinical
   settings. However, none have directly compared the treatment efficacy of
   these antibacterials on koala survival. A retrospective study was
   essential to identify any relationships between the demographical
   information, and the animals' responses to the current treatment
   regimens. Associations were explored between six explanatory (sex;
   maturity; location; clinical signs, treatment; treatment duration) and
   two outcome variables (survival; post-treatment PCR). Results showed
   that female koalas had a statistical trend of lower odds of surviving
   when compared to males (OR = 0.36, p = 0.05). Koalas treated with
   chloramphenicol for \& GE; 28 days had greater odds of surviving than
   when treated for < 28 days (OR = 8.8, p = 0.02), and those koalas
   administered doxycycline had greater odds of testing PCR negative when
   compared to chloramphenicol treatments (OR = 5.45, p = 0.008). There was
   no difference between the antibacterial treatments (chloramphenicol,
   doxycycline, and mixed/other) and the survival of koalas. Female koalas
   had greater odds of exhibiting UGT signs only (OR = 4.86, p < 0.001),
   and also greater odds of having both ocular and UGT clinical signs (OR =
   5.29, p < 0.001) when compared to males. Of the koalas, 28.5\% initially
   had no clinical signs but were PCR positive for C. pecorum. This study
   enables further understanding of the complex nature between chlamydial
   infection and response to antibacterial treatment.},

Title = {Species-specific metabolites mediate host selection and larval
   recruitment of the symbiotic seastar shrimp},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {In marine environments, host selection, defining how symbiotic organisms
   recognize and interact with their hosts, is often mediated by olfactory
   communication. Although adult symbionts may select their hosts detecting
   chemosensory cues, no information is available concerning the
   recruitment of symbiotic larvae which is a crucial step to sustain
   symbioses over generations. This study investigates the olfactory
   recognition of seastar hosts by adult Zenopontoniasoror shrimps and the
   recruitment of their larvae. We examine the semiochemicals that
   influence host selection using chemical extractions, behavioural
   experiments in olfactometers, and mass spectrometry analyses. After
   describing the symbiotic population and the embryonic development of
   shrimps, our results demonstrate that asterosaponins, which are
   traditionally considered as chemical defences in seastars, are
   species-specific and play a role in attracting the symbiotic shrimps.
   Adult shrimps were found to be attracted only by their original host
   species Culcitanovaeguineae, while larvae were attracted by different
   species of seastars. This study provides the first chemical
   identification of an olfactory cue used by larvae of symbiotic organisms
   to locate their host for recruitment. These findings highlight the
   importance of chemical communication in the mediation of symbiotic
   associations, which has broader significant implications for
   understanding the ecological dynamics of marine ecosystems.},
