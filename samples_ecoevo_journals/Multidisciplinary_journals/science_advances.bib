	abstract = {Does warmth from hydrothermal springs play a vital role in the biology and ecology of abyssal animals? Deep off central California, thousands of octopus (Muusoctopus robustus) migrate through cold dark waters to hydrothermal springs near an extinct volcano to mate, nest, and die, forming the largest known aggregation of octopus on Earth. Warmth from the springs plays a key role by raising metabolic rates, speeding embryonic development, and presumably increasing reproductive success; we show that brood times for females are similar to 1.8 years, far faster than expected for abyssal octopods. Using a high-resolution subsea mapping system, we created landscape-scale maps and image mosaics that reveal 6000 octopus in a 2.5-ha area. Because octopuses die after reproducing, hydrothermal springs indirectly provide a food supplement to the local energy budget. Although localized deep-sea heat sources may be essential to octopuses and other warm-tolerant species, most of these unique and often cryptic habitats remain undiscovered and unexplored.},

Here, we assessed how changes in the genetic characteristics of a keystone predator, grey wolves, affected the ecosystem of Isle Royale National Park over two decades. Changes in the genetic characteristic of the wolf population associated with a genetic rescue event, followed by high levels of inbreeding, led to a rise and then fall in predation rates on moose, the primary prey of wolves and dominant mammalian herbivore in this system. Those changes in predation rate led to large fluctuations in moose abundance, which in turn affected browse rates on balsam fir, the dominant forage for moose during winter and an important boreal forest species. Thus, forest dynamics can be traced back to changes in the genetic characteristics of a predator population.},

The placenta is a complex organ that repeatedly evolved in the livebearing fish family Poeciliidae. Here, we apply comparative approaches to test whether evolution has produced similar or different placental phenotypes in the Poeciliidae and to what extent these phenotypes correlate with convergence at the molecular level. We show the existence of two placental phenotypes characterized by distinctly different anatomical adaptations (divergent evolution). Furthermore, each placental phenotype independently evolved multiple times across the family, providing evidence for repeated convergence. Moreover, our comparative genomic analysis revealed that the genomes of species with different placentas are evolving at a different pace. Last, we show that the two placental phenotypes correlate with two previously described contrasting life-history optima. Our results argue for high evolvability (both divergent and convergent) of the placenta within a group of closely related species in a single family.},

We show that species-specific responses to localized environmental changes will alter the collection of co-occurring species within established fishing footprints along the U.S. West Coast. We demonstrate that availability of the most economically valuable, primary target species is highly likely to decline coastwide in response to warming and reduced oxygen concentrations, while availability of the most abundant, secondary target species will potentially increase. A spatial reshuffling of primary and secondary target species suggests regionally heterogeneous opportunities for fishers to adapt by changing where or what they fish.

Here, we tracked the symbiotic associations of reef-building corals for 6 years through a prolonged heatwave, including known survivorship for 79 of 315 colonies. Coral genetics strongly predicted survival of the ubiquitous coral, Porites (massive growth form), with variable survival (15 to 61\%) across three morphologically indistinguishable-but genetically distinct-lineages. The heatwave also disrupted strong associations between these coral lineages and their algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae), with symbiotic turnover in some colonies, resulting in reduced specificity across lineages.

Here, we show that the narwhal, Monodon monoceros, is extremely sensitive to human-made noise. Narwhals avoided deep diving ({\textgreater} 350 m) with simultaneous reduction of foraging and increased shallow diving activity as a response to either ship sound alone or ship sound with concurrent seismic airgun pulses. Normal behavior decreased by 50 to 75\% at distances where received sound levels were below background noise. Narwhals were equally responsive to both disturbance types, hence demonstrating their acute sensitivity to ship sound. This sensitivity coupled with their special behavioral-ecological strategy including a narrow ecological niche and high site fidelity makes them thus especially vulnerable to human impacts in the Arctic.},

We subjected 198 wild gray mouse lemurs to four cognitive and two personality tests and subsequently monitored their survival in a mark-recapture study. Our study revealed that survival was predicted by individual variation in cognitive performance as well as body mass and exploration. Because cognitive performance covaried negatively with exploration, individuals gathering more accurate information enjoyed better cognitive performance and lived longer, but so did heavier and more explorative individuals. These effects may reflect a speed-accuracy trade-off, with alternative strategies yielding similar overall fitness. The observed intraspecific variation in selective benefits of cognitive performance, if heritable, can provide the basis for the evolution of cognitive abilities in members of our lineage.},

Using extraordinarily well-preserved fish otoliths, we reconstruct a continuous mesopelagic fish community record in the Pacific Warm Pool region over 460,000 years. Fish production and diversity followed hump-shaped temperature gradients, with lower tipping point temperatures for the diversity than the production by similar to 1.5 degrees to 2.0 degrees C. During warmer-than-present interglacial periods, both production and diversity declined drastically. Our findings imply that the temperature-sensitive mesopelagic fish community at the southwestern margin of the Pacific Warm Pool, and possibly other hydrographically similar regions, may be especially affected if ocean warming continues unabated in the future.},

Here, we show that Timema stick insects exhibit genetically deter-mined color morphs that range from weakly to strongly discontinuous. Color data from nature and a manipu-lative field experiment demonstrate that greater morph differentiation is associated with shifts from host plants exhibiting more continuous color variation to those exhibiting greater coloration distance between green leaves and brown stems, the latter of which generates strong disruptive selection.

While alternative alleles causing discrete ALHS are expected to purge or fix over time, one-third of the similar to 90 species of Colias butterflies are polymorphic for a female-limited ALHS called Alba. Whether Alba arose once, evolved in parallel, or has been exchanged among taxa is currently unknown. Using comparative genome-wide association study (GWAS) and population genomic analyses, we placed the genetic basis of Alba in time-calibrated phylogenomic framework, revealing that Alba evolved once near the base of the genus and has been subsequently maintained via introgression and balancing selec-tion. CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis was then used to verify a putative cis-regulatory region of Alba, which we identified using phylogenetic foot printing. We hypothesize that this cis-regulatory region acts as a modular enhancer for the induction of the Alba ALHS, which has likely facilitated its long evolutionary persistence. Commons License},

	abstract = {Symbiotic cnidarians such as corals and anemones form highly productive and biodiverse coral reef ecosystems in nutrient-poor ocean environments, a phenomenon known as Darwin's paradox. Resolving this paradox requires elucidating the molecular bases of efficient nutrient distribution and recycling in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Using the sea anemone Aiptasia, we show that during symbiosis, the increased availability of glucose and the presence of the algae jointly induce the coordinated up-regulation and relocalization of glucose and ammonium transporters. These molecular responses are critical to support symbiont functioning and organism-wide nitrogen assimilation through glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase-mediated amino acid biosynthesis. Our results reveal crucial aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrogen conservation and recycling in these organisms that allow them to thrive in the nitrogen-poor ocean environments.},

	abstract = {Hybridization is widespread and constitutes an important source of genetic variability and evolution. In animals, its role in generating novel and independent lineages (hybrid speciation) has been strongly debated, with only a few cases supported by genomic data. The South American fur seal (SAfs) Arctocephalus australis is a marine apex predator of Pacific and Atlantic waters, with a disjunct set of populations in Peru and Northern Chile [Pe-ruvian fur seal (Pfs)] with controversial taxonomic status. We demonstrate, using complete genome and reduced representation sequencing, that the Pfs is a genetically distinct species with an admixed genome that originated from hybridization between the SAfs and the Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) similar to 400,000 years ago. Our results strongly support the origin of Pfs by homoploid hybrid speciation over alternative introgression scenarios. This study highlights the role of hybridization in promoting species-level biodiversity in large vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Survival of symbiotic reef-building corals under global warming requires rapid acclimation or adaptation. The impact of accumulated heat stress was compared across 1643 symbiont communities before and after the 2016 mass bleaching in three coral species and free-living in the environment across similar to 900 kilometers of the Great Barrier Reef. Resilient reefs (less aerial bleaching than predicted from high satellite sea temperatures) showed low variation in symbioses. Before 2016, heat-tolerant environmental symbionts were common in similar to 98\% of samples and moderately abundant (9 to 40\% in samples). In corals, heat-tolerant symbionts were at low abundances (0 to 7.3\%) but only in a minority (13 to 27\%) of colonies. Following bleaching, environmental diversity doubled (including heat-tolerant symbionts) and increased in one coral species. Communities were dynamic (Acropora millepora) and conserved (Acropora hyacinthus and Acropora tenuis), including symbiont community turnover and redistribution. Symbiotic restructuring after bleaching occurs but is a taxon-specific ecological opportunity.},

	abstract = {Human activities have led to degradation of ecosystems globally. The lost ecosystem functions and services accumulate from the time of disturbance to the full recovery of the ecosystem and can be quantified as a “recovery debt,” providing a valuable tool to develop better restoration practices that accelerate recovery and limit losses. Here, we quantified the recovery of faunal biodiversity and abundance toward a predisturbed state following structural restoration of oyster habitats globally. We found that while restoration initiates a rapid increase in biodiversity and abundance of reef-associated species within 2 years, recovery rate then decreases substantially, leaving a global shortfall in recovery of 35\% below a predisturbed state. While efficient restoration methods boost recovery and minimize recovery shortfalls, the time to full recovery is yet to be quantified. Therefore, potential future coastal development should weigh up not only the instantaneous damage to ecosystem functions but also the potential for generational loss of services.},

	abstract = {The viability of spatially structured populations depends on the abundance and connectivity between subpopulations of breeding adults. Yet, for many species, both are extremely difficult to assess. The speartooth shark is a critically endangered elasmobranch inhabiting tropical rivers with only three adults ever recorded in Australia. Close-kin mark-recapture models, informed by sibling pairs among 226 juveniles, were developed to estimate adult abundance and connectivity in two Australian river systems. Sixty-eight sibling pairs were found, and adult abundance was estimated at 892 for the Adelaide River and 1128 for the Alligator Rivers. We found strong evidence for female philopatry, with most females returning to the same river to pup. Adelaide River males appear largely philopatric, whereas Alligator Rivers males are highly connected to the Adelaide River. From only 4 years of sampling, our results demonstrate that juvenile-only kin pairs can inform simultaneous estimates of abundance and connectivity in a rare and threatened species.
