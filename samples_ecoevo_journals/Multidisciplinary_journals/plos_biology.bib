Abstract = {The updating of contextual memories is essential for survival in a
   changing environment. Accumulating data indicate that the dorsal CA1
   area (dCA1) contributes to this process. However, the cellular and
   molecular mechanisms of contextual fear memory updating remain poorly
   understood. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) regulates the
   structure and function of glutamatergic synapses. Here, using
   dCA1-targeted genetic manipulations in vivo, combined with ex vivo 3D
   electron microscopy and electrophysiology, we identify a novel, synaptic
   mechanism that is induced during attenuation of contextual fear memories
   and involves phosphorylation of PSD-95 at Serine 73 in dCA1. Our data
   provide the proof that PSD-95-dependent synaptic plasticity in dCA1 is
   required for updating of contextual fear memory.},

Title = {Neural responses in macaque prefrontal cortex are linked to strategic
   exploration},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Humans have been shown to strategically explore. They can identify
   situations in which gathering information about distant and uncertain
   options is beneficial for the future. Because primates rely on scarce
   resources when they forage, they are also thought to strategically
   explore, but whether they use the same strategies as humans and the
   neural bases of strategic exploration in monkeys are largely unknown. We
   designed a sequential choice task to investigate whether monkeys
   mobilize strategic exploration based on whether that information can
   improve subsequent choice, but also to ask the novel question about
   whether monkeys adjust their exploratory choices based on the
   contingency between choice and information, by sometimes providing the
   counterfactual feedback about the unchosen option. We show that monkeys
   decreased their reliance on expected value when exploration could be
   beneficial, but this was not mediated by changes in the effect of
   uncertainty on choices. We found strategic exploratory signals in
   anterior and mid-cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (dlPFC). This network was most active when a low value option was
   chosen, which suggests a role in counteracting expected value signals,
   when exploration away from value should to be considered. Such strategic
   exploration was abolished when the counterfactual feedback was
   available. Learning from counterfactual outcome was associated with the
   recruitment of a different circuit centered on the medial orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC), where we showed that monkeys represent chosen and unchosen
   reward prediction errors. Overall, our study shows how ACC/MCC-dlPFC and
   OFC circuits together could support exploitation of available
   information to the fullest and drive behavior towards finding more
   information through exploration when it is beneficial.},

Title = {A central CRMP complex essential for invasion in <i>Toxoplasma
   gondii</i>},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites. While most species are
   restricted to specific hosts and cell types, Toxoplasma gondii can
   invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This
   broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host
   cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central
   protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During
   invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are
   sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been
   suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion.
   However, to date, only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to
   be essential for invasion, suggesting functional redundancy that might
   allow such a broad host range. Cysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs)
   are a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins. In T. gondii, two CRMPs
   are present in the genome, CRMPA (TGGT1\_261080) and CRMPB
   (TGGT1\_292020). Here, we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex
   that contains the additional proteins MIC15 and the thrombospondin type
   1 domain-containing protein (TSP1). Disruption of this complex results
   in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the
   host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex
   conserved in all apicomplexans.},

Title = {Multispecies biofilm architecture determines bacterial exposure to
   phages},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Numerous ecological interactions among microbes-for example, competition
   for space and resources, or interaction among phages and their bacterial
   hosts-are likely to occur simultaneously in multispecies biofilm
   communities. While biofilms formed by just a single species occur,
   multispecies biofilms are thought to be more typical of microbial
   communities in the natural environment. Previous work has shown that
   multispecies biofilms can increase, decrease, or have no measurable
   impact on phage exposure of a host bacterium living alongside another
   species that the phages cannot target. The reasons underlying this
   variability are not well understood, and how phage-host encounters
   change within multispecies biofilms remains mostly unexplored at the
   cellular spatial scale. Here, we study how the cellular scale
   architecture of model 2-species biofilms impacts cell-cell and
   cell-phage interactions controlling larger scale population and
   community dynamics. Our system consists of dual culture biofilms of
   Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae under exposure to T7 phages, which
   we study using microfluidic culture, high-resolution confocal microscopy
   imaging, and detailed image analysis. As shown previously, sufficiently
   mature biofilms of E. coli can protect themselves from phage exposure
   via their curli matrix. Before this stage of biofilm structural
   maturity, E. coli is highly susceptible to phages; however, we show that
   these bacteria can gain lasting protection against phage exposure if
   they have become embedded in the bottom layers of highly packed groups
   of V. cholerae in co-culture. This protection, in turn, is dependent on
   the cell packing architecture controlled by V. cholerae biofilm matrix
   secretion. In this manner, E. coli cells that are otherwise susceptible
   to phage-mediated killing can survive phage exposure in the absence of
   de novo resistance evolution. While co-culture biofilm formation with V.
   cholerae can confer phage protection to E. coli, it comes at the cost of
   competing with V. cholerae and a disruption of normal curli-mediated
   protection for E. coli even in dual species biofilms grown over long
   time scales. This work highlights the critical importance of studying
   multispecies biofilm architecture and its influence on the community
   dynamics of bacteria and phages.},

Title = {Systematic assessment of the replicability and generalizability of
   preclinical findings: Impact of protocol harmonization across laboratory
   sites},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The influence of protocol standardization between laboratories on their
   replicability of preclinical results has not been addressed in a
   systematic way. While standardization is considered good research
   practice as a means to control for undesired external noise (i.e.,
   highly variable results), some reports suggest that standardized
   protocols may lead to idiosyncratic results, thus undermining
   replicability. Through the EQIPD consortium, a multi-lab collaboration
   between academic and industry partners, we aimed to elucidate parameters
   that impact the replicability of preclinical animal studies. To this
   end, 3 experimental protocols were implemented across 7 laboratories.
   The replicability of results was determined using the distance travelled
   in an open field after administration of pharmacological compounds known
   to modulate locomotor activity (MK-801, diazepam, and clozapine) in
   C57BL/6 mice as a worked example. The goal was to determine whether
   harmonization of study protocols across laboratories improves the
   replicability of the results and whether replicability can be further
   improved by systematic variation (heterogenization) of 2 environmental
   factors (time of testing and light intensity during testing) within
   laboratories. Protocols were tested in 3 consecutive stages and differed
   in the extent of harmonization across laboratories and standardization
   within laboratories: stage 1, minimally aligned across sites (local
   protocol); stage 2, fully aligned across sites (harmonized protocol)
   with and without systematic variation (standardized and heterogenized
   cohort); and stage 3, fully aligned across sites (standardized protocol)
   with a different compound. All protocols resulted in consistent
   treatment effects across laboratories, which were also replicated within
   laboratories across the different stages. Harmonization of protocols
   across laboratories reduced between-lab variability substantially
   compared to each lab using their local protocol. In contrast, the
   environmental factors chosen to introduce systematic variation within
   laboratories did not affect the behavioral outcome. Therefore,
   heterogenization did not reduce between-lab variability further compared
   to the harmonization of the standardized protocol. Altogether, these
   findings demonstrate that subtle variations between lab-specific study
   protocols may introduce variation across independent replicate studies
   even after protocol harmonization and that systematic heterogenization
   of environmental factors may not be sufficient to account for such
   between-lab variation. Differences in replicability of results within
   and between laboratories highlight the ubiquity of study-specific
   variation due to between-lab variability, the importance of transparent
   and fine-grained reporting of methodologies and research protocols, and
   the importance of independent study replication.},

Title = {Metabolic reconstitution of germ-free mice by a gnotobiotic microbiota
   varies over the circadian cycle},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise
   indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of
   energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased
   digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiota to
   obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher
   fat mass than germ-free (GF) or fully colonized counterparts. We
   therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy
   expenditure, and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed
   metabolic cage system, which allows long-term measurements without
   contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota-released calories
   are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized
   versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and GF mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e.,
   microbiota-released calories can in fact be well integrated into
   appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy
   expenditure after normalization by lean mass between the different
   microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative small differences in
   energy balance, or altered energy storage, must underlie fat
   accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage,
   major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates
   used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: In GF mice, the respiratory
   exchange ratio (RER) was consistently lower than that of fully colonized
   mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on
   glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, the RER of OligoMM12-colonized
   gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark
   (active/eating) phase but phenocopied GF mice during the light
   (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a
   GF-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light phase and both
   liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with GF
   mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are
   required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting
   phase of circadian cycle and which are absent in the OligoMM12
   consortium.},

Title = {<i>Candida albicans</i> selection for human commensalism results in

   invasive disease},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Candida albicans is a frequent colonizer of human mucosal surfaces as
   well as an opportunistic pathogen. C. albicans is remarkably versatile
   in its ability to colonize diverse host sites with differences in oxygen
   and nutrient availability, pH, immune responses, and resident microbes,
   among other cues. It is unclear how the genetic background of a
   commensal colonizing population can influence the shift to
   pathogenicity. Therefore, we examined 910 commensal isolates from 35
   healthy donors to identify host niche-specific adaptations. We
   demonstrate that healthy people are reservoirs for genotypically and
   phenotypically diverse C. albicans strains. Using limited diversity
   exploitation, we identified a single nucleotide change in the
   uncharacterized ZMS1 transcription factor that was sufficient to drive
   hyper invasion into agar. We found that SC5314 was significantly
   different from the majority of both commensal and bloodstream isolates
   in its ability to induce host cell death. However, our commensal strains
   retained the capacity to cause disease in the Galleria model of systemic
   infection, including outcompeting the SC5314 reference strain during
   systemic competition assays. This study provides a global view of
   commensal strain variation and within-host strain diversity of C.
   albicans and suggests that selection for commensalism in humans does not
   result in a fitness cost for invasive disease.},

Title = {Cheating leads to the evolution of multipartite viruses},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In multipartite viruses, the genome is split into multiple segments,
   each of which is transmitted via a separate capsid. The existence of
   multipartite viruses poses a problem, because replication is only
   possible when all segments are present within the same host. Given this
   clear cost, why is multipartitism so common in viruses? Most previous
   hypotheses try to explain how multipartitism could provide an advantage.
   In so doing, they require scenarios that are unrealistic and that cannot
   explain viruses with more than 2 multipartite segments. We show
   theoretically that selection for cheats, which avoid producing a shared
   gene product, but still benefit from gene products produced by other
   genomes, can drive the evolution of both multipartite and segmented
   viruses. We find that multipartitism can evolve via cheating under
   realistic conditions and does not require unreasonably high coinfection
   rates or any group-level benefit. Furthermore, the cheating hypothesis
   is consistent with empirical patterns of cheating and multipartitism
   across viruses. More broadly, our results show how evolutionary conflict
   can drive new patterns of genome organisation in viruses and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Sleep is a complex and plastic behavior regulated by multiple brain
   regions and influenced by numerous internal and external stimuli. Thus,
   to fully uncover the function(s) of sleep, cellular resolution of
   sleep-regulating neurons needs to be achieved. Doing so will help to
   unequivocally assign a role or function to a given neuron or group of
   neurons in sleep behavior. In the Drosophila brain, neurons projecting
   to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) have emerged as a key
   sleep-regulating area. To dissect the contribution of individual dFB
   neurons to sleep, we undertook an intersectional Split-GAL4 genetic
   screen focusing on cells contained within the 23E10-GAL4 driver, the
   most widely used tool to manipulate dFB neurons. In this study, we
   demonstrate that 23E10-GAL4 expresses in neurons outside the dFB and in
   the fly equivalent of the spinal cord, the ventral nerve cord (VNC).
   Furthermore, we show that 2 VNC cholinergic neurons strongly contribute
   to the sleep-promoting capacity of the 23E10-GAL4 driver under baseline
   conditions. However, in contrast to other 23E10-GAL4 neurons, silencing
   these VNC cells does not block sleep homeostasis. Thus, our data
   demonstrate that the 23E10-GAL4 driver contains at least 2 different
   types of sleep-regulating neurons controlling distinct aspects of sleep
   behavior.},

Title = {Comparative single-cell transcriptional atlases of <i>Babesia</i>
   species reveal conserved and species-specific expression profiles},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Babesia is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that infect red blood cells
   in vertebrate hosts. Pathology occurs during rapid replication cycles in
   the asexual blood stage of infection. Current knowledge of Babesia
   replication cycle progression and regulation is limited and relies
   mostly on comparative studies with related parasites. Due to limitations
   in synchronizing Babesia parasites, fine-scale time-course
   transcriptomic resources are not readily available. Single-cell
   transcriptomics provides a powerful unbiased alternative for profiling
   asynchronous cell populations. Here, we applied single-cell RNA
   sequencing to 3 Babesia species (B. divergens, B. bovis, and B.
   bigemina). We used analytical approaches and algorithms to map the
   replication cycle and construct pseudo-synchronized time-course gene
   expression profiles. We identify clusters of co-expressed genes showing
   ``just-in-time{''} expression profiles, with gradually cascading peaks
   throughout asexual development. Moreover, clustering analysis of
   reconstructed gene curves reveals coordinated timing of peak expression
   in epigenetic markers and transcription factors. Using a regularized
   Gaussian graphical model, we reconstructed co-expression networks and
   identified conserved and species-specific nodes. Motif analysis of a
   co-expression interactome of AP2 transcription factors identified
   specific motifs previously reported to play a role in DNA replication in
   Plasmodium species. Finally, we present an interactive web application
   to visualize and interactively explore the datasets.},

Title = {Forebrain nuclei linked to woodpecker territorial drum displays mirror
   those that enable vocal learning in songbirds},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Vocal learning is thought to have evolved in 3 orders of birds
   (songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds), with each showing similar brain
   regions that have comparable gene expression specializations relative to
   the surrounding forebrain motor circuitry. Here, we searched for
   signatures of these same gene expression specializations in previously
   uncharacterized brains of 7 assumed vocal non-learning bird lineages
   across the early branches of the avian family tree. Our findings using a
   conserved marker for the song system found little evidence of
   specializations in these taxa, except for woodpeckers. Instead,
   woodpeckers possessed forebrain regions that were anatomically similar
   to the pallial song nuclei of vocal learning birds. Field studies of
   free-living downy woodpeckers revealed that these brain nuclei showed
   increased expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) when males produce
   their iconic drum displays, the elaborate bill-hammering behavior that
   individuals use to compete for territories, much like birdsong. However,
   these specialized areas did not show increased IEG expression with
   vocalization or flight. We further confirmed that other woodpecker
   species contain these brain nuclei, suggesting that these brain regions
   are a common feature of the woodpecker brain. We therefore hypothesize
   that ancient forebrain nuclei for refined motor control may have given
   rise to not only the song control systems of vocal learning birds, but
   also the drumming system of woodpeckers.},

Title = {Evolutionary safety of lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral treatment},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nucleoside analogs are a major class of antiviral drugs. Some act by
   increasing the viral mutation rate causing lethal mutagenesis of the
   virus. Their mutagenic capacity, however, may lead to an evolutionary
   safety concern. We define evolutionary safety as a probabilistic
   assurance that the treatment will not generate an increased number of
   mutants. We develop a mathematical framework to estimate the total
   mutant load produced with and without mutagenic treatment. We predict
   rates of appearance of such virus mutants as a function of the timing of
   treatment and the immune competence of patients, employing realistic
   assumptions about the vulnerability of the viral genome and its
   potential to generate viable mutants. We focus on the case study of
   Molnupiravir, which is an FDA-approved treatment against Coronavirus
   Disease-2019 (COVID-19). We estimate that Molnupiravir is narrowly
   evolutionarily safe, subject to the current estimate of parameters.
   Evolutionary safety can be improved by restricting treatment with this
   drug to individuals with a low immunological clearance rate and, in
   future, by designing treatments that lead to a greater increase in
   mutation rate. We report a simple mathematical rule to determine the
   fold increase in mutation rate required to obtain evolutionary safety
   that is also applicable to other pathogen-treatment combinations.},

Title = {Phenotypic plasticity evolves at multiple biological levels in response
   to environmental predictability in a long-term experiment with a
   halotolerant microalga},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, the change in the phenotype of a given genotype
   in response to its environment of development, is a ubiquitous feature
   of life, enabling organisms to cope with variation in their environment.
   Theoretical studies predict that, under stationary environmental
   variation, the level of plasticity should evolve to match the
   predictability of selection at the timing of development. However, the
   extent to which patterns of evolution of plasticity for more integrated
   traits are mirrored by their underlying molecular mechanisms remains
   unclear, especially in response to well-characterized selective
   pressures exerted by environmental predictability. Here, we used
   experimental evolution with the microalgae Dunaliella salina under
   controlled environmental fluctuations, to test whether the evolution of
   phenotypic plasticity in responses to environmental predictability (as
   measured by the squared autocorrelation rho(2)) occurred across
   biological levels, going from DNA methylation to gene expression to cell
   morphology. Transcriptomic analysis indicates clear effects of salinity
   and rho(2) x salinity interaction on gene expression, thus identifying
   sets of genes involved in plasticity and its evolution. These
   transcriptomic effects were independent of DNA methylation changes in
   cis. However, we did find rho(2)-specific responses of DNA methylation
   to salinity change, albeit weaker than for gene expression. Overall, we
   found consistent evolution of reduced plasticity in less predictable
   environments for DNA methylation, gene expression, and cell morphology.
   Our results provide the first clear empirical signature of plasticity
   evolution at multiple levels in response to environmental
   predictability, and highlight the importance of experimental evolution
   to address predictions from evolutionary theory, as well as investigate
   the molecular basis of plasticity evolution.},

Title = {Autotoxin-mediated latecomer killing in yeast communities},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cellular adaptation to stressful environments such as starvation is
   essential to the survival of microbial communities, but the uniform
   response of the cell community may lead to entire cell death or severe
   damage to their fitness. Here, we demonstrate an elaborate response of
   the yeast community against glucose depletion, in which the first
   adapted cells kill the latecomer cells. During glucose depletion, yeast
   cells release autotoxins, such as leucic acid and
   L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the clonal cells of the
   ones producing them. Although these autotoxins were likely to induce
   mass suicide, some cells differentiated to adapt to the autotoxins
   without genetic changes. If nondifferentiated latecomers tried to invade
   the habitat, autotoxins damaged or killed the latecomers, but the
   differentiated cells could selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant
   fission and budding yeast shared this behavior using the same
   autotoxins, suggesting that latecomer killing may be the universal
   system of intercellular communication, which may be relevant to the
   evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms.},

Title = {The rearing environment persistently modulates mouse phenotypes from the
   molecular to the behavioural level},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence
   of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of
   the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different
   phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to
   genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains
   of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on
   their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic
   plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research
   findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which
   common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the
   phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a
   comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a
   single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different
   animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being
   transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of
   the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut
   microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent
   differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice.
   Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal
   facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons
   at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin
   organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome
   assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation
   of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental
   differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific
   phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore,
   they highlight an important limitation of inferences from
   single-laboratory studies and thus argue that study designs should take
   environmental background into account to increase the robustness and
   replicability of findings.},

Abstract = {Long-term memory formation involves the reorganization of brain

   the secondary auditory cortex to immediately encode new auditory
   memories, with these new memories purely requiring the activation of
   cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation within secondary auditory
   cortex. Similar results were obtained in the anterior cingulate cortex
   for contextual fear memories. Moreover, prior learning enabled
   connections from these cortices to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to
   support recent memory retention. We propose that the reorganization of
   circuits that characterizes system consolidation occurs only in the
   first instance that an event is learned, subsequently allowing the
   immediate assimilation of new analogous events in final storage sites.},

   hypoxic coral reefs},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Connectivity of coral reef fish populations relies on successful
   dispersal of a pelagic larval phase. Pelagic larvae must exhibit high
   swimming abilities to overcome ocean and reef currents, but once
   settling onto the reef, larvae transition to endure habitats that become
   hypoxic at night. Therefore, coral reef fish larvae must rapidly and
   dramatically shift their physiology over a short period of time. Taking
   an integrative, physiological approach, using swimming respirometry, and
   examining hypoxia tolerance and transcriptomics, we show that larvae of
   cinnamon anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) rapidly transition between
   ``physiological extremes{''} at the end of their larval phase. Daily
   measurements of swimming larval anemonefish over their entire early
   development show that they initially have very high mass-specific oxygen
   uptake rates. However, oxygen uptake rates decrease midway through the
   larval phase. This occurs in conjunction with a switch in haemoglobin
   gene expression and increased expression of myoglobin, cytoglobin, and
   neuroglobin, which may all contribute to the observed increase in
   hypoxia tolerance. Our findings indicate that critical ontogenetic
   changes in the gene expression of oxygen-binding proteins may underpin
   the physiological mechanisms needed for successful larval recruitment to
   reefs.},

Title = {Optimal restoration for pollination services increases forest cover
   while doubling agricultural profits},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pollinators are currently facing dramatic declines in abundance and
   richness across the globe. This can have profound impacts on
   agriculture, as 75\% of globally common food crops benefit from
   pollination services. As many native bee species require natural areas
   for nesting, restoration efforts within croplands may be beneficial to
   support pollinators and enhance agricultural yields. Yet, restoration
   can be challenging to implement due to large upfront costs and the
   removal of land from production. Designing sustainable landscapes will
   require planning approaches that include the complex spatiotemporal
   dynamics of pollination services flowing from (restored) vegetation into
   crops. We present a novel planning framework to determine the best
   spatial arrangement for restoration in agricultural landscapes while
   accounting for yield improvements over 40 years following restoration.
   We explored a range of production and conservation goals using a coffee
   production landscape in Costa Rica as a case study. Our results show
   that strategic restoration can increase forest cover by approximately
   20\% while doubling collective landholder profits over 40 years, even
   when accounting for land taken out of production. We show that
   restoration can provide immense economic benefits in the long run, which
   may be pivotal to motivating local landholders to undertake conservation
   endeavours in pollinator-dependent croplands.},

Title = {Conifer-killing bark beetles locate fungal symbionts by detecting
   volatile fungal metabolites of host tree resin monoterpenes},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Outbreaks of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) have
   decimated millions of hectares of conifer forests in Europe in recent
   years. The ability of these 4.0 to 5.5 mm long insects to kill mature
   trees over a short period has been sometimes ascribed to two main
   factors: (1) mass attacks on the host tree to overcome tree defenses and
   (2) the presence of fungal symbionts that support successful beetle
   development in the tree. While the role of pheromones in coordinating
   mass attacks has been well studied, the role of chemical communication
   in maintaining the fungal symbiosis is poorly understood. Previous
   evidence indicates that I. typographus can distinguish fungal symbionts
   of the genera Grosmannia, Endoconidiophora, and Ophiostoma by their de
   novo synthesized volatile compounds. Here, we hypothesize that the
   fungal symbionts of this bark beetle species metabolize spruce resin
   monoterpenes of the beetle's host tree, Norway spruce (Picea abies), and
   that the volatile products are used as cues by beetles for locating
   breeding sites with beneficial symbionts. We show that Grosmannia
   penicillata and other fungal symbionts alter the profile of spruce bark
   volatiles by converting the major monoterpenes into an attractive blend
   of oxygenated derivatives. Bornyl acetate was metabolized to camphor,
   and alpha- and beta-pinene to trans-4-thujanol and other oxygenated
   products. Electrophysiological measurements showed that I. typographus
   possesses dedicated olfactory sensory neurons for oxygenated
   metabolites. Both camphor and trans-4-thujanol attracted beetles at
   specific doses in walking olfactometer experiments, and the presence of
   symbiotic fungi enhanced attraction of females to pheromones. Another
   co-occurring nonbeneficial fungus (Trichoderma sp.) also produced
   oxygenated monoterpenes, but these were not attractive to I.
   typographus. Finally, we show that colonization of fungal symbionts on
   spruce bark diet stimulated beetles to make tunnels into the diet.
   Collectively, our study suggests that the blends of oxygenated
   metabolites of conifer monoterpenes produced by fungal symbionts are
   used by walking bark beetles as attractive or repellent cues to locate
   breeding or feeding sites containing beneficial microbial symbionts. The
   oxygenated metabolites may aid beetles in assessing the presence of the
   fungus, the defense status of the host tree and the density of
   conspecifics at potential feeding and breeding sites.},

Title = {Analysis of differences and commonalities in wildlife hunting across the
   Africa-Europe South-North gradient},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally,
   with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also
   undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North.
   Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic
   and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we
   examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across
   an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human
   Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected
   area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we
   observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated,
   and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal,
   socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks
   and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North.
   Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included
   increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and
   decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as
   mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management.
   Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the
   HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges
   that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation
   across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal
   mechanisms for achieving this goal.},

Abstract = {Navigation is one of the most fundamental cognitive skills for the
   survival of fish, the largest vertebrate class, and almost all other
   animal classes. Space encoding in single neurons is a critical component
   of the neural basis of navigation. To study this fundamental cognitive
   component in fish, we recorded the activity of neurons in the central
   area of the goldfish telencephalon while the fish were freely navigating
   in a quasi-2D water tank embedded in a 3D environment. We found
   spatially modulated neurons with firing patterns that gradually
   decreased with the distance of the fish from a boundary in each cell's
   preferred direction, resembling the boundary vector cells found in the
   mammalian subiculum. Many of these cells exhibited beta rhythm
   oscillations. This type of spatial representation in fish brains is
   unique among space-encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights
   into spatial cognition in this lineage.},

Title = {Plasticity of <i>Drosophila</i> germ granules during germ cell
   development},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Compartmentalization of RNAs and proteins into membraneless structures
   called granules is a ubiquitous mechanism for organizing and regulating
   cohorts of RNAs. Germ granules are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies
   required for germline development across the animal kingdom, but their
   regulatory roles in germ cells are not fully understood. We show that
   after germ cell specification, Drosophila germ granules enlarge through
   fusion and this growth is accompanied by a shift in function. Whereas
   germ granules initially protect their constituent mRNAs from
   degradation, they subsequently target a subset of these mRNAs for
   degradation while maintaining protection of others. This functional
   shift occurs through the recruitment of decapping and degradation
   factors to the germ granules, which is promoted by decapping activators
   and renders these structures P body-like. Disrupting either the mRNA
   protection or degradation function results in germ cell migration
   defects. Our findings reveal plasticity in germ granule function that
   allows them to be repurposed at different stages of development to
   ensure population of the gonad by germ cells. Additionally, these
   results reveal an unexpected level of functional complexity whereby
   constituent RNAs within the same granule type can be differentially
   regulated.},

Title = {Hypoxia extends lifespan and neurological function in a mouse model of

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is widespread interest in identifying interventions that extend
   healthy lifespan. Chronic continuous hypoxia delays the onset of
   replicative senescence in cultured cells and extends lifespan in yeast,
   nematodes, and fruit flies. Here, we asked whether chronic continuous
   hypoxia is beneficial in mammalian aging. We utilized the Ercc1 Delta/-
   mouse model of accelerated aging given that these mice are born
   developmentally normal but exhibit anatomic, physiological, and
   biochemical features of aging across multiple organs. Importantly, they
   exhibit a shortened lifespan that is extended by dietary restriction,
   the most potent aging intervention across many organisms. We report that
   chronic continuous 11\% oxygen commenced at 4 weeks of age extends
   lifespan by 50\% and delays the onset of neurological debility in Ercc1
   Delta/- mice. Chronic continuous hypoxia did not impact food intake and
   did not significantly affect markers of DNA damage or senescence,
   suggesting that hypoxia did not simply alleviate the proximal effects of
   the Ercc1 mutation, but rather acted downstream via unknown mechanisms.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
   that ``oxygen restriction{''} can extend lifespan in a mammalian model
   of aging.},

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Bacteria that live inside the cells of insect hosts (endosymbionts) can
   alter the reproduction of their hosts, including the killing of male
   offspring (male killing, MK). MK has only been described in a few
   insects, but this may reflect challenges in detecting MK rather than its
   rarity. Here, we identify MK Wolbachia at a low frequency (around 4\%)
   in natural populations of Drosophila pseudotakahashii. MK Wolbachia had
   a stable density and maternal transmission during laboratory culture,
   but the MK phenotype which manifested mainly at the larval stage was
   lost rapidly. MK Wolbachia occurred alongside a second Wolbachia strain
   expressing a different reproductive manipulation, cytoplasmic
   incompatibility (CI). A genomic analysis highlighted Wolbachia regions
   diverged between the 2 strains involving 17 genes, and homologs of the
   wmk and cif genes implicated in MK and CI were identified in the
   Wolbachia assembly. Doubly infected males induced CI with uninfected
   females but not females singly infected with CI-causing Wolbachia. A
   rapidly spreading dominant nuclear suppressor genetic element affecting
   MK was identified through backcrossing and subsequent analysis with
   ddRAD SNPs of the D. pseudotakahashii genome. These findings highlight
   the complexity of nuclear and microbial components affecting MK
   endosymbiont detection and dynamics in populations and the challenges of
   making connections between endosymbionts and the host phenotypes
   affected by them.},

Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ecosystem processes are challenging to quantify at a community level,
   particularly within complex ecosystems (e.g., rainforests, coral reefs).
   Predation is one of the most important types of species interactions,
   determining several ecosystem processes. However, while it is widely
   recognised, it is rarely quantified, especially in aquatic systems. To
   address these issues, we model predation on fish by fish, in a
   hyperdiverse coral reef community. We show that body sizes previously
   examined in fish-fish predation studies (based on a metanalysis), only
   represent about 5\% of likely predation events. The average fish
   predator on coral reefs is just 3.65 cm; the average fish prey just 1.5
   cm. These results call for a shift in the way we view fish predation and
   its ability to shape the species or functional composition of coral reef
   fish communities. Considered from a functional group approach, we found
   general agreement in the distribution of simulated and observed
   predation events, among both predator and prey functional groups.
   Predation on coral reefs is a process driven by small fish, most of
   which are neither seen nor quantified.},
