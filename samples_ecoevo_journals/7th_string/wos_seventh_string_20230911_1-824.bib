Title = {Did pathogens facilitate the rise of endothermy?},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {The evolutionary success of endothermy in mammals and birds represents
   an enduring enigma. Relative to an ectotherm of equivalent body size,
   endotherms expend many times the energy to maintain high, stable body
   temperatures. What source or sources of selection could have favored
   such an energetically costly strategy? Several hypotheses have been
   proposed for agents of selection that may have facilitated the rise of
   endothermy, with mixed support for each. Here, I discuss the possibility
   that an additional agent of selection, pathogens, may have played an
   important role in the evolution and maintenance of obligate endothermy
   in mammals and birds. I draw on recent work demonstrating that the
   immune system is highly thermally sensitive and individuals that
   maintain warm body temperatures have enhanced ability to reduce pathogen
   burdens. To further increase immune function when encountering a
   pathogen, ectotherms often employ the environmentally constrained and
   costly strategy of behavioral fever, whereas endotherms maintain body
   temperatures close to the optimum for immune performance at most times,
   essentially `priming' their immune systems for a rapid response to
   infection. An evolutionary arms race in an ancient ectotherm, in which
   better behavioral thermoregulators were favored by increasingly virulent
   pathogens (and vice versa) could have contributed to the evolution of
   obligate endothermy in mammals and birds.},

Pages = {12-16},
Abstract = {Screens are an ineliminable component of contemporary society for most
   humans. Consequently, tools and ideas that provide a heuristic and
   support for conceptually mitigating and balancing the costs of screen
   times at an individual level are critical. Here, screen adaptation
   theory (SAT) is proposed as a shorthand tool to frame the wealth of
   research examining human-screen interactions. Screens are best
   conceptualized as a place. Adaptation (to screens) are acquired or
   cultivated traits that enable us to not only survive with screens but
   potentially thrive-provided that we leverage research on costs and
   benefits. Adaptive behavioral traits suggest that we approach these
   interactions with purposeful intent. Finally, the theory associated with
   humans with screens is rich and interdisciplinary. We must design and
   adopt principles from theory relevant to our work, leisure, and
   individual choices to use screens as we move from tolerance to
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {Stories shape the human experience. Fairy tales, fables, and historical
   stories from many peoples influence contemporary culture and science.
   The Little Prince is an excellent example of a short tale that
   highlights the relative importance of living with ecology and
   connectedness. It also clearly illuminates the absurdity that can emerge
   when one becomes isolated from even the simple processes associated with
   the functioning of other natural systems or from ecological
   interactions. This is one of many excellent stories that can be used in
   teaching science to frame theory for learners into different and larger
   novel contexts. This fairy tale provides morals for daily living
   too-tend to your garden, watch sunsets, and use nature to tame your
   absurd life and connect to others. We use humour, stories, and current
   cultural memes from television and movies in many publications and/or
   their titles and in classroom lessons. Looking more broadly for tales
   and stories from different cultures and times promotes justice and
   openness.},

   calling for social momentum to effectively be activated; this vision

Title = {Phylogeny can inform animal model development for both inherited and

   Spectrum Disorders (FASD)},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The use of animal models in research on human and veterinary diseases
   and disorders is retracting, though it is likely to remain critical for
   decades. In light of increasing regulation and expectations of judicious
   use of animal subjects, we examine the idea that the use of animal
   models can be guided by phylogenetic relationships and modern
   evolutionary and cladistic analyses. Given that inherited disorders, and
   indeed, even the developmental and physiological responses to non
   inherited conditions, are subject to evolutionary forces, it follows
   that the observed differences in model organisms are the products of
   evolutionary divergence. Understanding that divergence has the potential
   to elucidate which taxa are most likely to exhibit any given symptom or
   manifest a reaction in a broadly predictable fashion. We examine two
   case studies, one the inherited disorder Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,
   and the other an entirely environmentally induced problem, Fetal Alcohol
   Spectrum Disorder, or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Both case studies reveal
   symptoms are largely congruent with phylogeny, suggesting relatively
   conservative evolution of developmental pathways. It follows that it is
   possible to characterize the manifestation of symptoms or
   dysmorphologies to broad phylogenetic groups. These data can then be
   used to inform research into possible treatments based on molecular
   genetic techniques sourced from unaffected taxa or even provide an
   evolutionary rationale for maximizing ethical decisions in the use and
   development of animal models in biomedical research. We argue that the
   technique should become standard practice in the development of animal
   models.},

Title = {Think like a Bayesian and avoid pitfalls from our frequentist past},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Bayesian inference is a powerful tool that is increasingly being used by
   ecologists. This is largely due to the flexibility in model
   specification and improvements in software that makes this tool easier
   to use. However, with increasing ease of use comes a risk of misuse or
   abuse. We review four major issues we have identified in the use of
   Bayesian methods and offer reminders and suggestions that will improve
   the application and reporting of Bayesian inference while at the same
   time, hopefully, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued null hypothesis
   statistical testing (NHST). These issues include; 1) understanding
   software and model specification; 2) use of prior probability
   distributions; 3) maximizing utility of posterior probability
   distributions; and 4) avoiding dichotomous thinking (i e , the NHST
   pitfall). We suggest ecologists should strive for openness in their use
   of statistical software by understanding their model and providing the
   full computer code used, develop reasonable and informative priors, and
   make full use of posterior information that Bayesian methods provide. At
   the same time, ecologists should avoid dichotomizing results into
   significant/non-significant boxes, eliminate null hypothesis tests
   (including probability intervals for hypothesis testing), and use clear
   language when describing results. Finally, quantitative training should
   be expanded in undergraduate curricula to provide students with a larger
   suite of foundational core concepts that extend beyond NHST.},

Title = {A paradigm for the evolution of human features: Apes trapped on barren
   volcanic islands},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {The aquatic ape hypothesis for human evolution can account for all the
   traits that distinguish humans from chimpanzees. This scientific
   paradigm has been considered impossible. It would require that human
   ancestors maintained a semiaquatic lifestyle for millions of years,
   whereas hominin fossils indicate relatively dry terrestrial
   environments. Here I propose a marine aquatic evolution that is
   speculative, but compatible with all the fossil and genetic evidence. In
   this hypothesis, hominins evolved from chimpanzee-like apes that became
   stranded on proto-Bioko-new volcanic islands with no terrestrial foods
   available. The apes were forced to eat shellfish and seaweed. From
   wading in water on two legs to obtain food, their bodies evolved to
   become bipedal. Naked skin, blubber, and protruding noses were also
   aquatic adaptations. Brain-size increase resulted from marine fatty acid
   DHA. Some of these hominins escaped to mainland Africa and their bipedal
   descendants are recorded at the famous fossil sites. The volcanic
   islands grew and evolved into Bioko, and the hominins that remained
   there evolved into Homo sapiens. They gave up their marine diet and
   semiaquatic habitat after food became available on the evolving island.
   Then, during one of the low sea-level stands in the Pleistocene epoch,
   humans walked to the mainland on the emergent Bioko land bridge. Unlike
   earlier aquatic ape ideas, the Bioko scenario can be tested by DNA. If
   the human genome includes a retrovirus that is otherwise only found in
   endemic animals on Bioko, it would show that our ancestors came from
   there. Unfortunately, Bioko and west-central Africa are not interesting
   to traditional paleoanthropologists, because they do not contain
   fossils.},

Title = {Evolution of the seed habit: Is niche construction a missing component?},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Evolution of land plants is one of the major transitions in the history
   of life on Earth. In this process, evolution of seeds constitutes one of
   the key events, liberating plants from dependence of free external water
   for fertilization, thus promoting colonization of dry environments and
   the build-up of terrestrial ecosystems. Previous explanations of
   evolution of seeds from heterosporous predecessors have been based on a
   framework of kin and sexual selection theory. Here I suggest that that
   niche construction is a missing component in these explanations. During
   colonization of increasingly drier habitats, the heterosporous life
   cycle was subjected to strong spatial and temporal gradients in water
   availability. The ancestral condition of separate niches of the
   sporophyte and female gametophyte generations changed into a situation
   where the sporophyte generation provided the means by which female
   gametophytes could develop, in effect `constructing' the recruitment
   niche for the female gametophyte, attached to the sporophyte. Selection
   favored modifications in the developmental program, altering the
   relative timing of fertilization and dispersal. Kin and sexual selection
   processes could then play out in the context of a plant life cycle where
   fertilization preceded dispersal, eventually forming the seed habit.
   Niche construction by the sporophyte removed the ecological independence
   of the two generations; the sporophyte provided the female gametophyte
   with a recruitment niche, transforming the biphasic life cycle into a
   unitary life cycle, and promoted an expansion of the ecological niche
   zone for land plants, eventually leading to a vegetation covering most
   parts of the land mass.},

Title = {The nine classes of plant-plant replacement},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-34},
Abstract = {Current models of plant community dynamics have fallen short both of
   conceptualizing plant communities well and of giving researchers a tool
   that accurately predicts their dynamics. Here I present a new idea of
   how that conceptual model should be constructed. I begin with the
   observation that space is a critical component of plant life and how it
   changes determines-to a large extent- how individual plants change. I
   then define that space as consisting of the phyto-space, which the
   phyto-mass (biomass plus necromass) occupies, and the neighborhood space
   around that phyto-space where a plant can influence, and be influenced
   by, other plants. I posit that it is how plants that make up a community
   replace themselves over time, as their phyto-spaces and neighborhood
   spaces change, that is the fundamental process of plant community
   dynamics. Those plant-plant replacements fall into nine distinct classes
   that extend the concept of replacement to include new space created not
   just by whole plant mortality, but also by plant tissue loss. Finally, I
   suggest that because most plant-plant replacements involve seeds,
   seedlings and saplings, the mechanisms and tolerances of predation,
   pathogens, germination, heibivory and seedling/sapling competition will
   be most critical in determining the plant-plant replacements in any
   plant community and its resulting dynamics.},

   to ask users questions about their experience with the methodology.
   Responses indicate an enthusiastic endorsement of SEM. Two major
   elements of respondent's experiences seem to contribute to their
   positive response, (1) a sense that they are obtaining more accurate
   explanatory understanding through the use of SEM and (2) excitement
   generated by the discovery of novel insights into their systems. We
   elaborate here on the detection of indirect effects, offsetting effects,
   and suppressed effects, and demonstrate how discovering these effects
   can advance ecology.},

Title = {Late-acting self-incompatibility and a narrow floral tube as selective
   forces for stylar dimorphism in Narcissus (Amaryllidaceae)},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-73},
Abstract = {Most heterostylous species show self- and intra-morph incompatibility
   and models established for such taxa have traditionally been applied to
   the evolution of stylar dimorphism and heterostyly in Narcissus, a genus
   with late-acting self-incompatibility. The model of Lloyd and Webb
   (1992a,b) proposed that, in an approach-herkogamous ancestor, stylar
   dimorphism and heterostyly appeared consecutively as a result of two
   single mutations selected positively to enhance cross-pollination Most
   polymorphic Narcissus are stylar dimorphic with two anther whorls, the
   lower positioned in the middle of a narrow floral tube, and style
   lengths that locate the stigmas above or below the low-level anthers.
   Here, I propose that in an ancestor with open-tubed flowers, late-acting
   self-incompatibility and variable style length, the narrowing of the
   floral tube increased self-pollination and ovule discounting in
   individuals with the stigma at the same height as the low-level anthers,
   imposing disruptive selection against this phenotype and causing the
   bimodal distribution of style lengths. This hypothesis stresses the need
   of avoiding self-interference for the selection of stylar dimorphism. It
   does not exclude the promotion of cross-pollination as a force for
   subsequent evolution of heterostyly in the genus nor the need of
   inter-morph pollination for the maintenance of polymorphism.},

Title = {Stick supply to nests by cliff-nesting raptors as an evolutionary load
   of past tree-nesting},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-25},
Abstract = {The supply of sticks to cliff nests by many European raptors has been
   explained only as a functional means of decreasing ectoparasite loads in
   nests and for signalling nest occupancy. We provide here a historical
   explanation of this behaviour as we consider it represents an
   evolutionary load of formerly tree-nesting species. Basically, from this
   perspective, facultative tree/cliff-nesting species reproduce the nests
   they used to build originally on top of trees, but on cliffs.
   Facultative species (likely evolved in forested areas) that supply their
   cliff nests with sticks include Pandion haliaetus, Haliaetus albicilla,
   Milvus migrans, Circaetus gallicus, Buteo buteo, Aquila fasciata, A.
   pennata, A. chrysaetos, A. heliaca, Gypaetus barbatus Gyps fulvus and
   Neophron percnopterus. On the contrary, the only Falco species that
   solely nests in cliffs (F. eleonorae)) and does not supply its nests
   with sticks and should be considered a true cliff-nester, likely evolved
   in non-forested areas. All other Falco species that do not supply their
   cliff nests with sticks but can make use of tree nests made by other
   non-raptorial species, should also be considered as true cliff-nesters,
   likely evolved in more forested areas or times. Milvus milvus, Elanus
   caeruleus, Accipiter nisus, A. gentilis, Pernis apivorus, Aquila
   adalberti, A. clanga, A. pomarina and Aegypius monachus are true tree
   nesters, likely evolved in forested areas, which did not evolve the
   plasticity to nest directly on cliffs.},

Title = {The sexual selection of hominin bipedalism},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-60},
Abstract = {In this article, I advance a novel hypothesis on the evolution of
   hominin bipedalism. I begin by arguing extensively for how the
   transition to bipedalism must have been problematic for hominins during
   the Neogene. Due to this and the fact that no other primate has made the
   unusual switch to bipedalism, it seems likely that the selection
   pressure towards bipedalism was unusually strong. With this in mind, I
   briefly lay out some of the most promising hypotheses on the
   evolutionary origin of hominin bipedalism and show how most, if not all,
   fail in the face of the need for an unusually strong selection pressure.
   For example, some hypotheses maintain that hominins became bipedal so
   they could use their hands for carrying infants, food, or other valuable
   objects. But extant apes are able to carry objects in one of their front
   limbs (while walking with the other three), and thus it does not seem
   plausible that our hominin ancestors went through the troublesome
   transition to bipedalism just so they could carry objects a little more
   efficiently. After I show that past hypotheses are wanting in the face
   of this challenge, I argue that there is only one selection pressure
   powerful enough to instigate a strange and problematic evolutionary
   adaptation like bipedalism, and that is sexual selection. Specifically,
   from the fact that bipedal locomotion is an important strategy for
   intimidating others and ascending the dominance hierarchy in extant
   apes, I argue that for no particular selective reason bipedal locomotion
   became a signal for high fitness (much as a large and intricate tail
   became a signal for high fitness for peahens), and this led to the trait
   being continuously reinforced in spite of all its deleterious fitness
   consequences.},

Title = {Meiosis decreases recombination load; Mitosis increases recombination
   load},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-28},
Abstract = {Chiasmata are necessary for proper chromosomal segregation, but can
   result in inadvertent recombination. Bernstein and Michod demonstrated
   that meiosis evolved as a means of error correction, not genetic mixing.
   Therefore meiotic recombination is not the sine qua non of sex, but is
   instead an epiphenomenon of imperfect meiotic error correction. By
   correcting against recombinant genotypes, meiosis reduces recombination
   load, thereby providing an unappreciated selective advantage for sex.
   Sex reducing recombination load should be integrated into population
   genetic models of multi-locus epistasis for maintenance of sex and may
   explain sequestration of germ lines in animals We predict that eumetazoa
   have less recombination load than sexual organisms without a germ line.
   Mitosis largely lacks the error correction of meiosis, destroys linkage
   through ubiquitous mitotic recombination, and thereby increases
   recombination load, especially in co-adapted gene complexes. Meiosis and
   possibly karyogamy provide an unexpected benefit to sex, offsetting at
   least some of the famed costs of sex.},

Title = {Transformative choices towards a sustainable academic publishing system},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-30},
Abstract = {Communicating new scientific discoveries is key to human progress. Yet,
   this endeavor has been increasingly hindered by monetary restrictions
   that restrain scientists from publishing their findings and accessing
   other scientists' reports. This process is further exacerbated by a
   large portion of publishing media owned by private companies that, in
   contrast with journals from scientific societies, do not reinject
   academic publishing benefits into the scientific community. As the
   academic world is not exempt from economic crises and funding
   restrictions, new alternatives are necessary to support a fair and
   economically sustainable publishing system for scientists and society as
   a whole. After summarizing major shortcomings of academic publishing
   today, we present several solutions that span the levels of the
   individual scientist, the scientific community, and the publisher to
   initiate a transformative change towards more sustainable scientific
   publishing. By providing a voice to the many scientists who are
   fundamental protagonists, yet often powerless witnesses, of the academic
   publishing system, as well as a roadmap for implementing solutions, we
   hope this initiative will go beyond sparking increased awareness and
   promote a shift towards more sustainable scientific publishing
   practices.},

Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-46},
Abstract = {Pursuing a graduate degree is difficult. To succeed, students must
   overcome a myriad of ill-defined, and often unforeseen, challenges. One
   major obstacle lies in publishing their work. In this perspective, I
   provide a detailed description of my own working system that matured
   late in my graduate career but still paid dividends in terms of my
   publication record, funding success, and work-life balance. I also
   include brief vignettes of other topics that were crucial to my own
   scientific development. While I organized this essay as a series of
   ``rules{''}, I don't mean to imply that graduate school nor academia has
   a specific formula for success. Not only does it not, but as a
   first-year postdoctoral researcher, I can only speak to what works in
   graduate school through the lens of my own experiences. My experience is
   particularly relevant, however, because unlike many who have offered
   similar advice in the past, I drafted this perspective in the months
   that followed my degree. Rather, I offer these rules as a starting point
   for you to take, consider, and mold into your own framework. I am
   confident, however, that there is commonality among the ideas described
   here and the general habits of successful academics. In writing this
   perspective, I had three primary goals: (1) To add a more detailed,
   recent perspective to previous, more general essays on this topic. (2)
   To bridge an apparent disconnect between successful faculty and graduate
   students. Essentially, the advice in this essay may be obvious to a
   seasoned academic while simultaneously highly relevant, and interesting,
   to an early career student. And finally, (3) I hope to help dispel myths
   graduate students may hold about the innate talent or expertise needed
   to succeed in graduate school and to demystify the day-to-day work side
   of the equation. Simply put, I'm not a scientific outlier. But with good
   organizational skills, a diligent writing habit, and some invaluable
   mentoring, I made it to the light at the end of the tunnel (and into a
   career-progressing position). You can too.},

Title = {The third dimension: How fire-related research can advance ecology and
   evolutionary biology},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-58},
Abstract = {Most of the Earth's vegetated surface is fireprone but the relevance of
   fire in understanding how nature works is not always recognized. We aim
   to show that, by adding the fire dimension to observations on biological
   phenomena, interpretations can be improved; how fire-related research
   can be used to answer `fundamental' questions in ecology; and how
   theories/models developed for fireprone ecosystems can be applied to
   advancing disturbance ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology
   more generally. We compiled lists from the world-wide web of the most
   highly cited papers in fire ecology, and examined papers that had been
   approached from multiple viewpoints, including fire. We show that great
   advances over the last 20 years have been made in our understanding of
   the pivotal role of fire as a driver of many ecological processes and a
   powerful selective agent/evolutionary trigger among biota. We document
   21 sets of observations originally interpreted in the context of the two
   traditional dimensions, prevailing environment and biotic interactions,
   but can also be shown to have a strong, if not dominant, historical link
   to fire. We note that fire-related research is able to address 55 of the
   100 questions considered `fundamental' in ecology and that many have
   already received some attention in fireprone ecosystems. We show how
   theories/models that had their origins in fireprone systems can be
   applied to other disturbance-prone systems and thus have wide
   application in ecology and evolutionary biology. Fire and other
   disturbances should be included as variables in research about possible
   critical environmental and biotic constraints controlling ecosystem
   function in general. Adding this third dimension to research endeavours
   greatly enriches our understanding of how nature works at the global
   scale in an era where ecosystems are changing rapidly and novel
   species-environmental interactions are emerging.},

Title = {Teaching post-secondary students in ecology and evolution: Strategies
   for early-career researchers},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-24},
Abstract = {Teaching can be a rewarding, yet challenging, experience for early
   career researchers (ECRs) in fields like ecology and evolution. Much of
   this challenge arises from the reality that ECRs in ecology and
   evolution typically receive little, if any, pedagogical training or
   advice on how to balance teaching, research (which can include extended
   field work), and other demands on their time. Here, we aim to provide
   accessible, pragmatic advice for ECRs in ecology and evolution who are
   given the opportunity to teach (as instructor of record). The advice is
   based on the authors' collective experiences teaching in ecology and
   evolution as ECRs and is meant to help ECRs address two challenges: a)
   balancing the demands of teaching against one's research, service, and
   personal life, and b) being effective in the classroom while doing so.
   The guidance we provide includes practical steps to take when teaching
   for the first time, including carefully refining the syllabus (course
   planning), adopting `non-traditional' teaching methods, and taking
   advantage of free teaching resources. We also discuss a range of `soft
   skills' to consider, including guarding against imposter syndrome (i.e.,
   self-doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud), managing expectations,
   being empathetic, compassionate, authentic, and fostering an inclusive
   classroom. Lastly, we emphasize the need to focus on developing
   students' critical thinking skills, integrating research and teaching
   where possible, and setting limits on class preparation time to maintain
   balance with your research and personal life. Collectively, we hope the
   examples provided here offer a useful guide to ECRs new to teaching.},

Abstract = {A capybara jaw (Rodentia, Caviidae, Hydrochoerinae) and an isolated
   lower tooth fragment were recovered from dredge spoils on Pelican Island
   in Galveston Bay, Gulf Coast of Texas. The attached matrix on the jaw
   and most of the dredged material is clay, indicative of the latest
   Pleistocene Beaumont Formation which underlies the Holocene deposits. In
   the latest Pleistocene (Rancholabrean) of the United States, capybaras
   are known from along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts in Texas, Florida,
   Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia. These Rancholabrean capybaras
   have been assigned to three different taxa: Neochoerus pinckneyi Hay,
   1923 for the largest size specimens, Hydrochoerus holmesi Simpson, 1928
   for the somewhat smaller specimens, or Neochoerus aesopi Leidy, 1853, a
   name that had been considered invalid because it was not adequately
   diagnosed, if there is only one late Pleistocene species of North
   American capybara.
   The p4 in the new Texas mandible is much smaller than the genotype of N.
   pinckneyi from the Aransas River in South Texas and similar in size to
   H. holmesi from the Pleistocene of Florida and Recent H. hydrochaeris.
   However cheek tooth size and occlusal pattern in Recent capybaras varies
   significantly with age. Hydrochoerus holmesi cannot be distinguished
   from N. pinckneyi. None of the late Pleistocene capybaras of South
   Carolina, including the type and referred specimens of N. aesopi, have
   any characteristics to differentiate them from H. holmesi or N.
   pinckneyi. We therefore assign all the Texas and South Carolina
   specimens to N. aesopi.},

Title = {Deciphering the many maps of the Xingu River Basin - an assessment of
   land cover classifications at multiple scales},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {166},

Abstract = {Remote sensing is an invaluable tool to objectively illustrate the rapid
   decline in habitat extents worldwide. The many operational Earth
   Observation platforms provide options for the generation of land cover
   maps, each with unique characteristics and considerable semantic
   differences in the definition of classes. As a result, differences in
   baseline estimates are inevitable. Here we compare forest cover and
   surface water estimates over four time periods spanning three decades
   (1989-2018) for similar to 1.3 million km(2) encompassing the Xingu
   River Basin, Brazil, from published, freely accessible remotely sensed
   land cover classifications. While all showed a decrease in forest extent
   over time, the total deforested area reported by each ranged widely for
   all time periods. The greatest differences ranged from 9\% to 17\%
   (116,958 to 219,778 km(2)) deforestation of the total area for year 2000
   and 2014-2018 time period, respectively. We also show the high
   sensitivity of forest fragmentation metrics (entropy and foreground area
   density) to data quality and spatial resolution, with cloud cover and
   sensor artefacts resulting in errors. Surface water classifications must
   be chosen carefully because sources differ greatly in location and
   mapped area of surface water. After operationalization of the Belo Monte
   dam complex, the large reservoirs are notably absent from several of the
   classifications illustrating land cover. Freshwater ecosystem health is
   influenced by the land cover surrounding water bodies (e.g., riparian
   zones). Understanding differences between the many remotely sensed
   baselines is fundamentally important to avoid information misuse, and to
   objectively choose the most appropriate classification for ecological
   studies, conservation, or policy making. The differences between the
   classifications examined here are not a failure of the technology, but
   due to different interpretations of `forest cover' and characteristics
   of the input data (e.g., spatial resolution). Our findings demonstrate
   the importance of transparency in the generation of remotely sensed
   classifications and the need for users to familiarize themselves with
   the characteristics and limitations of each data set.},

Title = {Body shape separates guilds of rheophilic herbivores (Myleinae:
   Serrasalmidae) better than feeding morphology},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {166},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Herbivorous fishes feed on stems, leaves, flowers, seeds, fruits, and
   nuts of diverse aquatic plants, as well as algae. Pacus are the
   herbivorous cousins of piranhas and consume a myriad of diets comprised
   of these plant products, but a few species are phytophages, herbivores
   that feed almost exclusively on rapids-dwelling (rheophilic) riverweed
   plants from the family Podostemaceae. The degree to which pacus feed on
   riverweed varies from obligate year-round consumption to strictly
   seasonal, facultative feeding. Obligate phytophages feed heavily on
   riverweed and strictly occur in river rapids, while facultative
   phytophages only consume riverweed during seasons with low flow. Does
   ecological specialization (diet) beget morphological specialization in
   the feeding apparatus and/or body shape of phytophages? Under a
   phylogenetic framework, we used microcomputed tomography (mu CT)
   scanning to compare functional feeding traits among 26 species of
   serrasalmids, four of which are obligate phytophages. We also compared
   body shape between pacus using geometric morphometrics to identify
   potential locomotor adaptations for rheophily. Obligate phytophages have
   dentitions and slicing jaws well-suited for shearing fleshy plant
   material relative to other pacus, which are equipped with fruit and seed
   crushing morphologies. Unrelated obligate phytophages have also
   converged on a similar body shape that is distinct from sympatric
   congeneric herbivores. Phytophagy involves more consistent changes to
   body shape than to feeding morphology, suggesting that body shape has
   more important ties to},

Abstract = {Microsternarchus bilineatus Fernandez-Yepez, 1968 is a small,
   inconspicuous electric fish distributed in the Orinoco, Amazon and
   Tocantins basins. Its holotype and paratypes from Rio San Jose, a
   tributary of Rio Guariquito, Orinoco basin, Venezuela, are apparently
   lost. We examined 14 specimens collected in Rio San Bartolo, also a
   tributary of Rio Guariquito, 110 km by river from Rio San Jose. Because
   of its proximity to the type locality and apparent conformity to the
   original description, we used these newly collected specimens to
   redescribe M. bilineatus using external morphology, morphometrics,
   meristics, and osteology including high-resolution X-ray computed
   tomography.
   In order to address geographic variation we compared Rio San Bartolo
   specimens with others of, or close to, M. bilineatus from Casiquiare
   river and from two streams in Roraima state, Brazil. In our analysis
   specimens from distant localities differ in the interobital distance and
   mouth size, number of anal-fin rays and skeletal features in the dentary
   and cranial fontanelles. Detailed revision of the genus will require a
   stable description of type species. Therefore, we designate INHS 111262
   as neotype for M. bilineatus.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of pathological conditions is usually centered on
   human and domesticated species. Thus, a vast array of pathologies within
   vertebrates are unknown, especially those that occur in exotics and
   those that lack external characters, such as conditions that affect the
   skeleton. Exotics represent a majority of the vertebrates housed in zoos
   and other wildlife centers, and in the larger picture of conservation,
   represent the best way to determine potential health threats and cures
   for endangered and threatened species in the wild. Here we describe a
   case of acromegaly, a rare condition of excess growth hormone, in a hog
   badger (Arctonyx collaris) based on Computed Tomography (CT). This is
   the first documented occurrence of this condition in non-human or
   non-domesticated mammals, and the first occurrence within Mustelidae.
   The recognition of this rare condition within a badger suggests that
   acromegaly may be more widespread within mammals than previously
   thought, and has implications for diagnosis of other exotics within
   zoos.},

Title = {Cichla cataractae (Cichliformes: Cichlidae), new species of peacock bass

Abstract = {A new species of peacock bass, Cichla cataractae, is distinguished from
   all congeners by molecular evidence and unique patterns of adult and
   juvenile pigmentation. Juveniles (<150 mm SL) have sides of body
   dominated by a series of three conspicuous dark blotches with the one
   below soft dorsal fin largest, attenuated posteriorly (long teardrop
   shape) but distinctly separated from elliptical caudal blotch; same
   blotches eventually with pale border (ocellated) in largest juveniles.
   Adult pattern on sides dominated by two distinct dark blotches, each one
   ocellated; anterior blotch rounded, located below anterior base of
   spinous dorsal fin and not extending above anterior lateral line;
   posterior blotch highly irregular in shape, located below soft dorsal
   fin and often displaced dorsally; additional dark blotch below posterior
   base of spinous dorsal fin generally absent or small, ocellated or not,
   and level with anterior blotch; vertical bars on sides generally absent
   or faint; postorbital stripe always present, highly broken into
   irregular series of dark spots, each one usually ocellated. Cichla
   cataractae is endemic to the Essequibo Basin where it typically inhabits
   rocky shoals in river channels with swift current. The new species is
   sympatric with the more widely distributed C. ocellaris, a species that
   prefers lentic habitats. Molecular analysis supports C. cataractae as a
   distinct lineage in a clade of Cichla containing C. temensis, C.
   melaniae, C. mirianae, C. piquiti and C. pinima. The oldest extant
   specimens of the new species were collected by Carl H. Eigenmann in 1908
   and documented in his seminal ``The Freshwater Fishes of British
   Guiana{''} (Eigenmann, 1912).},

Title = {Second species of Langlieria (Tristichopteridae, Sarcopterygii) from the
   Upper Devonian Catskill Formation of Pennsylvania, USA, and a new
   phylogenetic consideration of Tristichopteridae},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA},

Volume = {167},

Pages = {241-260},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A new species of Langlieria is described from the Upper Devonian
   (Frasnian) Irish Valley Member of the Catskill Formation. The type
   material was collected from a road cut exposure on the north side of the
   westbound lanes of Pennsylvania Route 322 west of Port Matilda, Centre
   County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The new species of Langlieria, the second
   from the Catskill Formation, is represented by high quality cranial
   material including parietal and postparietal shields, cheek, principal
   gular, and lower jaw; fin material; and body scales. The new species is
   the fourth tristichopterid to be described from the Catskill Formation
   (after Hyneria lindae, Langlieria radiatus, and Eusthenodon bourdont)
   and the first from the Irish Valley Member. It is also the first species
   of Langlieria with a known record in the Frasnian. Sedimentological and
   stratigraphic data suggest that the discovery site represents a distal,
   tide-dominated location within the Catskill Delta system with a greater
   marine influence than has been reconstructed for the previously
   described Catskill Formation tristichopterids. A new phylogenetic
   analysis of Tristichopteridae is presented that is the first to include
   the new species of Langlieria described here and E. bourdoni from the
   Cogan House Exit Ramp locality (Famemdan, Duncalmon Member) along U.S.
   Route 15/Interstate 99. The 50\% majority-rule consensus tree from the
   analysis supports a highly-nested Glade of tristichopterids that
   includes all of the considered species from the Famemdan, with the
   exception of Heddleichthys dalgleisiensis, and additionally includes the
   Frasnian Langlieria species that is described here.},

Title = {Types of Ampullariidae (Mollusca: Gastropoda) in the Academy of Natural

Abstract = {The Ampullariidae Gray, 1824 constitute a family of freshwater
   caenogastropods predominantly distributed in humid tropical and
   subtropical habitats in Africa, South and Central America and Asia. They
   include the largest of all freshwater snails and frequently comprise a
   major portion of the native freshwater mollusc faunas of these regions.
   Ampullariid taxonomy is confused, primarily because most species were
   described on the basis of shell morphology alone, which is highly
   variable within species yet relatively conservative among species within
   the family. The need for rigorous taxonomic treatment of the group is
   acute and the basis for such research is comprehensive study of type
   material. With type or possible type material of 31 nominal
   species-group taxa of Ampullariidae, belonging to the genera Felipponea
   Dalt, 1919 (1 taxon, South America), Lanistes Montfort, 1810 (6 taxa,
   Africa), Marisa Gray, 1824 (1, South America), Pila Roding, 1798 (1,
   Asia; 4 Africa), and Pomacea Perry, 1810 (17, South, Central, North
   America), as well as 1 incertae sedis taxon in New World Ampullariidae,
   the Academy of Natural Sciences has significant holdings, for which this
   annotated catalogue is provided. Information in each account includes
   original name and combination, citation to the original description,
   current taxonomic status, type material held by the Academy of Natural
   Sciences (holotypes, a neotype, paratypes, lectotypes, paralectotypes)
   with catalogue number(s) and number of specimens in each catalogue lot,
   type locality, collectors and dates of collection, and other remarks or
   additional information as appropriate. A lectotype is designated for
   Ampullaria peafiana Lea, 1838, and a neotype is designated for Pomacea
   paludosa flava Smith, 1937. All name-bearing types are illustrated.},

Abstract = {New fossils of ``Gyracanthus{''} sherwoodi Newberry, 1889 are described
   primarily from the Late Devonian Red Hill site and Metzger's Quarry
   (Catskill Formation, late Famennian) of Clinton and Sullivan Counties in
   central Pennsylvania. The fossils include ornamented prepectoral ventral
   plates, pectoral, pelvic, and dorsal fin spines, elements of the
   endoskeletal shoulder girdle (procoracoid and scapulocoracoid), scales,
   and possible anal fin spines. We distinguish between anterior and
   posterior dorsal fin spines. A growth series of elements, described for
   the first time for a gyracanth, show that the adults of this taxon
   reached about a meter in length, and juveniles already had ossified
   endoskeletal pectoral elements at body lengths 300-400 mm. The mainly
   cartilaginous skeleton, paired fin spines, shoulder girdle structure,
   and scale growth are consistent with gyracanthids being stem
   chondrichthyans. ``Gyracanthus{''} sherwoodi lived in non-marine
   conditions in the eastern Laurentian rivers and deltas.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Alburnus heckeli Battalgil 1944 is endemic to Lake Bazar in the
   Euphrates-Tigris River system (Persian Gulf basin) and shares
   morphological and molecular characters with the widespread species A.
   sellal Heckel 1843, except putatively for the number of gill rakers.
   This study compared morphometric and meristic data for A. heckeli with
   lentic and lotic populations of A. sellal. The only significant
   difference was in the number of gill rakers in lotic populations of A.
   sellal (10-25) vs. lentic populations of A. sellal (26-35) and A.
   heckeli (28-35). Although our results are consistent with the
   interpretation of A. heckeli and A. sellal as ``young species{''}, the
   amiguity of available morphological and molecular sequence data suggest
   that A. heckeli is best treated as a junior synonym of A. sellal until
   reliable differences are found.},

Abstract = {During a pilot survey, sponges and mollusks were sampled from the bottom
   of the middle Xingu River (rapids) and lower Xingu River (ria) via
   hand-picking in shallows and trawling and surface-supplied dives in
   deeper waters. The survey revealed a benthic community composed of eight
   sponge species in four genera and three families, and added six species
   to the Xingu Basin fauna. Sponges exhibited distinct variation in body
   shape corresponding to local environmental conditions such as water
   depth, current velocity and available substrates. Sponges inhabiting
   rocky bottoms in swift currents (rapids) typically formed crusts. Those
   in the deeper, calmer waters of the ria attained massive and elaborate
   forms while attached to infaunal bivalves. Oncosclera navicella and
   Drulia cristata exhibited crusts and massive forms as adaptations to
   rapids and ria, respectively. In the middle to lower Xingu, sponges
   encrusted the shells of eleven species of bivalves (seven infaunal,
   three epifaunal, and one infaunal/epifaunal) and one infaunal/epifaunal
   gastropod. Bivalves provide key substrates for supporting sponges above
   the sand, mud and detritus of the Xingu ria. Potential impacts of the
   Belo Monte Dam complex on the sponge fauna of the middle Xingu rapids
   are discussed.},

Title = {Satan's skeleton revealed: a tomographic and comparative osteology of
   Satan eurystomus, the subterranean Widemouth Blindcat (Siluriformes,
   Ictaluridae)},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {117-173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Widemouth Blindcat, Satan eurystomus Hubbs and Bailey 1947, was the
   second of four stygobitic species of Ictaluridae discovered in the
   subterranean waters of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. The
   skeletal anatomy of Satan has been scarcely known from a few, dated
   radiographs. Using additional radiographs and high resolution
   CT-datasets for two well-ossified specimens, we applied high-resolution
   X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) to visualize, illustrate and describe
   the bony skeleton of Satan. We also provide an online archive of still
   and animated tomographic images of the skeletal anatomy of this
   little-known species.
   The skeleton and soft anatomy of Satan are distinctive. Twelve skeletal
   autapomorphies are described that singularly distinguish Satan within
   Ictaluridae and, probably in combination, from all other catfishes. Some
   of these are reductive losses or simplifications of skull bones (e.g.
   loss of one infraorbital bone; reduced ornamentation of the pterotic
   bone) and joint complexity (e.g. simple overlapping frontal-lateral
   ethmoid articulation; loosely ligamentous interopercle-posterior
   ceratohyal joint). Some of the autapomorphies are anatomically and
   perhaps developmentally complex (e.g. a novel series of three midline
   joints closing a middle span of the posterior cranial fontanel; a deeply
   excavated temporal fossa and an unusually enlarged interhyal bone). The
   tiny dorsal-fin spinelet (first lepidotrich) of Satan has a novel peaked
   and twisted shape.
   Ten apparent and exclusive synapomorphies within Ictaluridae gathered
   from this and previous studies suggest that Satan and Pylodictis are
   closest relatives. Most of these are functionally related to prey
   detection and suction feeding: fusion of the symphyseal mandibular
   sensory pores and increase in the number of preoperculo-mandibular canal
   pores; depressed, flattened heads and wide transverse mouths; prominent
   posterior process of the lateral ethmoid alongside and below the frontal
   bone margin; vertical and blade-like supraoccipital posterior process;
   unique arrangement of the parasagittal and occipital muscle attachment
   crests on the skull roof; large triangular panel of integument within
   the operculum framed by the opercle, preopercle and interopercle bones;
   elongated posterior ceratohyal; and, form of the fourth supraneural and
   loss of its anterior nuchal plate.
   In contrast, 15 synapomorphies recovered by Arce-H. et al. 2016, are
   confirmed suggesting that Satan is one of the four stygobitic ictalurids
   comprising a ``Troglobites{''} subclade within the family:
   (Trogloglanis, Satan, Prietella phreatophila, P. lundbergi). These
   features include three stygomorphic and reductive apomorphies that are
   exclusive within Ictaluridae: loss of fully developed eyes and
   pigmentation, and simplification of the fifth vertebra and its joint
   with the Weberian apparatus. Twelve other synapomorphies shown by the
   Troglobites are also apparent homoplasies of character states shared
   with various other ictalurids. These include reductive characters such
   as shortened lateral line canal, reduced infraorbitals and
   underdeveloped or incomplete ossifications of the pterotic,
   supraoccipital, hyoid arch bones and transcapular ligament. Also, the
   Troglobites and various other ictalurids have: an adnate adipose caudal
   fin, foreshortened anterior cranial fontanelle, reduced ventral wings of
   the frontal bone, replacement of bone by cartilage in hypohyal joints;
   incompletely ossified transcapular ligament, and consolidation of some
   hypural bones.
   Completing a full morphological character dataset across the Troglobites
   has been impeded by incomplete specimen preparations and study of P.
   lundbergi and to a lesser extent, P. phreatophila and Trogloglanis.},

Abstract = {The pimelodid genus Hypophthalmus is a small group of pelagic and
   planktivorous catfishes that are abundant and variously distributed in
   the lowland river basins of the Amazon, Parnaiba, Orinoco, Guianas and
   Parana. Since their earliest published descriptions, commencing over 190
   years ago with H. edentatus Spix and Agassiz 1829, the taxonomy and
   nomenclature of Hypophthalmus species have been confused and unresolved.
   In this study, four of the six available species names are validated and
   two new species are described. Newly discovered characters of the
   vertebral column, circumoral barbels, pelvic fins, and lateralis sensory
   canals provide strong support and diagnostics for species and
   species-groups. A key to species, anatomical descriptions, notes on
   identification of small juveniles and phylogenetic interrelationships
   are included. A lectotype is designated for Hypophthalmus marginatus and
   nominal Hypophthalmus longifilis, respectively.},

Abstract = {New material from the Upper Devonian (Famennian) Catskill Formation of
   Pennsylvania, USA, reveals anatomical details previously lacking from
   the enigmatic fossil species that Newberry (1889, U.S. Geological Survey
   Monograph 16:1-228) named Holoptychius ? radiatus. The original material
   (scales and lepidotrichia) was attributed to Holoptychius
   (Sarcopterygii, Porolepiformes) according to the ridged ornament on the
   exposed portion of the scales. Scale and cranial anatomy revealed by the
   new material supports a reassignment of the species to Langlieria
   (Sarcopterygii, Tristichopteridae). The emended diagnosis of the new
   combination includes the grooved scale ornament that was noted, though
   described differently by Newberry, and a posterior oblique pitline
   groove of the parietal that extends to the caudal margin of the element.
   Along with Hyneria lindae and Eusthenodon sp. indet., there are now at
   least three known species of Tristichopteridae from the Catskill
   Formation. Temporal/spatial separation of these species, along with
   supporting anatomical characteristics, suggests that tristichopterids
   commonly filled the ecological niche of top predator in the
   Famennian-age nonmarine ecosystems of the Catskill Delta Complex. The
   presence of a Langlieria species in the Catskill Formation lends further
   support to a biogeographic connection between Pennsylvania, USA, and
   Belgium during the Famennian Stage of the Upper Devonian.},

Title = {A reappraisal of phylogenetic relationships among auchenipterid
   catfishes of the subfamily Centromochlinae and diagnosis of its genera
   (Teleostei: Siluriformes)},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships is presented for species of
   the South American catfish subfamily Centromochlinae (Auchenipteridae)
   based on parsimony analysis of 133 morphological characters in 47
   potential ingroup taxa and one outgroup taxon. Of the 48 species
   previously considered valid in the subfamily, only one, Centromochlus
   steindachneri, was not evaluated in the present study. The phylogenetic
   analysis generated two most parsimonious trees, each with 202 steps,
   that support the monophyly of Centromochlinae composed of five valid
   genera: Glanidium, Gephyromochlus, Gelanoglanis, Centromochlus and
   Tatia. Although those five genera form a clade sister to the monotypic
   Pseudotatia, we exclude Pseudotatia from Centromochlinae. The parsimony
   analysis placed Glanidium (six species) as the sister group to all other
   species of Centromochlinae. Gephyromochlus contained a single species,
   Gephyromochlus leopardus, that is sister to the clade Gelanoglanis (five
   species) + Centromochlus (eight species). Based on the new taxonomic
   arrangement herein, Balroglanis Grant 2015 and Sauronglanis Grant 2015
   are placed in the synonymy of Centromochlus. Tatia is the most diverse
   genus within Centromochlinae, with twenty-six species in three
   monophyletic clades. The species composition of Tatia differs from that
   of Calegari et al. (2019). Duringlanis Grant 2015 and Ferrarissoaresia
   Grant 2015 are considered synonyms of Tatia. All generic taxa within
   Centromochlinae are diagnosed based on synapomorphic morphological
   characters. An identification key for Centromochlinae is provided.},

Abstract = {Alexander Wilson (1766-1813) based his description of the
   ``Slate-colored Hawk/Falco atricapillus{''} (=Accipiter genitilis
   atricapillus) on a single specimen collected near Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania. which he deposited for posterity in the Philadelphia
   (Peale) Museum. Wilson's illustration of the specimen was engraved and
   hand-colored prints were published in American Ornithology voL 6 (1812b.
   PL 52) to accompany his scientific description of the species. However,
   the path of Wilson's type specimens became difficult to trace after the
   Peale Museum closed in 1846 and its collections were sold and dispersed.
   Wilson's holotype of F. atricapillas was presumed lost or destroyed
   until November 2020, when I rediscovered it in the collection of the
   Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSP), thanks to a
   penciled note made by the late Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, former ANSP
   curator of birds. This research also sheds new light on the history or
   the Peale Museum bird collection. exposing a basic misunderstanding
   about the ``Peale numbers{''} cited by Wilson, which has broad
   implications for the history of American ornithology. In short, ``Peale
   numbers{''} were assigned to species (not specimens) held in the Peale
   Museum.},

Abstract = {Long-term sediment accretion and nutrient concentrations were
   investigated in tidal marsh sediments of the Murderkill River, Delaware.
   Radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137), stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15),
   organic matter concentrations and nutrient concentrations were measured.
   Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g
   cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1).
   The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the
   downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in
   surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N
   concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites
   (mostly >= 1\% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen
   concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5\% N),
   decreased to approximately 0.6\% N by 1940, and then remained constant
   to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3
   plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water
   associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level.
   Surface sediments in all of the cores have more total phosphorus (TP)
   than below ground. The downstream site closest to the estuary had an
   abrupt increase in surface TP (i.e., 0-10 cm). Sediment TP increased
   slightly from 2003 to present time (i.e., from 0.07 to 0.11\% P).
   Sediment accumulation and accretion rates in the Murderkill River
   marshes are similar to the accretion rates determined by previous
   studies in the region.},

Abstract = {Five Gobio species viz. G. battalgilae, G. gymnostethus, G. hettitorum,
   G. insuyanus and G. microlepidotus inhabit the Konya endorheic basin.
   Some studies have suggested the synonymy of G. battalgilae and G.
   microlepidotus based on molecular characters. Therefore, this study
   aimed to test the hypothesis of synonymy of G. battalgilae and G.
   microlepidotus. Based on our results, the morphometric and meristic
   characters of G. battalgilae largely overlap with those of G.
   microlepidotus, and we find no evidence to support the distinctiveness
   of the two species. Therefore, G. battalgilae Naseka, Erk'akan \& Kucuk,
   2006 is treated as a junior synonym of G. microlepidotus Battalgil,

Abstract = {The loss of information accompanying assessment of absolute fit of
   substitution models to phylogenetic data negatively affects the
   discriminatory power of previous methods and can make them insensitive
   to lineage-specific changes in the substitution process. As an
   alternative, I propose evaluating absolute fit of substitution models
   based on a novel statistic which describes the observed data without
   information loss and which is unlikely to become zero-inflated with
   increasing numbers of taxa. This method can accommodate gaps and is
   sensitive to lineage-specific shifts in the substitution process. In
   simulation experiments, it exhibits greater discriminatory power than
   previous methods. The method can be implemented in both Bayesian and
   Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, and used to screen any set of
   models. Recently, it has been suggested that model selection may be an
   unnecessary step in phylogenetic inference. However, results presented
   here emphasize the importance of model fit assessment for reliable
   phylogenetic inference. {[}Absolute model fit; model misspecification;

Abstract = {The segmented trapdoor spiders (Liphistiidae) are the sole surviving
   family of the suborder Mesothelae, which forms the sister lineage to all
   other living spiders. Liphistiids have retained a number of
   plesiomorphic traits and their present-day distribution is limited to
   East and Southeast Asia. Studying this group has the potential to shed
   light on the deep evolutionary history of spiders, but the phylogeny and
   divergence times of the family have not been resolved with confidence.
   We performed phylogenomic and molecular dating analyses of 2765
   ultraconserved element loci from 185 liphistiid taxa. Our analyses show
   that the crown group of Liphistiidae appeared in the mid-Cretaceous at
   102 Ma (95\% credibility interval 92-113 Ma), but it was not until the
   Neogene that much of the diversification within the family occurred in
   mainland Southeast and East Asia. This diversification was coincident
   with tectonic events such as the extension of the East Asian continental
   margin, as well as geological upheavals in Indochina induced by the
   collision between India and Asia. Our study highlights the important
   role of major tectonic events in shaping the evolutionary history,
   present-day diversity, and geographical distribution of mesothele and
   liphistiid spiders.},

Title = {Paralogs and Off-Target Sequences Improve Phylogenetic Resolution in a

Abstract = {We present a 517-gene phylogenetic framework for the breadfruit genus
   Artocarpus (ca. 70 spp., Moraceae), making use of silica-dried leaves
   from recent fieldwork and herbarium specimens (some up to 106 years old)
   to achieve 96\% taxon sampling. We explore issues relating to assembly,
   paralogous loci, partitions, and analysis method to reconstruct a
   phylogeny that is robust to variation in data and available tools.
   Although codon partitioning did not result in any substantial
   topological differences, the inclusion of flanking noncoding sequence in
   analyses significantly increased the resolution of gene trees. We also
   found that increasing the size of data sets increased convergence
   between analysis methods but did not reduce gene-tree conflict. We
   optimized the HybPiper targeted-enrichment sequence assembly pipeline
   for short sequences derived from degraded DNA extracted from museum
   specimens. Although the subgenera of Artocarpus were monophyletic,
   revision is required at finer scales, particularly with respect to
   widespread species. We expect our results to provide a basis for further
   studies in Artocarpus and provide guidelines for future analyses of data
   sets based on target enrichment data, particularly those using sequences
   from both fresh and museum material, counseling careful attention to the
   potential of off-target sequences to improve resolution.},

Abstract = {Birds can use different types of gaits to move on the ground: they
   either walk, hop, or run. Although velocity can easily explain a
   preference for running, it remains unclear what drives a bird species to
   favor hopping over walking. As many hopping birds are relatively small
   and arboreal, we wanted to test the link between size, arboreality, and
   hopping ability. First, we carried out ancestral character state
   reconstructions of size range, hopping ability, and habitat traits on
   over 1000 species of birds. We found that both hopping ability and
   arboreality were derived and significantly correlated traits in avian
   evolution. Second, we tested the influence of hopping ability on the
   morphology of the lower appendicular skeleton by quantifying the shape
   differences of the pelvis and the three long bones of the hind limbs in
   47 avian species with different habitats and gait preferences. We used
   geometric morphometrics on 3D landmarks, digitized on micro-computed
   tomography (micro-CT) and surface scans of the pelvis, femur,
   tibiotarsus, and tarsometatarsus. Locomotion habits significantly
   influence the conformation of the pelvis, especially at the origin of
   hip and knee muscle extensors. Interestingly, habitat, more than
   locomotion habits, significantly changed tarsometatarsus conformation.
   The morphology of the distal part of the tarsometatarsus constrains
   digit orientation, which leads to a greater ability to perch, an
   advantageous trait in arboreality. The results of this work suggest an
   arboreal origin of hopping and illuminate the evolution of avian
   terrestrial locomotion.},

Title = {Estimating Diversity Through Time Using Molecular Phylogenies: Old and
   Species-Poor Frog Families are the Remnants of a Diverse Past},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Estimating how the number of species in a given group varied in the deep
   past is of key interest to evolutionary biologists. However, current
   phylogenetic approaches for obtaining such estimates have limitations,
   such as providing unrealistic diversity estimates at the origin of the
   group. Here, we develop a robust probabilistic approach for estimating
   diversity through time curves and uncertainty around these estimates
   from phylogenetic data. We show with simulations that under various
   realistic scenarios of diversification, this approach performs better
   than previously proposed approaches. We also characterize the effect of
   tree size and undersampling on the performance of the approach. We apply
   our method to understand patterns of species diversity in anurans (frogs
   and toads). We find that Archaeobatrachia-a species-poor group of old
   frog clades often found in temperate regions-formerly had much higher
   diversity and net diversification rate, but the group declined in
   diversity as younger, nested clades diversified. This diversity decline
   seems to be linked to a decline in speciation rate rather than an
   increase in extinction rate. Our approach, implemented in the R package
   RPANDA, should be useful for evolutionary biologists interested in
   understanding how past diversity dynamics have shaped present-day
   diversity. It could also be useful in other contexts, such as for
   analyzing lade-lade competitive effects or the effect of species
   richness on phenotypic divergence.},

Abstract = {The assumption of strictly neutral evolution is fundamental to the
   multispecies coalescent model and permits the derivation of gene tree
   distributions and coalescent times conditioned on a given species tree.
   In this study, we conduct computer simulations to explore the effects of
   violating this assumption in the form of species-specific positive
   selection when estimating species trees, species delimitations, and
   coalescent parameters under the model. We simulated data sets under an
   array of evolutionary scenarios that differ in both speciation
   parameters (i.e., divergence times, strength of selection) and
   experimental design (i.e., number of loci sampled) and incorporated
   species-specific positive selection occurring within branches of a
   species tree to identify the effects of selection on multispecies
   coalescent inferences. Our results highlight particular evolutionary
   scenarios and parameter combinations in which inferences may be more, or
   less, susceptible to the effects of positive selection. In some extreme
   cases, selection can decrease error in species delimitation and increase
   error in species tree estimation, yet these inferences appear to be
   largely robust to the effects of positive selection under many
   conditions likely to be encountered in empirical data sets.},

Title = {Intraspecific Niche Models for Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) Suggest
   Potential Variability in Population-Level Response to Climate Change},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {965-978},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Unique responses to climate change can occur across intraspecific
   levels, resulting in individualistic adaptation or movement patterns
   among populations within a given species. Thus, the need to model
   potential responses among genetically distinct populations within a
   species is increasingly recognized. However, predictive models of future
   distributions are regularly fit at the species level, often because
   intraspecific variation is unknown or is identified only within limited
   sample locations. In this study, we considered the role of intraspecific
   variation to shape the geographic distribution of ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa), an ecologically and economically important tree species in
   North America. Morphological and genetic variation across the
   distribution of ponderosa pine suggest the need to model intraspecific
   populations: the two varieties (var. ponderosa and var. scopulorum) and
   several haplotype groups within each variety have been shown to occupy
   unique climatic niches, suggesting populations have distinct
   evolutionary lineages adapted to different environmental conditions. We
   utilized a recently available, geographically widespread dataset of
   intraspecific variation (haplotypes) for ponderosa pine and a recently
   devised lineage distance modeling approach to derive additional, likely
   intraspecific occurrence locations. We confirmed the relative uniqueness
   of each haplotype-climate relationship using a niche-overlap analysis,
   and developed ecological niche models (ENMs) to project the distribution
   for two varieties and eight haplotypes under future climate forecasts.
   Future projections of haplotype niche distributions generally revealed
   greater potential range loss than predicted for the varieties. This
   difference may reflect intraspecific responses of distinct evolutionary
   lineages. However, directional trends are generally consistent across
   intraspecific levels, and include a loss of distributional area and an
   upward shift in elevation. Our results demonstrate the utility in
   modeling intraspecific response to changing climate and they inform
   management and conservation strategies, by identifying haplotypes and
   geographic areas that may be most at risk, or most secure, under
   projected climate change.},

Title = {Using Phylogenomic Data to Explore the Effects of Relaxed Clocks and
   Calibration Strategies on Divergence Time Estimation: Primates as a Test
   Case},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Primates have long been a test case for the development of phylogenetic
   methods for divergence time estimation. Despite a large number of
   studies, however, the timing of origination of crown Primates relative
   to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and the timing of
   diversification of the main crown groups remain controversial. Here, we
   analysed a data set of 372 taxa (367 Primates and 5 outgroups, 3.4
   million aligned base pairs) that includes nine primate genomes. We
   systematically explore the effect of different interpretations of fossil
   calibrations and molecular clock models on primate divergence time
   estimates. We find that even small differences in the construction of
   fossil calibrations can have a noticeable impact on estimated divergence
   times, especially for the oldest nodes in the tree. Notably, choice of
   molecular rate model (autocorrelated or independently distributed rates)
   has an especially strong effect on estimated times, with the independent
   rates model producing considerably more ancient age estimates for the
   deeper nodes in the phylogeny. We implement thermodynamic integration,
   combined with Gaussian quadrature, in the program MCMCTree, and use it
   to calculate Bayes factors for clock models. Bayesian model selection
   indicates that the autocorrelated rates model fits the primate data
   substantially better, and we conclude that time estimates under this
   model should be preferred. We show that for eight core nodes in the
   phylogeny, uncertainty in time estimates is close to the theoretical
   limit imposed by fossil uncertainties. Thus, these estimates are
   unlikely to be improved by collecting additional molecular sequence
   data. All analyses place the origin of Primates close to the K-Pg
   boundary, either in the Cretaceous or straddling the boundary into the
   Palaeogene.},

Abstract = {The conceptualization and coding of characters is a difficult issue in
   phylogenetic systematics, no matter which inference method is used when
   reconstructing phylogenetic trees or if the characters are just mapped
   onto a specific tree. Complex characters are groups of features that can
   be divided into simpler hierarchical characters (reductive coding),
   although the implied hierarchical relational information may change
   depending on the type of coding (composite vs. reductive). Up to now,
   there is no common agreement to either code characters as complex or
   simple. Phylogeneticists have discussed which coding method is best but
   have not incorporated the heuristic process of reciprocal illumination
   to evaluate the coding. Composite coding allows to test whether 1)
   several characters were linked resulting in a structure described as a
   complex character or trait or 2) independently evolving characters
   resulted in the configuration incorrectly interpreted as a complex
   character. We propose that complex characters or character states should
   be decomposed iteratively into simpler characters when the original
   homology hypothesis is not corroborated by a phylogenetic analysis, and
   the character or character state is retrieved as homoplastic. We tested
   this approach using the case of fruit types within subfamily
   Cinchonoideae (Rubiaceae). The iterative reductive coding of characters
   associated with drupes allowed us to unthread fruit evolution within
   Cinchonoideae. Our results show that drupes and berries are not
   homologous. As a consequence, a more precise ontology for the
   Cinchonoideae drupes is required.},

Abstract = {Gene tree discordance is expected in phylogenomic trees and biological
   processes are often invoked to explain it. However, heterogeneous levels
   of phylogenetic signal among individuals within data sets may cause
   artifactual sources of topological discordance. We examined how the
   information content in tips and subclades impacts topological
   discordance in the parrots (Order: Psittaciformes), a diverse and highly
   threatened clade of nearly 400 species. Using ultraconserved elements
   from 96\% of the clade's species-level diversity, we estimated
   concatenated and species trees for 382 ingroup taxa. We found that
   discordance among tree topologies was most common at nodes dating
   between the late Miocene and Pliocene, and often at the taxonomic level
   of the genus. Accordingly, we used two metrics to characterize
   information content in tips and assess the degree to which conflict
   between trees was being driven by lower-quality samples. Most instances
   of topological conflict and nonmonophyletic genera in the species tree
   could be objectively identified using these metrics. For subclades still
   discordant after tip-based filtering, we used a machine learning
   approach to determine whether phylogenetic signal or noise was the more
   important predictor of metrics supporting the alternative topologies. We
   found that when signal favored one of the topologies, the noise was the
   most important variable in poorly performing models that favored the
   alternative topology. In sum, we show that artifactual sources of gene
   tree discordance, which are likely a common phenomenon in many data
   sets, can be distinguished from biological sources by quantifying the
   information content in each tip and modeling which factors support each
   topology.},

Abstract = {Phylodynamic models generally aim at jointly inferring phylogenetic
   relationships, model parameters, and more recently, the number of
   lineages through time, based on molecular sequence data. In the fields
   of epidemiology and macroevolution, these models can be used to
   estimate, respectively, the past number of infected individuals
   (prevalence) or the past number of species (paleodiversity) through
   time. Recent years have seen the development of ``total-evidence{''}
   analyses, which combine molecular and morphological data from extant and
   past sampled individuals in a unified Bayesian inference framework. Even
   sampled individuals characterized only by their sampling time, that is,
   lacking morphological and molecular data, which we call occurrences,
   provide invaluable information to estimate the past number of lineages.
   Here, we present new methodological developments around the fossilized
   birth-death process enabling us to (i) incorporate occurrence data in
   the likelihood function; (ii) consider piecewise-constant birth, death,
   and sampling rates; and (iii) estimate the past number of lineages, with
   or without knowledge of the underlying tree. We implement our method in
   the RevBayes software environment, enabling its use along with a large
   set of models of molecular and morphological evolution, and validate the
   inference workflow using simulations under a wide range of conditions.
   We finally illustrate our new implementation using two empirical data
   sets stemming from the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution. In
   epidemiology, we infer the prevalence of the coronavirus disease 2019
   outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship, by taking into account jointly
   the case count record (occurrences) along with viral sequences for a
   fraction of infected individuals. In macroevolution, we infer the
   diversity trajectory of cetaceans using molecular and morphological data
   from extant taxa, morphological data from fossils, as well as numerous
   fossil occurrences. The joint modeling of occurrences and trees holds
   the promise to further bridge the gap between traditional epidemiology
   and pathogen genomics, as well as paleontology and molecular
   phylogenetics. {[}Birth-death model; epidemiology; fossils;

Abstract = {Although first posited to be of a single origin, the two superfamilies
   of phalangeriform marsupial possums (Phalangeroidea: brushtail possums
   and cuscuses and Petauroidea: possums and gliders) have long been
   considered, based on multiple sequencing studies, to have evolved from
   two separate origins. However, previous data from these sequence
   analyses suggested a variety of conflicting trees. Therefore, we
   reinvestigated these relationships by screening similar to 200,000
   orthologous short interspersed element (SINE) loci across the newly
   available whole-genome sequences of phalangeriform species and their
   relatives. Compared to sequence data, SINE presence/absence patterns are
   evolutionarily almost neutral molecular markers of the phylogenetic
   history of species. Their random and highly complex genomic insertion
   ensures their virtually homoplasy-free nature and enables one to compare
   hundreds of shared unique orthologous events to determine the true
   species tree. Here, we identify 106 highly reliable phylogenetic SINE
   markers whose presence/ absence patterns within multiple Australasian
   possum genomes unexpectedly provide the first significant evidence for
   the reunification of Australasian possums into one monophyletic group.
   Together, our findings indicate that nucleotide homoplasy and ancestral
   incomplete lineage sorting have most likely driven the conflicting
   signal distributions seen in previous sequence-based studies.},

Title = {Ecological Divergence and the History of Gene Flow in the Nearctic
   Milksnakes (Lampropeltis triangulum Complex)},

Abstract = {Many phylogeographic studies on species with large ranges have found
   genetic-geographic structure associated with changes in habitat and
   physical barriers preventing or reducing gene flow. These interactions
   with geographic space, contemporary and historical climate, and
   biogeographic barriers have complex effects on contemporary population
   genetic structure and processes of speciation. While allopatric
   speciation at biogeographic barriers is considered the primary mechanism
   for generating species, more recently it has been shown that parapatric
   modes of divergence may be equally or even more common. With genomic
   data and better modeling capabilities, we can more clearly define causes
   of speciation in relation to biogeography and migration between
   lineages, the location of hybrid zones with respect to the ecology of
   parental lineages, and differential introgression of genes between taxa.
   Here, we examine the origins of three Nearctic milksnakes (Lampropeltis
   elapsoides, Lampropeltis triangulum and Lampropeltis gentilis) using
   genome-scale data to better understand species diversification. Results
   from artificial neural networks show that a mix of a strong
   biogeographic barrier, environmental changes, and physical space has
   affected genetic structure in these taxa. These results underscore
   conspicuous environmental changes that occur as the sister taxa L.
   triangulum and L. gentilis diverged near the Great Plains into the
   forested regions of the Eastern Nearctic. This area has been recognized
   as a region for turnover for many vertebrate species, but as we show
   here the contemporary boundary does not isolate these sister species.
   These two species likely formed in the mid-Pleistocene and have remained
   partially reproductively isolated over much of this time, showing
   differential introgression of loci. We also demonstrate that when L.
   triangulum and L. gentilis are each in contact with the much older L.
   elapsoides, some limited gene flow has occurred. Given the strong
   agreement between nuclear and mtDNA genomes, along with estimates of
   ecological niche, we suggest that all three lineages should continue to
   be recognized as unique species. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the
   importance of considering complex modes of divergence and differential
   allelic introgression over a complex landscape when testing mechanisms
   of speciation. {[}Cline; delimitation; Eastern Nearctic; Great Plains;

Title = {Analysis of Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data Pinpoints Multiple
   Ancient Polyploidy Events in Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {190-207},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Target enrichment is becoming increasingly popular for phylogenomic
   studies. Although baits for enrichment are typically designed to target
   single-copy genes, paralogs are often recovered with increased
   sequencing depth, sometimes from a significant proportion of loci,
   especially in groups experiencing whole-genome duplication (WGD) events.
   Common approaches for processing paralogs in target enrichment data sets
   include random selection, manual pruning, and mainly, the removal of
   entire genes that show any evidence of paralogy. These approaches are
   prone to errors in orthology inference or removing large numbers of
   genes. By removing entire genes, valuable information that could be used
   to detect and place WGD events is discarded. Here, we used an automated
   approach for orthology inference in a target enrichment data set of 68
   species of Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae), a widely distributed clade of
   plants primarily from temperate climate regions. Previous molecular
   phylogenetic studies and chromosome numbers both suggested ancient WGDs
   in the group. However, both the phylogenetic location and putative
   parental lineages of these WGD events remain unknown. By taking paralogs
   into consideration and inferring orthologs from target enrichment data,
   we identified four nodes in the backbone of Alchemilla s.l. with an
   elevated proportion of gene duplication. Furthermore, using a gene-tree
   reconciliation approach, we established the autopolyploid origin of the
   entire Alchemilla s.l. and the nested allopolyploid origin of four major
   clades within the group. Here, we showed the utility of automated
   tree-based orthology inference methods, previously designed for genomic
   or transcriptomic data sets, to study complex scenarios of polyploidy
   and reticulate evolution from target enrichment data sets.},

Title = {Modeling Mito-nuclear Compatibility and Its Role in Species
   Identification},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial genetic material (mtDNA) is widely used for phylogenetic
   reconstruction and as a barcode for species identification. The utility
   of mtDNA in these contexts derives from its particular molecular
   properties, including its high evolutionary rate, uniparental
   inheritance, and small size. ButmtDNA may also play a fundamental role
   in speciation-as suggested by recent observations of coevolution with
   the nuclear DNA, along with the fact that respiration depends on
   coordination of genes from both sources. Here, we study how mito-nuclear
   interactions affect the accuracy of species identification by mtDNA, as
   well as the speciation process itself. We simulate the evolution of a
   population of individuals who carry a recombining nuclear genome and a
   mitochondrial genome inherited maternally. We compare a null model
   fitness landscape that lacks any mito-nuclear interaction against a
   scenario in which interactions influence fitness. Fitness is assigned to
   individuals according to their mito-nuclear compatibility, which drives
   the coevolution of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Depending on
   the model parameters, the population breaks into distinct species and
   the model output then allows us to analyze the accuracy of mtDNA barcode
   for species identification. Remarkably, we find that species
   identification by mtDNA is equally accurate in the presence or absence
   of mito-nuclear coupling and that the success of the DNA barcode derives
   mainly from population geographical isolation during speciation.
   Nevertheless, selection imposed by mito-nuclear compatibility influences
   the diversification process and leaves signatures in the genetic content
   and spatial distribution of the populations, in three ways. First,
   speciation is delayed and the resulting phylogenetic trees are more
   balanced. Second, clades in the resulting phylogenetic tree correlate
   more strongly with the spatial distribution of species and clusters of
   more similar mtDNA's. Third, there is a substantial increase in the
   intraspecies mtDNA similarity, decreasing the number of alleles
   substitutions per locus and promoting the conservation of genetic
   information. We compare the evolutionary patterns observed in our model
   to empirical data from copepods (Tigriopus californicus). We find good
   qualitative agreement in the geographic patterns and the topology of the
   phylogenetic tree, provided the model includes selection based on
   mito-nuclear interactions. These results highlight the role of
   mito-nuclear compatibility in the speciation process and its
   reconstruction from genetic data.},

   new method to obtain a probability distribution for the age of Amniota
   (the synapsid/sauropsid or bird/mammal divergence), one of the
   most-frequently used dating constraints. Our results suggest an older
   age (between about 322 and 340 Ma) than has been assumed by most studies
   that have used this constraint (which typically assumed a best estimate
   around 310-315 Ma) and provide, for the first time, a method to compute
   the shape of the probability density for this divergence time.},

Title = {Continued Adaptation of C-4 Photosynthesis After an Initial Burst of
   Changes in the Andropogoneae Grasses},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {C-4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that sustains fast growth and high
   productivity in tropical and subtropical conditions and evolved
   repeatedly in flowering plants. One of the major C lineages is
   Andropogoneae, a group of 1200 grass species that includes some of the
   world's most important crops and species dominating tropical and some
   temperate grasslands. Previous efforts to understand C evolution in the
   group have compared a few model C plants to distantly related C species
   so that changes directly responsible for the transition to C could not
   be distinguished from those that preceded or followed it. In this study,
   we analyze the genomes of 66 grass species, capturing the earliest
   diversification within Andropogoneae as well as their C relatives.
   Phylogenomics combined with molecular dating and analyses of protein
   evolution show that many changes linked to the evolution of C
   photosynthesis in Andropogoneae happened in the Early Miocene, between
   21 and 18 Ma, after the split from its C sister lineage, and before the
   diversification of the group. This initial burst of changes was followed
   by an extended period of modifications to leaf anatomy and biochemistry
   during the diversification of Andropogoneae, so that a single C origin
   gave birth to a diversity of C phenotypes during 18 million years of
   speciation events and migration across geographic and ecological spaces.
   Our comprehensive approach and broad sampling of the diversity in the
   group reveals that one key transition can lead to a plethora of
   phenotypes following sustained adaptation of the ancestral state.},

   Swallowtail Butterfly Evolution},

Abstract = {Evolutionary relationships have remained unresolved in many well-studied
   groups, even though advances in next-generation sequencing and analysis,
   using approaches such as transcriptomics, anchored hybrid enrichment, or
   ultraconserved elements, have brought systematics to the brink of whole
   genome phylogenomics. Recently, it has become possible to sequence the
   entire genomes of numerous nonbiological models in parallel at
   reasonable cost, particularly with shotgun sequencing. Here, we identify
   orthologous coding sequences from whole-genome shotgun sequences, which
   we then use to investigate the relevance and power of phylogenomic
   relationship inference and time-calibrated tree estimation. We study an
   iconic group of butterflies-swallowtails of the family Papilionidae-that
   has remained phylogenetically unresolved, with continued debate about
   the timing of their diversification. Low-coverage whole genomes were
   obtained using Illumina shotgun sequencing for all genera. Genome
   assembly coupled to BLAST-based orthology searches allowed extraction of
   6621 orthologous protein-coding genes for 45 Papilionidae species and 16
   outgroup species (with 32\% missing data after cleaning phases).
   Supermatrix phylogenomic analyses were performed with both
   maximum-likelihood (IQ-TREE) and Bayesian mixture models (PhyloBayes)
   for amino acid sequences, which produced a fully resolved phylogeny
   providing new insights into controversial relationships. Species tree
   reconstruction from gene trees was performed with ASTRAL and
   SuperTriplets and recovered the same phylogeny. We estimated gene site
   concordant factors to complement traditional node-support measures,
   which strengthens the robustness of inferred phylogenies. Bayesian
   estimates of divergence times based on a reduced data set (760 orthologs
   and 12\% missing data) indicate amid-Cretaceous origin of Papilionoidea
   around 99.2Ma (95\% credibility interval: 68.6-142.7 Ma) and
   Papilionidae around 71.4Ma(49.8-103.6 Ma), with subsequent
   diversification of modern lineages well after the Cretaceous-Paleogene
   event. These results show that shotgun sequencing of whole genomes, even
   when highly fragmented, represents a powerful approach to phylogenomics
   and molecular dating in a group that has previously been refractory to
   resolution.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Relationships of Diploids and the Origins of
   Allotetraploids in Dactylorhiza (Orchidaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-109},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Disentangling phylogenetic relationships proves challenging for groups
   that have evolved recently, especially if there is ongoing reticulation.
   Although they are in most cases immediately isolated from diploid
   relatives, sets of sibling allopolyploids often hybridize with each
   other, thereby increasing the complexity of an already challenging
   situation. Dactylorhiza (Orchidaceae: Orchidinae) is a genus much
   affected by allopolyploid speciation and reticulate phylogenetic
   relationships. Here, we use genetic variation at tens of thousands of
   genomic positions to unravel the convoluted evolutionary history of
   Dactylorhiza. We first investigate circumscription and relationships of
   diploid species in the genus using coalescent and maximum likelihood
   methods, and then group 16 allotetraploids by maximum affiliation to
   their putative parental diploids, implementing a method based on
   genotype likelihoods. The direction of hybrid crosses is inferred for
   each allotetraploid using information from maternally inherited plastid
   RADseq loci. Starting from age estimates of parental taxa, the relative
   ages of these allotetraploid entities are inferred by quantifying their
   genetic similarity to the diploids and numbers of private alleles
   compared with sibling allotetraploids. Whereas northwestern Europe is
   dominated by young allotetraploids of postglacial origins, comparatively
   older allotetraploids are distributed further south, where climatic
   conditions remained relatively stable during the Pleistocene
   glaciations. Our bioinformatics approach should prove effective for the
   study of other naturally occurring, nonmodel, polyploid plant complexes.},

Title = {Statistical Modeling of Distribution Patterns: A Markov Random Field
   Implementation and Its Application on Areas of Endemism},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A statistical framework to infer areas of endemism from geographic
   distributions is proposed. This novel method is based on hidden Markov
   random fields (HMRFs), a type of undirected graph model commonly used in
   computer vision. This framework assumes areas of endemism are the states
   of the hidden layer of the model, whereas taxon distributions are
   emitted values in the observed layer. Taxon distributions are associated
   to the observed layer through a clustering procedure based on the extent
   of overlap. Observations are emitted by the hidden layer according to a
   Gaussian distribution, whereas the joint distribution of the hidden
   layer follows a Potts model. State and parameter inference of the
   maximum a posteriori configuration is performed through a modified
   version of the expectation-maximization algorithm. The optimal number of
   areas of endemism in the data set is estimated through the
   pseudolikelihood information criterion, a model selection procedure that
   uses an approximation to likelihood. The performance of the new
   algorithm was assessed on simulated data, and compared with the most
   popular methods for delimitation of areas of endemism: biotic element
   analysis, parsimony analysis of endemism, and endemicity analysis. HMRFs
   efficiently recovered the true pattern across a wide range of
   uncertainty values. The performance was also examined on empirical data:
   South African weevils (Sciobius) and Central American ground beetles and
   funnel-web tarantulas (Carabidae and Dipluridae, respectively). HMRFs
   uncovered six areas of endemism from the weevil data set, whereas eight
   were estimated for the Central American arthropods (compared with 3-5
   and 3-14 from the other methods, respectively).},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {68},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The estimation of multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences is a
   basic step in many bioinformatics pipelines, including alignments and
   trees under stochastic models of sequence evolution has long been
   considered the most rigorous technique for estimating alignments and
   trees, but little is known about the accuracy of suchmethods on
   biological benchmarks. We report the results of an extensive study
   evaluating the most popular protein alignment methods as well as the
   statistical coestimation method BAli-Phy on 1192 protein data sets from
   established benchmarks as well as on 120 simulated data sets. Our study
   (which used more than 230 CPU years for the BAli-Phy analyses alone)
   shows that BAli-Phy has better precision and recall (with respect to the
   true alignments) than the other alignment methods on the simulated data
   sets but has consistently lower recall on the biological benchmarks
   (with respect to the reference alignments) than many of the other
   methods. In otherwords, we find that BAli-Phy systematically underaligns
   when operating on biological sequence data but shows no sign of this on
   simulated data. There are several potential causes for this change in
   performance, including model misspecification, errors in the reference
   alignments, and conflicts between structural alignment and evolutionary
   alignments, and future research is needed to determine the most likely
   explanation. We conclude with a discussion of the potential
   ramifications for each of these possibilities.},

Title = {An Assessment of Phylogenetic Tools for Analyzing the Interplay Between
   Interspecific Interactions and Phenotypic Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413-427},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Much ecological and evolutionary theory predicts that interspecific
   interactions often drive phenotypic diversification and that species
   phenotypes in turn influence species interactions. Several phylogenetic
   comparative methods have been developed to assess the importance of such
   processes in nature; however, the statistical properties of these
   methods have gone largely untested. Focusing mainly on scenarios of
   competition between closely-related species, we assess the performance
   of available comparative approaches for analyzing the interplay between
   interspecific interactions and species phenotypes. We find that many
   currently used statistical methods often fail to detect the impact of
   interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that sister-taxa analyses
   are particularly unreliable in general, and that recently developed
   process-based models have more satisfactory statistical properties.
   Methods for detecting predictors of species interactions are generally
   more reliable than methods for detecting character displacement. In
   weighing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, we hope
   to provide a clear guide for empiricists testing hypotheses about the
   reciprocal effect of interspecific interactions and species phenotypes
   and to inspire further development of process-based models.},

Title = {A General Model for Estimating Macroevolutionary Landscapes},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The evolution of quantitative characters over long timescales is often
   studied using stochastic diffusion models. The current toolbox available
   to students of macroevolution is however limited to two main models:
   Brownian motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, plus some of their
   extensions. Here, we present a very general model for inferring the
   dynamics of quantitative characters evolving under both random diffusion
   and deterministic forces of any possible shape and strength, which can
   accommodate interesting evolutionary scenarios like directional trends,
   disruptive selection, or macroevolutionary landscapes with multiple
   peaks. This model is based on a general partial differential equation
   widely used in statistical mechanics: the Fokker-Planck equation, also
   known in population genetics as the Kolmogorov forward equation. We thus
   call the model FPK, for Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov. We first explain how
   this model can be used to describe macroevolutionary landscapes over
   which quantitative traits evolve and, more importantly, we detail how it
   can be fitted to empirical data. Using simulations, we show that the
   model has good behavior both in terms of discrimination from alternative
   models and in terms of parameter inference. We provide R code to fit the
   model to empirical data using either maximum-likelihood or Bayesian
   estimation, and illustrate the use of this code with two empirical
   examples of body mass evolution in mammals. FPK should greatly expand
   the set of macroevolutionary scenarios that can be studied since it
   opens the way to estimating macroevolutionary landscapes of any
   conceivable shape.},

Title = {The Efficacy of Consensus Tree Methods for Summarizing Phylogenetic
   Relationships from a Posterior Sample of Trees Estimated from
   Morphological Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {354-362},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Consensus trees are required to summarize trees obtained through MCMC
   sampling of a posterior distribution, providing an overview of the
   distribution of estimated parameters such as topology, branch lengths,
   and divergence times. Numerous consensus tree construction methods are
   available, each presenting a different interpretation of the tree
   sample. The rise of morphological clock and sampled-ancestor methods of
   divergence time estimation, in which times and topology are coestimated,
   has increased the popularity of the maximum clade credibility (MCC)
   consensus tree method. The MCC method assumes that the sampled, fully
   resolved topology with the highest clade credibility is an adequate
   summary of the most probable clades, with parameter estimates from
   compatible sampled trees used to obtain the marginal distributions of
   parameters such as clade ages and branch lengths. Using both simulated
   and empirical data, we demonstrate that MCC trees, and trees constructed
   using the similar maximum a posteriori (MAP) method, often include
   poorly supported and incorrect clades when summarizing diffuse posterior
   samples of trees. We demonstrate that the paucity of information in
   morphological data sets contributes to the inability of MCC and MAP
   trees to accurately summarise of the posterior distribution. Conversely,
   majority-rule consensus (MRC) trees represent a lower proportion of
   incorrect nodes when summarizing the same posterior samples of trees.
   Thus, we advocate the use of MRC trees, in place of MCC or MAP trees, in
   attempts to summarize the results of Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of
   morphological data.},

Title = {Interspecific Gene Flow and Mitochondrial Genome Capture during the
   Radiation of Jamaican Anolis Lizards (Squamata; Iguanidae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Gene flow and reticulation are increasingly recognized as important
   processes in the diversification of many taxonomic groups. With the
   increasing ease of collecting genomic data and the development of
   multispecies coalescent network approaches, such reticulations can be
   accounted for when inferring phylogeny and diversification. Caribbean
   Anolis lizards are a classic example of an adaptive radiation in which
   species have independently radiated on the islands of the Greater
   Antilles into the same ecomorph classes. Within the Jamaican radiation
   at least one species, Anolis opalinus, has been documented to be
   polyphyletic in its mitochondrial DNA, which could be the result of an
   ancient reticulation event or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we
   generate mtDNA and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data and implement
   gene tree, species tree, and multispecies coalescent network methods to
   infer the diversification of this group. Our mtDNA gene tree recovers
   the same relationships previously inferred for this group, which is
   strikingly different from the species tree inferred from our GBS data.
   Posterior predictive simulations suggest that our genomic data violate
   commonly adopted assumptions of the multispecies coalescent model
   (MSCM), so we use network approaches to infer phylogenetic
   relationships. The inferred network topology contains a reticulation
   event but does not explain the mtDNA polyphyly observed in this group;
   however, coalescent simulations suggest that the observed mtDNA topology
   is likely the result of past introgression. How common a signature of
   gene flow and reticulation is across the radiation of Anolis is unknown;
   however, the reticulation events that we demonstrate here may have
   allowed for adaptive evolution, as has been suggested in other, more
   recent, adaptive radiations. {[}Adaptive radiation; hybridization;

Abstract = {Hybridization between species occurs more frequently in vertebrates than
   traditionally thought, but distinguishing ancient hybridization from
   other phenomena that generate similar evolutionary patterns remains
   challenging. Here, we used a comprehensive workflow to discover evidence
   of ancient hybridization between the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis)
   from Indonesia and a common ancestor of an Australian group of monitor
   lizards known colloquially as sand monitors. Our data comprise >300
   nuclear loci, mitochondrial genomes, phenotypic data, fossil and
   contemporary records, and past/present climatic data. We show that the
   four sand monitor species share more nuclear alleles with V. komodoensis
   than expected given a bifurcating phylogeny, likely as a result of
   hybridization between the latter species and a common ancestor of sand
   monitors. Sand monitors display phenotypes that are intermediate between
   their closest relatives and V. komodoensis. Biogeographic analyses
   suggest that V. komodoensis and ancestral sand monitors co-occurred in
   northern Australia. In agreement with the fossil record, this provides
   further evidence that the Komodo dragon once inhabited the Australian
   continent. Our study show show different sources of evidence can be used
   to thoroughly characterize evolutionary histories that deviate from a
   treelike pattern, that hybridization can have long-lasting effects on
   phenotypes, and that detecting hybridization can improve our
   understanding of evolutionary and biogeographic patterns.},

Volume = {70},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Markov models of character substitution on phylogenies form the
   foundation of phylogenetic inference frameworks. Early models made the
   simplifying assumption that the substitution process is homogeneous over
   time and across sites in the molecular sequence alignment. While
   standard practice adopts extensions that accommodate heterogeneity of
   substitution rates across sites, heterogeneity in the process over time
   in a site-specific manner remains frequently overlooked. This is
   problematic, as evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level
   are highly variable, subjecting different sites to different selective
   constraints over time, impacting their substitution behavior. We propose
   incorporating time variability through Markov-modulated models (MMMs),
   which extend covarion-like models and allow the substitution process
   (including relative character exchange rates as well as the overall
   substitution rate) at individual sites to vary across lineages. We
   implement a general MMM framework in BEAST, a popular Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference software package, allowing researchers to compose
   a wide range of MMMs through flexible XML specification. Using examples
   from bacterial, viral, and plastid genome evolution, we show that MMMs
   impact phylogenetic tree estimation and can substantially improve model
   fit compared to standard substitution models. Through simulations, we
   show that marginal likelihood estimation accurately identifies the
   generative model and does not systematically prefer the more
   parameter-rich MMMs. To mitigate the increased computational demands
   associated with MMMs, our implementation exploits recent developments in
   BEAGLE, a high-performance computational library for phylogenetic
   inference.},

   process. Specifically, these models allow for simultaneous estimation of
   the number of species present in a sample of individuals and the
   phylogenetic history of those species using only DNA sequence data from
   independent loci. These methods hold extraordinary promise for
   increasing the efficiency of species discovery but require extensive
   validation to ensure that they are accurate and precise. Whether the
   species identified by these methods correspond to the species that would
   be recognized by alternative species recognition criteria (such as
   measurements of reproductive isolation) is currently an open question
   and a subject of vigorous debate. Here, we perform an empirical test of
   these methods by making use of a classic model system in the history of
   speciation research, flies of the genus Drosophila. Specifically, we use
   the uniquely comprehensive data on reproductive isolation that is
   available for this system, along with DNA sequence data, to ask whether
   Drosophila species inferred under the multispecies coalescent model
   correspond to those recognized by many decades of speciation research.
   We found that coalescent based and reproductive isolation-based methods
   of inferring species boundaries are concordant for 77\% of the species
   pairs. We explore and discuss potential explanations for these
   discrepancies. We also found that the amount of prezygotic isolation
   between two species is a strong predictor of the posterior probability
   of species boundaries based on DNA sequence data, regardless of whether
   the species pairs are sympatrically or allopatrically distributed.},

Abstract = {With advances in sequencing technologies, there are now massive amounts
   of genomic data from across all life, leading to the possibility that a
   robust Tree of Life can be constructed. However, gene tree
   heterogeneity, which is when different genomic regions can evolve
   differently, is a common phenomenon in multi-locus data sets, and
   reduces the accuracy of standard methods for species tree estimation
   that do not take this heterogeneity into account. New methods have been
   developed for species tree estimation that specifically address gene
   tree heterogeneity, and that have been proven to converge to the true
   species tree when the number of loci and number of sites per locus both
   increase (i.e., the methods are said to be statistically consistent).
   Yet, little is known about the biologically realistic condition where
   the number of sites per locus is bounded. We show that when the sequence
   length of each locus is bounded (by any arbitrarily chosen value), the
   most common approaches to species tree estimation that take
   heterogeneity into account (i.e., traditional fully partitioned
   concatenated maximum likelihood and newer approaches, called summary
   methods, that estimate the species tree by combining estimated gene
   trees) are not statistically consistent, even when the heterogeneity is
   extremely constrained. The main challenge is the presence of conditions
   such as long branch attraction that create biased tree estimation when
   the number of sites is restricted. Hence, our study uncovers a
   fundamental challenge to species tree estimation using both traditional
   and new methods.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are representations of evolutionary relationships
   among species and contain signatures of the processes responsible for
   the speciation events they display. Inferring processes from tree
   properties, however, is challenging. To address this problem, we
   analyzed a spatially-explicit model of speciation where genome size and
   mating range can be controlled. We simulated parapatric and sympatric
   (narrow and wide mating range, respectively) radiations and constructed
   their phylogenetic trees, computing structural properties such as tree
   balance and speed of diversification. We showed that parapatric and
   sympatric speciation are well separated by these structural tree
   properties. Balanced trees with constant rates of diversification only
   originate in sympatry and genome size affected both the balance and the
   speed of diversification of the simulated trees. Comparison with
   empirical data showed that most of the evolutionary radiations
   considered to have developed in parapatry or sympatry are in good
   agreement with model predictions. Even though additional forces other
   than spatial restriction of gene flow, genome size, and genetic
   incompatibilities, do play a role in the evolution of species formation,
   the microevolutionary processes modeled here capture signatures of the
   diversification pattern of evolutionary radiations, regarding the
   symmetry and speed of diversification of lineages.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relative influence of various abiotic and biotic
   variables on diversification dynamics is amajor goal of
   macroevolutionary studies. Recently, phylogenetic approaches have been
   developed that make it possible to estimate the role of various
   environmental variables on diversification using time-calibrated species
   trees, paleoenvironmental data, and maximum-likelihood techniques. These
   approaches have been effectively employed to estimate how speciation and
   extinction rates vary with key abiotic variables, such as temperature
   and sea level, and we can anticipate that they will be increasingly used
   in the future. Here we compile a series of biotic and abiotic
   paleodatasets that can be used as explanatory variables in these models
   and use simulations to assess the statistical properties of the approach
   when applied to these paleodatasets. We demonstrate that
   environment-dependent models perform well in recovering
   environment-dependent speciation and extinction parameters, aswell as in
   correctly identifying the simulated environmental model when speciation
   is environment-dependent. We explore how the strength of the
   environment-dependency, tree size, missing taxa, and characteristics of
   the paleoenvironmental curves influence the performance of the models.
   Finally, using these models, we infer environment-dependent
   diversification in two empirical phylogenies: temperature-dependence in
   Cetacea and delta C-13-dependence in Ruminantia. We illustrate howto
   evaluate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables in
   these two clades and interpret these results in light of
   macroevolutionary hypotheses. Given the important role paleoenvironments
   are presumed to have played in species evolution, our statistical
   assessment of howenvironment-dependent models behave is crucial for
   their utility in macroevolutionary analysis.},

   Estimates},

Volume = {67},

Pages = {340-353},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Divergence time estimation-the calibration of a phylogeny to geological
   time-is an integral first step in modeling the tempo of biological
   evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly
   sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic
   sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life
   contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the
   fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms,
   where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early
   Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years
   or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common
   concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if
   underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al.
   (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time
   inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular
   substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of
   representative major lineages. These results demonstrate the impact of
   (potentially common) model violations. Here, we suggest another
   potential challenge: that the configuration of the statistical inference
   problem (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated
   priors) alone may preclude the reconstruction of the paleontological
   timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through
   sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree
   (diversification) prior with the calibration densities specified for
   fossil-calibrated nodes) that with no data present at all, that an Early
   Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero
   probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes
   calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior
   and posterior age distributions when employing routine lognormal fossil
   calibration priors. These results indicate that there is inadequate
   information in the data to over-rule the joint prior. Given that these
   calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the
   tree, they act to anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior
   inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the
   pseudodata present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We
   recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and
   posterior distributions be carefully compared to determine whether
   signal is coming from the data or prior belief, especially for
   parameters of direct interest. This recommendation is not novel.
   However, given how rarely such checks are carried out in evolutionary
   biology, it bears repeating. Our results demonstrate the fundamental
   importance of prior/posterior comparisons in any Bayesian analysis, and
   we hope that they further encourage both researchers and journals to
   consistently adopt this crucial step as standard practice. Finally, we
   note that the results presented here do not refute the biological
   modeling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of
   issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time
   estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward
   more confidently.},

Abstract = {The origin of amniotes 320 million years ago signalled independence from
   water in vertebrates and was closely followed by divergences within the
   mammal and reptile stem lineages (Synapsida and Reptilia). Early members
   of both groups had highly similar morphologies, being superficially
   `lizard-like' forms with many plesiomorphies. However, the extent to
   which they might have exhibited divergent patterns of evolutionary
   change, with potential to explain the large biological differences
   between their living members, is unresolved. We use a new, comprehensive
   phylogenetic dataset to quantify variation in rates and constraints of
   morphological evolution among Carboniferous-early Permian amniotes. We
   find evidence for an early burst of evolutionary rates, resulting in the
   early origins of morphologically distinctive subgroups that mostly
   persisted through the Cisuralian. Rates declined substantially through
   time, especially in reptiles. Early reptile evolution was also more
   constrained compared to early synapsids, exploring a more limited
   character state space. Postcranial innovation in particular was
   important in early synapsids, potentially related to their early origins
   of large body size. In contrast, early reptiles predominantly varied the
   temporal region, suggesting disparity in skull and jaw kinematics, and
   foreshadowing the variability of cranial biomechanics seen in reptiles
   today. Our results demonstrate that synapsids and reptiles underwent an
   early divergence of macroevolutionary patterns. This laid the foundation
   for subsequent evolutionary events and may be critical in understanding
   the substantial differences between mammals and reptiles today.
   Potential explanations include an early divergence of developmental
   processes or of ecological factors, warranting cross-disciplinary
   investigation.},

Abstract = {To examine phylogenetic heterogeneity in turtle evolution, we collected
   thousands of high-confidence single-copy orthologs from 19 genome
   assemblies representative of extant turtle diversity and estimated a
   phylogeny with multispecies coalescent and concatenated partitioned
   methods. We also collected next-generation sequences from 26 turtle
   species and assembled millions of biallelic markers to reconstruct
   phylogenies based on annotated regions from the western painted turtle
   (Chrysemys picta bellii) genome (coding regions, introns, untranslated
   regions, intergenic, and others). We then measured gene tree-species
   tree discordance, as well as gene and site heterogeneity at each node in
   the inferred trees, and tested for temporal patterns in phylogenomic
   conflict across turtle evolution. We found strong and consistent support
   for all bifurcations in the inferred turtle species phylogenies.
   However, a number of genes, sites, and genomic features supported
   alternate relationships between turtle taxa. Our results suggest that
   gene tree-species tree discordance in these data sets is likely driven
   by population-level processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. We
   found very little effect of substitutional saturation on species tree
   topologies, and no clear phylogenetic patterns in codon usage bias and
   compositional heterogeneity. There was no correlation between gene and
   site concordance, node age, and DNA substitution rate across most
   annotated genomic regions. Our study demonstrates that heterogeneity is
   to be expected even in well-resolved clades such as turtles, and that
   future phylogenomic studies should aim to sample as much of the genome
   as possible in order to obtain accurate phylogenies for assessing
   conservation priorities in turtles. {[}Discordance; genomes; phylogeny;

Title = {StarBeast3: Adaptive Parallelized Bayesian Inference under the
   Multispecies Coalescent},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {As genomic sequence data become increasingly available, inferring the
   phylogeny of the species as that of concatenated genomic data can be
   enticing. However, this approach makes for a biased estimator of branch
   lengths and substitution rates and an inconsistent estimator of tree
   topology. Bayesian multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods address these
   issues. This is achieved by constraining a set of gene trees within a
   species tree and jointly inferring both under a Bayesian framework.
   However, this approach comes at the cost of increased computational
   demand. Here, we introduce StarBeast3-a software package for efficient
   Bayesian inference under the MSC model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We
   gain efficiency by introducing cutting-edge proposal kernels and
   adaptive operators, and StarBeast3 is particularly efficient when a
   relaxed clock model is applied. Furthermore, gene-tree inference is
   parallelized, allowing the software to scale with the size of the
   problem. We validated our software and benchmarked its performance using
   three real and two synthetic data sets. Our results indicate that
   StarBeast3 is up to one-and-a-half orders of magnitude faster than
   StarBeast2, and therefore more than two orders faster than {*}BEAST,
   depending on the data set and on the parameter, and can achieve
   convergence on large data sets with hundreds of genes. StarBeast3 is
   open-source and is easy to set up with a friendly graphical user
   interface. {[}Adaptive; Bayesian inference; BEAST 2; effective

Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses often produce large numbers of trees. Mapping
   trees' distribution in ``tree space{''} can illuminate the behavior and
   performance of search strategies, reveal distinct clusters of optimal
   trees, and expose differences between different data sources or
   phylogenetic methods-but the high-dimensional spaces defined by metric
   distances are necessarily distorted when represented in fewer
   dimensions. Here, I explore the consequences of this transformation in
   phylogenetic search results from 128 morphological data sets, using
   stratigraphic congruence-a complementary aspect of tree similarity-to
   evaluate the utility of low-dimensional mappings. I find that
   phylogenetic similarities between cladograms are most accurately
   depicted in tree spaces derived from information-theoretic tree
   distances or the quartet distance. Robinson-Foulds tree spaces exhibit
   prominent distortions and often fail to group trees according to
   phylogenetic similarity, whereas the strong influence of tree shape on
   the Kendall-Colijn distance makes its tree space unsuitable for many
   purposes. Distances mapped into two or even three dimensions often
   display little correspondence with true distances, which can lead to
   profound misrepresentation of clustering structure. Without explicit
   testing, one cannot be confident that a tree space mapping faithfully
   represents the true distribution of trees, nor that visually evident
   structure is valid. My recommendations for tree space validation and
   visualization are implemented in a new graphical user interface in the
   ``TreeDist{''} R package. {[}Multidimensional scaling; phylogenetic

Title = {Investigating Sources of Conflict in Deep Phylogenomics of Vetigastropod
   Snails},

Number = {4},
Pages = {1009-1022},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses may suffer from multiple sources of error leading
   to conflict between genes and methods of inference. The evolutionary
   history of the mollusc clade Vetigastropoda makes them susceptible to
   these conflicts, their higher level phylogeny remaining largely
   unresolved. Originating over 350 Ma, vetigastropods were the dominant
   marine snails in the Paleozoic. Multiple extinction events and new
   radiations have resulted in both very long and very short branches and a
   large extant diversity of over 4000 species. This is the perfect setting
   of a hard phylogenetic question in which sources of conflict can be
   explored. We present 41 new transcriptomes across the diversity of
   vetigastropods (62 terminals total), and provide the first genomic-scale
   phylogeny for the group. We find that deep divergences differ from
   previous studies in which long branch attraction was likely pervasive.
   Robust results leading to changes in taxonomy include the paraphyly of
   the order Lepetellida and the family Tegulidae. Tectinae subfam. nov. is
   designated for the clade comprising Tectus, Cittarium, and Rochia. For
   two early divergences, topologies disagreed between concatenated
   analyses using site heterogeneous models versus concatenated partitioned
   analyses and summary coalescent methods. We investigated rate and
   composition heterogeneity among genes, as well as missing data by locus
   and by taxon, none of which had an impact on the inferred topologies. We
   also found no evidence for ancient introgression throughout the
   phylogeny. We further tested whether uninformative genes and
   over-partitioning were responsible for this discordance by evaluating
   the phylogenetic signal of individual genes using likelihood mapping,
   and by analyzing the most informative genes with a full multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model. We find that most genes are not informative at
   the two conflicting nodes, but neither this nor gene-wise partitioning
   are the cause of discordant results. New method implementations that
   simultaneously integrate amino acid profile mixture models and the MSC
   might be necessary to resolve these and other recalcitrant nodes in the
   Tree of Life. {[}Fissurellidae; Haliotidae; likelihood mapping;

Abstract = {Establishing an evolutionary timeline is fundamental for tackling a
   great variety of topics in evolutionary biology, including the
   reconstruction of patterns of historical biogeography, coevolution, and
   diversification. However, the tree of life is pruned by extinction and
   molecular data cannot be gathered for extinct lineages. Until recently
   methodological challenges have prevented the application of tip-dating
   Bayesian approaches in morphology-based fossil-only data sets. Herein,
   we present a morphological data set for a group of cricetid rodents to
   which we apply an array of methods fairly new in paleontology that can
   be used by paleontologists for the analysis of entirely extinct clades.
   We compare the tree topologies obtained by traditional parsimony,
   time-calibrated, and noncalibrated Bayesian inference phylogenetic
   approaches and calculate stratigraphic congruence indices for each.
   Bayesian tip-dated clock methods outperform parsimony in the case of our
   data set, which includes highly homoplastic morphological characters.
   Regardless, all three topologies support the monophyly of
   Megacricetodontinae, Democricetodontinae, and Cricetodontinae. Dispersal
   and speciation events inferred through Bayesian Binary Markov chain
   Monte Carlo and biodiversity analyses provide evidence for a correlation
   between biogeographic events, climatic changes, and diversification in
   cricetids. {[}Bayesian tip-dating; Cricetidae; Miocene; morphological

Abstract = {Gene tree discordance in large genomic data sets can be caused by
   evolutionary processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and
   hybridization, as well as model violation, and errors in data
   processing, orthology inference, and gene tree estimation. Species tree
   methods that identify and accommodate all sources of conflict are not
   available, but a combination of multiple approaches can help tease apart
   alternative sources of conflict. Here, using a phylotranscriptomic
   analysis in combination with reference genomes, we test a hypothesis of
   ancient hybridization events within the plant family Amaranthaceae s.l.
   thatwas previously supported bymorphological, ecological, and
   Sanger-based molecular data. The data set included seven genomes and 88
   transcriptomes, 17 generated for this study. We examined gene-tree
   discordance using coalescent-based species trees and network inference,
   gene tree discordance analyses, site pattern tests of introgression,
   topology tests, synteny analyses, and simulations. We found that a
   combination of processes might have generated the high levels of gene
   tree discordance in the backbone of Amaranthaceae s.l. Furthermore, we
   found evidence that three consecutive short internal branches produce
   anomalous trees contributing to the discordance. Overall, our results
   suggest that Amaranthaceae s.l. might be a product of an ancient and
   rapid lineage diversification, and remains, and probably will remain,
   unresolved. This work highlights the potential problems of
   identifiability associated with the sources of gene tree discordance
   including, in particular, phylogenetic network methods. Our results also
   demonstrate the importance of thoroughly testing for multiple sources of
   conflict in phylogenomic analyses, especially in the context of ancient,
   rapid radiations. We provide several recommendations for exploring
   conflicting signals in such situations.},

Title = {Tropical Niche Conservatism Explains the Eocene Migration from India to

Abstract = {Biological migrations between India and Southeast (SE) Asia provide an
   ideal system for exploring the effects of geology and climate on species
   ranges. Geologists have confirmed that the direct collision between
   India and Eurasia occurred in the Early Eocene, but most migrations
   occurred between the Indian subcontinent and SE Asia rather than the
   former and the southern margin of Eurasia. To explain this seemingly
   paradoxical disconnect between the routes of plate movement and
   biological migration, we studied the evolutionary history of the
   tropical spider family Ochyroceratidae based on 101 globally distributed
   species. We infer a robust dated phylogeny using both transcriptomic
   data and a data set of classical markers and relate these to
   biogeographic and climatic analyses. Our results indicate that the
   monophyly of Ochyroceratidae is strongly supported, and the divergence
   times suggest a Cretaceous Gondwanan origin of the family. Reconstructed
   biogeographic histories support a dispersal event from the Indian
   subcontinent to islands of SE Asia 55-38 Ma. Climatic analyses and the
   fossil record reveal that ochyroceratids are characterized by a high
   degree of tropical niche conservatism, and that the ancestor of the
   Indian and SE Asian clades originated in very warm, wet environments.
   Early Eocene tropical, perhumid climates in India, and SE Asia may have
   facilitated ochyroceratid migration, whereas the dry or seasonal climate
   extending from the eastern coast of China to Central Asia may have acted
   as a barrier, preventing dispersal. Our analyses suggest that climate
   plays a more important role than geology in biological migration from
   the Indian subcontinent to SE Asia, providing new insights into the
   Indian-Asian biogeographic link.},

Title = {Interdependent Phenotypic and Biogeographic Evolution Driven by Biotic
   Interactions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {739-755},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Biotic interactions are hypothesized to be one of the main processes
   shaping trait and biogeographic evolution during lineage
   diversification. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that
   species with similar ecological requirements either spatially exclude
   each other, by preventing the colonization of competitors or by driving
   coexisting populations to extinction, or show niche divergence when in
   sympatry. However, the extent and generality of the effect of
   interspecific competition in trait and biogeographic evolution has been
   limited by a dearth of appropriate process-generating models to directly
   test the effect of biotic interactions. Here, we formulate a
   phylogenetic parametric model that allows interdependence between trait
   and biogeographic evolution, thus enabling a direct test of central
   hypotheses on how biotic interactions shape these evolutionary
   processes. We adopt a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate
   the joint posterior distribution of trait histories, range histories,
   and coevolutionary process parameters under this analytically
   intractable model. Through simulations, we show that our model is
   capable of distinguishing alternative scenarios of biotic interactions.
   We apply our model to the radiation of Darwin's finches-a classic
   example of adaptive divergence-and find limited support for in situ
   trait divergence in beak size, but stronger evidence for convergence in
   traits such as beak shape and tarsus length and for competitive
   exclusion throughout their evolutionary history. These findings are more
   consistent with presympatric, rather than postsympatric, niche
   divergence. Our modeling framework opens new possibilities for testing
   more complex hypotheses about the processes underlying lineage
   diversification. More generally, it provides a robust probabilistic
   methodology to model correlated evolution of continuous and discrete
   characters.},

Abstract = {Studies have demonstrated that pervasive gene tree conflict underlies
   several important phylogenetic relationships where different species
   tree methods produce conflicting results. Here, we present a means of
   dissecting the phylogenetic signal for alternative resolutions within a
   data set in order to resolve recalcitrant relationships and,
   importantly, identify what the data set is unable to resolve. These
   procedures extend upon methods for isolating conflict and concordance
   involving specific candidate relationships and can be used to identify
   systematic error and disambiguate sources of conflict among species tree
   inference methods. We demonstrate these on a large phylogenomic plant
   data set. Our results support the placement of Amborella as sister to
   the remaining extant angiosperms, Gnetales as sister to pines, and the
   monophyly of extant gymnosperms. Several other contentious
   relationships, including the resolution of relationships within the
   bryophytes and the eudicots, remain uncertain given the low number of
   supporting gene trees. To address whether concatenation of filtered
   genes amplified phylogenetic signal for relationships, we implemented a
   combinatorial heuristic to test combinability of genes. We found that
   nested conflicts limited the ability of data filtering methods to fully
   ameliorate conflicting signal amongst gene trees. These analyses
   confirmed that the underlying conflicting signal does not support broad
   concatenation of genes. Our approach provides a means of dissecting a
   specific data set to address deep phylogenetic relationships while also
   identifying the inferential boundaries of the data set.},

Title = {The Behavior of Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chains When Sampling Rugged
   Phylogenetic Distributions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {729-734},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic inference relies on the use of Markov chain Monte
   Carlo (MCMC) to provide numerical approximations of high-dimensional
   integrals and estimate posterior probabilities. However, MCMC performs
   poorly when posteriors are very rugged (i.e., regions of high posterior
   density are separated by regions of low posterior density). One
   technique that has become popular for improving numerical estimates from
   MCMC when distributions are rugged is Metropolis coupling (MC3). InMC3,
   additional chains are employed to sample flattened transformations of
   the posterior and improve mixing. Here, we highlight several
   underappreciated behaviors of MC3. Notably, estimated posterior
   probabilities may be incorrect but appear to converge, when individual
   chains do not mix well, despite different chains sampling trees from all
   relevant areas in tree space. Counterintuitively, such behavior can be
   more difficult to diagnose with increased numbers of chains. We
   illustrate these surprising behaviors of MC3 using a simple,
   non-phylogenetic example and phylogenetic examples involving both
   constrained and unconstrained analyses. To detect and mitigate the
   effects of these behaviors, we recommend increasing the number of
   independent analyses and varying the temperature of the hottest chain in
   current versions of Bayesian phylogenetic software. Convergence
   diagnostics based on the behavior of the hottest chain may also help
   detect these behaviors and could form a useful addition to future
   software releases.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Models of tree evolution have mostly focused on capturing the
   cladogenesis processes behind speciation. Processes that derive the
   evolution of genomic elements, such as repeats, are not necessarily
   captured by these existing models. In this article, we design a model of
   tree evolution that we call the dual-birth model, and we show how it can
   be useful in studying the evolution of short Alu repeats found in the
   human genome in abundance. The dual-birth model extends the traditional
   birth-only model to have two rates of propagation, one for active nodes
   that propagate often, and another for inactive nodes, that with a lower
   rate, activate and start propagating. Adjusting the ratio of the rates
   controls the expected tree balance. We present several theoretical
   results under the dual-birth model, introduce parameter estimation
   techniques, and study the properties of the model in simulations. We
   then use the dual-birth model to estimate the number of active Alu
   elements and their rates of propagation and activation in the human
   genome based on a large phylogenetic tree that we build from close to
   one million Alu sequences.},

Title = {Issues and Perspectives in Species Delimitation using Phenotypic Data:
   Atlantean Evolution in Darwin's Finches},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Progress in the development and use of methods for species delimitation
   employing phenotypic data lags behind conceptual and practical advances
   in molecular genetic approaches. The basic evolutionary model underlying
   the use of phenotypic data to delimit species assumes randommating and
   quantitative polygenic traits, so that phenotypic distributions within a
   species should be approximately normal for individuals of the same sex
   and age. Accordingly, two or more distinct normal distributions of
   phenotypic traits suggest the existence of multiple species. In light of
   this model, we show that analytical approaches employed in taxonomic
   studies using phenotypic data are often compromised by three issues: 1)
   reliance on graphical analyses that convey little information on
   phenotype frequencies; 2) exclusion of characters potentially important
   for species delimitation following reduction of data dimensionality; and
   3) use of measures of central tendency to evaluate phenotypic
   distinctiveness. We outline approaches to overcome these issues based on
   statistical developments related to normal mixture models (NMMs) and
   illustrate them empirically with a reanalysis of morphological data
   recently used to claim that there are no morphologically distinct
   species of Darwin's ground-finches (Geospiza). We found negligible
   support for this claim relative to taxonomic hypotheses recognizing
   multiple species. Although species limits among ground-finches merit
   further assessments using additional sources of information, our results
   bear implications for other areas of inquiry including speciation
   research: because ground-finches have likely speciated and are not
   trapped in a process of ``Sisyphean{''} evolution as recently argued,
   they remain useful models to understand the evolutionary forces involved
   in speciation. Our work underscores the importance of statistical
   approaches grounded on appropriate evolutionary models for species
   delimitation. We discuss how NMMs offer new perspectives in the kind of
   inferences available to systematists, with significant repercussions on
   ideas about the phenotypic structure of biodiversity.},

Title = {Robust, Universal Tree Balance Indices},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 12},
Abstract = {Balance indices that quantify the symmetry of branching events and the
   compactness of trees are widely used to compare evolutionary processes
   or tree-generating algorithms. Yet, existing indices are not defined for
   all rooted trees, are unreliable for comparing trees with different
   numbers of leaves, and are sensitive to the presence or absence of rare
   types. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we define a
   new class of robust, universal tree balance indices. These indices take
   a form similar to Colless' index but can account for population sizes,
   are defined for trees with any degree distribution, and enable
   meaningful comparison of trees with different numbers of leaves. Second,
   we show that for bifurcating and all other full m-ary cladograms (in
   which every internal node has the same out-degree), one such
   Colless-like index is equivalent to the normalized reciprocal of
   Sackin's index. Hence, we both unify and generalize the two most popular
   existing tree balance indices. Our indices are intrinsically normalized
   and can be computed in linear time. We conclude that these more widely
   applicable indices have the potential to supersede those in current use.

Title = {Full-Likelihood Genomic Analysis Clarifies a Complex History of Species
   Divergence and Introgression: The Example of the erato-sara Group of
   Heliconius Butterflies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 16},
Abstract = {Introgressive hybridization plays a key role in adaptive evolution and
   species diversification in many groups of species. However, frequent
   hybridization and gene flow between species make estimation of the
   species phylogeny and key population parameters challenging. Here, we
   show that by accounting for phasing and using full-likelihood methods,
   introgression histories and population parameters can be estimated
   reliably from whole-genome sequence data. We employ the multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model with and without gene flow to infer the species
   phylogeny and cross-species introgression events using genomic data from
   six members of the erato-sara clade of Heliconius butterflies. The
   methods naturally accommodate random fluctuations in genealogical
   history across the genome due to deep coalescence. To avoid heterozygote
   phasing errors in haploid sequences commonly produced by genome assembly
   methods, we process and compile unphased diploid sequence alignments and
   use analytical methods to average over uncertainties in heterozygote
   phase resolution. There is robust evidence for introgression across the
   genome, both among distantly related species deep in the phylogeny and
   between sister species in shallow parts of the tree. We obtain
   chromosome-specific estimates of key population parameters such as
   introgression directions, times and probabilities, as well as species
   divergence times and population sizes for modern and ancestral species.
   We confirm ancestral gene flow between the sara clade and an ancestral
   population of Heliconius telesiphe, a likely hybrid speciation origin
   for Heliconius hecalesia, and gene flow between the sister species
   Heliconius erato and Heliconius himera. Inferred introgression among
   ancestral species also explains the history of two chromosomal
   inversions deep in the phylogeny of the group. This study illustrates
   how a full-likelihood approach based on the MSC makes it possible to
   extract rich historical information of species divergence and gene flow
   from genomic data. {[}3s; bpp; gene flow; Heliconius; hybrid speciation;

Title = {Relative Time Constraints Improve Molecular Dating},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Dating the tree of life is central to understanding the evolution of
   life on Earth. Molecular clocks calibrated with fossils represent the
   state of the art for inferring the ages of major groups. Yet, other
   information on the timing of species diversification can be used to date
   the tree of life. For example, horizontal gene transfer events and
   ancient coevolutionary interactions such as (endo)symbioses occur
   between contemporaneous species and thus can imply temporal
   relationships between two nodes in a phylogeny. Temporal constraints
   from these alternative sources can be particularly helpful when the
   geological record is sparse, for example, for microorganisms, which
   represent the majority of extant and extinct biodiversity. Here, we
   present a new method to combine fossil calibrations and relative age
   constraints to estimate chronograms. We provide an implementation of
   relative age constraints in RevBayes that can be combined in a modular
   manner with the wide range of molecular dating methods available in the
   software. We use both realistic simulations and empirical datasets of 40
   Cyanobacteria and 62 Archaea to evaluate our method. We show that the
   combination of relative age constraints with fossil calibrations
   significantly improves the estimation of node ages. {[}Archaea, Bayesian

Abstract = {Evolutionary comparisons between major environmental divides, such as
   between marine and freshwater systems, can reveal the fundamental
   processes governing diversification dynamics. Although processes may
   differ due to the different scales of their biogeographic barriers,
   freshwater and marine environments nevertheless offer similar
   opportunities for diversification in benthic, demersal, and pelagic
   habitats. Here, we compare the evolutionary patterns and processes
   shaping teleost diversity in each of these three habitats and between
   marine and freshwater systems. Using specimens from the National Museum
   of Natural History, we developed a data set of linear measurements
   capturing body shape in 2266 freshwater and 3344 marine teleost species.
   With a novel comparative approach, we contrast the primary axis of
   morphological diversification in each habitat with the major axis
   defined by phylogenetic signal. By comparing angles between these axes,
   we find that fish in corresponding habitats have more similar primary
   axes of morphological diversity than would be expected by chance, but
   that different historical processes underlie these parallel patterns in
   freshwater and marine environments. Marine diversification is more
   strongly aligned with phylogenetic signal and shows a trend toward
   lineages occupying separate regions of morphospace. In contrast,
   ecological signal appears to be a strong driver of diversification in
   freshwater lineages through repeated morphological evolution in densely
   packed regions of morphospace. In spite of these divergent histories,
   our findings reveal that habitat has driven convergent patterns of
   evolutionary diversification on a global scale. {[}Benthic-pelagic axis;

Volume = {71},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Bayesian phylogenetics, the coalescent process provides an
   informative framework for inferring changes in the effective size of a
   population from a phylogeny (or tree) of sequences sampled from that
   population. Popular coalescent inference approaches such as the Bayesian
   Skyline Plot, Skyride, and Skygrid all model these population size
   changes with a discontinuous, piecewise-constant function but then apply
   a smoothing prior to ensure that their posterior population size
   estimates transition gradually with time. These prior distributions
   implicitly encode extra population size information that is not
   available from the observed coalescent data or tree. Here, we present a
   novel statistic, Omega, to quantify and disaggregate the relative
   contributions of the coalescent data and prior assumptions to the
   resulting posterior estimate precision. Our statistic also measures the
   additional mutual information introduced by such priors. Using we show
   that, because it is surprisingly easy to overparametrize
   piecewise-constant population models, common smoothing priors can lead
   to overconfident and potentially misleading inference, even under robust
   experimental designs. We propose Omega as a useful tool for detecting
   when effective population size estimates are overly reliant on prior
   assumptions and for improving quantification of the uncertainty in those
   estimates.},

Title = {The Perfect Storm: Gene Tree Estimation Error, Incomplete Lineage
   Sorting, and Ancient Gene Flow Explain the Most Recalcitrant Ancient
   Angiosperm Clade, Malpighiales},

Abstract = {The genomic revolution offers renewed hope of resolving rapid radiations
   in the Tree of Life. The development of the multispecies coalescent
   model and improved gene tree estimation methods can better accommodate
   gene tree heterogeneity caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and
   gene tree estimation error stemming from the short internal branches.
   However, the relative influence of these factors in species tree
   inference is not well understood. Using anchored hybrid enrichment, we
   generated a data set including 423 single-copy loci from 64 taxa
   representing 39 families to infer the species tree of the flowering
   plant order Malpighiales. This order includes 9 of the top 10 most
   unstable nodes in angiosperms, which have been hypothesized to arise
   from the rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Here, we show that
   coalescent-based methods do not resolve the backbone of Malpighiales and
   concatenation methods yield inconsistent estimations, providing evidence
   that gene tree heterogeneity is high in this clade. Despite high levels
   of ILS and gene tree estimation error, our simulations demonstrate that
   these two factors alone are insufficient to explain the lack of
   resolution in this order. To explore this further, we examined triplet
   frequencies among empirical gene trees and discovered some of them
   deviated significantly from those attributed to ILS and estimation
   error, suggesting gene flow as an additional and previously
   unappreciated phenomenon promoting gene tree variation in Malpighiales.
   Finally, we applied a novel method to quantify the relative contribution
   of these three primary sources of gene tree heterogeneity and
   demonstrated that ILS, gene tree estimation error, and gene flow
   contributed to 10.0, 34.8, and 21.4 of the variation, respectively.
   Together, our results suggest that a perfect storm of factors likely
   influence this lack of resolution, and further indicate that
   recalcitrant phylogenetic relationships like the backbone of
   Malpighiales may be better represented as phylogenetic networks. Thus,
   reducing such groups solely to existing models that adhere strictly to
   bifurcating trees greatly oversimplifies reality, and obscures our
   ability to more clearly discern the process of evolution.},

Abstract = {The extent to which phylogenetic diversity (PD) captures feature
   diversity (FD) is a topical and controversial question in biodiversity
   conservation. In this short paper, we formalize this question and
   establish a precise mathematical condition for FD (based on discrete
   characters) to coincide with PD. In this way, we make explicit the two
   main reasons why the two diversity measures might disagree for given
   data; namely, the presence of certain patterns of feature evolution and
   loss, and using temporal branch lengths for PD in settings that may not
   be appropriate (e.g., due to rapid evolution of certain features over
   short periods of time). Our article also explores the relationship
   between the ``Fair Proportion{''} index of PD and a simple index of FD
   (both of which correspond to Shapley values in cooperative game theory).
   In a second mathematical result, we show that the two indices can take
   identical values for any phylogenetic tree, provided the branch lengths
   in the tree are chosen appropriately.},

Title = {On the Selection and Analysis of Clades in Comparative Evolutionary
   Studies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {190-196},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Researchers commonly present results of comparative studies of taxonomic
   groups. In this review, we criticize the focus on named clades, usually,
   comparably ranked groups such as families or orders, for comparative
   evolutionary analyses and question the general practice of using clades
   as units of analysis. The practice of analyzing sets of named groups
   persists despite widespread appreciation that the groups we have chosen
   to name are based on subjective human concerns rather than objective
   properties of nature. We demonstrate an effect of clade selection on
   results in one study and present some potential alternatives to
   selecting named clades for analysis that are relatively objective in
   clade choice. However, we note that these alternatives are only partial
   solutions for clade-based studies. The practice of analyzing named
   clades obviously is biased and problematic, but its issues portend
   broader problems with the general approach of employing clades as units
   of analysis. Most clade-based studies do not account for the
   nonindependence of clades, and the biological insight gained from
   demonstrating some pattern among a particular arbitrary sample of groups
   is arguable.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of complex ecological traits-including
   multistate representations of diet, habitat, and behavior-remain poorly
   understood. Reconstructing the tempo, mode, and historical sequence of
   transitions involving such traits poses many challenges for comparative
   biologists, owing to their multidimensional nature. Continuous-time
   Markov chains are commonly used to model ecological niche evolution on
   phylogenetic trees but are limited by the assumption that taxa are
   monomorphic and that states are univariate categorical variables. A
   necessary first step in the analysis of many complex traits is therefore
   to categorize species into a predetermined number of univariate
   ecological states, but this procedure can lead to distortion and loss of
   information. This approach also confounds interpretation of state
   assignments with effects of sampling variation because it does not
   directly incorporate empirical observations for individual species into
   the statistical inference model. In this study, we develop a
   Dirichlet-multinomial framework to model resource use evolution on
   phylogenetic trees. Our approach is expressly designed to model
   ecological traits that are multidimensional and to account for
   uncertainty in state assignments of terminal taxa arising from effects
   of sampling variation. The method uses multivariate count data across a
   set of discrete resource categories sampled for individual species to
   simultaneously infer the number of ecological states, the proportional
   utilization of different resources by different states, and the
   phylogenetic distribution of ecological states among living species and
   their ancestors. The method is general and may be applied to any data
   expressible as a set of observational counts from different categories.},

Title = {Repositories for Taxonomic Data: Where We Are and What is Missing},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Natural history collections are leading successful large-scale projects
   of specimen digitization (images, metadata, DNA barcodes), thereby
   transforming taxonomy into a big data science. Yet, little effort has
   been directed towards safeguarding and subsequently mobilizing the
   considerable amount of original data generated during the process of
   naming 15,000-20,000 species every year. From the perspective of
   alpha-taxonomists, we provide a review of the properties and diversity
   of taxonomic data, assess their volume and use, and establish criteria
   for optimizing data repositories. We surveyed 4113 alpha-taxonomic
   studies in representative journals for 2002, 2010, and 2018, and found
   an increasing yet comparatively limited use of molecular data in species
   diagnosis and description. In 2018, of the 2661 papers published in
   specialized taxonomic journals, molecular data were widely used in
   mycology (94\%), regularly in vertebrates (53\%), but rarely in botany
   (15\%) and entomology (10\%). Images play an important role in taxonomic
   research on all taxa, with photographs used in >80\% and drawings in
   58\% of the surveyed papers. The use of omics (high-throughput)
   approaches or 3D documentation is still rare. Improved archiving
   strategies for metabarcoding consensus reads, genome and transcriptome
   assemblies, and chemical and metabolomic data could help to mobilize the
   wealth of high-throughput data for alphataxonomy. Because
   long-term-ideally perpetual-data storage is of particular importance for
   taxonomy, energy footprint reduction via less storage-demanding formats
   is a priority if their information content suffices for the purpose of
   taxonomic studies. Whereas taxonomic assignments are quasifacts for most
   biological disciplines, they remain hypotheses pertaining to
   evolutionary relatedness of individuals for alpha-taxonomy. For this
   reason, an improved reuse of taxonomic data, including
   machine-learning-based species identification and delimitation
   pipelines, requires a cyberspecimen approachlinking data via unique
   specimen identifiers, and thereby making them findable, accessible,
   interoperable, and reusable for taxonomic research. This poses both
   qualitative challenges to adapt the existing infrastructure of data
   centers to a specimencentered concept and quantitative challenges to
   host and connect an estimated <2 million images produced per year by
   alpha-taxonomic studies, plus many millions of images from digitization
   campaigns. Of the 30,000-40,000 taxonomists globally, many are thought
   to be nonprofessionals, and capturing the data for online storage and
   reuse therefore requires low-complexity submission workflows and
   cost-free repository use. Expert taxonomists are the main stakeholders
   able to identify and formalize the needs of the discipline; their
   expertise is needed to implement the envisioned virtual collections of
   cyberspecimens.},

Abstract = {The Viviparidae, commonly known as River Snails, is a dominant group of
   freshwater snails with a nearly worldwide distribution that reaches its
   highest taxonomic and morphological diversity in Southeast Asia. The
   rich fossil record is indicative of a probable Middle Jurassic origin on
   the Laurasian supercontinent where the group started to diversify during
   the Cretaceous. However, it remains uncertain when and how the
   biodiversity hotspot in Southeast Asia was formed. Here, we used a
   comprehensive genetic data set containing both mitochondrial and nuclear
   markers and comprising species representing 24 out of 28 genera from
   throughout the range of the family. To reconstruct the spatiotemporal
   evolution of viviparids on a global scale, we reconstructed a
   fossil-calibrated phylogeny. We further assessed the roles of
   cladogenetic and anagenetic events in range evolution. Finally, we
   reconstructed the evolution of shell features by estimating ancestral
   character states to assess whether the appearance of sculptured shell
   morphologies was driven by major habitat shifts. The molecular phylogeny
   supports the monophyly of the three subfamilies, the Bellamyinae,
   Lioplacinae, and Viviparinae, but challenges the currently accepted
   genus-level classification in several cases. The almost global
   distribution of River Snails has been influenced both by comparatively
   ancient vicariance and more recent founder events. In Southeast Asia,
   Miocene dispersal was a main factor in shaping the modern species
   distributions. A recurrent theme across different viviparid taxa is that
   many species living in lentic waters exhibit sculptured shells, whereas
   only one strongly sculptured species is known from lotic environments.
   We show that such shell sculpture is habitat-dependent and indeed
   evolved several times independently in lentic River Snails. Considerably
   high transition rates between shell types in lentic habitats probably
   caused the co-occurrence of morphologically distinct shell types in
   several lakes. In contrast, directional evolution toward smooth shells
   in lotic habitats, as identified in the present analyses, explains why
   sculptured shells are rarely found in these habitats. However, the
   specific factors that promoted changes in shell morphology require
   further work.},

   Inference of Deep Basidiomycota Relationships},

Abstract = {Resolving deep divergences in the tree of life is challenging even for
   analyses of genome-scale phylogenetic data sets. Relationships between
   Basidiomycota subphyla, the rusts and allies (Pucciniomycotina), smuts
   and allies (Ustilaginomycotina), and mushroom-forming fungi and allies
   (Agaricomycotina) were found particularly recalcitrant both to
   traditional multigene and genome-scale phylogenetics. Here, we address
   basal Basidiomycota relationships using concatenated and gene tree-based
   analyses of various phylogenomic data sets to examine the contribution
   of several potential sources of bias. We evaluate the contribution of
   biological causes (hard polytomy, incomplete lineage sorting) versus
   unmodeled evolutionary processes and factors that exacerbate their
   effects (e.g., fast-evolving sites and long-branch taxa) to inferences
   of basal Basidiomycota relationships. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   and likelihood mapping analyses reject the hard polytomy with
   confidence. In concatenated analyses, fast-evolving sites and
   oversimplified models of amino acid substitution favored the grouping of
   smuts with mushroom-forming fungi, often leading to maximal bootstrap
   support in both concatenation and coalescent analyses. On the contrary,
   the most conserved data subsets grouped rusts and allies with
   mushroom-forming fungi, although this relationship proved labile,
   sensitive to model choice, to different data subsets and to missing
   data. Excluding putative long-branch taxa, genes with high proportions
   of missing data and/or with strong signal failed to reveal a consistent
   trend toward one or the other topology, suggesting that additional
   sources of conflict are at play. While concatenated analyses yielded
   strong but conflicting support, individual gene trees mostly provided
   poor support for any resolution of rusts, smuts, and mushroom-forming
   fungi, suggesting that the true Basidiomycota tree might be in a part of
   tree space that is difficult to access using both concatenation and gene
   tree-based approaches. Inference-based assessments of absolute model fit
   strongly reject best-fit models for the vast majority of genes,
   indicating a poor fit of even the most commonly used models. While this
   is consistent with previous assessments of site-homogenous models of
   amino acid evolution, this does not appear to be the sole source of
   confounding signal. Our analyses suggest that topologies uniting smuts
   with mushroom-forming fungi can arise as a result of inappropriate
   modeling of amino acid sites that might be prone to systematic bias. We
   speculate that improved models of sequence evolution could shed more
   light on basal splits in the Basidiomycota, which, for now, remain
   unresolved despite the use of whole genome data.},

Title = {An algorithm for Morphological Phylogenetic Analysis with Inapplicable
   Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {68},

Pages = {619-631},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Morphological data play a key role in the inference of biological
   relationships and evolutionary history and are essential for the
   interpretation of the fossil record. The hierarchical interdependence of
   many morphological characters, however, complicates phylogenetic
   analysis. In particular, many characters only apply to a subset of
   terminal taxa. The widely used ``reductive coding{''} approach treats
   taxa in which a character is inapplicable as though the character's
   state is simply missing (unknown). This approach has long been known to
   create spurious tree length estimates on certain topologies, potentially
   leading to erroneous results in phylogenetic searches-but pratical
   solutions have yet to be proposed and implemented. Here, we present a
   single-character algorithm for reconstructing ancestral states in
   reductively coded data sets, following the theoretical guideline of
   minimizing homoplasy over all characters. Our algorithm uses up to three
   traversals to score a tree, and a fourth to fully resolve final states
   at each node within the tree. We use explicit criteria to resolve
   ambiguity in applicable/inapplicable dichotomies, and to optimize
   missing data. So that it can be applied to single characters, the
   algorithm employs local optimization; as such, the method provides a
   fast but approximate inference of ancestral states and tree score. The
   application of our method to published morphological data sets indicates
   that, compared to traditional methods, it identifies different trees as
   ``optimal.{''} As such, the use of our algorithm to handle inapplicable
   data may significantly alter the outcome of tree searches, modifying the
   inferred placement of living and fossil taxa and potentially leading to
   major differences in reconstructions of evolutionary history.},

Abstract = {Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate
   genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological
   processes occur, such that, it is possible to make inferences about
   their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose
   it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting
   inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key
   features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a
   model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present
   TreeModelAdequacy, a package for the popular BEAST2 software that allows
   assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility
   by analyzing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and
   H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately
   described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1
   influenza data were best described by the birth-death
   susceptible-infected-recovered model.},

Abstract = {New World Monkeys (NWM) (platyrrhines) are one of the most diverse
   groups of primates, occupying today a wide range of ecosystems in the
   American tropics and exhibiting large variations in ecology, morphology,
   and behavior. Although the relationships among the almost 200 living
   species are relatively well understood, we lack robust estimates of the
   timing of origin, ancestral morphology, and geographic range evolution
   of the clade. Herein, we integrate paleontological and molecular
   evidence to assess the evolutionary dynamics of extinct and extant
   platyrrhines. We develop novel analytical frameworks to infer the
   evolution of body mass, changes in latitudinal ranges through time, and
   species diversification rates using a phylogenetic tree of living and
   fossil taxa. Our results show that platyrrhines originated 510 million
   years earlier than previously assumed, dating back to the Middle Eocene.
   The estimated ancestral platyrrhine was smalluweighing 0.4 kguand
   matched the size of their presumed African ancestors. As the three
   platyrrhine families diverged, we recover a rapid change in body mass
   range. During the Miocene Climatic Optimum, fossil diversity peaked and
   platyrrhines reached their widest latitudinal range, expanding as far
   South as Patagonia, favored by warm and humid climate and the lower
   elevation of the Andes. Finally, global cooling and aridification after
   the middle Miocene triggered a geographic contraction of NWM and
   increased their extinction rates. These results unveil the full
   evolutionary trajectory of an iconic and ecologically important
   radiation of monkeys and showcase the necessity of integrating fossil
   and molecular data for reliably estimating evolutionary rates and
   trends.},

Title = {Accounting for Calibration Uncertainty: Bayesian Molecular Dating as a
   ``Doubly Intractable{''} Problem},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {651-661},

Abstract = {This study introduces a new Bayesian technique for molecular dating that
   explicitly accommodates for uncertainty in the phylogenetic position of
   calibrated nodes derived from the analysis of fossil data. The proposed
   approach thus defines an adequate framework for incorporating expert
   knowledge and/or prior information about the way fossils were collected
   in the inference of node ages. Although it belongs to the class of
   ``node-dating{''} approaches, this method shares interesting properties
   with ``tip-dating{''} techniques. Yet, it alleviates some of the
   computational and modeling difficulties that hamper tip-dating
   approaches. The influence of fossil data on the probabilistic
   distribution of trees is the crux of the matter considered here. More
   specifically, among all the phylogenies that a treemodel (e.g., the
   birth-death process) generates, only a fraction of them ``agree{''} with
   the fossil data. Bayesian inference under the new model requires taking
   this fraction into account. However, evaluating this quantity is
   difficult in practice. A generic solution to this issue is presented
   here. The proposed approach relies on a recent statistical technique,
   the so-called exchange algorithm, dedicated to drawing samples from
   ``doubly intractable{''} distributions. A small example illustrates the
   problem of interest and the impact of uncertainty in the placement of
   calibration constraints in the phylogeny given fossil data. An analysis
   of land plant sequences and multiple fossils further highlights the
   pertinence of the proposed approach.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Modern infectious disease outbreak surveillance produces continuous
   streams of sequence data which require phylogenetic analysis as data
   arrives. Current software packages for Bayesian phylogenetic inference
   are unable to quickly incorporate new sequences as they become
   available, making them less useful for dynamically unfolding
   evolutionary stories. This limitation can be addressed by applying a
   class of Bayesian statistical inference algorithms called sequential
   Monte Carlo (SMC) to conduct online inference, wherein newdata can be
   continuously incorporated to update the estimate of the posterior
   probability distribution. In this article, we describe and evaluate
   several different online phylogenetic sequential Monte Carlo (OPSMC)
   algorithms. We show that proposing new phylogenies with a density
   similar to the Bayesian prior suffers from poor performance, and we
   develop ``guided{''} proposals that better match the proposal density to
   the posterior. Furthermore, we show that the simplest guided proposals
   can exhibit pathological behavior in some situations, leading to poor
   results, and that the situation can be resolved by heating the proposal
   density. The results demonstrate that relative to the widely used
   MCMC-based algorithm implemented in MrBayes, the total time required to
   compute a series of phylogenetic posteriors as sequences arrive can be
   significantly reduced by the use of OPSMC, without incurring a
   significant loss in accuracy.},

Title = {Conflicting Evolutionary Histories of the Mitochondrial and Nuclear

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The rapid diversification of Myotis bats into more than 100 species is
   one of the most extensive mammalian radiations available for study.
   Efforts to understand relationships within Myotis have primarily
   utilized mitochondrial markers and trees inferred from nuclear markers
   lacked resolution. Our current understanding of relationships within
   Myotis is therefore biased towards a set of phylogenetic markers that
   may not reflect the history of the nuclear genome. To resolve this, we
   sequenced the full mitochondrial genomes of 37 representative Myotis,
   primarily from the New World, in conjunction with targeted sequencing of
   3648 ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We inferred the phylogeny and
   explored the effects of concatenation and summary phylogenetic methods,
   as well as combinations of markers based on informativeness or levels of
   missing data, on our results. Of the 294 phylogenies generated from the
   nuclear UCE data, all are significantly different from phylogenies
   inferred using mitochondrial genomes. Even within the nuclear data,
   quartet frequencies indicate that around half of all UCE loci conflict
   with the estimated species tree. Several factors can drive such
   conflict, including incomplete lineage sorting, introgressive
   hybridization, or even phylogenetic error. Despite the degree of
   discordance between nuclear UCE loci and the mitochondrial genome and
   among UCE loci themselves, the most common nuclear topology is recovered
   in one quarter of all analyses with strong nodal support. Based on these
   results, we re-examine the evolutionary history of Myotis to better
   understand the phenomena driving their unique nuclear, mitochondrial,
   and biogeographic histories.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Reliable estimation of phylogeny is central to avoid inaccuracy in
   downstream macroevolutionary inferences. However, limitations exist in
   the implementation of concatenated and summary coalescent approaches,
   and Bayesian and full coalescent inference methods may not yet be
   feasible for computation of phylogeny using complicated models and large
   data sets. Here, we explored methodological (e.g., optimality criteria,
   character sampling, model selection) and biological (e.g., heterotachy,
   branch length heterogeneity) sources of systematic error that can result
   in biased or incorrect parameter estimates when reconstructing phylogeny
   by using the gadiform fishes as a model Glade. Gadiformes include some
   of the most economically important fishes in the world (e.g., Cods,
   Hakes, and Rattails). Despite many attempts, a robust higher-level
   phylogenetic framework was lacking due to limited character and
   taxonomic sampling, particularly from several species-poor families that
   have been recalcitrant to phylogenetic placement. We compiled the first
   phylogenomic data set, including 14,208 loci (>2.8 M bp) from 58 species
   representing all recognized gadiform families, to infer a
   time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. Data were generated with a
   gene-capture approach targeting coding DNA sequences from single-copy
   protein-coding genes. Species-tree and concatenated maximum-likelihood
   (ML) analyses resolved all family-level relationships within Gadiformes.
   While there were a few differences between topologies produced by the
   DNA and the amino acid data sets, most of the historically unresolved
   relationships among gadiform lineages were consistently well resolved
   with high support in our analyses regardless of the methodological and
   biological approaches used. However, at deeper levels, we observed
   inconsistency in branch support estimates between bootstrap and gene and
   site coefficient factors (gCF, sCF). Despite numerous short internodes,
   all relationships received unequivocal bootstrap support while gCF and
   sCF had very little support, reflecting hidden conflict across loci.
   Most of the gene-tree and species-tree discordance in our study is a
   result of short divergence times, and consequent lack of informative
   characters at deep levels, rather than incomplete lineage sorting. We
   use this phylogeny to establish a new higher-level classification of
   Gadiformes as a way of clarifying the evolutionary diversification of
   the order. We recognize 17 families in five suborders: Bregmacerotoidei,
   Gadoidei, Ranicipitoidei, Merluccioidei, and Macrouroidei (including two
   subclades). A time-calibrated analysis using 15 fossil taxa suggests
   that Gadiformes evolved similar to 79.5 Ma in the late Cretaceous, but
   that most extant lineages diverged after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg)
   mass extinction (66 Ma). Our results reiterate the importance of
   examining phylogenomic analyses for evidence of systematic error that
   can emerge as a result of unsuitable modeling of biological factors
   and/or methodological issues, even when data sets are large and yield
   high support for phylogenetic relationships.},

Abstract = {The geographic distribution of biodiversity is central to understanding
   evolutionary biology. Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic histories often
   help to explain how biogeographic patterns unfold through time. However,
   such patterns are also influenced by a variety of other factors, such as
   lineage diversification, that may affect the probability of certain
   types of biogeographic events. The complex and well-known geologic and
   climatic history of Afro-Arabia, together with the extensive research on
   reptile systematics in the region, makes Afro-Arabian squamate
   communities an ideal system to investigate biogeographic patterns and
   their drivers. Here, we reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and
   the ancestral geographic distributions of several Afro-Arabian reptile
   clades (totaling 430 species) to estimate the number of dispersal,
   vicariance and range contraction events. We then compare the observed
   biogeographic history to a distribution of simulated biogeographic
   events based on the empirical phylogeny and the best-fit model. This
   allows us to identify periods in the past where the observed
   biogeographic history was likely shaped by forces beyond the ones
   included in the model. We find an increase in vicariance following the
   Oligocene, most likely caused by the fragmentation of the Afro-Arabian
   plate. In contrast, we did not find differences between observed and
   expected dispersal and range contraction levels. This is consistent with
   diversification enhanced by environmental processes and with the
   establishment of a dispersal corridor connecting Africa, Arabia and
   Eurasia since the middle Miocene. Finally, here we show that our novel
   approach is useful to pinpoint events in the evolutionary history of
   lineages that might reflect external forces not predicted by the
   underlying biogeographic model. {[}Dispersal; diversification; model

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees provide a powerful framework for testing
   macroevolutionary hypotheses, but it is becoming increasingly apparent
   that inferences derived from extant species alone can be highly
   misleading. Trees incorporating living and extinct taxa are needed to
   address fundamental questions about the origins of diversity and
   disparity but it has proved challenging to generate robust, species-rich
   phylogenies that include large numbers of fossil taxa. As a result, most
   studies of diversification dynamics continue to rely on molecular
   phylogenies. Here, we extend and apply a recently developed
   meta-analytic approach for synthesizing previously published
   phylogenetic studies to infer a well-resolved set of species level,
   time-scaled phylogenetic hypotheses for extinct and extant cetaceans
   (whales, dolphins, and allies). Our trees extend sampling from the
   similar to 90 extant species to over 500 living and extinct species, and
   therefore allow for more robust inference of macroevolutionary dynamics.
   While the diversification scenarios, we recover are broadly concordant
   with those inferred from molecular phylogenies they differ in critical
   ways, notably in the relative contributions of extinction and speciation
   rate shifts in driving rapid radiations. The metatree approach provides
   the most immediate route for generating higher level phylogenies of
   extinct taxa and opens the door to re-evaluation of macroevolutionary
   hypotheses derived only from extant taxa.},

Title = {Phylogenomics Reveals Ancient Gene Tree Discordance in the Amphibian

Volume = {70},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Molecular phylogenies have yielded strong support for many parts of the
   amphibian Tree of Life, but poor support for the resolution of deeper
   nodes, including relationships among families and orders. To clarify
   these relationships, we provide a phylogenomic perspective on amphibian
   relationships by developing a taxon-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment
   protocol targeting hundreds of conserved exons which are effective
   across the class. After obtaining data from 220 loci for 286 species
   (representing 94\% of the families and 44\% of the genera), we estimate
   a phylogeny for extant amphibians and identify gene tree-species tree
   conflict across the deepest branches of the amphibian phylogeny. We
   perform locus-by-locus genealogical interrogation of alternative
   topological hypotheses for amphibian monophyly, focusing on interordinal
   relationships. We find that phylogenetic signal deep in the amphibian
   phylogeny varies greatly across loci in a manner that is consistent with
   incomplete lineage sorting in the ancestral lineage of extant
   amphibians. Our results overwhelmingly support amphibian monophyly and a
   sister relationship between frogs and salamanders, consistent with the
   Batrachia hypothesis. Species tree analyses converge on a small set of
   topological hypotheses for the relationships among extant amphibian
   families. These results clarify several contentious portions of the
   amphibian Tree of Life, which in conjunction with a set of vetted fossil
   calibrations, support a surprisingly younger timescale for crown and
   ordinal amphibian diversification than previously reported. More
   broadly, our study provides insight into the sources, magnitudes, and
   heterogeneity of support across loci in phylogenomic data sets.},

Title = {Joint Phylogenetic Estimation of Geographic Movements and Biome Shifts
   during the Global Diversification of Viburnum},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Phylogeny, molecular sequences, fossils, biogeography, and biome
   occupancy are all lines of evidence that reflect the singular
   evolutionary history of a clade, but they are most often studied
   separately, by first inferring a fossil-dated molecular phylogeny, then
   mapping on ancestral ranges and biomes inferred from extant species.
   Here we jointly model the evolution of biogeographic ranges, biome
   affinities, and molecular sequences, while incorporating fossils to
   estimate a dated phylogeny for all of the 163 extant species of the
   woody plant clade Viburnum (Adoxaceae) that we currently recognize in
   our ongoing worldwide monographic treatment of the group. Our analyses
   indicate that while the major Viburnum lineages evolved in the Eocene,
   the majority of extant species originated since the Miocene. Viburnum
   radiated first in Asia, in warm, broad-leaved evergreen (lucidophyllous)
   forests. Within Asia, we infer several early shifts into more tropical
   forests, and multiple shifts into forests that experience prolonged
   freezing. From Asia, we infer two early movements into the New World.
   These two lineages probably first occupied warm temperate forests and
   adapted later to spreading cold climates. One of these lineages
   (Porphyrotinus) occupied cloud forests and moved south through the
   mountains of the Neotropics. Several other movements into North America
   took place more recently, facilitated by prior adaptations to freezing
   in the Old World. We also infer four disjunctions between Asia and
   Europe: the Tinus lineage is the oldest and probably occupied warm
   forests when it spread, whereas the other three were more recent and in
   cold-adapted lineages. These results variously contradict published
   accounts, especially the view that Viburnum radiated initially in cold
   forests and, accordingly, maintained vessel elements with scalariform
   perforations. We explored how the location and biome assignments of
   fossils affected our inference of ancestral areas and biome states. Our
   results are sensitive to, but not entirely dependent upon, the inclusion
   of fossil biome data. It will be critical to take advantage of all
   available lines of evidence to decipher events in the distant past. The
   joint estimation approach developed here provides cautious hope even
   when fossil evidence is limited.},

Title = {A Darwinian Uncertainty Principle},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {521-529},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Reconstructing ancestral characters and traits along a phylogenetic tree
   is central to evolutionary biology. It is the key to understanding
   morphology changes among species, inferring ancestral biochemical
   properties of life, or recovering migration routes in phylogeography.
   The goal is 2-fold: to reconstruct the character state at the tree root
   (e.g., the region of origin of some species) and to understand the
   process of state changes along the tree (e.g., species flow between
   countries). We deal here with discrete characters, which are
   ``unique,{''} as opposed to sequence characters (nucleotides or
   amino-acids), where we assume the same model for all the characters (or
   for large classes of characters with site-dependent models) and thus
   benefit from multiple information sources. In this framework, we use
   mathematics and simulations to demonstrate that although each goal can
   be achieved with high accuracy individually, it is generally impossible
   to accurately estimate both the root state and the rates of state
   changes along the tree branches, from the observed data at the tips of
   the tree. This is because the global rates of state changes along the
   branches that are optimal for the two estimation tasks have opposite
   trends, leading to a fundamental trade-off in accuracy. This inherent
   ``Darwinian uncertainty principle{''} concerning the simultaneous
   estimation of ``patterns{''} and ``processes{''} governs ancestral
   reconstructions in biology. For certain tree shapes (typically
   speciation trees) the uncertainty of simultaneous estimation is reduced
   when more tips are present; however, for other tree shapes it does not
   (e.g., coalescent trees used in population genetics).},

Title = {Strengthening the Interaction of the Virology Community with the
   International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) by Linking Virus
   Names and Their Abbreviations to Virus Species},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {828-839},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is tasked with
   classifying viruses into taxa (phyla to species) and devising taxon
   names. Virus names and virus name abbreviations are currently not within
   the ICTV's official remit and are not regulated by an official entity.
   Many scientists, medical/veterinary professionals, and regulatory
   agencies do not address evolutionary questions nor are they concerned
   with the hierarchical organization of the viral world, and therefore,
   have limited use for ICTV-devised taxa. Instead, these professionals
   look to the ICTV as an expert point source that provides the most
   current taxonomic affiliations of viruses of interests to facilitate
   document writing. These needs are currently unmet as an ICTV-supported,
   easily searchable database that includes all published virus names and
   abbreviations linked to their taxa is not available. In addition, in
   stark contrast to other biological taxonomic frameworks, virus taxonomy
   currently permits individual species to have several members.
   Consequently, confusion emerges among those who are not aware of the
   difference between taxa and viruses, and because certain well-known
   viruses cannot be located in ICTV publications or be linked to their
   species. In addition, the number of duplicate names and abbreviations
   has increased dramatically in the literature. To solve this conundrum,
   the ICTV could mandate listing all viruses of established species and
   all reported unclassified viruses in forthcoming online ICTV Reports and
   create a searchable webpage using this information. The International
   Union of Microbiology Societies could also consider changing the mandate
   of the ICTV to include the nomenclature of all viruses in addition to
   taxon considerations. With such a mandate expansion, official virus
   names and virus name abbreviations could be catalogued and virus
   nomenclature could be standardized. As a result, the ICTV would become
   an even more useful resource for all stakeholders in virology.},

Title = {Changing Ecological Opportunities Facilitated the Explosive
   Diversification of New Caledonian Oxera (Lamiaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {460-481},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phylogenies recurrently demonstrate that oceanic island systems have
   been home to rapid clade diversification and adaptive radiations. The
   existence of adaptive radiations posits a central role of natural
   selection causing ecological divergence and speciation, and some plant
   radiations have been highlighted as paradigmatic examples of such
   radiations. However, neutral processes may also drive speciation during
   clade radiations, with ecological divergence occurring following
   speciation. Here, we document an exceptionally rapid and unique
   radiation of Lamiaceae within the New Caledonian biodiversity hotspot.
   Specifically, we investigated various biological, ecological, and
   geographical drivers of species diversification within the genus Oxera.
   We found that Oxera underwent an initial process of rapid cladogenesis
   likely triggered by a dramatic period of aridity during the early
   Pliocene. This early diversification of Oxera was associated with an
   important phase of ecological diversification triggered by significant
   shifts of pollination syndromes, dispersal modes, and life forms.
   Finally, recent diversification of Oxera appears to have been further
   driven by the interplay of allopatry and habitat shifts likely related
   to climatic oscillations. This suggests that Oxera could be regarded as
   an adaptive radiation at an early evolutionary stage that has been
   obscured by more recent joint habitat diversification and neutral
   geographical processes. Diversification within Oxera has perhaps been
   triggered by varied ecological and biological drivers acting in a
   leapfrog pattern, but geographic processes may have been an equally
   important driver. We suspect that strictly adaptive radiations may be
   rare in plants and that most events of rapid clade diversification may
   have involved a mixture of geographical and ecological divergence.},

Title = {Reconstructing the Evolution of Giant Extinct Kangaroos: Comparing the
   Utility of DNA, Morphology, and Total Evidence},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {520-537},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Combined ``total evidence{''} analysis of molecular and morphological
   data offers the opportunity to objectively merge fossils into the tree
   of life, and challenges the primacy of solely DNA based phylogenetic and
   dating inference, even among modern taxa. To investigate the relative
   utility of DNA, morphology, and total evidence for evolutionary
   inference, we sequenced the first near-complete mitochondrial genomes
   from extinct Australian megafauna: a 40-50 thousand year old giant
   short-faced kangaroo (Simosthenurus occidentalis) and giant wallaby
   (Protemnodon anak). We analyzed the ancient DNA and fossil data
   alongside comparable data from extant species to infer phylogeny,
   divergence times, and ancestral body mass among macropods (kangaroos and
   wallabies). Our results confirm a close relationship between Protemnodon
   and the iconic kangaroo genus complex ``Macropus{''}, and unite the
   giant Simothenurus with the hare-sized Lagostrophus fasciatus (banded
   hare-wallaby), suggesting that the latter is the closest living link to
   the once diverse sthenurine kangaroo radiation. We find that large body
   size evolved multiple times among kangaroos, coincident with expansion
   of open woodland habitats beginning in the Late Miocene. In addition,
   our results suggest that morphological data mislead macropod phylogeny
   reconstruction and in turn can distort total evidence estimation of
   divergence dates. However, a novel result with potentially broad
   application is that the accuracy and precision of reconstructing
   ancestral body mass was improved by tracing body mass on morphological
   branch lengths. This is likely due to positive allometric correlation
   between morphological and body size variation-a relationship that may be
   masked or even misleadingly inverted with the temporal or molecular
   branch lengths that typically underpin ancestral body size
   reconstruction. Our study supports complementary roles for DNA and
   morphology in evolutionary inference, and opens a new window into the
   evolution of Australia's unique marsupial fauna.},

   Among phylogenomic methods, restriction site associated DNA (RAD)
   sequencing approaches have gained much attention as they enable rapid
   generation of up to thousands of loci randomly scattered across the
   genome and are suitable for nonmodel species. RAD data sets however
   suffer from large amounts of missing data and rapid locus dropout along
   with decreasing relatedness among taxa. The relationship between locus
   dropout and the amount of phylogenetic information retained in the data
   has remained largely uninvestigated. Similarly, phylogenetic hypotheses
   based on RAD have rarely been compared with phylogenetic hypotheses
   based on multilocus Sanger sequencing, even less so using exactly the
   same species and specimens. We compared the Sanger-based phylogenetic
   hypothesis (8 loci; 6172 bp) of 32 species of the diverse moth genus
   Eupithecia (Lepidoptera, Geometridae) to that based on double-digest RAD
   sequencing (3256 loci; 726,658 bp). We observed that topologies were
   largely congruent, with some notable exceptions that we discuss. The
   locus dropout effect was strong. We demonstrate that number of loci is
   not a precise measure of phylogenetic information since the number of
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may remain low at very shallow
   phylogenetic levels despite large numbers of loci. As we hypothesize,
   the number of SNPs and parsimony informative SNPs (PIS) is low at
   shallow phylogenetic levels, peaks at intermediate levels and,
   thereafter, declines again at the deepest levels as a result of decay of
   available loci. Similarly, we demonstrate with empirical data that the
   locus dropout affects the type of loci retained, the loci found in many
   species tending to show lower interspecific distances than those shared
   among fewer species. We also examine the effects of the numbers of loci,
   SNPs, and PIS on nodal bootstrap support, but could not demonstrate with
   our data our expectation of a positive correlation between them. We
   conclude that RAD methods provide a powerful tool for phylogenomics at
   an intermediate phylogenetic level as indicated by its broad congruence
   with an eight-gene Sanger data set in a genus of moths. When assessing
   the quality of the data for phylogenetic inference, the focus should be
   on the distribution and number of SNPs and PIS rather than on loci.},

Abstract = {Primary biodiversity data represent the fundamental elements of any
   study in systematics and evolution. They are, however, no longer
   gathered as they used to be and the mass-production of observation-based
   (OB) occurrences is overthrowing the collection of specimen-based (SB)
   occurrences. Although this change in practice is a major upheaval with
   significant consequences in the study of biodiversity, it remains
   understudied and has not attracted yet the attention it deserves.
   Analyzing 536 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility (GBIF) mediated data, we show that this spectacular
   change affects the 24 eukaryote taxonomic classes we targeted: from 1970
   to 2016 the proportion of occurrences marked as traceable to tangible
   material (i. e., SB occurrences) fell from 68\% to 18\%; moreover, most
   of those specimen based-occurrences cannot be readily traced back to a
   specimen because the necessary information is missing. Ethical,
   practical or legal reasons responsible for this shift are known, and
   this situation appears unlikely to be reversed. Still, we urge scholars
   to acknowledge this dramatic change, embrace it and actively deal with
   it. Specifically, we emphasize why SB occurrences must be gathered, as a
   warrant to allow both repeating evolutionary studies and conducting rich
   and diverse investigations. When impossible to secure, voucher specimens
   must be replaced with OB occurrences combined with ancillary data (e.
   g., pictures, recordings, samples, DNA sequences). Ancillary data are
   instrumental for the usefulness of biodiversity occurrences and we show
   that, despite improving technologies to collate them, they remain rarely
   shared. The consequences of such a change are not yet clear butwe
   advocate collecting material evidence or ancillary data to ensure that
   primary biodiversity data collected lately do not partly become obsolete
   when doubtful.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Species are fundamental units in biological research and can be defined
   on the basis of various operational criteria. There has been growing use
   of molecular approaches for species delimitation. Among the most widely
   used methods, the generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson
   tree processes (PTP) were designed for the analysis of single-locus data
   but are often applied to concatenations of multilocus data. In contrast,
   the Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach in the software Bayesian
   Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) explicitlymodels the evolution of
   multilocus data. In this study, we compare the performance of GMYC, PTP,
   and BPP using synthetic data generated by simulation under various
   speciation scenarios. We show that in the absence of gene flow, the main
   factor influencing the performance of these methods is the ratio of
   population size to divergence time, while number of loci and sample size
   per species have smaller effects. Given appropriate priors and correct
   guide trees, BPP shows lower rates of species overestimation and
   underestimation, and is generally robust to various potential
   confounding factors except high levels of gene flow. The
   single-threshold GMYC and the best strategy that we identified in PTP
   generally perform well for scenarios involving more than a single
   putative species when gene flow is absent, but PTP outperforms GMYC when
   fewer species are involved. Both methods are more sensitive than BPP to
   the effects of gene flow and potential confounding factors. Case studies
   of bears and bees further validate some of the findings from our
   simulation study, and reveal the importance of using an informed
   starting point for molecular species delimitation. Our results highlight
   the key factors affecting the performance of molecular species
   delimitation, with potential benefits for using these methods within an
   integrative taxonomic framework.},

Title = {Targeted Enrichment of Large Gene Families for Phylogenetic Inference:
   Phylogeny and Molecular Evolution of Photosynthesis Genes in the

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Hybrid enrichment is an increasingly popular approach for obtaining
   hundreds of loci for phylogenetic analysis acrossmany taxa quickly and
   cheaply. The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy
   loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and
   homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion
   of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene
   families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene
   families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and
   subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait
   sequences designed for the ``portullugo{''} (Caryophyllales), a
   moderately sized lineage of flowering plants (similar to 2200 species)
   that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C-4
   and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to
   simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling
   of sequences for a major enzyme of C4 and CAM photosynthesis, which
   revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions
   associated with C4 and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set
   of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74
   taxa, with similar to 50\% matrix completeness across data sets.
   Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both
   shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches
   both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support:
   Anacampserotaceae + Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive
   succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence,
   BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals
   across gene trees. Our results add to the growing number of examples
   illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale
   data.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetics, the inference of evolutionary trees from molecular
   sequence data such as DNA, is an enterprise that yields valuable
   evolutionary understanding of many biological systems. Bayesian
   phylogenetic algorithms, which approximate a posterior distribution on
   trees, have become a popular if computationally expensive means of doing
   phylogenetics. Modern data collection technologies are quickly adding
   new sequences to already substantial databases. With all current
   techniques for Bayesian phylogenetics, computation must start anew each
   time a sequence becomes available, making it costly to maintain an
   up-to-date estimate of a phylogenetic posterior. These considerations
   highlight the need for an online Bayesian phylogenetic method which can
   update an existing posterior with new sequences. Here, we provide
   theoretical results on the consistency and stability of methods for
   online Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on Sequential Monte Carlo
   (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo. We first show a consistency result,
   demonstrating that the method samples from the correct distribution in
   the limit of a large number of particles. Next, we derive the first
   reported set of bounds on how phylogenetic likelihood surfaces change
   when new sequences are added. These bounds enable us to characterize the
   theoretical performance of sampling algorithms by bounding the effective
   sample size (ESS) with a given number of particles from below. We show
   that the ESS is guaranteed to grow linearly as the number of particles
   in an SMC sampler grows. Surprisingly, this result holds even though the
   dimensions of the phylogenetic model grow with each new added sequence.},

Abstract = {Organismal traits can evolve in a coordinated way, with correlated
   patterns of gains and losses reflecting important evolutionary
   associations. Discovering these associations can reveal important
   information about the functional and ecological linkages among traits.
   Phylogenetic profiles treat individual genes as traits distributed
   across sets of genomes and can provide a fine-grained view of the
   genetic underpinnings of evolutionary processes in a set of genomes.
   Phylogenetic profiling has been used to identify genes that are
   functionally linked and to identify common patterns of lateral gene
   transfer in microorganisms. However, comparative analysis of
   phylogenetic profiles and other trait distributions should take into
   account the phylogenetic relationships among the organisms under
   consideration. Here, we propose the Community Coevolution Model (CCM), a
   new coevolutionary model to analyze the evolutionary associations among
   traits, with a focus on phylogenetic profiles. In the CCM, traits are
   considered to evolve as a community with interactions, and the
   transition rate for each trait depends on the current states of other
   traits. Surpassing other comparative methods for pairwise trait
   analysis, CCM has the additional advantage of being able to examine
   multiple traits as a community to reveal more dependency relationships.
   We also develop a simulation procedure to generate phylogenetic profiles
   with correlated evolutionary patterns that can be used as benchmark data
   for evaluation purposes. A simulation study demonstrates that CCM is
   more accurate than other methods including the Jaccard Index and three
   tree-aware methods. The parameterization of CCM makes the interpretation
   of the relations between genes more direct, which leads to Darwin's
   scenario being identified easily based on the estimated parameters. We
   show that CCM is more efficient and fits real data better than other
   methods resulting in higher likelihood scores with fewer parameters. An
   examination of 3786 phylogenetic profiles across a set of 659 bacterial
   genomes highlights linkages between genes with common functions,
   including many patterns that would not have been identified under a
   nonphylogenetic model of common distribution. We also applied the CCM to

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are a central tool in many areas of life science and
   medicine. They demonstrate evolutionary patterns among species, genes,
   and patterns of ancestry among sets of individuals. The tree shapes and
   branch lengths of phylogenetic trees encode evolutionary and
   epidemiological information. To extract information from tree shapes and
   branch lengths, representation and comparison methods for phylogenetic
   trees are needed. Representing and comparing tree shapes and branch
   lengths of phylogenetic trees are challenging, for a tree shape is
   unlabeled and can be displayed in numerous different forms, and branch
   lengths of a tree shape are specific to edges whose positions vary with
   respect to the displayed forms of the tree shape. In this article, we
   introduce representation and comparison methods for rooted unlabeled
   phylogenetic trees based on a tree lattice that serves as a coordinate
   system for rooted binary trees with branch lengths and a graph
   polynomial that fully characterizes tree shapes. We show that the
   introduced tree representations and metrics provide distance-based
   likelihood-free methods for tree clustering, parameter estimation, and
   model selection and apply the methods to analyze phylogenies
   reconstructed from virus sequences. {[}Graph polynomial; likelihood-free

Abstract = {A potential shortcoming of concatenation methods for species tree
   estimation is their failure to account for incomplete lineage sorting.
   Coalescent methods address this problem but make various assumptions
   that, if violated, can result in worse performance than concatenation.
   Given the challenges of analyzing DNA sequences with both concatenation
   and coalescent methods, retroelement insertions (RIs) have emerged as
   powerful phylogenomic markers for species tree estimation. Here, we show
   that two recently proposed quartet-based methods, SDPquartets and
   ASTRAL\_BP, are statistically consistent estimators of the unrooted
   species tree topology under the coalescent when RIs follow a neutral
   infinite-sites model of mutation and the expected number of new RIs per
   generation is constant across the species tree. The accuracy of these
   (and other) methods for inferring species trees from RIs has yet to be
   assessed on simulated data sets, where the true species tree topology is
   known. Therefore, we evaluated eight methods given RIs simulated from
   four model species trees, all of which have short branches and at least
   three of which are in the anomaly zone. In our simulation study,
   ASTRAL\_BP and SDPquartets always recovered the correct species tree
   topology when given a sufficiently large number of RIs, as predicted. A
   distance-based method (ASTRID\_BP) and Dollo parsimony also performed
   well in recovering the species tree topology. In contrast, unordered,
   polymorphism, and Camin-Sokal parsimony (as well as an approach based on
   MDC) typically fail to recover the correct species tree topology in
   anomaly zone situations with more than four ingroup taxa. Of the methods
   studied, only ASTRAL\_BP automatically estimates internal branch lengths
   (in coalescent units) and support values (i.e., local posterior
   probabilities). We examined the accuracy of branch length estimation,
   finding that estimated lengths were accurate for short branches but
   upwardly biased otherwise. This led us to derive the maximum likelihood
   (branch length) estimate for when RIs are given as input instead of
   binary gene trees; this corrected formula produced accurate estimates of
   branch lengths in our simulation study provided that a sufficiently
   large number of RIs were given as input. Lastly, we evaluated the impact
   of data quantity on species tree estimation by repeating the above
   experiments with input sizes varying from 100 to 100,000
   parsimony-informative RIs. We found that, when given just 1000
   parsimony-informative RIs as input, ASTRAL\_BP successfully
   reconstructed major clades (i.e., clades separated by branches >0.3
   coalescent units) with high support and identified rapid radiations
   (i.e., shorter connected branches), although not their precise branching
   order. The local posterior probability was effective for controlling
   false positive branches in these scenarios. {[}Coalescence; incomplete

Abstract = {Mountain systems harbor a substantial fraction of global biodiversity
   and, thus, provide excellent opportunities to study rapid
   diversification and to understand the historical processes underlying
   the assembly of biodiversity hotspots. The rich biodiversity in
   mountains is widely regarded as having arisen under the influence of
   geological and climatic processes as well as the complex interactions
   among them. However, the relative contribution of geology and climate in
   driving species radiation is seldom explored. Here, we studied the
   evolutionary radiation of Oreocharis (Gesneriaceae), which has
   diversified extensively throughout East Asia, especially within the
   Hengduan Mountains (HDM), using transcriptomic data and a time
   calibrated phylogeny for 88\% (111/126) of all species of the genus. In
   particular, we applied phylogenetic reconstructions to evaluate the
   extent of incomplete lineage sorting accompanying the early and rapid
   radiation in the genus. We then fit macroevolutionary models to explore
   its spatial and diversification dynamics in Oreocharis and applied
   explicit birth-death models to investigate the effects of past
   environmental changes on its diversification. Evidence from 574
   orthologous loci suggest that Oreocharis underwent an impressive early
   burst of speciation starting ca. 12 Ma in the Miocene, followed by a
   drastic decline in speciation toward the present. Although we found no
   evidence for a shift in diversification rate across the phylogeny of
   Oreocharis, we showed a difference in diversification dynamics between
   the HDM and non-HDM lineages, with higher diversification rates in the
   HDM. The diversification dynamic of Oreocharis is most likely positively
   associated with temperature-dependent speciation and dependency on the
   Asian monsoons. We suggest that the warm and humid climate of the
   mid-Miocene was probably the primary driver of the rapid diversification
   in Oreocharis, while mountain building of the HDM might have indirectly
   affected species diversification of the HDM lineage. This study
   highlights the importance of past climatic changes, combined with
   mountain building, in creating strong environmental heterogeneity and
   driving diversification of mountain plants, and suggests that the
   biodiversity in the HDM cannot directly be attributed to mountain
   uplift, contrary to many recent speculations.{[}East Asian monsoons;

Title = {Do Meristic Characters Used in Phylogenetic Analysis Evolve in an
   Ordered Manner?},

Abstract = {The use of ordered characters in phylogenetic analysis has been
   inconsistent throughout the history of phylogenetic inference. It has
   become more widespread in recent years, and some have advocated that all
   characters representing continuous or meristic traits should be ordered
   as a matter of course. Here, using the example of dental evolution, we
   examine two factors that may impact on whether meristic characters
   actually evolve in an ordered manner: the regulatory hierarchy governing
   the development of teeth that allows large sections of the entire tooth
   row to be suppressed in a single transition and regionalization of the
   tooth row where different modules have a degree of independence in their
   evolution. These are studied using both empirical and simulated data.
   Models of evolution of such characters are examined over molecular
   phylogenies to see if ordered or unordered models fit best. Simulations
   of tooth-row evolution are designed to incorporate changes in region
   size and multiple levels of developmental control to suppress individual
   regions or the entire row. The empirical analyses show that in a Glade
   with largely homodont dentition the characters evolve in an ordered
   manner, but if dentition is heterodont with distinct regionalization
   their evolution better fits an unordered model. In the simulations, even
   if teeth are added and removed from the tooth row in an ordered manner,
   dividing the row into independently evolving modules can lead to
   characters covering multiple modules better fitting an unordered model
   of evolution. Adding the ability to suppress regions or the entire tooth
   row has a variable effect depending on the rates of suppression relative
   to the rates of addition and subtraction of individual teeth. We
   therefore advise not following a single policy when deciding whether to
   order meristic traits but to base the decision on a priori knowledge of
   the focal Glade's evolution and developmental biology.},

Abstract = {The phylogeny and systematics of fur seals and sea lions (Otariidae)
   have long been studied with diverse data types, including an increasing
   amount of molecular data. However, only a few phylogenetic relationships
   have reached acceptance because of strong gene-tree species tree
   discordance. Divergence times estimates in the group also vary largely
   between studies. These uncertainties impeded the understanding of the
   biogeographical history of the group, such as when and how
   trans-equatorial dispersal and subsequent speciation events occurred.
   Here, we used high-coverage genome-wide sequencing for 14 of the 15
   species of Otariidae to elucidate the phylogeny of the family and its
   bearing on the taxonomy and biogeographical history. Despite extreme
   topological discordance among gene trees, we found a fully supported
   species tree that agrees with the few well-accepted relationships and
   establishes monophyly of the genus Arctocephalus. Our data support a
   relatively recent trans-hemispheric dispersal at the base of a southern
   lade, which rapidly diversified into six major lineages between 3 and
   2.5 Ma. Otaria diverged first, followed by Phocarctos and then four
   major lineages within Arctocephalus. However, we found Zalophus to be
   nonmonophyletic, with California (Zalophus californianus) and Steller
   sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) grouping closer than the Galapagos sea
   lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) with evidence for introgression between the
   two genera. Overall, the high degree of genealogical discordance was
   best explained by incomplete lineage sorting resulting from
   quasi-simultaneous speciation within the southern Glade with
   introgresssion playing a subordinate role in explaining the incongruence
   among and within prior phylogenetic studies of the family.},

Abstract = {Temperate woody plants in the Northern Hemisphere have long been known
   to exhibit high species richness in East Asia and North America and
   significantly lower diversity in Europe, but the causes of this pattern
   remain debated. Here, we quantify the roles of dispersal, niche
   evolution, and extinction in shaping the geographic diversity of the
   temperate woody plant family Juglandaceae (walnuts and their relatives).
   Integrating evidence from molecular, morphological, fossil, and
   (paleo)environmental data, we find strong support for a Boreotropical
   origin of the family with contrasting evolutionary trajectories between
   the temperate subfamily Juglandoideae and the tropical subfamily
   Engelhardioideae. Juglandoideae rapidly evolved frost tolerance when the
   global climate shifted to ice-house conditions from the Oligocene, with
   diversification at high latitudes especially in Europe and Asia during
   the Miocene. Subsequent range contraction at high latitudes and high
   levels of extinction in Europe driven by global cooling led to the
   current regional disparity in species diversity. Engelhardioideae showed
   temperature conservatism while adapting to increased humidity, tracking
   tropical climates to low latitudes since the middle Eocene with
   comparatively little diversification, perhaps due to high competition in
   the tropical zone. The biogeographic history of Juglandaceae shows that
   the North Atlantic land bridge and Europe played more critical roles
   than previously thought in linking the floras of East Asia and North
   America, and showcases the complex interplay among climate change, niche
   evolution, dispersal, and extinction that shaped the modern disjunct
   pattern of species richness in temperate woody plants.},

Abstract = {Species tree estimation from multilocus data sets is extremely
   challenging, especially in the presence of gene tree heterogeneity
   across the genome due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Summary
   methods have been developed which estimate gene trees and then combine
   the gene trees to estimate a species tree by optimizing various
   optimization scores. In this study, we have extended and adapted the
   concept of phylogenetic terraces to species tree estimation by
   ``summarizing{''} a set of gene trees, where multiple species trees with
   distinct topologies may have exactly the same optimality score (i.e.,
   quartet score, extra lineage score, etc.). We particularly investigated
   the presence and impacts of equally optimal trees in species tree
   estimation from multilocus data using summary methods by taking ILS into
   account. We analyzed two of the most popular ILS-aware optimization
   criteria: maximize quartet consistency (MQC) and minimize deep
   coalescence (MDC). Methods based on MQC are provably statistically
   consistent, whereas MDC is not a consistent criterion for species tree
   estimation. We present a comprehensive comparative study of these two
   optimality criteria. Our experiments, on a collection of data sets
   simulated under ILS, indicate that MDC may result in competitive or
   identical quartet consistency score as MQC, but could be significantly
   worse than MQC in terms of tree accuracy-demonstrating the presence and
   impacts of equally optimal species trees. This is the first known study
   that provides the conditions for the data sets to have equally optimal
   trees in the context of phylogenomic inference using summary methods.},

Abstract = {Anthozoan cnidarians (corals and sea anemones) include some of the
   world's most important foundation species, capable of building massive
   reef complexes that support entire ecosystems. Although previous
   molecular phylogenetic analyses have revealed widespread homoplasy of
   the morphological characters traditionally used to define orders and
   families of anthozoans, analyses using mitochondrial genes or rDNA have
   failed to resolve many key nodes in the phylogeny. With a fully
   resolved, time-calibrated phylogeny for 234 species constructed from
   hundreds of ultraconserved elements and exon loci, we explore the
   evolutionary origins of the major clades of Anthozoa and some of their
   salient morphological features. The phylogeny supports reciprocally
   monophyletic Hexacorallia and Octocorallia, with Ceriantharia as the
   earliest diverging hexacorals; two reciprocally monophyletic clades of
   Octocorallia; and monophyly of all hexacoral orders with the exception
   of the enigmatic sea anemone Relicanthus daphneae. Divergence dating
   analyses place Anthozoa in the Cryogenian to Tonian periods (648-894
   Ma), older than has been suggested by previous studies. Ancestral state
   reconstructions indicate that the ancestral anthozoan was a solitary
   polyp that had bilateral symmetry and lacked a skeleton. Colonial growth
   forms and the ability to precipitate calcium carbonate evolved in the
   Ediacaran (578 Ma) and Cambrian (503 Ma) respectively; these hallmarks
   of reef-building species have subsequently arisen multiple times
   independently in different orders. Anthozoans formed associations with
   photosymbionts by the Devonian ( 383 Ma), and photosymbioses have been
   gained and lost repeatedly in all orders. Together, these results have
   profound implications for the interpretation of the Precambrian
   environment and the early evolution of metazoans.},

Abstract = {Determining the optimal targets of genomic subsampling for
   phylogenomics, phylogeography, and population genomics remains a
   challenge for evolutionary biologists. Of the available methods for
   subsampling the genome, hybrid enrichment (sequence capture) has become
   one of the primary means of data collection for systematics, due to the
   flexibility and cost efficiency of this approach. Despite the utility of
   this method, information is lacking as to what genomic targets are most
   appropriate for addressing questions at different evolutionary scales.
   In this study, first, we compare the benefits of target loci developed
   for deep- and shallow scales by comparing these loci at each of three
   taxonomic levels: within a genus (phylogenetics), within a species
   (phylogeography), and within a hybrid zone (population genomics).
   Specifically, we target evolutionarily conserved loci that are
   appropriate for deeper phylogenetic scales and more rapidly evolving
   loci that are informative for phylogeographic and population genomic
   scales. Second, we assess the efficacy of targeting multiple-locus sets
   for different taxonomic levels in the same hybrid enrichment reaction,
   an approach we term hierarchical hybrid enrichment. Third, we apply this
   approach to the North American chorus frog genus Pseudacris to answer
   key evolutionary questions across taxonomic and temporal scales. We
   demonstrate that in this system the type of genomic target that produces
   the most resolved gene trees differs depending on the taxonomic level,
   although the potential for error is substantially lower for the
   deep-scale loci at all levels. We successfully recover data for the two
   different locus sets with high efficiency. Using hierarchical data
   targeting deep and shallow levels: we 1) resolve the phylogeny of the
   genus Pseudacris and introduce a novel visual and hypothesis testing
   method that uses nodal heat maps to examine the robustness of branch
   support values to the removal of sites and loci; 2) estimate the
   phylogeographic history of Pseudacris feriarum, which reveals up to five
   independent invasions leading to sympatry with congener Pseudacris
   nigrita to form replicated reinforcement contact zones with ongoing gene
   flow into sympatry; and 3) quantify with high confidence the frequency
   of hybridization in one of these zones between P. feriarum and P.
   nigrita, which is lower than microsatellite-based estimates. We find
   that the hierarchical hybrid enrichment approach offers an efficient,
   multitiered data collection method for simultaneously addressing
   questions spanning multiple evolutionary scales.},

Abstract = {Phylogenomic analyses have helped resolve many recalcitrant
   relationships in the angiosperm tree of life, yet phylogenetic
   resolution of the backbone of the Leguminosae, one of the largest and
   most economically and ecologically important families, remains poor due
   to generally limited molecular data and incomplete taxon sampling of
   previous studies. Here, we resolve many of the Leguminosae's thorniest
   nodes through comprehensive analysis of plastome-scale data using
   multiple modified coding and noncoding data sets of 187 species
   representing almost all major clades of the family. Additionally, we
   thoroughly characterize conflicting phylogenomic signal across the
   plastome in light of the family's complex history of plastome evolution.
   Most analyses produced largely congruent topologies with strong
   statistical support and provided strong support for resolution of some
   long-controversial deep relationships among the early diverging lineages
   of the subfamilies Caesalpinioideae and Papilionoideae. The robust
   phylogenetic backbone reconstructed in this study establishes a
   framework for future studies on legume classification, evolution, and
   diversification. However, conflicting phylogenetic signal was detected
   and quantified at several key nodes that prevent the confident
   resolution of these nodes using plastome data alone.},

Title = {Whole-Genome Analyses Resolve the Phylogeny of Flightless Birds
   (Palaeognathae) in the Presence of an Empirical Anomaly Zone},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Palaeognathae represent one of the two basal lineages in modern birds,
   and comprise the volant (flighted) tinamous and the flightless ratites.
   Resolving palaeognath phylogenetic relationships has historically proved
   difficult, and short internal branches separating major palaeognath
   lineages in previous molecular phylogenies suggest that extensive
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) might have accompanied a rapid ancient
   divergence. Here, we investigate palaeognath relationships using
   genome-wide data sets of three types of noncoding nuclear markers,
   together totaling 20,850 loci and over 41 million base pairs of aligned
   sequence data. We recover a fully resolved topology placing rheas as the
   sister to kiwi and emu + cassowary that is congruent across marker types
   for two species tree methods (MP-EST and ASTRAL-II). This topology is
   corroborated by patterns of insertions for 4274 CR1 retroelements
   identified from multispecies whole-genome screening, and is robustly
   supported by phylogenomic subsampling analyses, with MP-EST
   demonstrating particularly consistent performance across subsampling
   replicates as compared to ASTRAL. In contrast, analyses of concatenated
   data supermatrices recover rheas as the sister to all other nonostrich
   palaeognaths, an alternative that lacks retroelement support and shows
   inconsistent behavior under subsampling approaches. While statistically
   supporting the species tree topology, conflicting patterns of
   retroelement insertions also occur and imply high amounts of ILS across
   short successive internal branches, consistent with observed patterns of
   gene tree heterogeneity. Coalescent simulations and topology tests
   indicate that the majority of observed topological incongruence among
   gene trees is consistent with coalescent variation rather than arising
   from gene tree estimation error alone, and estimated branch lengths for
   short successive internodes in the inferred species tree fall within the
   theoretical range encompassing the anomaly zone. Distributions of
   empirical gene trees confirm that the most common gene tree topology for
   each marker type differs from the species tree, signifying the existence
   of an empirical anomaly zone in palaeognaths.},

Abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a ubiquity of
   molecular sequence data. This data avalanche is particularly challenging
   in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences
   obtained from diverse microbial environments. Phylogenetic placement
   methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context.
   Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as
   the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or
   PPLACER, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to
   the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations
   face substantial scalability limitations. Herein, we present EPA-NG, a
   complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster,
   offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts
   from both, RAxML-EPA and PPLACER. EPA-NG can be executed on standard
   shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing
   clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-NG, we placed billion
   metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree
   with 3748 taxa in just under h, using 2048 cores. Our performance
   assessment shows that EPA-NG outperforms RAxML-EPA and PPLACER by up to
   a factor of in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable
   parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the
   distributed memory parallelization of EPA-NG scales well up to 2048
   cores. EPA-NG is available under the AGPLv3 license:

Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {973-985},

Abstract = {Genomic data have only sometimes brought resolution to the tree of life.
   Large phylogenomic studies can reach conflicting conclusions about
   important relationships, with mutually exclusive hypotheses receiving
   strong support. Reconciling such differences requires a detailed
   understanding of how phylogenetic signal varies among data sets. Two
   complementary strategies for better understanding phylogenomic conflicts
   are to examine support on a locus-by-locus basis and use support values
   that capture a larger range of variation in phylogenetic information,
   such as likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios can be calculated using
   either maximum or marginal likelihoods. Despite being conceptually
   similar, differences in how these ratios are calculated and interpreted
   have not been closely examined in phylogenomics. Here, we compare the
   behavior of maximum and marginal likelihood ratios when evaluating
   alternate resolutions of recalcitrant relationships among major squamate
   lineages. We find that these ratios are broadly correlated between loci,
   but the correlation is driven by extreme values. As a consequence, the
   proportion of loci that support a hypothesis can change depending on
   which ratio is used and whether smaller values are discarded. In
   addition, maximum likelihood ratios frequently exhibit identical support
   for alternate hypotheses, making conflict resolution a challenge. We
   find surprising support for a sister relationship between snakes and
   iguanians across four different phylogenomic data sets in contrast to
   previous empirical studies. {[}Bayes factors; likelihood ratios;

Abstract = {Estimating time-dependent rates of speciation and extinction from dated
   phylogenetic trees of extant species (timetrees), and determining how
   and why they vary, is key to understanding how ecological and
   evolutionary processes shape biodiversity. Due to an increasing
   availability of phylogenetic trees, a growing number of process-based
   methods relying on the birth-death model have been developed in the last
   decade to address a variety of questions in macroevolution. However,
   this methodological progress has regularly been criticized such that one
   may wonder how reliable the estimations of speciation and extinction
   rates are. In particular, using lineages-through-time (LTT) plots, a
   recent study has shown that there are an infinite number of equally
   likely diversification scenarios that can generate any timetree. This
   has led to questioning whether or not diversification rates should be
   estimated at all. Here, we summarize, clarify, and highlight technical
   considerations on recent findings regarding the capacity of models to
   disentangle diversification histories. Using simulations, we illustrate
   the characteristics of newly proposed ``pulled rates{''} and their
   utility. We recognize that the recent findings are a step forward in
   understanding the behavior of macroevolutionary modeling, but they in no
   way suggest we should abandon diversification modeling altogether. On
   the contrary, the study of macroevolution using phylogenetic trees has
   never been more exciting and promising than today. We still face
   important limitations in regard to data availability and methods, but by
   acknowledging them we can better target our joint efforts as a
   scientific community. {[}Birth-death models; extinction; phylogenetics;

Title = {On Information Rank Deficiency in Phenotypic Covariance Matrices},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {810-822},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {This article investigates a form of rank deficiency in phenotypic
   covariance matrices derived from geometric morphometric data, and its
   impact on measures of phenotypic integration. We first define a type of
   rank deficiency based on information theory then demonstrate that this
   deficiency impairs the performance of phenotypic integration metrics in
   a model system. Lastly, we propose methods to treat for this information
   rank deficiency. Our first goal is to establish how the rank of a
   typical geometric morphometric covariance matrix relates to the
   information entropy of its eigenvalue spectrum. This requires clear
   definitions of matrix rank, of which we define three: the full matrix
   rank (equal to the number of input variables), the mathematical rank
   (the number of nonzero eigenvalues), and the information rank or
   ``effective rank{''} (equal to the number of nonredundant eigenvalues).
   We demonstrate that effective rank deficiency arises from a combination
   of methodological factors-Generalized Procrustes analysis, use of the
   correlation matrix, and insufficient sample size-as well as phenotypic
   covariance. Secondly, we use dire wolf jaws to document how differences
   in effective rank deficiency bias two metrics used to measure phenotypic
   integration. The eigenvalue variance characterizes the integration
   change incorrectly, and the standardized generalized variance lacks the
   sensitivity needed to detect subtle changes in integration. Both metrics
   are impacted by the inclusion of many small, but nonzero, eigenvalues
   arising from a lack of information in the covariance matrix, a problem
   that usually becomes more pronounced as the number of landmarks
   increases. We propose a new metric for phenotypic integration that
   combines the standardized generalized variance with information entropy.
   This metric is equivalent to the standardized generalized variance but
   calculated only from those eigenvalues that carry nonredundant
   information. It is the standardized generalized variance scaled to the
   effective rank of the eigenvalue spectrum. We demonstrate that this
   metric successfully detects the shift of integration in our dire wolf
   sample. Our third goal is to generalize the new metric to compare data
   sets with different sample sizes and numbers of variables. We develop a
   standardization for matrix information based on data permutation then
   demonstrate that Smilodon jaws are more integrated than dire wolf jaws.
   Finally, we describe how our information entropy-based measure allows
   phenotypic integration to be compared in dense semilandmark data sets
   without bias, allowing characterization of the information content of
   any given shape, a quantity we term ``latent dispersion{''}. {[}Canis

Title = {Evaluating Species Delimitation Methods in Radiations: The Land Snail
   Albinaria cretensis Complex on Crete},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {439-460},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Delimiting species in radiations is notoriously difficult because of the
   small differences between the incipient species, the star-like tree with
   short branches between species, incomplete lineage sorting, and the
   possibility of introgression between several of the incipient species.
   Next-generation sequencing data may help to overcome some of these
   problems. We evaluated methods for species delimitation based on
   genome-wide markers in a land snail radiation on Crete. Species
   delimitation in the Albinaria cretensis group was based exclusively on
   shell characters until now and resulted in classifications
   distinguishing 3-9 species. We generated sequences of 4270 loci for 140
   specimens of the A. cretensis group from 48 populations by double-digest
   restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We evaluated three methods
   for species discovery. The multispecies coalescent approach implemented
   in the program Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography resulted in a
   drastic overestimating of the number of species, whereas Gaussian
   clustering resulted in an overlumping. Primary species hypotheses based
   on the maximum percentage of the genome of the individuals derived from
   ancestral populations as estimated with the program ADMIXTURE moderately
   overestimated the number of species, but this was the only approach that
   provided information about gene flow between groups. Two of the methods
   for species validation that we applied, BFD{*} and delimitR, resulted in
   an acceptance of almost all primary species hypotheses, even such based
   on arbitrary subdivisions of hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE. In contrast,
   secondary species hypotheses, resulting from an evaluation of primary
   species hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE with isolation by distance tests,
   approached the morphological classification, but also uncovered two
   cryptic species and indicated that some of the previously delimited
   units should be combined. Thus, we recommend this combination of
   approaches that provided more detailed insights in the distinctness of
   barriers between the taxa of a species complex and the spatial
   distribution of admixture between them than the other methods. The
   recognition and delimitation of undersampled species remained a major
   challenge. {[}ADMIXTURE; Clausiliidae; delimitR, Gaussian clustering;

Title = {A Multifunction Trade-Off has Contrasting Effects on the Evolution of
   Form and Function},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {681-693},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Trade-offs caused by the use of an anatomical apparatus for more than
   one function are thought to be an important constraint on evolution.
   However, whether multifunctionality suppresses diversification of
   biomechanical systems is challenged by recent literature showing that
   traits more closely tied to trade-offs evolve more rapidly. We contrast
   the evolutionary dynamics of feeding mechanics and morphology between
   fishes that exclusively capture prey with suction and multifunctional
   species that augment this mechanism with biting behaviors to remove
   attached benthic prey. Diversification of feeding kinematic traits was,
   on average, over 13.5 times faster in suction feeders, consistent with
   constraint on biters due to mechanical trade-offs between biting and
   suction performance. Surprisingly, we found that the evolution of
   morphology contrasts directly with these differences in kinematic
   evolution, with significantly faster rates of evolution of head shape in
   biters. This system provides clear support for an often postulated, but
   rarely confirmed prediction that multifunctionality stifles functional
   diversification, while also illustrating the sometimes weak relationship
   between form and function.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {258-267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Relaxed randomwalk (RRW) models of trait evolution introduce
   branch-specific rate multipliers tomodulate the variance of a standard
   Brownian diffusion process along a phylogeny and more accurately model
   overdispersed biological data. Increased taxonomic sampling challenges
   inference under RRWs as the number of unknown parameters grows with the
   number of taxa. To solve this problem, we present a scalable method to
   efficiently fit RRWs and infer this branchspecific variation in a
   Bayesian framework. We develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler
   to approximate the high-dimensional, correlated posterior that exploits
   a closed-form evaluation of the gradient of the trait data
   log-likelihood with respect to all branch-ratemultipliers
   simultaneously. Our gradient calculation achieves computational
   complexity that scales only linearly with the number of taxa under
   study. We compare the efficiency of our HMC sampler to the previously
   standard univariable Metropolis-Hastings approach while studying the
   spatial emergence of theWest Nile virus in North America in the early
   2000s. Our method achieves at least a 6-fold speed increase over the
   univariable approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of
   our method by applying the RRW to study the correlation between five
   mammalian life history traits in a phylogenetic tree with 3650 tips.},

   Models for Dissecting the Interplay among Phylogeny, Model, and Data},

Abstract = {Stochastic models of character trait evolution have become a cornerstone
   of evolutionary biology in an array of contexts. While probabilistic
   models have been used extensively for statistical inference, they have
   largely been ignored for the purpose of measuring distances between
   phylogeny-aware models. Recent contributions to the problem of
   phylogenetic distance computation have highlighted the importance of
   explicitly considering evolutionary model parameters and their impacts
   on molecular sequence data when quantifying dissimilarity between trees.
   By comparing two phylogenies in terms of their induced probability
   distributions that are functions of many model parameters, these
   distances can be more informative than traditional approaches that rely
   strictly on differences in topology or branch lengths alone. Currently,
   however, these approaches are designed for comparing models of
   nucleotide substitution and gene tree distributions, and thus, are
   unable to address other classes of traits and associated models that may
   be of interest to evolutionary biologists. Here, we expand the
   principles of probabilistic phylogenetic distances to compute tree
   distances under models of continuous trait evolution along a phylogeny.
   By explicitly considering both the degree of relatedness among species
   and the evolutionary processes that collectively give rise to character
   traits, these distances provide a foundation for comparing models and
   their predictions, and for quantifying the impacts of assuming one
   phylogenetic background over another while studying the evolution of a
   particular trait. We demonstrate the properties of these approaches
   using theory, simulations, and several empirical data sets that
   highlight potential uses of probabilistic distances in many scenarios.
   We also introduce an open-source R package named PRDATR for easy
   application by the scientific community for computing phylogenetic
   distances under models of character trait evolution.},

Title = {A Multitype Birth-Death Model for Bayesian Inference of Lineage-Specific
   Birth and Death Rates},

Abstract = {Heterogeneous populations can lead to important differences in birth and
   death rates across a phylogeny. Taking this heterogeneity into account
   is necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the underlying population
   dynamics. We present a new multitype birth-death model (MTBD) that can
   estimate lineage-specific birth and death rates. This corresponds to
   estimating lineage-dependent speciation and extinction rates for species
   phylogenies, and lineage-dependent transmission and recovery rates for
   pathogen transmission trees. In contrast with previous models, we do not
   presume to know the trait driving the rate differences, nor do we
   prohibit the same rates from appearing in different parts of the
   phylogeny. Using simulated data sets, we show that the MTBD model can
   reliably infer the presence of multiple evolutionary regimes, their
   positions in the tree, and the birth and death rates associated with
   each. We also present a reanalysis of two empirical data sets and
   compare the results obtained by MTBD and by the existing software BAMM.
   We compare two implementations of the model, one exact and one
   approximate (assuming that no rate changes occur in the extinct parts of
   the tree), and show that the approximation only slightly affects
   results. The MTBD model is implemented as a package in the Bayesian
   inference software BEAST 2 and allows joint inference of the phylogeny
   and the model parameters.},

Abstract = {With the rapid reduction in sequencing costs of high-throughput genomic
   data, it has become commonplace to use hundreds of genes to infer
   phylogeny of any study system. While sampling a large number of genes
   has given us a tremendous opportunity to uncover previously unknown
   relationships and improve phylogenetic resolution, it also presents us
   with new challenges when the phylogenetic signal is confused by
   differences in the evolutionary histories of sampled genes. Given the
   incorporation of accurate marginal likelihood estimation methods into
   popular Bayesian software programs, it is natural to consider using the
   Bayes Factor (BF) to compare different partition models in which genes
   within any given partition subset share both tree topology and edge
   lengths. We explore using marginal likelihood to assess data subset
   combinability when data subsets have varying levels of phylogenetic
   discordance due to deep coalescence events among genes (simulated within
   a species tree), and compare the results with our recently described
   phylogenetic informational dissonance index (D) estimated for each data
   set. BF effectively detects phylogenetic incongruence and provides a way
   to assess the statistical significance of D values. We use BFs to assess
   data combinability using an empirical data set comprising 56 plastid
   genes from the green algal order Volvocales. We also discuss the
   potential need for calibrating BFs and demonstrate that BFs used in this
   study are correctly calibrated.},

Title = {The Search for Common Origin: Homology Revisited},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {767-780},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of biodiversity on Earth is a central aim in
   biology. Currently, various disciplines of science contribute to unravel
   evolution at all levels of life, from individual organisms to species
   and higher ranks, using different approaches and specific terminologies.
   The search for common origin, traditionally called homology, is a
   connecting paradigm of all studies related to evolution. However, it is
   not always sufficiently taken into account that defining homology
   depends on the hierarchical level studied (organism, population, and
   species), which can cause confusion. Therefore, we propose a framework
   to define homologies making use of existing terms, which refer to
   homology in different fields, but restricting them to an unambiguous
   meaning and a particular hierarchical level. We propose to use the
   overarching term ``homology{''} only when ``morphological homology,{''}
   ``vertical gene transfer,{''} and ``phylogenetic homology{''} are
   confirmed. Consequently, neither phylogenetic nor morphological homology
   is equal to homology. This article is intended for readers with
   different research backgrounds. We challenge their traditional
   approaches, inviting them to consider the proposed framework and
   offering them a new perspective for their own research.},

Title = {Detecting the Dependence of Diversification on Multiple Traits from
   Phylogenetic Trees and Trait Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-328},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Species diversification may be determined by many different variables,
   including the traits of the diversifying lineages. The state-dependent
   speciation and extinction (SSE) framework contains methods to detect the
   dependence of diversification on these traits. For the analysis of
   traits with multiple states, MuSSE (multiple-states dependent speciation
   and extinction) was developed. However, MuSSE and other SSE models have
   been shown to yield false positives, because they cannot separate
   differential diversification rates from dependence of diversification on
   the observed traits. The recently introduced method HiSSE
   (hidden-state-dependent speciation and extinction) resolves this problem
   by allowing a hidden state to affect diversification rates.
   Unfortunately, HiSSE does not allow traits with more than two states,
   and, perhaps more interestingly, the simultaneous action of multiple
   traits on diversification. Herein, we introduce an R package (SecSSE:
   several examined and concealed states-dependent speciation and
   extinction) that combines the features of HiSSE and MuSSE to
   simultaneously infer state-dependent diversification across two or more
   examined (observed) traits or states while accounting for the role of a
   possible concealed (hidden) trait. Moreover, SecSSE also has improved
   functionality when compared with its two parents. First, it allows for
   an observed trait being in two or more states simultaneously, which is
   useful for example when a taxon is a generalist or when the exact state
   is not precisely known. Second, it provides the correct likelihood when
   conditioned on nonextinction, which has been incorrectly implemented in
   HiSSE and other SSE models. To illustrate our method, we apply SecSSE to
   seven previous studies that used MuSSE, and find that in five out of
   seven cases, the conclusions drawn based on MuSSE were premature. We
   test with simulations whether SecSSE sacrifices statistical power to
   avoid the high Type I error problem of MuSSE, but we find that this is
   not the case: for the majority of simulations where the observed traits
   affect diversification, SecSSE detects this.},

   problems. (i) It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by
   predictor (independent) variables when the model contains covariances.
   (ii) Researchers may want the to include the variance explained by the
   covariances by asking questions such as How much of the data is
   explained by phylogeny? Here, I investigated three s for phylogenetic
   and mixed models. is an extension of the ordinary least-squares that
   weights residuals by variances and covariances estimated by the model;
   it is closely related to presented by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013. A
   general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear
   mixed-effects models. Methods Ecol. Evol. 4:133-142). is based on
   predicting each residual from the fitted model and computing the
   variance between observed and predicted values. is based on the
   likelihood of fitted models, and therefore, reflects the amount of
   information that the models contain. These three s are formulated as
   partial s, making it possible to compare the contributions of predictor
   variables and variance components (phylogenetic signal and random
   effects) to the fit of models. Because partial s compare a full model
   with a reduced model without components of the full model, they are
   distinct from marginal s that partition additive components of the
   variance. I assessed the properties of the s for phylogenetic models
   using simulations for continuous and binary response data (phylogenetic
   generalized least squares and phylogenetic logistic regression). Because
   the s are designed broadly for any model for correlated data, I also
   compared s for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models.

   explained by different components of models. However, gives the most
   direct answer to the question of how much variance in the data is
   explained by a model. is most appropriate for comparing models fit to
   different data sets, because it does not depend on sample sizes. And is
   most appropriate to assess the importance of different components within
   the same model applied to the same data, because it is most closely
   associated with statistical significance tests.},

Abstract = {Time-calibrated phylogenies of living species have been widely used to
   study the tempo and mode of species diversification. However, it is
   increasingly clear that inferences about species
   diversificationuextinction rates in particularucan be unreliable in the
   absence of paleontological data. We introduce a general framework based
   on the fossilized birthdeath process for studying speciationextinction
   dynamics on phylogenies of extant and extinct species. The model assumes
   that phylogenies can be modeled as a mixture of distinct evolutionary
   rate regimes and that a hierarchical Poisson process governs the number
   of such rate regimes across a tree. We implemented the model in BAMM, a
   computational framework that uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte
   Carlo to simulate a posterior distribution of macroevolutionary rate
   regimes conditional on the branching times and topology of a phylogeny.
   The implementation, we describe can be applied to paleontological
   phylogenies, neontological phylogenies, and to phylogenies that include
   both extant and extinct taxa. We evaluate performance of the model on
   data sets simulated under a range of diversification scenarios. We find
   that speciation rates are reliably inferred in the absence of
   paleontological data. However, the inclusion of fossil observations
   substantially increases the accuracy of extinction rate estimates. We
   demonstrate that inferences are relatively robust to at least some
   violations of model assumptions, including heterogeneity in preservation
   rates and misspecification of the number of occurrences in
   paleontological data sets.},

Title = {Bayesian Divergence-Time Estimation with Genome-Wide Single-Nucleotide
   Polymorphism Data of Sea Catfishes (Ariidae) Supports Miocene Closure of
   the Panamanian Isthmus},

Abstract = {The closure of the Isthmus of Panama has long been considered to be one
   of the best defined biogeographic calibration points for molecular
   divergence-time estimation. However, geological and biological evidence
   has recently cast doubt on the presumed timing of the initial isthmus
   closure around 3Ma but has instead suggested the existence of temporary
   land bridges as early as the Middle or Late Miocene. The biological
   evidence supporting these earlier land bridges was based either on only
   few molecular markers or on concatenation of genome-wide sequence data,
   an approach that is known to result in potentially misleading branch
   lengths and divergence times, which could compromise the reliability of
   this evidence. To allow divergence-time estimation with genomic data
   using the more appropriate multispecies coalescent (MSC) model, we here
   develop a new method combining the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based
   Bayesian species-tree inference of the software SNAPP with a molecular
   clock model that can be calibrated with fossil or biogeographic
   constraints. We validate our approach with simulations and use our
   method to reanalyze genomic data of Neotropical army ants (Dorylinae)
   that previously supported divergence times of Central and South American
   populations before the isthmus closure around 3 Ma. Our reanalysis with
   the MSC model shifts all of these divergence times to ages younger than
   3 Ma, suggesting that the older estimates supporting the earlier
   existence of temporary land bridges were artifacts resulting at least
   partially from the use of concatenation. We then apply our method to a
   new restriction-site associated DNA-sequencing data set of Neotropical
   sea catfishes (Ariidae) and calibrate their species tree with extensive
   information from the fossil record. We identify a series of divergences
   between groups of Caribbean and Pacific sea catfishes around 10 Ma,
   indicating that processes related to the emergence of the isthmus led to
   vicariant speciation already in the Late Miocene, millions of years
   before the final isthmus closure.},

Abstract = {Most existing measures of distance between phylogenetic trees are based
   on the geometry or topology of the trees. Instead, we consider distance
   measures which are based on the underlying probability distributions on
   genetic sequence data induced by trees. Monte Carlo schemes are
   necessary to calculate these distances approximately, and we describe
   efficient sampling procedures. Key features of the distances are the
   ability to include substitution model parameters and to handle trees
   with different taxon sets in a principled way. We demonstrate some of
   the properties of these new distance measures and compare them to
   existing distances, in particular by applying multidimensional scaling
   to data sets previously reported as containing phylogenetic islands.},

Abstract = {The concept that complex ancestral traits can never be recovered after
   their loss is still widely accepted, despite phylogenetic and molecular
   approaches suggest instances where phenotypes may have been lost
   throughout the evolutionary history of a clade and subsequently reverted
   back in derived lineages. One of the first and most notable examples of
   such a process is wing evolution in phasmids; this polyneopteran order
   of insects, which comprises stick and leaf insects, has played a central
   role in initiating a long-standing debate on the topic. In this study, a
   novel and comprehensive time tree including over 300 Phasmatodea species
   is used as a framework for investigating wing evolutionary patterns in
   the clade. Despite accounting for several possible biases and sources of
   uncertainty, macroevolutionary analyses consistently revealed multiple
   reversals to winged states taking place after their loss, and
   reversibility is coupled with higher species diversification rates. Our
   findings support a loss of or reduction in wings that occurred in the
   lineage leading to the extant phasmid most recent common ancestor, and
   brachyptery is inferred to be an unstable state unless co-opted for
   nonaerodynamic adaptations. We also explored how different assumptions
   of wing reversals probability could impact their inference: we found
   that until reversals are assumed to be over 30 times more unlikely than
   losses, they are consistently inferred despite uncertainty in tree and
   model parameters. Our findings demonstrate that wing evolution is a
   reversible and dynamic process in phasmids and contribute to our
   understanding of complex trait evolution. {[}Dollo's law; Phasmatodea;

Title = {Bayesian Analyses of Comparative Data with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model:
   Potential Pitfalls},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {1524-1540},

Abstract = {The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is widely used in comparative
   phylogenetic analyses to study the evolution of quantitative traits. It
   has been applied to various purposes, including the estimation of the
   strength of selection or ancestral traits, inferring the existence of
   several selective regimes, or accounting for phylogenetic correlation in
   regression analyses. Most programs implementing statistical inference
   under the OU model have resorted to maximum-likelihood (ML) inference
   until the recent advent of Bayesian methods. A series of issues have
   been noted for ML inference using the OU model, including parameter
   nonidentifiability. How these problems translate to a Bayesian framework
   has not been studied much to date and is the focus of the present
   article. In particular, I aim to assess the impact of the choice of
   priors on parameter estimates. I show that complex interactions between
   parameters may cause the priors for virtually all parameters to impact
   inference in sometimes unexpected ways, whatever the purpose of
   inference. I specifically draw attention to the difficulty of setting
   the prior for the selection strength parameter, a task to be undertaken
   with much caution. I particularly address investigators who do not have
   precise prior information, by highlighting the fact that the effect of
   the prior for one parameter is often only visible through its impact on
   the estimate of another parameter. Finally, I propose a new
   parameterization of the OU model that can be helpful when prior
   information about the parameters is not available. {[}Bayesian

Abstract = {Phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated loci
   ({''}phylogenomics{''} or ``supermatrix phylogeny{''}) is a powerful
   tool for solving evolutionary splits that are poorly resolved in single
   gene/protein trees. However, recent phylogenomic attempts to resolve the
   eukaryote root have yielded conflicting results, along with claims of
   various artifacts hidden in the data. We have investigated these
   conflicts using two new methods for assessing phylogenetic conflict.
   ConJak uses whole marker (gene or protein) jackknifing to assess
   deviation from a central mean for each individual sequence, whereas
   ConWin uses a sliding window to screen for incongruent protein fragments
   (mosaics). Both methods allow selective masking of individual sequences
   or sequence fragments in order to minimize missing data, an important
   consideration for resolving deep splits with limited data. Analyses
   focused on a set of 76 eukaryotic proteins of bacterial ancestry
   previously used in various combinations to assess the branching order
   among the three major divisions of eukaryotes: Amorphea (mainly animals,
   fungi, and Amoebozoa), Diaphoretickes (most other well-known eukaryotes
   and nearly all algae) and Excavata, represented here by Discoba
   (Jakobida, Heterolobosea, and Euglenozoa). ConJak analyses found strong
   outliers to be concentrated in undersampled lineages, whereas ConWin
   analyses of Discoba, the most undersampled of the major lineages,
   detected potentially incongruent fragments scattered throughout.
   Phylogenetic analyses of the full data using an LG-gamma model support a
   Discoba sister scenario (neozoan-excavate root), which rises to 99-100\%
   bootstrap support with data masked according to either protocol.
   However, analyses with two site-specific (CAT) mixture models yielded
   widely inconsistent results and a striking sensitivity to missing data.
   The neozoan-excavate root places Amorphea and Diaphoretickes as more
   closely related to each other than either is to Discoba, a fundamental
   relationship that should remain unaffected by additional taxa.},

Title = {Image-Based Automated Species Identification: Can Virtual Data
   Augmentation Overcome Problems of Insufficient Sampling?},

Abstract = {Automated species identification and delimitation is challenging,
   particularly in rare and thus often scarcely sampled species, which do
   not allow sufficient discrimination of infraspecific versus
   interspecific variation. Typical problems arising from either low or
   exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by
   automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective
   species identification from training samples. However, limited
   infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning.
   In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help
   to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual
   species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised
   image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual
   data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and
   generation of artificial images using a generative adversarial networks
   approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck
   features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network that are then stepwise
   reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and principal
   component analysis to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation
   employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an
   oversampling algorithm in vector space. Applied on four different image
   data sets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla,
   Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart
   butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep
   learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy
   with nonaugmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach
   (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia). {[}Deep learning;

   different alignment methods can potentially yield very different
   topologies for individual genes. But it is unclear if the choice of
   alignment methods remains important in phylogenomic analyses, which
   incorporate data from hundreds or thousands of genes. For example,
   problematic biases in alignment might be multiplied across many loci,
   whereas alignment errors in individual genes might become irrelevant.
   The issue of alignment trimming (i.e., removing poorly aligned regions
   or missing data from individual genes) is also poorly explored. Here, we
   test the impact of 12 different combinations of alignment and trimming
   methods on phylogenomic analyses. We compare these methods using
   published phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from
   squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), birds, and tetrapods. We compare
   the properties of alignments generated by different alignment and
   trimming methods (e.g., length, informative sites, missing data). We
   also test whether these data sets can recover well-established clades
   when analyzed with concatenated (RAxML) and species-tree methods
   (ASTRAL-III), using the full data (similar to 5000 loci) and subsampled
   data sets (10\% and 1\% of loci). We show that different alignment and
   trimming methods can significantly impact various aspects of
   phylogenomic data sets (e.g., length, informative sites). However, these
   different methods generally had little impact on the recovery and
   support values for well-established clades, even across very different
   numbers of loci. Nevertheless, our results suggest several ``best
   practices{''} for alignment and trimming. Intriguingly, the choice of
   phylogenetic methods impacted the phylogenetic results most strongly,
   with concatenated analyses recovering significantly more
   well-established clades (with stronger support) than the species-tree
   analyses.},

Abstract = {Genome-scale data have the potential to clarify phylogenetic
   relationships across the tree of life but have also revealed extensive
   gene tree conflict. This seeming paradox, whereby larger data sets both
   increase statistical confidence and uncover significant discordance,
   suggests that understanding sources of conflict is important for
   accurate reconstruction of evolutionary history. We explore this paradox
   in squamate reptiles, the vertebrate clade comprising lizards, snakes,
   and amphisbaenians. We collected an average of 5103 loci for 91 species
   of squamates that span higher-level diversity within the clade, which we
   augmented with publicly available sequences for an additional 17 taxa.
   Using a locus-by-locus approach, we evaluated support for alternative
   topologies at 17 contentious nodes in the phylogeny. We identified
   shared properties of conflicting loci, finding that rate and
   compositional heterogeneity drives discordance between gene trees and
   species tree and that conflicting loci rarely overlap across contentious
   nodes. Finally, by comparing our tests of nodal conflict to previous
   phylogenomic studies, we confidently resolve 9 of the 17 problematic
   nodes. We suggest this locus-by-locus and node-by-node approach can
   build consensus on which topological resolutions remain uncertain in
   phylogenomic studies of other contentious groups.},

Abstract = {The incorporation of stratigraphic data into phylogenetic analysis has a
   long history of debate but is not currently standard practice for
   paleontologists. Bayesian tip-dated (or morphological clock)
   phylogenetic methods have returned these arguments to the spotlight, but
   how tip dating affects the recovery of evolutionary relationships has
   yet to be fully explored. Here I show, through analysis of several data
   sets with multiple phylogenetic methods, that topologies produced by tip
   dating are outliers as compared to topologies produced by parsimony and
   undated Bayesian methods, which retrieve broadly similar trees.
   Unsurprisingly, trees recovered by tip dating have better fit to
   stratigraphy than trees recovered by other methods under both the Gap
   Excess Ratio (GER) and the Stratigraphic Completeness Index (SCI). This
   is because trees with better stratigraphic fit are assigned a higher
   likelihood by the fossilized birth-death treemodel. However, the degree
   to which the tree model favors tree topologies with high stratigraphic
   fit metrics is modulated by the diversification dynamics of the group
   under investigation. In particular, when net diversification rate is
   low, the treemodel favors trees with a higher GER compared to when net
   diversification rate is high. Differences in stratigraphic fit and tree
   topology between tip dating and other methods are concentrated in parts
   of the tree with weaker character signal, as shown by successive
   deletion of the most incomplete taxa from two data sets. These results
   show that tip dating incorporates stratigraphic data in an intuitive
   way, with good stratigraphic fit an expectation that can be overturned
   by strong evidence from character data.},

Abstract = {Taxon sampling is a central aspect of phylogenetic study design, but it
   has received limited attention in the context of total-evidence dating,
   a widely used dating approach that directly integrates molecular and
   morphological information from extant and fossil taxa. We here assess
   the impact of commonly employed outgroup sampling schemes and missing
   morphological data in extant taxa on age estimates in a total-evidence
   dating analysis under the uniform tree prior. Our study group is
   Pimpliformes, a highly diverse, rapidly radiating group of parasitoid
   wasps of the family Ichneumonidae. We analyze a data set comprising 201
   extant and 79 fossil taxa, including the oldest fossils of the family
   from the Early Cretaceous and the first unequivocal representatives of
   extant subfamilies from themid-Paleogene. Based on newly compiled
   molecular data fromten nuclear genes and amorphological matrix that
   includes 222 characters, we showthat age estimates become both older and
   less precise with the inclusion of more distant and more poorly sampled
   outgroups. These outgroups not only lack morphological and temporal
   information but also sit on long terminal branches and considerably
   increase the evolutionary rate heterogeneity. In addition, we discover
   an artifact that might be detrimental for total-evidence dating:
   ``bare-branch attraction,{''} namely high attachment probabilities of
   certain fossils to terminal branches for which morphological data are
   missing. Using computer simulations, we confirm the generality of this
   phenomenon and show that a large phylogenetic distance to any of the
   extant taxa, rather than just older age, increases the risk of a fossil
   being misplaced due to bare-branch attraction. After restricting
   outgroup sampling and adding morphological data for the previously
   attracting, bare branches, we recover a Jurassic origin for Pimpliformes
   and Ichneumonidae. This first age estimate for the group not only
   suggests an older origin than previously thought but also that
   diversification of the crown group happened well before the
   CretaceousPaleogene boundary. Our case study demonstrates that in order
   to obtain robust age estimates, total-evidence dating studies need to be
   based on a thorough and balancedsampling of both extant and fossil taxa,
   with the aim of minimizing evolutionary rate heterogeneity and missing
   morphological information.},

Abstract = {Long branch attraction (LBA) is a prevalent form of bias in phylogenetic
   estimation but the reasons for it are only partially understood. We
   argue here that it is largely due to differences in the sizes of the
   model spaces corresponding to different trees. Trees with long branches
   together allow much more flexible internal branch length parameter
   estimation. Consequently, although each tree has the same number of
   parameters, trees with long branches together have larger effective
   model spaces. The problem of LBA becomes particularly pronounced with
   partitioned data. Formulation of tree estimation as model selection
   leads us to propose bootstrap bias corrections as cross-checks on
   estimation when long branches end up being estimated together.},

Abstract = {Whatever one's definition of species, it is generally expected that
   individuals of the same species should be genetically more similar to
   each other than they are to individuals of another species. Here, we
   show that in the presence of cross-species gene flow, this expectation
   may be incorrect. We use the multispecies coalescent model with
   continuous-time migration or episodic introgression to study the impact
   of gene flow on genetic differences within and between species and
   highlight a surprising but plausible scenario in which different
   population sizes and asymmetrical migration rates cause a genetic
   sequence to be on average more closely related to a sequence from
   another species than to a sequence from the same species. Our results
   highlight the extraordinary impact that even a small amount of gene flow
   may have on the genetic history of the species. We suggest that
   contrasting long-term migration rate and short-term hybridization rate,
   both of which can be estimated using genetic data, may be a powerful
   approach to detecting the presence of reproductive barriers and to
   define species boundaries.},

Abstract = {The need for robust estimates of times of divergence is essential for
   downstream analyses, yet assessing this robustness is still rare. We
   generated a time-calibrated genus-level phylogeny of butterflies
   (Papilionoidea), including 994 taxa, up to 10 gene fragments and an
   unprecedented set of 12 fossils and 10 host-plant node calibration
   points. We compared marginal priors and posterior distributions to
   assess the relative importance of the former on the latter. This
   approach revealed a strong influence of the set of priors on the root
   age but for most calibrated nodes posterior distributions shifted from
   the marginal prior, indicating significant information in the molecular
   data set. Using a very conservative approach we estimated an origin of
   butterflies at 107.6 Ma, approximately equivalent to the latest Early
   Cretaceous, with a credibility interval ranging from 89.5 Ma (mid Late
   Cretaceous) to 129.5 Ma (mid Early Cretaceous). In addition, we tested
   the effects of changing fossil calibration priors, tree prior, different
   sets of calibrations and different sampling fractions but our estimate
   remained robust to these alternative assumptions. With 994 genera, this
   tree provides a comprehensive source of secondary calibrations for
   studies on butterflies.},

Abstract = {Resolving patterns of ancient and rapid diversifications is one of the
   most challenging tasks in evolutionary biology. These difficulties arise
   from confusing phylogenetic signals that are associated with the
   interplay of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and homoplasy.
   Phylogenomic analyses of hundreds, or even thousands, of loci offer the
   potential to resolve such contentious relationships. Yet, how much
   useful phylogenetic information these large data sets contain remains
   uncertain and often goes untested. Here, we assess the utility of
   different data filtering approaches to maximize phylogenetic information
   and minimize noise when reconstructing an ancient radiation of
   Neotropical electric knifefishes (Order Gymnotiformes) using
   ultraconserved elements. We found two contrasting hypotheses of
   gymnotiforme volutionary relationships depending on whether phylogenetic
   inferences were based on concatenation or coalescent methods. In the
   first case, all analyses inferred a previously-and commonly-proposed
   hypothesis, where the family Apteronotidae was found as the sister group
   to all other gymnotiform families. In contrast, coalescent-based
   analyses suggested a novel hypothesis where families producing
   pulse-type (viz., Gymnotidae, Hypopomidae, and Rhamphichthyidae) and
   wave-type electric signals (viz., Apteronotidae, Sternopygidae) were
   reciprocally monophyletic. Nodal support for this second hypothesis
   increased when analyzing loci with the highest phylogenetic information
   content and further increased when data were pruned using targeted
   filtering methods that maximized phylogenetic informativeness at the
   deepest nodes of the Gymnotiformes. Bayesian concordance analyses and
   topology tests of individual gene genealogies demonstrated that the
   difficulty of resolving this radiation was likely due to high gene-tree
   incongruences that resulted from ILS. We show that data filtering
   reduces gene-tree heterogeneity and increases nodal support and
   consistency of species trees using coalescent methods; however, we
   failed to observe the same effect when using concatenation methods.
   Furthermore, the targeted filtering strategies applied here support the
   use of ``gene data interrogation{''} rather than ``gene genealogy
   interrogation{''} approaches in phylogenomic analyses, to extract
   phylogenetic signal from intractable portions of the Tree of Life.},

Abstract = {Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques now allow relatively
   easy and affordable sequencing of large portions of the genome, even for
   nonmodel organisms. Many phylogenetic studies reduce costs by focusing
   their sequencing efforts on a selected set of targeted loci, commonly
   enriched using sequence capture. The advantage of this approach is that
   it recovers a consistent set of loci, each with high sequencing depth,
   which leads to more confidence in the assembly of target sequences. High
   sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically
   informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele
   sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies. Instead,
   many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig
   sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads
   into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce
   both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an
   easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture
   data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility
   of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the
   multispecies coalescent model. Our empirical analyses of ultraconserved
   element locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus
   Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient
   phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage
   divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during
   the last 3 myr. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two
   species and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of
   rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our
   simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to
   more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the
   more common approach of using contig sequences.},

Title = {Inference of Adaptive Shifts for Multivariate Correlated Traits},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {662-680},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To study the evolution of several quantitative traits, the classical
   phylogenetic comparative framework consists of amultivariate random
   process running along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is sometimes preferred to the simple
   Brownian motion (BM) as it models stabilizing selection toward an
   optimum. The optimum for each trait is likely to be changing over the
   long periods of time spanned by large modern phylogenies. Our goal is to
   automatically detect the position of these shifts on a phylogenetic
   tree, while accounting for correlations between traits, which might
   exist because of structural or evolutionary constraints. We show that,
   in the presence of shifts, phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis
   fails to decorrelate traits efficiently, so that any method aiming at
   finding shifts needs to deal with correlation simultaneously. We
   introduce here a simplification of the full multivariate OU model, named
   scalar OU, which allows for noncausal correlations and is still
   computationally tractable. We extend the equivalence between the OU and
   a BMon a rescaled tree to our multivariate framework. We describe an
   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that allows for a maximum
   likelihood estimation of the shift positions, associated with a new
   model selection criterion, accounting for the identifiability issues for
   the shift localization on the tree. The method, freely available as an
   R-package (PhylogeneticEM) is fast, and can deal withmissing values. We
   demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to another
   state-of-the-art method (l1ou) on a wide range of simulated scenarios
   and use this new framework to reanalyze recently gathered data sets
   onNewWorldMonkeys and Anolis lizards.},

Abstract = {Although phylogeny estimation is notoriously difficult in radiations
   that occurred several hundred million years ago, phylogenomic approaches
   offer new ways to examine relationships among ancient lineages and
   evaluate hypotheses that are key to evolutionary biology. Here, we
   reconstruct the deep-rooted relationships of one of the oldest living
   arthropod clades, the branchiopod crustaceans, using a kaleidoscopic
   approach. We use concatenation and coalescent tree-building methods to
   analyze a large multigene data set at the nucleotide and amino acid
   level and examine gene tree versus species tree discordance. We
   unequivocally resolve long-debated relationships among extant orders of
   the Cladocera, the waterfleas, an ecologically relevant zooplankton
   group in global aquatic and marine ecosystems that is famous for its
   model systems in ecology and evolution. To build the data set, we
   assembled eight de novo genomes of key taxa including representatives of
   all extant cladoceran orders and suborders. Our phylogenetic analysis
   focused on a BUSCO-based set of 823 conserved single-copy orthologs
   shared among 23 representative taxa spanning all living branchiopod
   orders, including 11 cladoceran families. Our analysis supports the
   monophyly of the Cladocera and reveals remarkable homoplasy in their
   body plans. We found large phylogenetic distances between lineages with
   similar ecological specializations, indicating independent evolution in
   major body plans, such as in the pelagic predatory orders Haplopoda and
   Onychopoda (the ``Gymnomera{''}). In addition, we assessed rapid
   cladogenesis by estimating relative timings of divergence in major
   lineages using reliable fossil-calibrated priors on eight nodes in the
   branchiopod tree, suggesting a Paleozoic origin around 325 Ma for the
   cladoceran ancestor and an ancient rapid radiation around 252 Ma at the
   Perm/Triassic boundary. These findings raise new questions about the
   roles of homoplasy and rapid radiation in the diversification of the
   cladocerans and help examine trait evolution from a genomic perspective
   in a functionally well understood, ancient arthropod group.

Abstract = {Whole-genome comparisons based on average nucleotide identities (ANI)
   and the genome-to-genome distance calculator have risen to prominence in
   rapidly classifying prokaryotic taxa using whole-genome sequences. Some
   implementations have even been proposed as a new standard in species
   classification and have become a common technique for papers describing
   newly sequenced genomes. However, attempts to apply whole-genome
   divergence data to the delineation of higher taxonomic units and to
   phylogenetic inference have had difficulty matching those produced by
   more complex phylogenetic methods. We present a novel method for
   generating statistically supported phylogenies of archaeal and bacterial
   groups using a combined ANI and alignment fraction-based metric. For the
   test cases to which we applied the developed approach, we obtained
   results comparable with other methodologies up to at least the family
   level. The developed method uses nonparametric bootstrapping to gauge
   support for inferred groups. This method offers the opportunity to make
   use of whole-genome comparison data, that is already being generated, to
   quickly produce phylogenies including support for inferred groups.
   Additionally, the developed ANI methodology can assist the
   classification of higher taxonomic groups.{[}Average nucleotide identity

Abstract = {How best can we summarize sets of phylogenetic trees? Systematists have
   relied heavily on consensus methods, but if tree distributions can be
   partitioned into distinct subsets, it may be helpful to provide separate
   summaries of these rather than relying entirely upon a single consensus
   tree. How sets of trees can most helpfully be partitioned and
   represented leads to many open questions, but one natural partitioning
   is provided by the islands of trees found during tree searches. Islands
   that are of dissimilar size have been shown to yield majority-rule
   consensus trees dominated by the largest sets We illustrate this large
   island bias and approaches that mitigate its impact by revisiting a
   recent analysis of phylogenetic relationships of living and fossil
   amphibians. We introduce a revised definition of tree islands based on
   any tree-to-tree pairwise distance metric that usefully extends the
   notion to any set or multiset of trees, as might be produced by, for
   example, Bayesian or bootstrap methods, and that facilitates finding
   tree islands a posteriori. We extract islands from a tree distribution
   obtained in a Bayesian analysis of the amphibian data to investigate
   their impact in that context, and we compare the partitioning produced
   by tree islands with those resulting from some alternative approaches.
   Distinct subsets of trees, such as tree islands, should be of interest
   because of what they may reveal about evolution and/or our attempts to
   understand it, and are an important, sometimes overlooked, consideration
   when building and interpreting consensus trees.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Topological conflict or incongruence is widespread in phylogenomic data.
   Concatenation- and coalescent-based approaches often result in
   incongruent topologies, but the causes of this conflict can be difficult
   to characterize. We examined incongruence stemming from conflict the
   between likelihood-based signal (quantified by the difference in
   gene-wise log-likelihood score or Delta GLS) and quartet-based
   topological signal (quantified by the difference in gene-wise quartet
   score or Delta GQS) for every gene in three phylogenomic studies in
   animals, fungi, and plants, which were chosen because their
   concatenation-based IQ-TREE (T1) and quartet-based ASTRAL (T2)
   phylogenies are known to produce eight conflicting internal branches
   (bipartitions). By comparing the types of phylogenetic signal for all
   genes in these three data matrices, we found that 30-36\% of genes in
   each data matrix are inconsistent, that is, each of these genes has a
   higher log-likelihood score for T1 versus T2 (i.e., Delta GLS >0)
   whereas its T1 topology has lower quartet score than its T2 topology
   (i.e., Delta GQS <0) or vice versa. Comparison of inconsistent and
   consistent genes using a variety of metrics (e.g., evolutionary rate,
   gene tree topology, distribution of branch lengths, hidden paralogy, and
   gene tree discordance) showed that inconsistent genes are more likely to
   recover neither T1 nor T2 and have higher levels of gene tree
   discordance than consistent genes. Simulation analyses demonstrate that
   the removal of inconsistent genes from data sets with low levels of
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and low and medium levels of gene tree
   estimation error (GTEE) reduced incongruence and increased accuracy. In
   contrast, removal of inconsistent genes from data sets withmedium and
   high ILS levels and high GTEE levels eliminated or extensively reduced
   incongruence, but the resulting congruent species phylogenies were not
   always topologically identical to the true species trees.},

Abstract = {Ecological opportunities can be provided to organisms that cross
   stringent biogeographic barriers towards environments with new
   ecological niches. Wallace's and Lyddeker's lines are arguably the most
   famous biogeographic barriers, separating the Asian and Australo-Papuan
   biotas. One of the most ecomorphologically diverse groups of reptiles,
   the pythons, is distributed across these lines, and are remarkably more
   diverse in phenotype and ecology east of Lydekker's line in
   Australo-Papua. We used an anchored hybrid enrichment approach, with
   near complete taxon sampling, to extract mitochondrial genomes and 376
   nuclear loci to resolve and date their phylogenetic history.
   Biogeographic reconstruction demonstrates that they originated in Asia
   around 38-45 Ma and then invaded Australo-Papua around 23 Ma.
   Australo-Papuan pythons display a sizeable expansion in morphological
   space, with shifts towards numerous new adaptive optima in head and body
   shape, coupled with the evolution of new micro-habitat preferences. We
   provide an updated taxonomy of pythons and our study also demonstrates
   how ecological opportunity following colonization of novel environments
   can promote morphological diversification in a formerly
   ecomorphologically conservative group.},

Abstract = {The evolution of cetaceans, from their early transition to an aquatic
   lifestyle to their subsequent diversification, has been the subject of
   numerous studies. However, although the higher-level relationships among
   cetacean families have been largely settled, several aspects of the
   systematics within these groups remain unresolved. Problematic clades
   include the oceanic dolphins (37 spp.), which have experienced a recent
   rapid radiation, and the beaked whales (22 spp.), which have not been
   investigated in detail using nuclear loci. The combined application of
   high-throughput sequencing with techniques that target specific genomic
   sequences provide a powerful means of rapidly generating large volumes
   of orthologous sequence data for use in phylogenomic studies. To
   elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Cetacea, we combined
   sequence capture with Illumina sequencing to generate data for 3200
   protein-coding genes for 68 cetacean species and their close relatives
   including the pygmy hippopotamus. By combining data from 38,000 exons
   with existing sequences from 11 cetaceans and seven outgroup taxa, we
   produced the first comprehensive comparative genomic data set for
   cetaceans, spanning 6,527,596 aligned base pairs (bp) and 89 taxa.
   Phylogenetic trees reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of
   individual gene trees, produced mostly concordant and well-supported
   trees. Our results completely resolve the relationships among beaked
   whales as well as the contentious relationships among oceanic dolphins,
   especially the problematic subfamily Delphinidae. We carried out
   Bayesian estimation of species divergence times using MCMCTree and
   compared our complete data set to a subset of clocklike genes. Analyses
   using the complete data set consistently showed less variance in
   divergence times than the reduced data set. In addition, integration of
   new fossils (e.g., Mystacodon selenensis) indicates that the
   diversification of Crown Cetacea began before the Late Eocene and the
   divergence of Crown Delphinidae as early as the Middle Miocene.},

Abstract = {Tree reconciliation is the mathematical tool that is used to investigate
   the coevolution of organisms, such as hosts and parasites. A common
   approach to tree reconciliation involves specifying a model that assigns
   costs to certain events, such as cospeciation, and then tries to find a
   mapping between two specified phylogenetic trees which minimizes the
   total cost of the implied events. For such models, it has been shown
   that there may be a huge number of optimal solutions, or at least
   solutions that are close to optimal. It is therefore of interest to be
   able to systematically compare and visualize whole collections of
   reconciliations between a specified pair of trees. In this article, we
   consider various metrics on the set of all possible reconciliations
   between a pair of trees, some that have been defined before but also new
   metrics that we shall propose. We show that the diameter for the
   resulting spaces of reconciliations can in some cases be determined
   theoretically, information that we use to normalize and compare
   properties of the metrics. We also implement the metrics and compare
   their behavior on several host parasite data sets, including the shapes
   of their distributions. In addition, we show that in combination with
   multidimensional scaling, the metrics can be useful for visualizing
   large collections of reconciliations, much in the same way as
   phylogenetic tree metrics can be used to explore collections of
   phylogenetic trees. Implementations of the metrics can be downloaded

Title = {Modeling Site Heterogeneity with Posterior Mean Site Frequency Profiles
   Accelerates Accurate Phylogenomic Estimation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {216-235},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Proteins have distinct structural and functional constraints at
   different sites that lead to site-specific preferences for particular
   amino acid residues as the sequences evolve. Heterogeneity in the amino
   acid substitution process between sites is not modeled by commonly used
   empirical amino acid exchange matrices. Such model misspecification can
   lead to artefacts in phylogenetic estimation such as long-branch
   attraction. Although sophisticated site-heterogeneous mixture models
   have been developed to address this problem in both Bayesian and maximum
   likelihood (ML) frameworks, their formidable computational time and
   memory usage severely limits their use in large phylogenomic analyses.
   Here we propose a posterior mean site frequency (PMSF) method as a rapid
   and efficient approximation to full empirical profile mixture models for
   ML analysis. The PMSF approach assigns a conditional mean amino acid
   frequency profile to each site calculated based on a mixture model
   fitted to the data using a preliminary guide tree. These PMSF profiles
   can then be used for in-depth tree-searching in place of the full
   mixture model. Compared with widely used empirical mixture models with k
   classes, our implementation of PMSF in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org)
   speeds up the computation by approximately k/1.5-fold and requires a
   small fraction of the RAM. Furthermore, this speedup allows, for the
   first time, full nonparametric bootstrap analyses to be conducted under
   complex site-heterogeneous models on large concatenated data matrices.
   Our simulations and empirical data analyses demonstrate that PMSF can
   effectively ameliorate long-branch attraction artefacts. In some
   empirical and simulation settings PMSF provided more accurate estimates
   of phylogenies than the mixture models from which they derive.},

Abstract = {Contamination of a genetic sample with DNA from one or more nontarget
   species is a continuing concern of molecular phylogenetic studies, both
   Sanger sequencing studies and next-generation sequencing studies. We
   developed an automated pipeline for identifying and excluding likely
   cross-contaminated loci based on the detection of bimodal distributions
   of patristic distances across gene trees. When contamination occurs
   between samples within a data set, a comparison between a contaminated
   sample and its contaminant taxon will yield bimodal distributions with
   one peak close to zero patristic distance. This new method does not rely
   on a priori knowledge of taxon relatedness nor does it determine the
   causes(s) of the contamination. Exclusion of putatively contaminated
   loci from a data set generated for the insect family Cicadidae showed
   that these sequences were affecting some topological patterns and branch
   supports, although the effects were sometimes subtle, with some
   contamination-influenced relationships exhibiting strong bootstrap
   support. Long tip branches and outlier values for one anchored
   phylogenomic pipeline statistic (AvgNHomologs) were correlated with the
   presence of contamination. While the anchored hybrid enrichment markers
   used here, which target hemipteroid taxa, proved effective in resolving
   deep and shallow level Cicadidae relationships in aggregate, individual
   markers contained inadequate phylogenetic signal, in part probably due
   to short length. The cleaned data set, consisting of 429 loci, from 90
   genera representing 44 of 56 current Cicadidae tribes, supported three
   of the four sampled Cicadidae subfamilies in concatenated-matrix maximum
   likelihood (ML) and multispecies coalescent-based species tree analyses,
   with the fourth subfamily weakly supported in the ML trees. No
   well-supported patterns from previous family-level Sanger sequencing
   studies of Cicadidae phylogeny were contradicted. One taxon (Aragualna
   plenalinea) did not fall with its current subfamily in the genetic tree,
   and this genus and its tribe Aragualnini is reclassified to Tibicininae
   following morphological re-examination. Only subtle differences were
   observed in trees after the removal of loci for which divergent base
   frequencies were detected. Greater success may be achieved by increased
   taxon sampling and developing a probe set targeting a more recent common
   ancestor and longer loci. Searches for contamination are an essential
   step in phylogenomic analyses of all kinds and our pipeline is an
   effective solution. {[}Auchenorrhyncha; base-composition bias;

Abstract = {Diversification rates vary across species as a response to various
   factors, including environmental conditions and species-specific
   features. Phylogenetic models that allow accounting for and quantifying
   this heterogeneity in diversification rates have proven particularly
   useful for understanding clades diversification. Recently, we introduced
   the cladogenetic diversification rate shift model, which allows
   inferring multiple rate changes of small magnitude across lineages.
   Here, we present a new inference technique for this model that
   considerably reduces computation time through the use of data
   augmentation and provide an implementation of this method in Julia. In
   addition to drastically reducing computation time, this new inference
   approach provides a posterior distribution of the augmented data, that
   is the tree with extinct and unsampled lineages as well as associated
   diversification rates. In particular, this allows extracting the
   distribution through time of both the mean rate and the number of
   lineages. We assess the statistical performances of our approach using
   simulations and illustrate its application on the entire bird
   radiation.{[}Birth-death model; data augmentation; diversification;

Abstract = {Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the interaction between coalescence
   and speciation, can generate incongruence between gene trees and species
   trees, as can gene duplication (D), transfer (T), and loss (L). These
   processes are usually modeled independently, but in reality, ILS can
   affect gene copy number polymorphism, that is, interfere with DTL. This
   has been previously recognized, but not treated in a satisfactory way,
   mainly because DTL events are naturally modeled forward-in-time, while
   ILS is naturally modeled backward-in-time with the coalescent. Here, we
   consider the joint action of ILS and DTL on the gene tree/species tree
   problem in all its complexity. In particular, we show that the
   interaction between ILS and duplications/transfers (without losses) can
   result in patterns usually interpreted as resulting from gene loss, and
   that the realized rate of D, T, and L becomes nonhomogeneous in time
   when ILS is taken into account. We introduce algorithmic solutions to
   these problems. Our new model, the multilocus multispecies coalescent,
   which also accounts for any level of linkage between loci, generalizes
   the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model and offers a versatile, powerful
   framework for proper simulation, and inference of gene family evolution.},

Title = {Morphological Characters Can Strongly Influence Early Animal
   Relationships Inferred from Phylogenomic Data Sets},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {There are considerable phylogenetic incongruencies between morphological
   and phylogenomic data for the deep evolution of animals. This has
   contributed to a heated debate over the earliest-branching lineage of
   the animal kingdom: the sister to all other Metazoa (SOM). Here, we use
   published phylogenomic data sets (similar to 45,000-400,000 characters
   in size with similar to 15-100 taxa) that focus on early metazoan
   phylogeny to evaluate the impact of incorporating morphological data
   sets (similar to 15-275 characters). We additionally use small exemplar
   data sets to quantify how increased taxon sampling can help stabilize
   phylogenetic inferences. We apply a plethora of common methods, that is,
   likelihood models and their ``equivalent{''} under parsimony: character
   weighting schemes. Our results are at odds with the typical view of
   phylogenomics, that is, that genomic-scale data sets will swamp out
   inferences from morphological data. Instead, weighting morphological
   data 2-10x in both likelihood and parsimony can in some cases ``flip{''}
   which phylum is inferred to be the SOM. This typically results in the
   molecular hypothesis of Ctenophora as the SOM flipping to Porifera (or
   occasionally Placozoa). However, greater taxon sampling improves
   phylogenetic stability, with some of the larger molecular data sets
   (>200,000 characters and up to similar to 100 taxa) showing node
   stability even with >= 100x upweighting of morphological data.
   Accordingly, our analyses have three strong messages. 1) The assumption
   that genomic data will automatically ``swamp out{''} morphological data
   is not always true for the SOM question. Morphological data have a
   strong influence in our analyses of combined data sets, even when
   outnumbered thousands of times by molecular data. Morphology therefore
   should not be counted out a priori. 2) We here quantify for the first
   time how the stability of the SOM node improves for several genomic data
   sets when the taxon sampling is increased. 3) The patterns of ``flipping

Title = {Incorporating Hierarchical Characters into Phylogenetic Analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1163-1180},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Popular optimality criteria for phylogenetic trees focus on sequences of
   characters that are applicable to all the taxa. As studies grow in
   breadth, it can be the case that some characters are applicable for a
   portion of the taxa and inapplicable for others. Past work has explored
   the limitations of treating inapplicable characters as missing data,
   noting that this strategy may favor trees where internal nodes are
   assigned impossible states, where the arrangement of taxa within
   subclades is unduly influenced by variation in distant parts of the
   tree, and/or where taxa that otherwise share most primary characters are
   grouped distantly. Approaches that avoid the first two problems have
   recently been proposed. Here, we propose an alternative approach which
   avoids all three problems. We focus on data matrices that use reductive
   coding of traits, that is, explicitly incorporate the innate hierarchy
   induced by inapplicability, and as such our approach extend to
   hierarchical characters, in general. In the spirit of maximum parsimony,
   the proposed criterion seeks the phylogenetic tree with the minimal
   changes across any tree branch, but where changes are defined in terms
   of dissimilarity metrics that weigh the effects of inapplicable
   characters. The approach can accommodate binary, multistate, ordered,
   unordered, and polymorphic characters. We give a polynomial-time
   algorithm, inspired by Fitch's algorithm, to score trees under a family
   of dissimilarity metrics, and prove its correctness. We show that the
   resulting optimality criteria is computationally hard, by reduction to
   the NP-hardness of the maximum parsimony optimality criteria. We
   demonstrate our approach using synthetic and empirical data sets and
   compare the results with other recently proposed methods for choosing
   optimal phylogenetic trees when the data includes hierarchical
   characters.},

Title = {Morphometric Variation at Different Spatial Scales: Coordination and

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {It is a classic aim of quantitative and evolutionary biology to infer
   genetic architecture and potential evolutionary responses to selection
   from the variance-covariance structure of measured traits. But a
   meaningful genetic or developmental interpretation of raw covariances is
   difficult, and classic concepts of morphological integration do not
   directly apply to modern morphometric data. Here, we present a new
   morphometric strategy based on the comparison of morphological variation
   across different spatial scales. If anatomical elements vary completely
   independently, then their variance accumulates at larger scales or for
   structures composed of multiple elements: morphological variance would
   be a power function of spatial scale. Deviations from this pattern of
   ``variational self-similarity{''} (serving as a null model of completely
   uncoordinated growth) indicate genetic or developmental coregulation of
   anatomical components. We present biometric strategies and R scripts for
   identifying patterns of coordination and compensation in the size and
   shape of composite anatomical structures. In an application to human
   cranial variation, we found that coordinated variation and positive
   correlations are prevalent for the size of cranial components, whereas
   their shape was dominated by compensatory variation, leading to strong
   canalization of cranial shape at larger scales. We propose that
   mechanically induced bone formation and remodeling are key mechanisms
   underlying compensatory variation in cranial shape. Such epigenetic
   coordination and compensation of growth are indispensable for stable,
   canalized development and may also foster the evolvability of complex
   anatomical structures by preserving spatial and functional integrity
   during genetic responses to selection.},

Title = {A Logical Model of Homology for Comparative Biology},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {69},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is a growing body of research on the evolution of anatomy in a
   wide variety of organisms. Discoveries in this field could be greatly
   accelerated by computational methods and resources that enable these
   findings to be compared across different studies and different organisms
   and linked with the genes responsible for anatomical modifications.
   Homology is a key concept in comparative anatomy; two important types
   are historical homology (the similarity of organisms due to common
   ancestry) and serial homology (the similarity of repeated structures
   within an organism). We explored how to most effectively represent
   historical and serial homology across anatomical structures to
   facilitate computational reasoning. We assembled a collection of
   homology assertions from the literature with a set of taxon phenotypes
   for the skeletal elements of vertebrate fins and limbs from the
   Phenoscape Knowledgebase. Using seven competency questions, we evaluated
   the reasoning ramifications of two logical models: the Reciprocal
   Existential Axioms (REA) homology model and the Ancestral Value Axioms
   (AVA) homology model. The AVA model returned all user-expected results
   in addition to the search term and any of its subclasses. The AVA model
   also returns any superclass of the query term in which a homology
   relationship has been asserted. The REA model returned the user-expected
   results for five out of seven queries. We identify some challenges of
   implementing complete homology queries due to limitations of OWL
   reasoning. This work lays the foundation for homology reasoning to be
   incorporated into other ontology-based tools, such as those that enable
   synthetic supermatrix construction and candidate gene discovery.},

Title = {Biogeographical Network Analysis of Cretaceous Terrestrial Tetrapods: A
   Phylogeny-Based Approach},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1034-1051},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Network methods are widely used to represent and analyze biogeography.
   It is difficult, however, to convert occurrence data of fossil
   vertebrates to a biogeographical network, as most species were known
   from a single locality. A new method for creating a biogeographical
   network that can incorporate phylogenetic information is proposed in
   this study, which increases the number of edges in the network of fossil
   vertebrates and enables the application of various network methods.
   Using ancestral state reconstruction via maximum parsimony, the method
   first estimates the biogeographical regions of all internal nodes of a
   given phylogeny using biogeographical information on the terminal taxa.
   Then, each internal node in the phylogenetic tree is converted to an
   edge in the biogeographical network that connects the region(s), if
   unambiguously estimated, of its two descendants. The new method was
   applied to phylogenetic trees generated by a birth-death model. Under
   all conditions tested, an average of 70\% of the internal nodes in
   phylogenetic trees were converted into edges. Three network indices-link
   density, average link weight, and endemism index (EI)-were evaluated for
   their usefulness in comparing different biogeographical networks. The EI
   reflects the rate of dispersal; the other indices reflect
   nonbiogeographical parameters, the number of taxa and regions, which
   highlights the importance of evaluating network indices before applying
   them to biogeographical studies. Multiple Cretaceous biogeographical
   networks were constructed from the phylogenies of five tetrapod taxa:
   terrestrial crocodyliforms, terrestrial turtles, nonavian dinosaurs,
   avians, and pterosaurs. The networks of avians and pterosaurs showed
   similar topologies and a strong correlation, and unexpectedly high
   endemism indices. These similarities were probably a result of shared
   taphonomic biases (i.e., the Lagerstatten effect) for volant taxa with
   fragile skeletons. The crocodyliform network was partitioned into the
   Gondwanan and Laurasian continents. The dinosaur network was partitioned
   into three groups of continents: 1) North America, Asia, and Australia;
   2) Europe and Africa; and 3) India, Madagascar, and South America. When
   Early and Late Cretaceous dinosaurs were analyzed separately, the
   dinosaur networks were divided into 1) North America, Asia, and
   Australia; and 2) Europe, Africa, India, and South America for the Early
   Cretaceous and 1) North America, Asia, and Europe; and 2) India,
   Madagascar, and South America for the Late Cretaceous. This partitioning
   of dinosaur and crocodyliform networks corroborates the results of
   previous biogeographical studies and indicates that the method
   introduced here can retrieve biogeographical signals from a source
   phylogeny when sufficient data are available for most targeted
   biogeographical regions.},

Title = {Integration of Anatomy Ontologies and Evo-Devo Using Structured Markov
   Models Suggests a New Framework for Modeling Discrete Phenotypic Traits},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {698-716},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modeling discrete phenotypic traits for either ancestral character state
   reconstruction or morphology-based phylogenetic inference suffers from
   ambiguities of character coding, homology assessment, dependencies, and
   selection of adequate models. These drawbacks occur because trait
   evolution is driven by two key processes-hierarchical and hidden-which
   are not accommodated simultaneously by the available phylogenetic
   methods. The hierarchical process refers to the dependencies between
   anatomical body parts, while the hidden process refers to the evolution
   of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying trait development. Herein,
   I demonstrate that these processes can be efficiently modeled using
   structured Markov models (SMM) equipped with hidden states, which
   resolves the majority of the problems associated with discrete traits.
   Integration of SMM with anatomy ontologies can adequately incorporate
   the hierarchical dependencies, while the use of the hidden states
   accommodates hidden evolution of GRNs and substitution rate
   heterogeneity. I assess the new models using simulations and theoretical
   synthesis. The new approach solves the long-standing ``tail color
   problem,{''} in which the trait is scored for species with tails of
   different colors or no tails. It also presents a previously unknown
   issue called the ``two-scientist paradox,{''} in which the nature of
   coding the trait and the hidden processes driving the trait's evolution
   are confounded; failing to account for the hidden process may result in
   a bias, which can be avoided by using hidden state models. All this
   provides a clear guideline for coding traits into characters. This
   article gives practical examples of using the new framework for
   phylogenetic inference and comparative analysis.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that natural selection underlies both traits and
   interactions, evolutionary models often neglect that ecological
   interactions may, and in many cases do, influence the evolution of
   traits. Herein, we explore the interdependence of ecological
   interactions and functional traits in the pollination associations of
   hawkmoths and flowering plants. Specifically, we develop an adaptation
   of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of trait evolution that allows us to
   study the influence of plant corolla depth and observed hawkmoth-plant
   interactions on the evolution of hawkmoth proboscis length. Across
   diverse modelling scenarios, we find that the inclusion of contemporary
   interactions can provide a better description of trait evolution than
   the null expectation. Moreover, we show that the pollination
   interactions provide more-likely models of hawkmoth trait evolution when
   interactions are considered at increasingly fine-scale groups of
   hawkmoths. Finally, we demonstrate how the results of best-fit modeling
   approaches can implicitly support the association between interactions
   and trait evolution that our method explicitly examines. In showing that
   contemporary interactions can provide insight into the historical
   evolution of hawkmoth proboscis length, we demonstrate the clear utility
   of incorporating additional ecological information to models designed to
   study past trait evolution.},

Title = {Lineage Diversity and Size Disparity in Musteloidea: Testing Patterns of
   Adaptive Radiation Using Molecular and Fossil-Based Methods},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Adaptive radiation is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism that drives
   the remarkable species diversity and morphological disparity across the
   Tree of Life. Tests for adaptive radiation in extant taxa are
   traditionally estimated from calibrated molecular phylogenies with
   little input from extinct taxa. With 85 putative species in 33 genera
   and over 400 described extinct species, the carnivoran superfamily
   Musteloidea is a prime candidate to investigate patterns of adaptive
   radiation using both extant-and fossil-based macroevolutionary methods.
   The species diversity and equally impressive ecological and phenotypic
   diversity found across Musteloidea is often attributed to two adaptive
   radiations coinciding with two major climate events, the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition.
   Here, we compiled a novel time-scaled phylogeny for 88\% of extant
   musteloids and used it as a framework for testing the predictions of
   adaptive radiation hypotheses with respect to rates of lineage
   diversification and phenotypic evolution. Contrary to expectations, we
   found no evidence for rapid bursts of lineage diversification at the
   origin of Musteloidea, and further analyses of lineage diversification
   rates using molecular and fossil-based methods did not find associations
   between rates of lineage diversification and the Eocene-Oligocene
   transition or Mid-Miocene Climate Transition as previously hypothesized.
   Rather, we found support for decoupled diversification dynamics driven
   by increased clade carrying capacity in the branches leading to a
   subclade of elongate mustelids. Supporting decoupled diversification
   dynamics between the subclade of elongate mustelids and the ancestral
   musteloid regime is our finding of increased rates of body length
   evolution, but not body mass evolution, within the decoupled mustelid
   subclade. The lack of correspondence in rates of body mass and length
   evolution suggest that phenotypic evolutionary rates under a single
   morphological metric, even one as influential as mass, may not capture
   the evolution of diversity in clades that exhibit elongate body shapes.
   The discordance in evolutionary rates between body length and body mass
   along with evidence of decoupled diversification dynamics suggests that
   body elongation might be an innovation for the exploitation of novel
   Mid-Miocene resources, resulting in the radiation of some musteloids.},

Title = {Novel Approaches for Phylogenetic Inference from Morphological Data and

Abstract = {Here, I combine previously underutilized models and priors to perform
   more biologically realistic phylogenetic inference from morphological
   data, with an example from squamate reptiles. When coding morphological
   characters, it is often possible to denote ordered states with explicit
   reference to observed or hypothetical ancestral conditions. Using this
   logic, we can integrate across character-state labels and estimate
   meaningful rates of forward and backward transitions from plesiomorphy
   to apomorphy. I refer to this approach as MkA, for ``asymmetric.{''} The
   MkA model incorporates the biological reality of limited reversal for
   many phylogenetically informative characters, and significantly
   increases likelihoods in the empirical data sets. Despite this, the
   phylogeny of Squamata remains contentious. Total-evidence analyses using
   combined morphological and molecular data and the MkA approach tend
   toward recent consensus estimates supporting a nested Iguania. However,
   support for this topology is not unambiguous across data sets or
   analyses, and no mechanism has been proposed to explain the widespread
   incongruence between partitions, or the hidden support for various
   topologies in those partitions. Furthermore, different morphological
   data sets produced by different authors contain both different
   characters and different states for the same or similar characters,
   resulting in drastically different placements for many important fossil
   lineages. Effort is needed to standardize ontology for morphology,
   resolve incongruence, and estimate a robust phylogeny. The MkA approach
   provides a preliminary avenue for investigating morphological evolution
   while accounting for temporal evidence and asymmetry in character-state
   changes.},

Abstract = {An evolutionary process is reflected in the sequence of changes of any
   trait (e.g., morphological or molecular) through time. Yet, a better
   understanding of evolution would be procured by characterizing
   correlated evolution, or when two or more evolutionary processes
   interact. Previously developed parametric methods often require
   significant computing time as they rely on the estimation of many
   parameters. Here, we propose a minimal likelihood framework modeling the
   joint evolution of two traits on a known phylogenetic tree. The type and
   strength of correlated evolution are characterized by a few parameters
   tuning mutation rates of each trait and interdependencies between these
   rates. The framework can be applied to study any discrete trait or
   character ranging from nucleotide substitution to gain or loss of a
   biological function. More specifically, it can be used to 1) test for
   independence between two evolutionary processes, 2) identify the type of
   interaction between them, and 3) estimate parameter values of the most
   likely model of interaction. In the current implementation, the method
   takes as input a phylogenetic tree with discrete evolutionary events
   mapped on its branches. The method then maximizes the likelihood for one
   or several chosen scenarios. The strengths and limits of the method, as
   well as its relative power compared to a few other methods, are assessed
   using both simulations and data from 16S rRNA sequences in a sample of
   54 gamma-enterobacteria. We show that, even with data sets of fewer than
   100 species, the method performs well in parameter estimation and in
   evolutionary model selection.},

Title = {Inferring the Effect of Species Interactions on Trait Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {463-479},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Models of trait evolution form an important part of macroevolutionary
   biology. The Brownian motion model and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models have
   become classic (null) models of character evolution, in which species
   evolve independently. Recently, models incorporating species
   interactions have been developed, particularly involving competition
   where abiotic factors pull species toward an optimal trait value and
   competitive interactions drive the trait values apart. However, these
   models assume a fitness function rather than derive it from population
   dynamics and they do not consider dynamics of the trait variance. Here,
   we develop a general coherent trait evolution framework where the
   fitness function is based on a model of population dynamics, and
   therefore it can, in principle, accommodate any type of species
   interaction. We illustrate our framework with a model of
   abundance-dependent competitive interactions against a macroevolutionary
   background encoded in a phylogenetic tree. We develop an inference tool
   based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and test it on simulated data
   (of traits at the tips). We find that inference performs well when the
   diversity predicted by the parameters equals the number of species in
   the phylogeny. We then fit the model to empirical data of baleen whale
   body lengths, using three different summary statistics, and compare it
   to a model without population dynamics and a model where competition
   depends on the total metabolic rate of the competitors. We show that the
   unweighted model performs best for the least informative summary
   statistic, while the model with competition weighted by the total
   metabolic rate fits the data slightly better than the other two models
   for the two more informative summary statistics. Regardless of the
   summary statistic used, the three models substantially differ in their
   predictions of the abundance distribution. Therefore, data on abundance
   distributions will allow us to better distinguish the models from one
   another, and infer the nature of species interactions. Thus, our
   framework provides a conceptual approach to reveal species interactions
   underlying trait evolution and identifies the data needed to do so in
   practice.},

Title = {Interrogating Phylogenetic Discordance Resolves Deep Splits in the Rapid
   Radiation of Old World Fruit Bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The family Pteropodidae (Old World fruit bats) comprises >200 species
   distributed across the Old World tropics and subtropics. Most
   pteropodids feed on fruit, suggesting an early origin of frugivory,
   although several lineages have shifted to nectar-based diets.
   Pteropodids are of exceptional conservation concern with >50\% of
   species considered threatened, yet the systematics of this group has
   long been debated, with uncertainty surrounding early splits attributed
   to an ancient rapid diversification. Resolving the relationships among
   the main pteropodid lineages is essential if we are to fully understand
   their evolutionary distinctiveness, and the extent to which these bats
   have transitioned to nectar-feeding. Here we generated orthologous
   sequences for >1400 nuclear protein-coding genes (2.8 million base
   pairs) across 114 species from 43 genera of Old World fruit bats (57\%
   and 96\% of extant species- and genus-level diversity, respectively),
   and combined phylogenomic inference with filtering by information
   content to resolve systematic relationships among the major lineages.
   Concatenation and coalescent-based methods recovered three distinct
   backbone topologies that were not able to be reconciled by filtering via
   phylogenetic information content. Concordance analysis and gene
   genealogy interrogation show that one topology is consistently the best
   supported, and that observed phylogenetic conflicts arise from both gene
   tree error and deep incomplete lineage sorting. In addition to resolving
   long-standing inconsistencies in the reported relationships among major
   lineages, we show that Old World fruit bats have likely undergone at
   least seven independent dietary transitions from frugivory to
   nectarivory. Finally, we use this phylogeny to identify and describe one
   new genus.},

Abstract = {The diversification of modern birds has been shaped by a number of
   radiations. Rapid diversification events make reconstructing the
   evolutionary relationships among taxa challenging due to the convoluted
   effects of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression.
   Phylogenomic data sets have the potential to detect patterns of
   phylogenetic incongruence, and to address their causes. However, the
   footprints of ILS and introgression on sequence data can vary between
   different phylogenomic markers at different phylogenetic scales
   depending on factors such as their evolutionary rates or their selection
   pressures. We show that combining phylogenomic markers that evolve at
   different rates, such as paired-end double-digest restriction
   site-associated DNA(PE-ddRAD) and ultraconserved elements (UCEs), allows
   a comprehensive exploration of the causes of phylogenetic discordance
   associated with short internodes at different timescales. We used
   thousands of UCE and PE-ddRAD markers to produce the first well-resolved
   phylogeny of shear waters, a group of medium-sized pelagic seabirds that
   are among the most phylogenetically controversial and endangered bird
   groups. We found that phylogenomic conflict was mainly derived from high
   levels of ILS due to rapid speciation events. We also documented a case
   of introgression, despite the high philopatry of shearwaters to their
   breeding sites, which typically limits gene flow. We integrated
   state-of-the-art concatenated and coalescent-based approaches to expand
   on previous comparisons of UCE and RAD-Seq data sets for phylogenetics,
   divergence time estimation, and inference of introgression, and we
   propose a strategy to optimize RAD-Seq data for phylogenetic analyses.
   Our results highlight the usefulness of combining phylogenomic markers
   evolving at different rates to understand the causes of phylogenetic
   discordance at different timescales.},

Abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon that
   generates genetic variability in a population and fosters species
   diversity in nature. The availability of large genome scale data sets
   has revolutionized hybridization studies to shift from the observation
   of the presence or absence of hybrids to the investigation of the
   genomic constitution of hybrids and their genome-specific evolutionary
   dynamics. Although a handful of methods have been proposed in an attempt
   to identify hybrids, accurate detection of hybridization from genomic
   data remains a challenging task. In addition to methods that infer
   phylogenetic networks or that utilize pairwise divergence, site pattern
   frequency based and population genetic clustering approaches are
   popularly used in practice, though the performance of these methods
   under different hybridization scenarios has not been extensively
   examined. Here, we use simulated data to comparatively evaluate the
   performance of four tools that are commonly used to infer hybridization
   events: the site pattern frequency based methods HyDe and the
   D-statistic (i.e., the ABBA-BABA test) and the population clustering
   approaches structure and ADMIXTURE. We consider single hybridization
   scenarios that vary in the time of hybridization and the amount of
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) for different proportions of parental
   contributions (gamma); introgressive hybridization; multiple
   hybridization scenarios; and a mixture of ancestral and recent
   hybridization scenarios. We focus on the statistical power to detect
   hybridization and the false discovery rate (FDR) for comparisons of the
   D-statistic and HyDe, and the accuracy of the estimates of gamma as
   measured by the mean squared error for HyDe, structure, and ADMIXTURE.
   Both HyDe and the D-statistic are powerful for detecting hybridization
   in all scenarios except those with high ILS, although the D-statistic
   often has an unacceptably high FDR. The estimates of gamma in HyDe are
   impressively robust and accurate whereas structure and ADMIXTURE
   sometimes fail to identify hybrids, particularly when the proportional
   parental contributions are asymmetric (i.e., when v is close to 0).
   Moreover, the posterior distribution estimated using structure exhibits
   multimodality in many scenarios, making interpretation difficult. Our
   results provide guidance in selecting appropriate methods for
   identifying hybrid populations from genomic data.},

Abstract = {Organismal interactions drive the accumulation of diversity by
   influencing species ranges, morphology, and behavior. Interactions vary
   from agonistic to cooperative and should result in predictable patterns
   in trait and range evolution. However, despite a conceptual
   understanding of these processes, they have been difficult to model,
   particularly on macroevolutionary timescales and across broad geographic
   spaces. Here, we investigate the influence of biotic interactions on
   trait evolution and community assembly inmonitor lizards (Varanus).
   Monitors are an iconic radiation with a cosmopolitan distribution and
   the greatest size disparity of any living terrestrial vertebrate genus.
   Between the colossal Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis and the smallest
   Australian dwarf goannas, Varanus length and mass vary by multiple
   orders of magnitude. To test the hypothesis that size variation in this
   genus was driven by character displacement, we extended existing
   phylogenetic comparative methods which consider lineage interactions to
   account for dynamic biogeographic history and apply these methods to
   Australian monitors and marsupial predators. Incorporating both
   exon-capture molecular and morphological data sets we use a combined
   evidence approach to estimate the relationships among living and extinct
   varaniform lizards. Our results suggest that communities of Australian
   Varanus show high functional diversity as a result of continent-wide
   interspecific competition among monitors but not with faunivorous
   marsupials. We demonstrate that patterns of trait evolution resulting
   from character displacement on continental scales are recoverable from
   comparative data and highlight that these macroevolutionary patterns may
   develop in parallel across widely distributed sympatric groups.},

Abstract = {Three prominent explanations have been proposed to explain the dramatic
   differences in species richness across regions and elevations, (i) time
   for speciation, (ii) diversification rates, and (iii) ecological limits.
   But the relative importance of these explanations and, especially, their
   interplay and possible synthesis remain largely elusive. Integrating
   diversification analyses, null models, and geographic information
   systems, I study avian richness across regions and elevations of the New
   World. My results reveal that even though the three explanations are
   differentially important (with ecological limits playing the dominant
   role), each contributes uniquely to the formation of richness gradients.
   Further, my results reveal the likely interplay between the
   explanations. They indicate that ecological limits hinder the
   diversification process, such that the accumulation of species within a
   region gradually slows down over time. Yet, it does not seem to converge
   toward a hard ceiling on regional richness. Instead, species-rich
   regions show suppressed, but continued, diversification, coupled with
   signatures of possible competition (esp. Neotropical lowlands).
   Conversely, species-poor, newly-colonized regions show fast
   diversification and weak to no signs of competition (esp. Nearctic
   highlands). These results held across five families of birds, across
   grid cells, biomes, and elevations. Together, my findings begin to
   illuminate the rich, yet highly consistent, interplay of the mechanisms
   that together shape richness gradients in the New World, including the
   most species-rich biodiversity hotspots on the planet, the Andes and the
   Amazon.},

Volume = {69},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent analyses of genomic sequence data suggest cross-species gene flow
   is common in both plants and animals, posing challenges to species tree
   estimation. We examine the levels of gene flow needed to mislead species
   tree estimation with three species and either episodic introgressive
   hybridization or continuous migration between an outgroup and one
   ingroup species. Several species tree estimation methods are examined,
   including the majority-vote method based on the most common gene tree
   topology (with either the true or reconstructed gene trees used), the
   UPGMA method based on the average sequence distances (or average
   coalescent times) between species, and the full-likelihood method based
   on multilocus sequence data. Our results suggest that the majority-vote
   method based on gene tree topologies is more robust to gene flow than
   the UPGMA method based on coalescent times and both are more robust than
   likelihood assuming a multispecies coalescent (MSC) model with no
   cross-species gene flow. Comparison of the continuous migration model
   with the episodic introgression model suggests that a small amount of
   gene flow per generation can cause drastic changes to the genetic
   history of the species and mislead species tree methods, especially if
   the species diverged through radiative speciation events. Estimates of
   parameters under the MSC with gene flow suggest that African mosquito
   species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex constitute such an
   example of extreme impact of gene flow on species phylogeny.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary inferences require reliable phylogenies. Morphological data
   have traditionally been analyzed using maximum parsimony, but recent
   simulation studies have suggested that Bayesian analyses yield more
   accurate trees. This debate is ongoing, in part, because of ambiguity
   over modes of morphological evolution and a lack of appropriate models.
   Here, we investigate phylogenetic methods using two novel simulation
   models-one in which morphological characters evolve stochastically along
   lineages and another in which individuals undergo selection. Both models
   generate character data and lineage splitting simultaneously: the
   resulting trees are an emergent property, rather than a fixed parameter.
   Standard consensus methods for Bayesian searches (Mki) yield fewer
   incorrect nodes and quartets than the standard consensus trees recovered
   using equal weighting and implied weighting parsimony searches.
   Distances between the pool of derived trees (most parsimonious or
   posterior distribution) and the true trees-measured using
   Robinson-Foulds (RF), subtree prune and regraft (SPR), and tree
   bisection reconnection (TBR) metrics-demonstrate that this is related to
   the search strategy and consensus method of each technique. The amount
   and structure of homoplasy in character data differ between models.
   Morphological coherence, which has previously not been considered in
   this context, proves to be a more important factor for phylogenetic
   accuracy than homoplasy. Selection-based models exhibit relatively lower
   homoplasy, lower morphological coherence, and higher inaccuracy in
   inferred trees. Selection is a dominant driver of morphological
   evolution, but we demonstrate that it has a confounding effect on
   numerous character properties which are fundamental to phylogenetic
   inference. We suggest that the current debate should move beyond
   considerations of parsimony versus Bayesian, toward identifying modes of
   morphological evolution and using these to build models for
   probabilistic search methods.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Gene and Gene Expression (GAGE) species concept, a new version of
   the Pragmatic Species Concept of Seifert (2014), is proposed as a
   concept applicable to any described recent or fossil eukaryotic organism
   independent from its mode of reproduction or evolutionary history. In
   addition to presenting the concept as such, the article also provides
   practical recommendations for taxonomists when delimiting species and
   describing taxa. The wording of the new concept contains a heading core
   sentence plus five attached sentences addressing essential conditions
   for its translation into a sound taxonomic practice: ``Species are
   separable clusters that have passed a threshold of evolutionary
   divergence and are exclusively defined by nun icor DNA sequences and/or
   their (repression `,roll m Is. Nuclear DNA sequences and their
   expression products are different character systems but have a highly
   correlated indicative function. Character systems with the least risk of
   epigenetic or ontogenetic modification have superior indicative value
   when conflicts between character systems of integrative studies arise.
   All character systems have to be described by an adequate numerics
   allowing cluster formation and determination of thresholds. Thresholds
   for each character system should be fixed by consensus among the experts
   under the principle of avoiding oversplitting or lumping. Clusters must
   not be the expression of intraspecific polymorphism.{''} Recognizing the
   distortions and conflicts caused to taxonomy through barcoding or
   through assessment on the basis of association with other organisms, the
   GAGE species concept strongly downgrades the use of cytoplasmic DNA of
   endosymbiotic origin (mtDNA, cpDNA) or DNA of closely associated
   microbes (e.g., Wolbachia bacteria) for final taxonomic decision-making.
   Recognizing the distortion of phylogenies by the high frequency of
   reticulate evolution, it is argued that delimiting and naming species
   has to be separated from constructing bifurcating phylogenetic trees.},

Title = {Analysis of Spounaviruses as a Case Study for the Overdue
   Reclassification of Tailed Phages},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {110-123},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tailed bacteriophages are the most abundant and diverse viruses in the
   world, with genome sizes ranging from 10 kbp to over 500 kbp. Yet, due
   to historical reasons, all this diversity is confined to a single virus
   order-Caudovirales, composed of just four families: Myoviridae,
   Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and the newly created Ackermannviridae
   family. In recent years, this morphology-based classification scheme has
   started to crumble under the constant flood of phage sequences,
   revealing that tailed phages are even more genetically diverse than once
   thought. This prompted us, the Bacterial and Archaeal Viruses
   Subcommittee of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
   (ICTV), to consider overall reorganization of phage taxonomy. In this
   study, we used a wide range of complementary methods-including
   comparative genomics, core genome analysis, and marker gene
   phylogenetics-to show that the group of Bacillus phage SPO1-related
   viruses previously classified into the Spounavirinae subfamily, is
   clearly distinct from other members of the family Myoviridae and its
   diversity deserves the rank of an autonomous family. Thus, we removed
   this group from the Myoviridae family and created the family
   Herelleviridae-a new taxon of the same rank. In the process of the taxon
   evaluation, we explored the feasibility of different demarcation
   criteria and critically evaluated the usefulness of our methods for
   phage classification. The convergence of results, drawing a consistent
   and comprehensive picture of a new family with associated subfamilies,
   regardless of method, demonstrates that the tools applied here are
   particularly useful in phage taxonomy. We are convinced that creation of
   this novel family is a crucial milestone toward much-needed
   reclassification in the Caudovirales order.},

Abstract = {BEAGLE is a high-performance likelihood-calculation library for
   phylogenetic inference. The BEAGLE library defines a simple, but
   flexible, application programming interface (API), and includes a
   collection of efficient implementations for calculation under a variety
   of evolutionary models on different hardware devices. The library has
   been integrated into recent versions of popular phylogenetics software
   packages including BEAST and MrBayes and has been widely used across a
   diverse range of evolutionary studies. Here, we present BEAGLE 3 with
   new parallel implementations, increased performance for challenging data
   sets, improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new
   OpenCL and central processing unit-threaded implementations to the
   library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider range of modern
   hardware. Further, we have extended the API and library to support
   concurrent computation of independent partial likelihood arrays, for
   increased performance of nucleotide-model analyses with greater
   flexibility of data partitioning. For better scalability and usability,
   we have improved how phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in
   multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) and cluster environments, and
   introduced an automated method to select the fastest device given the
   data set, evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers
   who wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online
   tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a variety
   of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware. For a partitioned exemplar
   analysis, we observe run-time performance improvements as high as
   5.9-fold over our previous GPU implementation. BEAGLE 3 is free,
   open-source software licensed under the Lesser GPL and available at
   https://beagle-dev.github.io.},

Title = {Robust Design for Coalescent Model Inference},

Abstract = {The coalescent process describes how changes in the size or structure of
   a population influence the genealogical patterns of sequences sampled
   from that population. The estimation of (effective) population size
   changes from genealogies that are reconstructed from these sampled
   sequences is an important problem in many biological fields. Often,
   population size is characterized by a piecewise-constant function, with
   each piece serving as a population size parameter to be estimated.
   Estimation quality depends on both the statistical coalescent inference
   method employed, and on the experimental protocol, which controls
   variables such as the sampling of sequences through time and space, or
   the transformation of model parameters. While there is an extensive
   literature on coalescent inference methodology, there is comparatively
   little work on experimental design. The research that does exist is
   largely simulation-based, precluding the development of provable or
   general design theorems. We examine three key design problems: temporal
   sampling of sequences under the skyline demographic coalescent model,
   spatio-temporal sampling under the structured coalescent model, and time
   discretization for sequentially Markovian coalescent models. In all
   cases, we prove that 1) working in the logarithm of the parameters to be
   inferred (e.g., population size) and 2) distributing informative
   coalescent events uniformly among these log-parameters, is uniquely
   robust. ``Robust{''} means that the total and maximum uncertainty of our
   parameter estimates are minimized, and made insensitive to their unknown
   (true) values. This robust design theorem provides rigorous
   justification for several existing coalescent experimental design
   decisions and leads to usable guidelines for future empirical or
   simulation-based investigations. Given its persistence among models,
   this theorem may form the basis of an experimental design paradigm for
   coalescent inference.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {616-632},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {When inferring phylogenies, one important decision is whether and how
   nucleotide substitution parameters should be shared across different
   subsets or partitions of the data. One sort of partitioning error occurs
   when heterogeneous subsets aremistakenlylumped together and treated as
   if they share parameter values. The opposite kind of error is mistakenly
   treating homogeneous subsets as if they result from distinct sets of
   parameters. Lumping and splitting errors are not equally bad. Lumping
   errors can yield parameter estimates that do not accurately reflect any
   of the subsets that were combined whereas splitting errors yield
   estimates that did not benefit from sharing information across
   partitions. Phylogenetic partitioning decisions are often made by
   applying information criteria such as the Akaike information criterion
   (AIC). As with other information criteria, the AIC evaluates a model or
   partition scheme by combining the maximum log-likelihood value with a
   penalty that depends on the number of parameters being estimated. For
   the purpose of selecting an optimal partitioning scheme, we derive an
   adjustment to the AIC that we refer to as the AIC((p)) and that is
   motivated by the idea that splitting errors are less serious than
   lumping errors. We also introduce a similar adjustment to the Bayesian
   information criterion (BIC) that we refer to as the BIC(p). Via
   simulation and empirical data analysis, we contrast AIC and BIC behavior
   to our suggested adjustments. We discuss these results and also
   emphasize whywe expect the probability of lumping errors with the
   AIC((p)) and the BIC(p) to be relatively robust to model
   parameterization.},

Title = {Species Tree Estimation and the Impact of Gene Loss Following

Abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurs broadly and repeatedly across the
   history of eukaryotes and is recognized as a prominent evolutionary
   force, especially in plants. Immediately following WGD, most genes are
   present in two copies as paralogs. Due to this redundancy, one copy of a
   paralog pair commonly undergoes pseudogenization and is eventually lost.
   When speciation occurs shortly after WGD; however, differential loss of
   paralogs may lead to spurious phylogenetic inference resulting from the
   inclusion of pseudoorthologs-paralogous genes mistakenly identified as
   orthologs because they are present in single copies within each sampled
   species. The influence and impact of including pseudoorthologs versus
   true orthologs as a result of gene extinction (or incomplete laboratory
   sampling) are only recently gaining empirical attention in the
   phylogenomics community. Moreover, few studies have yet to investigate
   this phenomenon in an explicit coalescent framework. Here, using
   mathematical models, numerous simulated data sets, and two newly
   assembled empirical data sets, we assess the effect of pseudoorthologs
   on species tree estimation under varying degrees of incomplete lineage
   sorting (ILS) and differential gene loss scenarios following WGD. When
   gene loss occurs along the terminal branches of the species tree,
   alignment-based (BPP) and gene-tree-based (ASTRAL, MP-EST, and STAR)
   coalescent methods are adversely affected as the degree of ILS
   increases. This can be greatly improved by sampling a sufficiently large
   number of genes. Under the same circumstances, however, concatenation
   methods consistently estimate incorrect species trees as the number of
   genes increases. Additionally, pseudoorthologs can greatly mislead
   species tree inference when gene loss occurs along the internal branches
   of the species tree. Here, both coalescent and concatenation methods
   yield inconsistent results. These results underscore the importance of
   understanding the influence of pseudoorthologs in the phylogenomics era.

Number = {6},
Pages = {1307-1318},

Abstract = {Understanding phenotypic disparity across the tree of life requires
   identifying where and when evolutionary rates change on phylogeny. A
   primary methodological challenge in macroevolution is therefore to
   develop methods for accurate inference of among-lineage variation in
   rates of phenotypic evolution. Here, we describe a method for inferring
   among-lineage evolutionary rate heterogeneity in both continuous and
   discrete traits. The method assumes that the present-day distribution of
   a trait is shaped by a variable-rate process arising from a mixture of
   constant-rate processes and uses a single-pass tree traversal algorithm
   to estimate branch-specific evolutionary rates. By employing dynamic
   programming optimization techniques and approximate maximum likelihood
   estimators where appropriate, our method permits rapid exploration of
   the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Simulations indicate that
   the method reconstructs rates of trait evolution with high accuracy.
   Application of the method to data sets on squamate reptile reproduction
   and turtle body size recovers patterns of rate heterogeneity identified
   by previous studies but with computational costs reduced by many orders
   of magnitude. Our results expand the set of tools available for
   detecting macroevolutionary rate heterogeneity and point to the utility
   of fast, approximate methods for studying large-scale biodiversity
   dynamics. {[}Brownian motion; continuous characters; discrete

Abstract = {The species tree paradigm that dominates current molecular systematic
   practice infers species trees from collections of sequences under
   assumptions of the multispecies coalescent (MSC), that is, that there is
   free recombination between the sequences and no (or very low)
   recombination within them. These coalescent genes (c-genes) are thus
   defined in an historical rather than molecular sense and can in theory
   be as large as an entire genome or as small as a single nucleotide. A
   debate about how to define c-genes centers on the contention that
   nuclear gene sequences used in many coalescent analyses undergo too much
   recombination, such that their introns comprise multiple c-genes,
   violating a key assumption of the MSC. Recently a similar argument has
   been made for the genes of plastid (e.g., chloroplast) and mitochondrial
   genomes, which for the last 30 or more years have been considered to
   represent a single c-gene for the purposes of phylogeny reconstruction
   because they are nonrecombining in an historical sense. Consequently, it
   has been suggested that these genomes should be analyzed using
   coalescent methods that treat their genes-over 70 protein-coding genes
   in the case of most plastid genomes (plastomes)-as independent estimates
   of species phylogeny, in contrast to the usual practice of
   concatenation, which is appropriate for generating gene trees. However,
   although recombination certainly occurs in the plastome, as has been
   recognized since the 1970's, it is unlikely to be phylogenetically
   relevant. This is because such historically effective recombination can
   only occur when plastomes with incongruent histories are brought
   together in the same plastid. However, plastids sort rapidly into
   different cell lineages and rarely fuse. Thus, because of plastid
   biology, the plastome is a more canonical c-gene than is the average
   multi-intron mammalian nuclear gene. The plastome should thus continue
   to be treated as a single estimate of the underlying species phylogeny,
   as should the mitochondrial genome. The implications of this long-held
   insight of molecular systematics for studies in the phylogenomic era are
   explored. {[}c-gene; coalescent gene; concatalescence; organelle genome;

Title = {A New Pipeline for Removing Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {410-425},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Target enrichment (such as Hyb-Seq) is a well-established high
   throughput sequencing method that has been increasingly used for
   phylogenomic studies. Unfortunately, current widely used pipelines for
   analysis of target enrichment data do not have a vigorous procedure to
   remove paralogs in target enrichment data. In this study, we develop a
   pipeline we call Putative Paralogs Detection (PPD) to better address
   putative paralogs from enrichment data. The new pipeline is an add-on to
   the existing HybPiper pipeline, and the entire pipeline applies criteria
   in both sequence similarity and heterozygous sites at each locus in the
   identification of paralogs. Users may adjust the thresholds of sequence
   identity and heterozygous sites to identify and remove paralogs
   according to the level of phylogenetic divergence of their group of
   interest. The new pipeline also removes highly polymorphic sites
   attributed to errors in sequence assembly and gappy regions in the
   alignment. We demonstrated the value of the new pipeline using empirical
   data generated from Hyb-Seq and the Angiosperms353 kit for two woody
   genera Castanea (Fagaceae, Fagales) and Hamamelis (Hamamelidaceae,
   Saxifragales). Comparisons of data sets showed that the PPD identified
   many more putative paralogs than the popular method HybPiper.
   Comparisons of tree topologies and divergence times showed evident
   differences between data from HybPiper and data from our new PPD
   pipeline. We further evaluated the accuracy and error rates of PPD by
   BLAST mapping of putative paralogous and orthologous sequences to a
   reference genome sequence of Castanea mollissima. Compared to HybPiper
   alone, PPD identified substantially more paralogous gene sequences that
   mapped to multiple regions of the reference genome (31 genes for PPD
   compared with 4 genes for HybPiper alone). In conjunction with HybPiper,
   paralogous genes identified by both pipelines can be removed resulting
   in the construction of more robust orthologous gene data sets for
   phylogenomic and divergence time analyses. Our study demonstrates the
   value of Hyb-Seq with data derived from the Angiosperms353 probe set for
   elucidating species relationships within a genus, and argues for the
   importance of additional steps to filter paralogous genes and poorly
   aligned regions (e.g., as occur through assembly errors), such as our
   new PPD pipeline described in this study. {[}Angiosperms353; Castanea;

Abstract = {Understanding how gene flow affects population divergence and speciation
   remains challenging. Differentiating one evolutionary process from
   another can be difficult because multiple processes can produce similar
   patterns, and more than one process can occur simultaneously. Although
   simple population models produce predictable results, how these
   processes balance in taxa with patchy distributions and complicated
   natural histories is less certain. These types of populations might be
   highly connected through migration (gene flow), but can experience
   stronger effects of genetic drift and inbreeding, or localized
   selection. Although different signals can be difficult to separate, the
   application of high-throughput sequence data can provide the resolution
   necessary to distinguish many of these processes. We present
   whole-genome sequence data for an avian species group with an alpine and
   arctic tundra distribution to examine the role that different population
   genetic processes have played in their evolutionary history.
   Rosy-finches inhabit high elevation mountaintop sky islands and
   high-latitude island and continental tundra. They exhibit extensive
   plumage variation coupled with low levels of genetic variation.
   Additionally, the number of species within the complex is debated,
   making them excellent for studying the forces involved in the process of
   diversification, as well as an important species group in which to
   investigate species boundaries. Total genomic variation suggests a
   broadly continuous pattern of allele frequency changes across the
   mainland taxa of this group in North America. However, phylogenomic
   analyses recover multiple distinct, well supported, groups that coincide
   with previously described morphological variation and current
   species-level taxonomy. Tests of introgression using D-statistics and
   approximate Bayesian computation reveal significant levels of
   introgression between multiple North American taxa. These results
   provide insight into the balance between divergent and homogenizing
   population genetic processes and highlight remaining challenges in
   interpreting conflict between different types of analytical approaches
   with whole-genome sequence data.},

Title = {Adaptive Estimation for Epidemic Renewal and Phylogenetic Skyline Models},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or
   count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable
   estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological
   drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and
   evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In
   infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an
   epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the
   effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of
   observed incident cases. The skyline model infers the effective
   population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from
   that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N
   informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct
   problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional
   piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might
   underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious
   understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention
   policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet
   principled approach for optimizing p exists. Usually, p is heuristically
   set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a
   computable and interpretable pselection method based on the minimum
   description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many
   standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional
   statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result,
   our method optimizes p so that R and N estimates properly and
   meaningfully adapt to available data. It also outperforms comparable
   Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification
   problems, given minimal knowledge of the parameter space, and exposes
   statistical similarities among renewal, skyline, and other models in
   biology. Rigorous and interpretable model selection is necessary if
   trustworthy and justifiable conclusions are to be drawn from piecewise
   models.},

Title = {A Simulation-Based Approach to Statistical Alignment},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {252-266},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Classic alignment algorithms utilize scoring functions which maximize
   similarity or minimize edit distances. These scoring functions account
   for both insertion-deletion (indel) and substitution events. In
   contrast, alignments based on stochastic models aim to explicitly
   describe the evolutionary dynamics of sequences by inferring relevant
   probabilistic parameters from input sequences. Despite advances in
   stochastic modeling during the last two decades, scoring-based methods
   are still dominant, partially due to slow running times of probabilistic
   approaches. Alignment inference using stochastic models involves
   estimating the probability of events, such as the insertion or deletion
   of a specific number of characters. In this work, we present SimBa-SAl,
   a simulation-based approach to statistical alignment inference, which
   relies on an explicit continuous time Markov model for both indels and
   substitutions. SimBa-SAl has several advantages. First, using
   simulations, it decouples the estimation of event probabilities from the
   inference stage, which allows the introduction of accelerations to the
   alignment inference procedure. Second, it is general and can accommodate
   various stochastic models of indel formation. Finally, it allows
   computing the maximum-likelihood alignment, the probability of a given
   pair of sequences integrated over all possible alignments, and sampling
   alternative alignments according to their probability. We first show
   that SimBa-SAl allows accurate estimation of parameters of the
   long-indel model previously developed by Miklos et al. (2004). We next
   show that SimBa-SAl is more accurate than previously developed pairwise
   alignment algorithms, when analyzing simulated as well as empirical data
   sets. Finally, we study the goodness-of-fit of the long-indel and TKF91
   models. We show that although the long-indel model fits the data sets
   better than TKF91, there is still room for improvement concerning the
   realistic modeling of evolutionary sequence dynamics.},

Title = {Combined Analysis of Extant Rhynchonellida (Brachiopoda) using
   Morphological and Molecular Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Independent molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses have often
   produced discordant results for certain groups which, for fossil-rich
   groups, raises the possibility that morphological data might mislead in
   those groups for whichwe dependuponmorphology themost. Rhynchonellide
   brachiopods, withmore than 500 extinct genera but only 19 extant genera
   represented today, provide an opportunity to explore the factors that
   produce contentious phylogenetic signal across datasets, as previous
   phylogenetic hypotheses generated from molecular sequence data bear
   little agreement with those constructed using morphological characters.
   Using a revised matrix of 66 morphological characters, and published
   ribosomal DNA sequences, we performed a series of combined phylogenetic
   analyses to identify conflicting phylogenetic signals. We completed a
   series of parsimony-based and Bayesian analyses, varying the data used,
   the taxa included, and the models used in the Bayesian analyses. We also
   performed simulation-based sensitivity analyses to assess whether the
   small size of the morphological data partition relative to the molecular
   data influenced the results of the combined analyses. In order to
   compare and contrast a large number of phylogenetic analyses and their
   resulting summary trees, we developed a measure for the incongruence
   between two topologies and simultaneously ignore any differences in
   phylogenetic resolution. Phylogenetic hypotheses generated using only
   morphological characters differed among each other, and with previous
   analyses, whereas molecular-only and combined Bayesian analyses produced
   extremely similar topologies. Characters historically associated with
   traditional classification in the Rhynchonellida have very
   lowconsistency indices on the topology preferred by the combined
   Bayesian analyses. Overall, this casts doubt on the use of morphological
   systematics to resolve relationships among the crown rhynchonellide
   brachiopods. However, expanding our dataset to a larger number of
   extinct taxa with intermediate morphologies is necessary to exclude the
   possibility that the morphology of extant taxa is not dominated by
   convergence along long branches.},

Title = {Functional Trade-Offs Asymmetrically Promote Phenotypic Evolution},

Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {150-160},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Trade-offs are thought to bias evolution and are core features of many
   anatomical systems. Therefore, trade-offs may have far-reaching
   macroevolutionary consequences, including patterns of morphological,
   functional, and ecological diversity. Jaws, like many complex anatomical
   systems, are comprised of elements involved in biomechanical trade-offs.
   We test the impact of a core mechanical trade-off, the transmission of
   velocity versus force (i.e., mechanical advantage), on rates of jaw
   evolution in Neotropical cichlids. Across 130 species representing a
   wide array of feeding ecologies, we find that the velocity-force
   trade-off impacts the evolution of the surrounding jaw system.
   Specifically, rates of jaw evolution are faster at functional extremes
   than in more functionally intermediate or unspecialized jaws. Yet,
   surprisingly, the effect on jaw evolution is uneven across the extremes
   of the velocity-force continuum. Rates of jaw evolution are 4- to
   10-fold faster in velocity-modified jaws, whereas force-modified jaws
   are 7- to 18-fold faster, compared to unspecialized jaws, depending on
   the extent of specialization. Further, we find that a more extreme
   mechanical trade-off resulted in faster rates of jaw evolution. The
   velocity-force trade-off reflects a gradient from specialization on
   capture-intensive (e.g., evasive or buried) to processing-intensive prey
   (e.g., attached or shelled), respectively. The velocity extreme of the
   trade-off is characterized by large magnitudes of trait change leading
   to functionally divergent specialists and ecological stasis. By
   contrast, the force extreme of the trade-off is characterized by
   enhanced ecological lability made possible by phenotypes more readily
   co-opted for different feeding ecologies. This asymmetry of
   macroevolutionary outcomes along each extreme is likely the result of an
   enhanced utility of the pharyngeal jaw system as force-modified oral
   jaws are adapted for prey that requires intensive processing (e.g.,
   algae, detritus, and mollusks). The velocity-force trade-off, a
   fundamental feature of many anatomical systems, promotes rapid
   phenotypic evolution of the surrounding jaw system in a canonical
   continental adaptive radiation. Considering that the velocity-force
   trade-off is an inherent feature of all jaw systems that involve a lower
   element that rotates at a joint, spanning the vast majority of
   vertebrates, our results may be widely applicable across the tree of
   life. {[}Adaptive radiation; constraint; decoupling; jaws;

Title = {Measuring Phylogenetic Information of Incomplete Sequence Data},

Abstract = {Widely used approaches for extracting phylogenetic information from
   aligned sets of molecular sequences rely upon probabilistic models of
   nucleotide substitution or amino-acid replacement. The phylogenetic
   information that can be extracted depends on the number of columns in
   the sequence alignment and will be decreased when the alignment contains
   gaps due to insertion or deletion events. Motivated by the measurement
   of information loss, we suggest assessment of the effective sequence
   length (ESL) of an aligned data set. The ESL can differ from the actual
   number of columns in a sequence alignment because of the presence of
   alignment gaps. Furthermore, the estimation of phylogenetic information
   is affected by model misspecification. Inevitably, the actual process of
   molecular evolution differs from the probabilistic models employed to
   describe this process. This disparity means the amount of phylogenetic
   information in an actual sequence alignment will differ from the amount
   in a simulated data set of equal size, which motivated us to develop a
   new test for model adequacy. Via theory and empirical data analysis, we
   show how to disentangle the effects of gaps and model misspecification.
   By comparing the Fisher information of actual and simulated sequences,
   we identify which alignment sites and tree branches are most affected by
   gaps and model misspecification. {[}Fisher information; gaps; insertion;

Title = {Phylogenomics of Piranhas and Pacus (Serrasalmidae) Uncovers How Dietary

Abstract = {The Amazon and neighboring South American river basins harbor the
   world's most diverse assemblages of freshwater fishes. One of the most
   prominent South American fish families is the Serrasalmidae (pacus and
   piranhas), found in nearly every continental basin. Serrasalmids are
   keystone ecological taxa, being some of the top riverine predators as
   well as the primary seed dispersers in the flooded forest. Despite their
   widespread occurrence and notable ecologies, serrasalmid evolutionary
   history and systematics are controversial. For example, the sister taxon
   to serrasalmids is contentious, the relationships of major clades within
   the family are inconsistent across different methodologies, and half of
   the extant serrasalmid genera are suggested to be non-monophyletic. We
   analyzed exon capture to reexamine the evolutionary relationships among
   63 (of 99) species across all 16 serrasalmid genera and their nearest
   outgroups, including multiple individuals per species to account for
   cryptic lineages. To reconstruct the timeline of serrasalmid
   diversification, we time-calibrated this phylogeny using two different
   fossil-calibration schemes to account for uncertainty in taxonomy with
   respect to fossil teeth. Finally, we analyzed diet evolution across the
   family and comment on associated changes in dentition, highlighting the
   ecomorphological diversity within serrasalmids. We document widespread
   non-monophyly of genera within Myleinae, as well as between Serrasalmus
   and Pristobrycon, and propose that reliance on traits like teeth to
   distinguish among genera is confounded by ecological homoplasy,
   especially among herbivorous and omnivorous taxa. We clarify the
   relationships among all serrasalmid genera, propose new subfamily
   affiliations, and support hemiodontids as the sister taxon to
   Serrasalmidae.},

Abstract = {In order to study evolutionary pattern and process, we need to be able
   to accurately identify species and the evolutionary lineages from which
   they are derived. Determining the concordance between genetic and
   morphological variation of living populations, and then directly
   comparing extant and fossil morphological data, provides a robust
   approach for improving our identification of lineages through time. We
   investigate genetic and shell morphological variation in extant species
   of Penion marine snails from New Zealand, and extend this analysis into
   deep time using fossils. We find that genetic and morphological
   variation identify similar patterns and support most currently
   recognized extant species. However, some taxonomic over-splitting is
   detected due to shell size being a poor trait for species delimitation,
   and we identify incorrect assignment of some fossil specimens. We infer
   that a single evolutionary lineage (Penion sulcatus) has existed for 22
   myr, with most aspects of shell shape and shell size evolving under a
   random walk. However, by removing samples previously classified as the
   extinct species P. marwicki, we instead detect morphological stasis for
   one axis of shell shape variation. This result demonstrates how lineage
   identification can change our perception of evolutionary pattern and
   process.},

Abstract = {Genomics is narrowing uncertainty in the phylogenetic structure for many
   amniote groups. For one of the most diverse and species-rich groups, the
   squamate reptiles (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians), an inverse
   correlation between the number of taxa and loci sampled still persists
   across all publications using DNA sequence data and reaching a consensus
   on the relationships among them has been highly problematic. In this
   study, we use high-throughput sequence data from 289 samples covering 75
   families of squamates to address phylogenetic affinities, estimate
   divergence times, and characterize residual topological uncertainty in
   the presence of genome-scale data. Importantly, we address genomic
   support for the traditional taxonomic groupings Scleroglossa and
   Macrostomata using novel machine-learning techniques. We interrogate
   genes using various metrics inherent to these loci, including
   parsimony-informative sites (PIS), phylogenetic informativeness, length,
   gaps, number of substitutions, and site concordance to understand why
   certain loci fail to find previously well-supported molecular clades and
   how they fail to support species-tree estimates. We show that both
   incomplete lineage sorting and poor gene-tree estimation (due to a few
   undesirable gene properties, such as an insufficient number of PIS), may
   account for most gene and species-tree discordance. We find overwhelming
   signal for Toxicofera, and also show that none of the loci included in
   this study supports Scleroglossa or Macrostomata. We comment on the
   origins and diversification of Squamata throughout the Mesozoic and
   underscore remaining uncertainties that persist in both deeper parts of
   the tree (e.g., relationships between Dibamia, Gekkota, and remaining
   squamates; among the three toxicoferan clades Iguania, Serpentes, and
   Anguiformes) and within specific clades (e.g., affinities among
   gekkotan, pleurodont iguanians, and colubroid families).},

Abstract = {Discrete morphological data have been widely used to study species
   evolution, but the use of quantitative (or continuous) morphological
   characters is less common. Here, we implement a Bayesian method to
   estimate species divergence times using quantitative characters.
   Quantitative character evolution is modeled using Brownian diffusion
   with character correlation and character variation within populations.
   Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population
   variation (or population ``noise{''}) and the correlation among
   characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate,
   especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply
   our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium
   landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals. Our results show
   that time estimates are affected by whether the correlations and
   population noise are accounted for or ignored in the analysis. The
   estimates are also affected by the type of data analyzed, with analyses
   of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination
   of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate
   variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species
   appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that
   the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the
   autocorrelated-rates model. We suggest that using morphological
   continuous characters, together with molecular data, can bring a new
   perspective to the study of species evolution. Our new model is
   implemented in the MCMCtree computer program for Bayesian inference of
   divergence times.},

Title = {Estimating Age-Dependent Extinction: Contrasting Evidence from Fossils
   and Phylogenies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The estimation of diversification rates is one of the most vividly
   debated topics in modern systematics, with considerable controversy
   surrounding the power of phylogenetic and fossil-based approaches in
   estimating extinction. Van Valen's seminal work from 1973 proposed the
   ``Law of constant extinction,{''} which states that the probability of
   extinction of taxa is not dependent on their age. This assumption of
   age-independent extinction has prevailed for decades with its assessment
   based on survivorship curves, which, however, do not directly account
   for the incompleteness of the fossil record, and have rarely been
   applied at the species level. Here, we present a Bayesian framework to
   estimate extinction rates from the fossil record accounting for
   age-dependent extinction (ADE). Our approach, unlike previous
   implementations, explicitly models unobserved species and accounts for
   the effects of fossil preservation on the observed longevity of sampled
   lineages. We assess the performance and robustness of our method through
   extensive simulations and apply it to a fossil data set of terrestrial
   Carnivora spanning the past 40 myr. We find strong evidence of ADE, as
   we detect the extinction rate to be highest in young species and
   declining with increasing species age. For comparison, we apply a
   recently developed analogous ADE model to a dated phylogeny of extant
   Carnivora. Although the phylogeny-based analysis also infers ADE, it
   indicates that the extinction rate, instead, increases with increasing
   taxon age. The estimated mean species longevity also differs
   substantially, with the fossil-based analyses estimating 2.0 myr, in
   contrast to 9.8 myr derived from the phylogeny-based inference.
   Scrutinizing these discrepancies, we find that both fossil and
   phylogeny-based ADE models are prone to high error rates when speciation
   and extinction rates increase or decrease through time. However,
   analyses of simulated and empirical data show that fossil-based
   inferences are more robust. This study shows that an accurate estimation
   of ADE from incomplete fossil data is possible when the effects of
   preservation are jointly modeled, thus allowing for a reassessment of
   Van Valen's model as a general rule in macroevolution.},

Abstract = {The shapes of evolutionary trees are influenced by the nature of the
   evolutionary process but comparisons of trees fromdifferent processes
   are hindered by the challenge of completely describing tree shape. We
   present a full characterization of the shapes of rooted branching trees
   in a form that lends itself to natural tree comparisons. We use this
   characterization to define a metric, in the sense of a true distance
   function, on tree shapes. The metric distinguishes trees from random
   models known to produce different tree shapes. It separates trees
   derived from tropical versus USA influenza A sequences, which reflect
   the differing epidemiology of tropical and seasonal flu. We describe
   several metrics based on the same core characterization, and illustrate
   howto extend themetric to incorporate trees' branch lengths or other
   features such as overall imbalance. Our approach allows us to construct
   addition and multiplication on trees, and to create a convex metric on
   tree shapes which formally allows computation of average tree shapes.},

Title = {Combining Species Delimitation, Species Trees, and Tests for Gene Flow
   Clarifies Complex Speciation in Scrub-Jays},

Abstract = {Complex speciation, involving rapid divergence and multiple bouts of
   post-divergence gene flow, can obfuscate phylogenetic relationships and
   species limits. In North America, cases of complex speciation are
   common, due at least in part to the cyclical Pleistocene glacial history
   of the continent. Scrub-Jays in the genus Aphelocoma provide a useful
   case study in complex speciation because their range throughout North
   America is structured by phylogeographic barriers with multiple cases of
   secondary contact between divergent lineages. Here, we show that a
   comprehensive approach to genomic reconstruction of evolutionary
   history, i.e., synthesizing results from species delimitation, species
   tree reconstruction, demographic model testing, and tests for gene flow,
   is capable of clarifying evolutionary history despite complex
   speciation. We find concordant evidence across all statistical
   approaches for the distinctiveness of an endemic southern Mexico lineage
   (A. w. sumichrasti), culminating in support for the species status of
   this lineage under any commonly applied species concept. We also find
   novel genomic evidence for the species status of a Texas endemic lineage
   A. w. texana, for which equivocal species delimitation results were
   clarified by demographic modeling and spatially explicit models of gene
   flow. Finally, we find that complex signatures of both ancient and
   modern gene flow between the non-sister California Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma
   californica) and Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii) result
   in discordant gene trees throughout the species' genomes despite clear
   support for their overall isolation and species status. In sum, we find
   that a multi-faceted approach to genomic analysis can increase our
   understanding of complex speciation histories, even in well-studied
   groups. Given the emerging recognition that complex speciation is
   relatively commonplace, the comprehensive framework that we demonstrate
   for interrogation of species limits and evolutionary history using
   genomic data can provide a necessary roadmap for disentangling the
   impacts of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) to better
   understand the systematics of other groups with similarly complex
   evolutionary histories. {[}Gene flow; genomics; introgression;

Abstract = {How long does speciation take? The answer to this important question in
   evolutionary biology lies in the genetic difference not only among
   species, but also among lineages within each species. With the advance
   of genome sequencing in non-model organisms and the statistical tools to
   improve accuracy in inferring evolutionary histories among recently
   diverged lineages, we now have the lineage-level trees to answer these
   questions. However, we do not yet have an analytical tool for inferring
   speciation processes from these trees. What is needed is a model of
   speciation processes that generates both the trees and species
   identities of extant lineages. The model should allow calculation of the
   probability that certain lineages belong to certain species and have an
   evolutionary history consistent with the tree. Here, we propose such a
   model and test the model performance on both simulated data and real
   data. We show that maximum-likelihood estimates of the model are highly
   accurate and give estimates from real data that generate patterns
   consistent with observations. We discuss how to extend the model to
   account for different rates and types of speciation processes across
   lineages in a species group. By linking evolutionary processes on
   lineage level to species level, the model provides a new phylogenetic
   approach to study not just when speciation happened, but how speciation
   happened. {[}Micro-macro evolution; Protracted birth-death process;

Abstract = {The historical signal in nucleotide sequences becomes eroded over time
   by substitutions occurring repeatedly at the same sites. This
   phenomenon, known as substitution saturation, is recognized as one of
   the primary obstacles to deep-time phylogenetic inference using
   genome-scale data sets. We present a new test of substitution saturation
   and demonstrate its performance in simulated and empirical data. For
   some of the 36 empirical phylogenomic data sets that we examined, we
   detect substitution saturation in around 50\% of loci. We found that
   saturation tends to be flagged as problematic in loci with highly
   discordant phylogenetic signals across sites. Within each data set, the
   loci with smaller numbers of informative sites are more likely to be
   flagged as containing problematic levels of saturation. The entropy
   saturation test proposed here is sensitive to high evolutionary rates
   relative to the evolutionary timeframe, while also being sensitive to
   several factors known to mislead phylogenetic inference, including short
   internal branches relative to external branches, short nucleotide
   sequences, and tree imbalance. Our study demonstrates that excluding
   loci with substitution saturation can be an effective means of
   mitigating the negative impact of multiple substitutions on phylogenetic
   inferences. {[}Phylogenetic model performance; phylogenomics;

Title = {Unveiling the Patterns of Reticulated Evolutionary Processes with

Abstract = {Reticulation, caused by hybridization and allopolyploidization, is
   considered an important and frequent phenomenon in the evolution of
   numerous plant lineages. Although both processes represent important
   driving forces of evolution, they are mostly ignored in phylogenetic
   studies involving a large number of species. Indeed only a scattering of
   methods exists to recover a comprehensive reticulated evolutionary
   history for a broad taxon sampling. Among these methods, comparisons of
   topologies obtained from plastid markers with those from a few nuclear
   sequences are favored, even though they restrict in-depth studies of
   hybridization and polyploidization. The genus Rosa encompasses c. 150
   species widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere and
   represents a challenging taxonomic group in which hybridization and
   polyploidization are prominent. Our main objective was to develop a
   general framework that would take patterns of reticulation into account
   in the study of the phylogenetic relationships among Rosa species. Using
   amplicon sequencing, we targeted allele variation in the nuclear genome
   as well as haploid sequences in the chloroplast genome. We successfully
   recovered robust plastid and nuclear phylogenies and performed in-depth
   tests for several scenarios of hybridization using a maximum
   pseudo-likelihood approach on taxon subsets. Our diploid-first approach
   followed by hybrid and polyploid grafting resolved most of the
   evolutionary relationships among Rosa subgenera, sections, and selected
   species. Based on these results, we provide new directions for a future
   revision of the infrageneric classification in Rosa. The stepwise
   strategy proposed here can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic
   relationships of other challenging taxonomic groups with large numbers
   of hybrid and polyploid taxa. {[}Amplicon sequencing; interspecific

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent genomic analyses have highlighted parallel divergence in response
   to ecological gradients, but the extent to which altitude can underpin
   such repeated speciation remains unclear. Wing reduction and flight loss
   have apparently evolved repeatedly in montane insect assemblages and
   have been suggested as important drivers of hexapod diversification. We
   test this hypothesis using genomic analyses of a wide spread
   wing-polymorphic stonefly species complex in New Zealand. We identified
   over 50,000 polymorphic genetic markers generated across almost 200
   Zelandoperla fenestrata stonefly specimens using a newly generated
   plecopteran reference genome, to reveal widespread parallel speciation
   between sympatric full-winged and wing-reduced ecotypes. Rather than the
   existence of a single, widespread, flightless taxon (Zelandoperla
   pennulata), evolutionary genomic data reveal that wing-reduced upland
   lineages have speciated repeatedly and independently from full-winged Z.
   fenestrata. This repeated evolution of reproductive isolation between
   local ecotype pairs that lack mitochondrial DNA differentiation suggests
   that ecological speciation has evolved recently. Acluster of outlier
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected in independently wing-reduced
   lineages, tightly linked in an approximately 85 kb genomic region that
   includes the developmental ``supergene{''} doublesex, suggests that this
   ``island of divergence{''} may play a key role in rapid ecological
   speciation.},

Title = {Phase Resolution of Heterozygous Sites in Diploid Genomes is Important
   to Phylogenomic Analysis under the Multispecies Coalescent Model},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {334-352},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Genome sequencing projects routinely generate haploid consensus
   sequences from diploid genomes, which are effectively chimeric sequences
   with the phase at heterozygous sites resolved at random. The impact of
   phasing errors on phylogenomic analyses under the multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a computer
   simulation to evaluate the performance of four phase-resolution
   strategies (the true phase resolution, the diploid analytical
   integration algorithm which averages over all phase resolutions,
   computational phase resolution using the program PHASE, and random
   resolution) on estimation of the species tree and evolutionary
   parameters in analysis of multilocus genomic data under the MSC model.
   We found that species tree estimation is robust to phasing errors when
   species divergences were much older than average coalescent times but
   may be affected by phasing errors when the species tree is shallow.
   Estimation of parameters under the MSC model with and without
   introgression is affected by phasing errors. In particular, random phase
   resolution causes serious overestimation of population sizes for modern
   species and biased estimation of cross-species introgression
   probability. In general, the impact of phasing errors is greater when
   the mutation rate is higher, the data include more samples per species,
   and the species tree is shallower with recent divergences. Use of phased
   sequences inferred by the PHASE program produced small biases in
   parameter estimates. We analyze two real data sets, one of East Asian
   brown frogs and another of Rocky Mountains chipmunks, to demonstrate
   that heterozygote phase-resolution strategies have similar impacts on
   practical data analyses. We suggest that genome sequencing projects
   should produce unphased diploid genotype sequences if fully phased data
   are too challenging to generate, and avoid haploid consensus sequences,
   which have heterozygous sites phased at random. In case the analytical
   integration algorithm is computationally unfeasible, computational
   phasing prior to population genomic analyses is an acceptable
   alternative. {[}BPP; introgression; multispecies coalescent; phase;

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Rapid evolutionary radiations are among the most challenging
   phylogenetic problems, wherein different types of data (e.g., morphology
   and molecular) or genetic markers (e.g., nuclear and organelle) often
   yield inconsistent results. The tribe Arundinarieae, that is, the
   temperate bamboos, is a Glade of tetraploid originated 22 Ma and
   subsequently radiated in East Asia. Previous studies of Arundinarieae
   have found conflicting relationships and/or low support. Here, we obtain
   nuclear markers from ddRAD data for 213 Arundinarieae taxa and parallel
   sampling of chloroplast genomes from genome skimming for 147 taxa. We
   first assess the feasibility of using ddRAD-seq data for phylogenetic
   estimates of paleopolyploid and rapidly radiated lineages, optimize
   clustering thresholds, and analysis workflow for orthology
   identification. Reference-based ddRAD data assembly approaches perform
   well and yield strongly supported relationships that are generally
   concordant with morphology-based taxonomy. We recover five major
   lineages, two of which are notable (the pachymorph and leptomorph
   lineages), in that they correspond with distinct rhizome morphologies.
   By contrast, the phylogeny from chloroplast genomes differed
   significantly. Based on multiple lines of evidence, the ddRAD tree is
   favored as the best species tree estimation for temperate bamboos. Using
   a time-calibrated ddRAD tree, we find that Arundinarieae diversified
   rapidly around the mid-Miocene corresponding with intensification of the
   East Asian monsoon and the evolution of key innovations including the
   leptomorph rhizomes. Our results provide a highly resolved phylogeny of
   Arundinarieae, shed new light on the radiation and reticulate
   evolutionary history of this tribe, and provide an empirical example for
   the study of recalcitrant plant radiations.},

Title = {Craniodental and Postcranial Characters of Non-Avian Dinosauria Often
   Imply Different Trees},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of molecular sequence data, morphology
   still makes an important contribution to resolving the phylogeny of many
   groups, and is the only source of data for most fossils. Most
   systematists sample morphological characters as broadly as possible on
   the principle of total evidence. However, it is not uncommon for
   sampling to be focused on particular aspects of anatomy, either because
   characters therein are believed to be more informative, or because
   preservation biases restrict what is available. Empirically, the optimal
   trees from partitions of morphological data sets often represent
   significantly different hypotheses of relationships. Previous work on
   hard-part versus soft-part characters across animal phyla revealed
   significant differences in about a half of sampled studies. Similarly,
   studies of the craniodental versus postcranial characters of vertebrates
   revealed significantly different trees in about one-third of cases, with
   the highest rates observed in non-avian dinosaurs. We test whether this
   is a generality here with a much larger sample of 81 published data
   matrices across all major dinosaur groups. Using the incongruence length
   difference test and two variants of the incongruence relationship
   difference test, we found significant incongruence in about 50\% of
   cases. Incongruence is not uniformly distributed across major dinosaur
   clades, being highest (63\%) in Theropoda and lowest (25\%) in
   Thyreophora. As in previous studies, our partition tests show some
   sensitivity to matrix dimensions and the amount and distribution of
   missing entries. Levels of homoplasy and retained synapomorphy are
   similar between partitions, such that incongruence must partly reflect
   differences in patterns of homoplasy between partitions, which may
   itself be a function of modularity and mosaic evolution. Finally, we
   implement new tests to determine which partition yields trees most
   similar to those from the entire matrix. Despite no bias across
   dinosaurs overall, there are striking differences between major groups.
   The craniodental characters of Ornithischia and the postcranial
   characters of Saurischia yield trees most similar to the ``total
   evidence{''} trees derived from the entire matrix. Trees from these same
   character partitions also tend to be most stratigraphically congruent: a
   mutual consilience suggesting that those partitions yield more accurate
   trees.},

Title = {Probabilistic Species Tree Distances: Implementing the Multispecies
   Coalescent to Compare Species Trees Within the Same Model-Based
   Framework Used to Estimate Them},

Abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous use of statistical models for phylogenomic and
   population genomic inferences, this model-based rigor is rarely applied
   to post hoc comparison of trees. In a recent study, Garba et al. derived
   new methods for measuring the distance between two gene trees computed
   as the difference in their site pattern probability distributions.
   Unlike traditional metrics that compare trees solely in terms of
   geometry, these measures consider gene trees and associated parameters
   as probabilistic models that can be compared using standard information
   theoretic approaches. Consequently, probabilistic measures of
   phylogenetic tree distance can be far more informative than simply
   comparisons of topology and/or branch lengths alone. However, in their
   current form, these distance measures are not suitable for the
   comparison of species tree models in the presence of gene tree
   heterogeneity. Here, we demonstrate an approach for how the theory of
   Garba et al. (2018), which is based on gene tree distances, can be
   extended naturally to the comparison of species tree models.
   Multispecies coalescent (MSC) models parameterize the discrete
   probability distribution of gene trees conditioned upon a species tree
   with a particular topology and set of divergence times (in coalescent
   units), and thus provide a framework for measuring distances between
   species tree models in terms of their corresponding gene tree topology
   probabilities. We describe the computation of probabilistic species tree
   distances in the context of standard MSC models, which assume complete
   genetic isolation postspeciation, as well as recent theoretical
   extensions to the MSC in the form of network-based MSC models that relax
   this assumption and permit hybridization among taxa. We demonstrate
   these metrics using simulations and empirical species tree estimates and
   discuss both the benefits and limitations of these approaches. We make
   our species tree distance approach available as an R package called
   pSTDistanceR, for open use by the community.},

Title = {Evidence that Myotis lucifugus ``Subspecies{''} are Five Nonsister
   Species, Despite Gene Flow},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {756-769},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While genetic exchange between nonsister species was traditionally
   considered to be rare in mammals, analyses of molecular data in multiple
   systems suggest that it may be common. Interspecific gene flow, if
   present, is problematic for phylogenetic inference, particularly for
   analyses near the species level. Here, we explore how to detect and
   account for gene flow during phylogeny estimation using data from a
   clade of North American Myotis bats where previous results have led
   researchers to suspect that gene flow among lineages is present. Initial
   estimates of phylogenetic networks and species trees indicate that
   subspecies described within Myotis lucifugus are paraphyletic. In order
   to explore the extent to which gene flow is likely to interfere with
   phylogeny estimation, we use posterior predictive simulation and a novel
   Approximate Bayesian Computation approach based on gene tree distances.
   The former indicates that the species tree model is a poor fit to the
   data, and the latter provides evidence that a species tree with gene
   flow is a better fit. Taken together, we present evidence that the
   currently recognized M. lucifugus subspecies are paraphyletic, exchange
   alleles with other Myotis species in regions of secondary contact, and
   should be considered independent evolutionary lineages despite their
   morphological similarity.},

Title = {Variation Across Mitochondrial Gene Trees Provides Evidence for
   Systematic Error: How Much Gene Tree Variation Is Biological?},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {847-860},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of large genomic data sets in phylogenetics has highlighted
   extensive topological variation across genes. Much of this discordance
   is assumed to result from biological processes. However, variation among
   gene trees can also be a consequence of systematic error driven by poor
   model fit, and the relative importance of biological vs. methodological
   factors in explaining gene tree variation is a major unresolved
   question. Using mitochondrial genomes to control for biological causes
   of gene tree variation, we estimate the extent of gene tree discordance
   driven by systematic error and employ posterior prediction to highlight
   the role of model fit in producing this discordance. We find that the
   amount of discordance among mitochondrial gene trees is similar to the
   amount of discordance found in other studies that assume only biological
   causes of variation. This similarity suggests that the role of
   systematic error in generating gene tree variation is underappreciated
   and critical evaluation of fit between assumed models and the data used
   for inference is important for the resolution of unresolved phylogenetic
   questions.},

Title = {Inferring Phylogenetic Networks Using PhyloNet},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {735-740},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {PhyloNet was released in 2008 as a software package for representing and
   analyzing phylogenetic networks. At the time of its release, the main
   functionalities in PhyloNet consisted of measures for comparing network
   topologies and a single heuristic for reconciling gene trees with a
   species tree. Since then, PhyloNet has grown significantly. The software
   package now includes a wide array of methods for inferring phylogenetic
   networks from data sets of unlinked loci while accounting for both
   reticulation (e.g., hybridization) and incomplete lineage sorting. In
   particular, PhyloNet now allows for maximum parsimony, maximum
   likelihood, and Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from gene
   tree estimates. Furthermore, Bayesian inference directly from sequence
   data (sequence alignments or biallelic markers) is implemented. Maximum
   parsimony is based on an extension of the ``minimizing deep
   coalescences{''} criterion to phylogenetic networks, whereas maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian inference are based on the multispecies network
   coalescent. All methods allow for multiple individuals per species. As
   computing the likelihood of a phylogenetic network is computationally
   hard, PhyloNet allows for evaluation and inference of networks using a
   pseudolikelihood measure. PhyloNet summarizes the results of thevarious
   analyzes and generates phylogenetic networks in the extended Newick
   format that is readily viewable by existing visualization software.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in modern
   evolutionary biology. Phylogenetic methods reconstruct the evolutionary
   relationships among organisms, whereas phylodynamic approaches reveal
   the underlying diversification processes that lead to the observed
   relationships. These two fields have many practical applications in
   disciplines as diverse as epidemiology, developmental biology,
   palaeontology, ecology, and linguistics. The combination of increasingly
   large genetic data sets and increases in computing power is facilitating
   the development of more sophisticated phylogenetic and phylodynamic
   methods. Big data sets allow us to answer complex questions. However,
   since the required analyses are highly specific to the particular data
   set and question, a black-box method is not sufficient anymore. Instead,
   biologists are required to be actively involved with modeling decisions
   during data analysis. The modular design of the Bayesian phylogenetic
   software package BEAST 2 enables, and in fact enforces, this
   involvement. At the same time, the modular design enables computational
   biology groups to develop new methods at a rapid rate. A thorough
   understanding of the models and algorithms used by inference software is
   a critical prerequisite for successful hypothesis formulation and
   assessment. In particular, there is a need for more readily available
   resources aimed at helping interested scientists equip themselves with
   the skills to confidently use cutting-edge phylogenetic analysis
   software. These resources will also benefit researchers who do not have
   access to similar courses or training at their home institutions. Here,
   we introduce the ``Taming the Beast{''}
   (https://taming-the-beast.github.io/) resource, which was developed as
   part of a workshop series bearing the same name, to facilitate the usage
   of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2.},

Abstract = {Patterns of specificity among symbiotic partners are key to a
   comprehensive understanding of the evolution of symbiotic systems.
   Specificity of mutualistic partners, within a widespread monophyletic
   group for which all species are sampled has rarely been explored. Here,
   we assess the level of specificity between the cosmopolitan
   lichen-forming fungus (mycobiont) from the genus Peltigera, section
   Polydactylon, and its cyanobacterial partner Nostoc (cyanobiont). The
   mycobiont and cyanobiont phylogenies are inferred from five nuclear loci
   and the rbcLX region, respectively. These sequences were obtained from
   206 lichen thalli, representing ca. 40 closely related Peltigera species
   sampled worldwide, doubling the number of known species in this group.
   We found a broad spectrum of specificity for both partners ranging from
   strict specialists to generalists. Overall, mycobionts are more
   specialized than cyanobionts by associating mostly with one or a few
   Nostoc phylogroups, whereas most cyanobionts associate frequently with
   several Peltigera species. Specialist mycobionts are older than
   generalists, supporting the hypothesis that specialization of mycobionts
   to one or few cyanobionts, is favored through time in geographic areas
   where species have been established for long periods of time. The
   relatively recent colonization of a new geographic area (Central and
   South America) by members of section Polydactylon is associated with a
   switch to a generalist pattern of association and an increased
   diversification rate by the fungal partner, suggesting that switches to
   generalism are rare events that are advantageous in new environments. We
   detected higher genetic diversity in generalist mycobionts. We also
   found that Peltigera species specialized on a single Nostoc phylogroup
   have narrower geographical distributions compared with generalist
   species.},

Title = {Hidden Phylogenomic Signal Helps Elucidate Arsenurine Silkmoth Phylogeny
   and the Evolution of Body Size and Wing Shape Trade-Offs},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {One of the key objectives in biological research is understanding how
   evolutionary processes have produced Earth's diversity. A critical step
   toward revealing these processes is an investigation of evolutionary
   tradeoffs-that is, the opposing pressures of multiple selective forces.
   For millennia, nocturnal moths have had to balance successful flight, as
   they search for mates or host plants, with evading bat predators.
   However, the potential for evolutionary trade-offs between wing shape
   and body size are poorly understood. In this study, we used
   phylogenomics and geometric morphometrics to examine the evolution of
   wing shape in the wild silkmoth subfamily Arsenurinae (Saturniidae) and
   evaluate potential evolutionary relationships between body size and wing
   shape. The phylogeny was inferred based on 782 loci from target capture
   data of 42 arsenurine species representing all 10 recognized genera.
   After detecting in our data one of the most vexing problems in
   phylogenetic inference-a region of a tree that possesses short branches
   and no ``support{''} for relationships (i.e., a polytomy), we looked for
   hidden phylogenomic signal (i.e., inspecting differing phylogenetic
   inferences, alternative support values, quartets, and phylogenetic
   networks) to better illuminate the most probable generic relationships
   within the subfamily. We found there are putative evolutionary
   trade-offs between wing shape, body size, and the interaction of fore-
   and hindwing (HW) shape. Namely, body size tends to decrease with
   increasing HW length but increases as forewing (FW) shape becomes more
   complex. Additionally, the type of HW (i.e., tail or no tail) a lineage
   possesses has a significant effect on the complexity of FW shape. We
   outline possible selective forces driving the complex HW shapes that
   make Arsenurinae, and silkmoths as a whole, so charismatic. {[}Anchored

Title = {Gene Tree Estimation Error with Ultraconserved Elements: An Empirical
   Study on Pseudapis Bees},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {803-821},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Summarizing individual gene trees to species phylogenies using two-step
   coalescent methods is now a standard strategy in the field of
   phylogenomics. However, practical implementations of summary methods
   suffer from gene tree estimation error, which is caused by various
   biological and analytical factors. Greatly understudied is the choice of
   gene tree inference method and downstream effects on species tree
   estimation for empirical data sets. To better understand the impact of
   this method choice on gene and species tree accuracy, we compare gene
   trees estimated through four widely used programs under different
   model-selection criteria: PhyloBayes, MrBayes, IQ-Tree, and RAxML. We
   study their performance in the phylogenomic framework of >800
   ultraconserved elements from the bee subfamily Nomiinae (Halictidae).
   Our taxon sampling focuses on the genus Pseudapis, a distinct lineage
   with diverse morphological features, but contentious morphology-based
   taxonomic classifications and no molecular phylogenetic guidance. We
   approximate topological accuracy of gene trees by assessing their
   ability to recover two uncontroversial, monophyletic groups, and compare
   branch lengths of individual trees using the stemminess metric (the
   relative length of internal branches). We further examine different
   strategies of removing uninformative loci and the collapsing of weakly
   supported nodes into polytomies. We then summarize gene trees with
   ASTRAL and compare resulting species phylogenies, including comparisons
   to concatenation-based estimates. Gene trees obtained with the
   reversible jump model search in MrBayes were most concordant on average
   and all Bayesian methods yielded gene trees with better stemminess
   values. The only gene tree estimation approach whose ASTRAL summary
   trees consistently produced the most likely correct topology, however,
   was IQ-Tree with automated model designation (ModelFinder program). We
   discuss these findings and provide practical advice on gene tree
   estimation for summary methods. Lastly, we establish the first
   phylogeny-informed classification for Pseudapis s. 1. and map the
   distribution of distinct morphological features of the group.},

Title = {Color Polymorphism is a Driver of Diversification in the Lizard Family
   Lacertidae},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Color polymorphism-two or more heritable color phenotypes maintained
   within a single breeding population-is an extreme type of intraspecific
   diversity widespread across the tree of life. Color polymorphism is
   hypothesized to be an engine for speciation, where morph loss or
   divergence between distinct color morphs within a species results in the
   rapid evolution of new lineages, and thus, color polymorphic lineages
   are expected to display elevated diversification rates. Multiple species
   in the lizard family Lacertidae are color polymorphic, making them an
   ideal group to investigate the evolutionary history of this trait and
   its influence on macroevolution. Here, we produce a comprehensive
   species-level phylogeny of the lizard family Lacertidae to reconstruct
   the evolutionary history of color polymorphism and test if color
   polymorphism has been a driver of diversification. Accounting for
   phylogenetic uncertainty with multiple phylogenies and simulation
   studies, we estimate an ancient origin of color polymorphism (111 Ma)
   within the Lacertini tribe (subfamily Lacertinae). Color polymorphism
   most likely evolved few times in the Lacertidae and has been lost at a
   much faster rate than gained. Evolutionary transitions to color
   polymorphism are associated with shifts in increased net diversification
   rate in this family of lizards. Taken together, our empirical results
   support long-standing theoretical expectations that color polymorphism
   is a driver of diversification.},

Volume = {70},

Pages = {1061-1075},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) are commonly used to study
   evolution and adaptation. However, frequently used PCMs for discrete
   traits mishandle single evolutionary transitions. They erroneously
   detect correlated evolution in these situations. For example, hair and
   mammary glands cannot be said to have evolved in a correlated fashion
   because each evolved only once in mammals, but a commonly used model
   (Pagel's Discrete) statistically supports correlated (dependent)
   evolution. Using simulations, we find that rate parameter estimation,
   which is central for model selection, is poor in these scenarios due to
   small effective (evolutionary) sample sizes of independent character
   state change. Pagel's Discrete model also tends to favor dependent
   evolution in these scenarios, in part, because it forces evolution
   through state combinations unobserved in the tip data. This model
   prohibits simultaneous dual transitions along branches. Models with
   underlying continuous data distributions (e.g., Threshold and GLMM) are
   less prone to favor correlated evolution but are still susceptible when
   evolutionary sample sizes are small. We provide three general
   recommendations for researchers who encounter these common situations:
   i) create study designs that evaluate a priori hypotheses and maximize
   evolutionary sample sizes; ii) assess the suitability of evolutionary
   models-for discrete traits, we introduce the phylogenetic imbalance
   ratio; and iii) evaluate evolutionary hypotheses with a consilience of
   evidence from disparate fields, like biogeography and developmental
   biology. Consilience plays a central role in hypothesis testing within
   the historical sciences where experiments are difficult or impossible to
   conduct, such as many hypotheses about correlated evolution. These
   recommendations are useful for investigations that employ any type of
   PCM.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Analysis of Concatenated Ultraconserved Elements Reveals

Abstract = {The fairy wrasses (genus Cirrhilabrus) are among the most successful of
   the extant wrasse lineages (Teleostei: Labridae), with their 61 species
   accounting for nearly 10 of the family. Although species complexes
   within the genus have been diagnosed on the basis of coloration patterns
   and synapomorphies, attempts to resolve evolutionary relationships among
   these groups using molecular and morphological data have largely been
   unsuccessful. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach with a data set
   comprising 991 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and mitochondrial COI to
   uncover the evolutionary history and patterns of temporal and spatial
   diversification of the fairy wrasses. Our analyses of phylogenetic
   signal suggest that most gene-tree incongruence is caused by estimation
   error, leading to poor resolution in a summary-coalescent analysis of
   the data. In contrast, analyses of concatenated sequences are able to
   resolve the major relationships of Cirrhilabrus. We determine the
   placements of species that were previously regarded as incertae sedis
   and find evidence for the nesting of Conniella, an unusual, monotypic
   genus, within Cirrhilabrus. Our relaxed-clock dating analysis indicates
   that the major divergences within the genus occurred around the
   Miocene-Pliocene boundary, followed by extensive cladogenesis of species
   complexes in the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Biogeographic reconstruction
   suggests that the fairy wrasses emerged within the Coral Triangle, with
   episodic fluctuations of sea levels during glacial cycles coinciding
   with shallow divergence events but providing few opportunities for more
   widespread dispersal. Our study demonstrates both the resolving power
   and limitations of UCEs across shallow timescales where there is
   substantial estimation error in individual gene trees.},

Abstract = {Amino acid substitution models play a crucial role in phylogenetic
   analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate
   amino acid substitution models; however, they are typically complicated
   and slow. In this article, we propose QMaker, a new ML method to
   estimate a general time-reversible Q matrix from a large protein data
   set consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines an
   efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling
   themodel heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate
   mixturemodels among sites. We provide QMaker as a user-friendly function
   in the IQ-TREEsoftware package (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the
   use of multiple CPU cores so that biologists can easily estimate amino
   acid substitution models from their own protein alignments. We used
   QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino acid substitution models
   from the current Pfam database as well as five clade-specific models for
   mammals, birds, insects, yeasts, and plants. Our results show that the
   new models considerably improve the fit between model and data and in
   some cases influence the inference of phylogenetic tree topologies.},

Abstract = {Phylogenomic data from a rapidly increasing number of studies provide
   new evidence for resolving relationships in recently radiated clades,
   but they also pose new challenges for inferring evolutionary histories.
   Most existing methods for reconstructing phylogenetic hypotheses rely
   solely on algorithms that only consider incomplete lineage sorting (ILS)
   as a cause of intra- or intergenomic discordance. Here, we utilize a
   variety of methods, including those to infer phylogenetic networks, to
   account for both ILS and introgression as a cause for nuclear and
   cytoplasmic-nuclear discordance using phylogenomic data from the
   recently radiated flowering plant genus Polemonium (Polemoniaceae), an
   ecologically diverse genus in Western North America with known and
   suspected gene flow between species. We find evidence for widespread
   discordance among nuclear loci that can be explained by both ILS and
   reticulate evolution in the evolutionary history of Polemonium.
   Furthermore, the histories of organellar genomes show strong discordance
   with the inferred species tree from the nuclear genome. Discordance
   between the nuclear and plastid genome is not completely explained by
   ILS, and only one case of discordance is explained by detected
   introgression events. Our results suggest that multiple processes have
   been involved in the evolutionary history of Polemonium and that the
   plastid genome does not accurately reflect species relationships. We
   discuss several potential causes for this cytoplasmic-nuclear
   discordance, which emerging evidence suggests is more widespread across
   the Tree of Life than previously thought.},

Title = {A Simulation-Based Evaluation of Tip-Dating Under the Fossilized
   Birth-Death Process},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {325-344},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bayesian molecular dating is widely used to study evolutionary
   timescales. This procedure usually involves phylogenetic analysis of
   nucleotide sequence data, with fossil-based calibrations applied as age
   constraints on internal nodes of the tree. An alternative approach is
   tip-dating, which explicitly includes fossil data in the analysis. This
   can be done, for example, through the joint analysis of molecular data
   from present-day taxa and morphological data from both extant and fossil
   taxa. In the context of tip-dating, an important development has been
   the fossilized birth-death process, which allows non-contemporaneous
   tips and sampled ancestors while providing a model of lineage
   diversification for the prior on the tree topology and internal node
   times. However, tip-dating with fossils faces a number of considerable
   challenges, especially, those associated with fossil sampling and
   evolutionary models for morphological characters. We conducted a
   simulation study to evaluate the performance of tip-dating using the
   fossilized birth-death model. We simulated fossil occurrences and the
   evolution of nucleotide sequences and morphological characters under a
   wide range of conditions. Our analyses of these data show that the
   number and the maximum age of fossil occurrences have a greater
   influence than the degree of among-lineage rate variation or the number
   of morphological characters on estimates of node times and the tree
   topology. Tip-dating with the fossilized birth-death model generally
   performs well in recovering the relationships among extant taxa but has
   difficulties in correctly placing fossil taxa in the tree and
   identifying the number of sampled ancestors. The method yields accurate
   estimates of the ages of the root and crown group, although the
   precision of these estimates varies with the probability of fossil
   occurrence. The exclusion of morphological characters results in a
   slight overestimation of node times, whereas the exclusion of nucleotide
   sequences has a negative impact on inference of the tree topology. Our
   results provide an overview of the performance of tip-dating using the
   fossilized birth-death model, which will inform further development of
   the method and its application to key questions in evolutionary biology.},

Title = {A Critical Appraisal of the Placement of Xiphosura (Chelicerata) with

Abstract = {Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) are traditionally regarded as sister group
   to the clade of terrestrial chelicerates (Arachnida). This hypothesis
   has been challenged by recent phylogenomic analyses, but the
   non-monophyly of Arachnida has consistently been disregarded as
   artifactual. We re-evaluated the placement of Xiphosura among
   chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic data set to date,
   expanding outgroup sampling, and including data from whole genome
   sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in the placement of some
   arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within
   Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is
   apparent that the radiation of arachnids is an old one and occurred over
   a brief period of time, resulting in several consecutive short
   internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees to
   explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of
   horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were
   evaluated, as well as the effects of fast-evolving partitions and the
   dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that
   the placement of horseshoe crabs cannot be explained by missing data,
   compositional biases, saturation, or ILS. Interrogation of the
   phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived
   placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses
   support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic
   arachnids, comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long-standing
   paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations
   of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat. Future studies
   testing chelicerate relationships should approach the task with a
   sampling strategy where the monophyly of Arachnida is not held as the
   premise.},

Abstract = {Organelle genome fragmentation has been found in a wide range of
   eukaryotic lineages; however, its use in phylogenetic reconstruction has
   not been demonstrated. We explored the use of mitochondrial (mt) genome
   fragmentation in resolving the controversial suborder-level phylogeny of
   parasitic lice (order Phthiraptera). There are approximately 5000
   species of parasitic lice in four suborders (Amblycera, Ischnocera,
   Rhynchophthirina, and Anoplura), which infest mammals and birds. The
   phylogenetic relationships among these suborders are unresolved despite
   decades of studies. We sequenced the mt genomes of eight species of
   parasitic lice and compared them with 17 other species of parasitic lice
   sequenced previously. We found that the typical single-chromosome mt
   genome is retained in the lice of birds but fragmented into many
   minichromosomes in the lice of eutherian mammals. The shared derived
   feature ofmt genomefragmentation unites the eutherian mammal lice of
   Ischnocera (family Trichodectidae) with Anoplura and Rhynchophthirina to
   the exclusion of the bird lice of Ischnocera (family Philopteridae). The
   novel clade, namelyMitodivisia, is also supported by phylogenetic
   analysis of mt genome and cox1 gene sequences. Our results demonstrate,
   for the first time, that organelle genome fragmentation is informative
   for resolving controversial high-level phylogenies.},

Title = {Multiple Sequence Alignment Averaging Improves Phylogeny Reconstruction},

Abstract = {The classic methodology of inferring a phylogenetic tree from sequence
   data is composed of two steps. First, a multiple sequence alignment
   (MSA) is computed. Then, a tree is reconstructed assuming the MSA is
   correct. Yet, inferred MSAs were shown to be inaccurate and alignment
   errors reduce tree inference accuracy. It was previously proposed that
   filtering unreliable alignment regions can increase the accuracy of tree
   inference. However, it was also demonstrated that the benefit of this
   filtering is often obscured by the resulting loss of phylogenetic
   signal. In this work we explore an approach, in which instead of relying
   on a single MSA, we generate a large set of alternative MSAs and
   concatenate them into a single SuperMSA. By doing so, we account for
   phylogenetic signals contained in columns that are not present in the
   single MSA computed by alignment algorithms. Using simulations, we
   demonstrate that this approach results, on average, in more accurate
   trees compared to 1) using an unfiltered MSA and 2) using a single MSA
   with weights assigned to columns according to their reliability. Next,
   we explore in which regions of the MSA space our approach is expected to
   be beneficial. Finally, we provide a simple criterion for deciding
   whether or not the extra effort of computing a SuperMSA and inferring a
   tree from it is beneficial. Based on these assessments, we expect our
   methodology to be useful for many cases in which diverged sequences are
   analyzed. The option to generate such a SuperMSA is available at

Title = {A Penalized Likelihood Framework for High-Dimensional Phylogenetic
   Comparative Methods and an Application to New-World Monkeys Brain
   Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Working with high-dimensional phylogenetic comparative data sets is
   challenging because likelihood-based multivariate methods suffer from
   low statistical performances as the number of traits p approaches the
   number of species n and because some computational complications occur
   when p exceeds n. Alternative phylogenetic comparative methods have
   recently been proposed to deal with the large p small n scenario but
   their use and performances are limited. Herein, we develop a penalized
   likelihood (PL) framework to deal with high-dimensional comparative data
   sets. We propose various penalizations and methods for selecting the
   intensity of the penalties. We apply this general framework to the
   estimation of parameters (the evolutionary trait covariance matrix and
   parameters of the evolutionary model) and model comparison for the
   high-dimensional multivariate Brownian motion (BM), Early-burst (EB),
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), and Pagel's lambda models. We show using
   simulations that our PL approach dramatically improves the estimation of
   evolutionary trait covariance matrices and model parameters when p
   approaches n, and allows for their accurate estimation when p equals or
   exceeds n. In addition, we show that PL models can be efficiently
   compared using generalized information criterion (GIC). We implement
   these methods, as well as the related estimation of ancestral states and
   the computation of phylogenetic principal component analysis in the R
   package RPANDA and mvMORPH. Finally, we illustrate the utility of the
   new proposed framework by evaluating evolutionary models fit, analyzing
   integration patterns, and reconstructing evolutionary trajectories for a
   high-dimensional 3D data set of brain shape in the New World monkeys. We
   find a clear support for an EB model suggesting an early diversification
   of brain morphology during the ecological radiation of the clade. PL
   offers an efficient way to deal with high-dimensional multivariate
   comparative data.},

Title = {Testing the Role of the Red Queen and Court Jester as Drivers of the
   Macroevolution of Apollo Butterflies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {940-964},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In macroevolution, the Red Queen (RQ) model posits that biodiversity
   dynamics depend mainly on species-intrinsic biotic factors such as
   interactions among species or life-history traits, while the Court
   Jester (CJ) model states that extrinsic environmental abiotic factors
   have a stronger role. Until recently, a lack of relevant methodological
   approaches has prevented the unraveling of contributions from these 2
   types of factors to the evolutionary history of a lineage. Herein, we
   take advantage of the rapid development of new macroevolution models
   that tie diversification rates to changes in paleoenvironmental
   (extrinsic) and/or biotic (intrinsic) factors. We inferred a robust and
   fully-sampled species-level phylogeny, as well as divergence times and
   ancestral geographic ranges, and related these to the radiation of
   Apollo butterflies (Parnassiinae) using both extant (molecular) and
   extinct (fossil/morphological) evidence. We tested whether their
   diversification dynamics are better explained by an RQ or CJ hypothesis,
   by assessing whether speciation and extinction were mediated by
   diversity-dependence (niche filling) and clade-dependent host-plant
   association (RQ) or by large-scale continuous changes in extrinsic
   factors such as climate or geology (CJ). For the RQ hypothesis, we found
   significant differences in speciation rates associated with different
   host-plants but detected no sign of diversity-dependence. For CJ, the
   role of Himalayan-Tibetan building was substantial for biogeography but
   not a driver of high speciation, while positive dependence between warm
   climate and speciation/extinction was supported by continuously varying
   maximum-likelihood models. We find that rather than a single factor, the
   joint effect of multiple factors (biogeography, species traits,
   environmental drivers, and mass extinction) is responsible for current
   diversity patterns and that the same factor might act differently across
   clades, emphasizing the notion of opportunity. This study confirms the
   importance of the confluence of several factors rather than single
   explanations in modeling diversification within lineages.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1091-1109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As a result of the process of descent with modification, closely related
   species tend to be similar to one another in a myriad different ways. In
   statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will
   not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their
   introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have
   been framed as a solution to this problem. In this article, we argue
   that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has
   this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are
   doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very
   thing we sought to build defenses against-unreplicated evolutionary
   events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the
   susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring problem in
   comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated
   controversies. In each Case Study, we propose a potential solution to
   the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they
   share a common theme: unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven
   approaches (which we term ``phylogenetic natural history{''}) to
   disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the
   factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has,
   at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal
   hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to
   re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this
   way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what
   evidence supports our claims.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {821-829},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The analysis of hybridization and gene flow among closely related taxa
   is a common goal for researchers studying speciation and phylogeography.
   Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern
   frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models
   that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the
   detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities
   exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees
   within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches
   of the gene trees. For certain models, site patterns are predicted to
   occur in equal frequency (i.e., their difference is 0), producing a set
   of functions called phylogenetic invariants. In this article, we
   introduce HyDe, a software package for detecting hybridization using
   phylogenetic invariants arising under the coalescent model with
   hybridization. HyDe is written in Python and can be used interactively
   or through the command line using pre-packaged scripts. We demonstrate
   the use of HyDe on simulated data, as well as on two empirical data sets
   from the literature. We focus in particular on identifying individual
   hybrids within population samples and on distinguishing between hybrid
   speciation and gene flow.},

Title = {To Include or Not to Include: The Impact of Gene Filtering on Species
   Tree Estimation Methods},

Abstract = {With the increasing availability of whole genome data, many species
   trees are being constructed from hundreds to thousands of loci. Although
   concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood is a standard approach
   for estimating species trees, it does not account for gene tree
   heterogeneity, which can occur due to many biological processes, such as
   incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent species tree estimation methods,
   many of which are statistically consistent in the presence of incomplete
   lineage sorting, include Bayesian methods that coestimate the gene trees
   and the species tree, summary methods that compute the species tree by
   combining estimated gene trees, and site-based methods that infer the
   species tree from site patterns in the alignments of different loci. Due
   to concerns that poor quality loci will reduce the accuracy of estimated
   species trees, many recent phylogenomic studies have removed or filtered
   genes on the basis of phylogenetic signal and/or missing data prior to
   inferring species trees; little is known about the performance of
   species tree estimation methods when gene filtering is performed. We
   examine how incomplete lineage sorting, phylogenetic signal of
   individual loci, and missing data affect the absolute and the relative
   accuracy of species tree estimation methods and show how these
   properties affect methods' responses to gene filtering strategies. In
   particular, summary methods (ASTRAL-II, ASTRID, and MP-EST), a
   site-based coalescent method (SVDquartets within PAUP{*}), and an
   unpartitioned concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood (RAxML)
   were evaluated on a heterogeneous collection of simulated multilocus
   data sets, and the following trends were observed. Filtering genes based
   on gene tree estimation error improved the accuracy of the summary
   methods when levels of incomplete lineage sorting were low to moderate
   but did not benefit the summary methods under higher levels of
   incomplete lineage sorting, unless gene tree estimation error was also
   extremely high (a model condition with few replicates). Neither
   SVDquartets nor concatenation analysis using RAxML benefited from
   filtering genes on the basis of gene tree estimation error. Finally,
   filtering genes based on missing data was either neutral (i.e., did not
   impact accuracy) or else reduced the accuracy of all five methods. By
   providing insight into the consequences of gene filtering, we offer
   recommendations for estimating species tree in the presence of
   incomplete lineage sorting and reconcile seemingly conflicting
   observations made in prior studies regarding the impact of gene
   filtering.},

Title = {Recoding Amino Acids to a Reduced Alphabet may Increase or Decrease
   Phylogenetic Accuracy},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {723-737},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Common molecular phylogenetic characteristics such as long branches and
   compositional heterogeneity can be problematic for phylogenetic
   reconstruction when using amino acid data. Recoding alignments to
   reduced alphabets before phylogenetic analysis has often been used both
   to explore and potentially decrease the effect of such problems. We
   tested the effectiveness of this strategy on topological accuracy using
   simulated data on four-taxon trees. We simulated alignments in
   phylogenetically challenging ways to test the phylogenetic accuracy of
   analyses using various recoding strategies together with commonly used
   homogeneous models. We tested three recoding methods based on amino acid
   exchangeability, and another recoding method based on lowering the
   compositional heterogeneity among alignment sequences as measured by the
   Chi-squared statistic. Our simulation results show that on trees with
   long branches where sequences approach saturation, accuracy was not
   greatly affected by exchangeability-based recodings, but
   Chi-squared-based recoding decreased accuracy. We then simulated
   sequences with different kinds of compositional heterogeneity over the
   tree. Recoding often increased accuracy on such alignments.
   Exchangeability-based recoding was rarely worse than not recoding, and
   often considerably better. Recoding based on lowering the Chi-squared
   value improved accuracy in some cases but not in others, suggesting that
   low compositional heterogeneity by itself is not sufficient to increase
   accuracy in the analysis of these alignments. We also simulated
   alignments using site-specific amino acid profiles, making sequences
   that had compositional heterogeneity over alignment sites.
   Exchangeability-based recoding coupled with site-homogeneous models had
   poor accuracy for these data sets but Chi-squared-based recoding on
   these alignments increased accuracy. We then simulated data sets that
   were compositionally both site- and tree-heterogeneous, like many real
   data sets. The effect on the accuracy of recoding such doubly
   problematic data sets varied widely, depending on the type of
   compositional tree heterogeneity and on the recoding scheme.
   Interestingly, analysis of unrecoded compositionally heterogeneous
   alignments with the NDCH or CAT models was generally more accurate than
   homogeneous analysis, whether recoded or not. Overall, our results
   suggest that making trees for recoded amino acid data sets can be
   useful, but they need to be interpreted cautiously as part of a more
   comprehensive analysis. The use of better-fitting models like NDCH and
   CAT, which directly account for the patterns in the data, may offer a
   more promising long-term solution for analyzing empirical data.

Title = {Ghost Lineages Highly Influence the Interpretation of Introgression
   Tests},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 16},
Abstract = {Most species are extinct, those that are not are often unknown.
   Sequenced and sampled species are often a minority of known ones. Past
   evolutionary events involving horizontal gene flow, such as horizontal
   gene transfer, hybridization, introgression, and admixture, are
   therefore likely to involve ``ghosts,{''} that is extinct, unknown, or
   unsampled lineages. The existence of these ghost lineages is widely
   acknowledged, but their possible impact on the detection of gene flow
   and on the identification of the species involved is largely overlooked.
   It is generally considered as a possible source of error that, with
   reasonable approximation, can be ignored. We explore the possible
   influence of absent species on an evolutionary study by quantifying the
   effect of ghost lineages on introgression as detected by the popular
   D-statistic method. We show from simulated data that under certain
   frequently encountered conditions, the donors and recipients of
   horizontal gene flow can be wrongly identified if ghost lineages are not
   taken into account. In particular, having a distant outgroup, which is
   usually recommended, leads to an increase in the error probability and
   to false interpretations in most cases. We conclude that introgression
   from ghost lineages should be systematically considered as an
   alternative possible, even probable, scenario. {[}ABBA-BABA;

Title = {Different Evolutionary Pathways Lead to Incomplete Convergence of
   Elongate Body Shapes in Carnivoran Mammals},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Although convergence is often recognized as a ubiquitous feature across
   the Tree of Life, whether the underlying traits also exhibit similar
   evolutionary pathways towards convergent forms puzzles biologists. In
   carnivoran mammals, ``elongate,{''} ``slender,{''} and ``long{''} are
   often used to describe and even to categorize mustelids (martens,
   polecats, and weasels), herpestids (mongooses), viverrids (civets and
   genets), and other carnivorans together. But just how similar these
   carnivorans are and whether there is convergence in the morphological
   component that contribute to elongation has never been assessed. Here, I
   found that these qualitatively described elongate carnivorans exhibited
   incomplete convergence towards elongate bodies compared to other
   terrestrial carnivorans. In contrast, the morphological components
   underlying body shape variation do not exhibit convergence despite
   evidence that these components are more elongate in elongate carnivorans
   compared to nonelongate carnivorans. Furthermore, these components also
   exhibited shorter but different phylogenetic half-lives towards more
   elongate adaptive peaks, indicating that different selective pressures
   can create multiple pathways to elongation. Incorporating the fossil
   record will facilitate further investigation of whether body elongation
   evolved adaptively or if it is simply a retained ancestral
   trait.{[}Axial skeleton; body elongation; convergent evolution;

Title = {Morphology-Based Identification of Bemisia tabaci Cryptic Species
   Puparia via Embedded Group-Contrast Convolution Neural Network Analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1095-1109},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {The Bemisia tabaci species complex is a group of tropical-subtropical
   hemipterans, some species of which have achieved global distribution
   over the past 150 years. Several species are regarded currently as among
   the world's most pernicious agricultural pests, causing a variety of
   damage types via direct feeding and plant-disease transmission. Long
   considered a single variable species, genetic, molecular and
   reproductive compatibility analyses have revealed that this
   ``species{''} is actually a complex of between 24 and 48 morphologically
   cryptic species. However, determinations of which populations represent
   distinct species have been hampered by a failure to integrate
   genetic/molecular and morphological species-diagnoses. This, in turn,
   has limited the success of outbreak-control and eradication programs.
   Previous morphological investigations, based on traditional and
   geometric morphometric procedures, have had limited success in
   identifying genetic/molecular species from patterns of morphological
   variation in puparia. As an alternative, our investigation focused on
   exploring the use of a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN)
   trained on puparial images and based on an embedded, group-contrast
   training protocol as a means of searching for consistent differences in
   puparial morphology. Fifteen molecular species were selected for
   analysis, all of which had been identified via DNA barcoding and
   confirmed using more extensive molecular characterizations and crossing
   experiments. Results demonstrate that all 15 species can be
   discriminated successfully based on differences in puparium morphology
   alone. This level of discrimination was achieved for laboratory
   populations reared on both hairy-leaved and glabrous-leaved host plants.
   Moreover, cross-tabulation tests confirmed the generality and stability
   of the CNN discriminant system trained on both ecophenotypic variants.
   The ability to identify B. tabaci species quickly and accurately from
   puparial images has the potential to address many long-standing problems
   in B. tabaci taxonomy and systematics as well as playing a vital role in
   ongoing pest-management efforts. {[}Aleyrodidae; entomology; Hemiptera;

Title = {Nucleotide Substitutions during Speciation may Explain Substitution Rate
   Variation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 24},
Abstract = {Although molecular mechanisms associated with the generation of
   mutations are highly conserved across taxa, there is widespread
   variation in mutation rates between evolutionary lineages. When
   phylogenies are reconstructed based on nucleotide sequences, such
   variation is typically accounted for by the assumption of a relaxed
   molecular clock, which is a statistical distribution of mutation rates
   without much underlying biological mechanism. Here, we propose that
   variation in accumulated mutations may be partly explained by an
   elevated mutation rate during speciation. Using simulations, we show how
   shifting mutations from branches to speciation events impacts inference

Abstract = {The tree of life is the fundamental biological roadmap for navigating
   the evolution and properties of life on Earth, and yet remains largely
   unknown. Even angiosperms (flowering plants) are fraught with data gaps,
   despite their critical role in sustaining terrestrial life. Today,
   high-throughput sequencing promises to significantly deepen our
   understanding of evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe a
   comprehensive phylogenomic platform for exploring the angiosperm tree of
   life, comprising a set of open tools and data based on the 353 nuclear
   genes targeted by the universal Angiosperms353 sequence capture probes.
   The primary goals of this article are to (i) document our methods, (ii)
   describe our first data release, and (iii) present a novel open data
   portal, the Kew Tree of Life Explorer (htips://treeoflife.keworg). We
   aim to generate novel target sequence capture data for all genera of
   flowering plants, exploiting natural history collections such as
   herbarium specimens, and augment it with mined public data. Our first
   data release, described here, is the most extensive nuclear phylogenomic
   data set for angiosperms to date, comprising 3099 samples validated by
   DNA barcode and phylogenetic tests, representing all 64 orders, 404
   families (96\%) and 2333 genera (17\%). A ``first pass{''} angiosperm
   tree of life was inferred from the data, which totaled 824,878
   sequences, 489,086,049 base pairs, and 532,260 alignment columns, for
   interactive presentation in the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. This species
   tree was generated using methods that were rigorous, yet tractable at
   our scale of operation. Despite limitations pertaining to taxon and gene
   sampling, gene recovery, models of sequence evolution and paralogy, the
   tree strongly supports existing taxonomy, while challenging numerous
   hypothesized relationships among orders and placing many genera for the
   first time. The validated data set, species tree and all intermediates
   are openly accessible via the Kew Tree of Life Explorer and will be
   updated as further data become available. This major milestone toward a
   complete tree of life for all flowering plant species opens doors to a
   highly integrated future for angiosperm phylogenomics through the
   systematic sequencing of standardized nuclear markers. Our approach has
   the potential to serve as a much-needed bridge between the growing
   movement to sequence the genomes of all life on Earth and the vast
   phylogenomic potential of the world's natural history collections.},

Title = {The Origin of the Legumes is a Complex Paleopolyploid Phylogenomic
   Tangle Closely Associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) Mass
   Extinction Event},

Abstract = {The consequences of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (KPB) mass
   extinction for the evolution of plant diversity remain poorly
   understood, even though evolutionary turnover of plant lineages at the
   KPB is central to understanding assembly of the Cenozoic biota. The
   apparent concentration of whole genome duplication (WGD) events around
   the KPB may have played a role in survival and subsequent
   diversification of plant lineages. To gain new insights into the origins
   of Cenozoic biodiversity, we examine the origin and early evolution of
   the globally diverse legume family (Leguminosae or Fabaceae). Legumes
   are ecologically (co-)dominant across many vegetation types, and the
   fossil record suggests that they rose to such prominence after the KPB
   in parallel with several well-studied animal clades including
   Placentalia and Neoaves. Furthermore, multiple WGD events are
   hypothesized to have occurred early in legume evolution. Using a
   recently inferred phylogenomic framework, we investigate the placement
   of WGDs during early legume evolution using gene tree reconciliation
   methods, gene count data and phylogenetic supernetwork reconstruction.
   Using 20 fossil calibrations we estimate a revised timeline of legume
   evolution based on 36 nuclear genes selected as informative and evolving
   in an approximately clock-like fashion. To establish the timing of WGDs
   we also date duplication nodes in gene trees. Results suggest either a
   pan-legume WGD event on the stem lineage of the family, or an
   allopolyploid event involving (some of) the earliest lineages within the
   crown group, with additional nested WGDs subtending subfamilies
   Papilionoideae and Detarioideae. Gene tree reconciliation methods that
   do not account for allopolyploidy may be misleading in inferring an
   earlier WGD event at the time of divergence of the two parental lineages
   of the polyploid, suggesting that the allopolyploid scenario is more
   likely. We show that the crown age of the legumes dates to the
   Maastrichtian or early Paleocene and that, apart from the Detarioideae
   WGD, paleopolyploidy occurred close to the KPB. We conclude that the
   early evolution of the legumes followed a complex history, in which
   multiple auto- and/or allopolyploidy events coincided with rapid
   diversification and in association with the mass extinction event at the
   KPB, ultimately underpinning the evolutionary success of the Leguminosae
   in the Cenozoic.},

Abstract = {Numerous methods for inferring species-level phylogenies under the
   coalescent model have been proposed within the last 20 years, and
   debates continue about the relative strengths and weaknesses of these
   methods. One desirable property of a phylogenetic estimator is that of
   statistical consistency, which means intuitively that as more data are
   collected, the probability that the estimated tree has the same topology
   as the true tree goes to 1. To date, consistency results for species
   tree inference under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) have been derived
   only for summary statistics methods, such as ASTRAL and MP-EST. These
   methods have been found to be consistent given true gene trees but may
   be inconsistent when gene trees are estimated from data for loci of
   finite length. Here, we consider the question of statistical consistency
   for four taxa for SVDQuartets for general data types, as well as for the
   maximum likelihood (ML) method in the case in which the data are a
   collection of sites generated under the MSC model such that the sites
   are conditionally independent given the species tree (we call these data
   coalescent independent sites {[}CIS] data). We show that SVDQuartets is
   statistically consistent for all data types (i.e., for both CIS data and
   formultilocus data), and we derive its rate of convergence. We
   additionally show that ML is consistent for CIS data under the JC69
   model and discuss why a proof for the more general multilocus case is
   difficult. Finally, we compare the performance of ML and SDVQuartets
   using simulation for both data types.},

Abstract = {A protein superfamily contains distantly related proteins that have
   acquired diverse biological functions through a long evolutionary
   history. Phylogenetic analysis of the early evolution of protein
   superfamilies is a key challenge because existing phylogenetic methods
   show poor performance when protein sequences are too diverged to
   construct an informative multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Here, we
   propose the Graph Splitting (GS) method, which rapidly reconstructs a
   protein superfamily-scale phylogenetic tree using a graph-based
   approach. Evolutionary simulation showed that the GS method can
   accurately reconstruct phylogenetic trees and be robust to major
   problems in phylogenetic estimation, such as biased taxon sampling,
   heterogeneous evolutionary rates, and long-branch attraction when
   sequences are substantially diverge. Its application to an empirical
   data set of the triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)-barrel superfamily
   suggests rapid evolution of protein-mediated pyrimidine biosynthesis,
   likely taking place after the RNA world. Furthermore, the GS method can
   also substantially improve performance of widely used MSA methods by
   providing accurate guide trees.},

Abstract = {What constitutes a discrete morphological character versus character
   state has been long discussed in the systematics literature but the
   consensus on this issue is still missing. Different methods of
   classifying organismal features into characters and character states
   (CCSs) can dramatically affect the results of phylogenetic analyses.
   Here, I show that, in the framework of Markov models, the modular
   structure of the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying trait
   development, and the hierarchical nature of GRN evolution, essentially
   remove the distinction between morphological CCS, thus endowing the CCS
   with an invariant property with respect to each other. This property
   allows the states of one character to be represented as several
   individual characters and vice versa. In practice, this means that a
   phenotype can be encoded using a set of characters or just one complex
   character with numerous states. The representation of a phenotype using
   one complex character can be implemented in Markov models of trait
   evolution by properly structuring transition rate matrix.},

Abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis, which states that substitutions
   accumulate in protein sequences at a constant rate, plays a fundamental
   role in molecular evolution but it is violated when selective or
   mutational processes vary with time. Such violations of the molecular
   clock have been widely investigated for protein sequences, but not yet
   for protein structures. Here, we introduce a novel statistical test
   (Significant Clock Violations) and perform a large scale assessment of
   the molecular clock in the evolution of both protein sequences and
   structures in three large superfamilies. After validating our method
   with computer simulations, we find that clock violations are generally
   consistent in sequence and structure evolution, but they tend to be
   larger and more significant in structure evolution. Moreover, changes of
   function assessed through Gene Ontology and InterPro terms are
   associated with large and significant clock violations in structure
   evolution. We found that almost one third of significant clock
   violations are significant in structure evolution but not in sequence
   evolution, highlighting the advantage to use structure information for
   assessing accelerated evolution and gathering hints of positive
   selection. Clock violations between closely related pairs are frequently
   significant in sequence evolution, consistent with the observed time
   dependence of the substitution rate attributed to segregation of neutral
   and slightly deleterious polymorphisms, but not in structure evolution,
   suggesting that these substitutions do not affect protein structure
   although they may affect stability. These results are consistent with
   the view that natural selection, both negative and positive, constrains
   more strongly protein structures than protein sequences. Our code for
   computing clock violations is freely available at

Title = {OSF-Builder: A New Tool for Constructing and Representing Evolutionary
   Histories Involving Introgression},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {717-729},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introgression is an evolutionary process which provides an important
   source of innovation for evolution. Although various methods have been
   used to detect introgression, very few methods are currently available
   for constructing evolutionary histories involving introgression. In this
   article, we propose a new method for constructing such evolutionary
   histories whose starting point is a species forest (consisting of a
   collection of lineage trees, usually arising as a collection of clades
   or monophyletic groups in a species tree), and a gene tree for a
   specific allele of interest, or allele tree for short. Our method is
   based on representing introgression in terms of a certain ``overlay{''}
   of the allele tree over the lineage trees, called an overlaid species
   forest (OSF). OSFs are similar to phylogenetic networks although a key
   difference is that they typically have multiple roots because each
   monophyletic group in the species tree has a different point of origin.
   Employing a new model for introgression, we derive an efficient
   algorithm for building OSFs called OSF-Builder that is guaranteed to
   return an optimal OSF in the sense that the number of potential
   introgression events is minimized. As well as using simulations to
   assess the performance of OSF-Builder, we illustrate its use on a
   butterfly data set in which introgression has been previously inferred.
   The OSF-Builder software is available for download from
   https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/software/OSF-Builder.},

Title = {Homoplasy-Based Partitioning Outperforms Alternatives in Bayesian
   Analysis of Discrete Morphological Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {657-671},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bayesian analysis of morphological data is becoming increasingly popular
   mainly (but not only) because it allows for time-calibrated phylogenetic
   inference using relaxed morphological clocks and tip dating whenever
   fossils are available. As with molecular data, recent studies have shown
   that modeling among-character rate variation (ACRV) in morphological
   matrices greatly improves phylogenetic inference. In a likelihood
   framework this may be accomplished, for instance, by employing a hidden
   Markov model to assign characters to rate categories drawn from a
   (discretized) Gamma distribution and/or by partitioning data sets
   according to rate heterogeneity and estimating per-partition branch
   lengths, conditioned on a single topology. While the first approach is
   available in many phylogenetic analysis software, there is still no
   clear consensus on how to partition data, except perhaps in the simplest
   cases (e.g., ``by codon{''} partitioning of coding sequences).
   Additionally, there is a trade-off between improvement in likelihood
   scores and the number of free parameters in the analysis, which rises
   quickly with the number of partitions. This trade-off may be dealt with
   by employing statistics that penalize overfitting of complex models,
   such as Akaike or Bayesian information criteria, or the more recently
   introduced stepping-stone method for marginal likelihood approximation.
   We applied the latter to three distinct matrices of discrete
   morphological data and demonstrated that sorting characters by homoplasy
   scores (obtained from implied weighting parsimony analysis) outperformed
   other partitioning strategies (anatomically-based and PartitionFinder2).
   The method was in fact so efficient in segregating characters by rates
   of evolution that no within-partition ACRV modeling was necessary, while
   among-partition rate variation was adequately accommodated by rate
   multipliers. We conclude that partitioning by homoplasy is a powerful
   and easy-to-implement strategy to address ACRV in complex data sets. We
   provide some guidelines focusing on morphological matrices, although
   this approach may be also applicable to molecular data sets.},

   Sampling},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-233},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bayesian inference methods rely on numerical algorithms for both model
   selection and parameter inference. In general, these algorithms require
   a high computational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the
   major challenges in phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal
   likelihood. This quantity is commonly used for comparing different
   evolutionary models, but its calculation, even for simple models, incurs
   high computational cost. Another interesting challenge relates to the
   estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long Markov chains are
   required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter inference,
   especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are
   addressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS)
   is a Bayesian computation algorithm, which provides the means to
   estimate marginal likelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to
   sample from the posterior distribution at no extra cost. The methods
   currently used in phylogenetics for marginal likelihood estimation lack
   in practicality due to their dependence on many tuning parameters and
   their inability of most implementations to provide a direct way to
   calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates, unlike NS. In
   this article, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is
   analysed under different scenarios and compared to established methods.
   We conclude that NS is a competitive and attractive algorithm for
   phylogenetic inference. An implementation is available as a package for
   BEAST 2 under the LGPL licence, accessible at

Abstract = {The subtribe Espeletiinae (Asteraceae), endemic to the high-elevations
   in the Northern Andes, exhibits an exceptional diversity of species,
   growth-forms, and reproductive strategies. This complex of 140 species
   includes large trees, dichotomous trees, shrubs and the extraordinary
   giant caulescent rosettes, considered as a classic example of adaptation
   in tropical high-elevation ecosystems. The subtribe has also long been
   recognized as a prominent case of adaptive radiation, but the
   understanding of its evolution has been hampered by a lack of
   phylogenetic resolution. Herein, we produce the first fully resolved
   phylogeny of all morphological groups of Espeletiinae, using whole
   plastomes and about a million nuclear nucleotides obtained with an
   original de novo assembly procedure without reference genome, and
   analyzed with traditional and coalescent-based approaches that consider
   the possible impact of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization on
   phylogenetic inference. We show that the diversification of Espeletiinae
   started from a rosette ancestor about 2.3 Ma, after the final uplift of
   the Northern Andes. This was followed by two independent radiations in
   the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes, with a few trans-cordilleran
   dispersal events among low-elevation tree lineages but none among
   high-elevation rosettes. We demonstrate complex scenarios of
   morphological change in Espeletiinae, usually implying the convergent
   evolution of growth-forms with frequent loss/gains of various traits.
   For instance, caulescent rosettes evolved independently in both
   countries, likely as convergent adaptations to life in tropical
   high-elevation habitats. Tree growth-forms evolved independently three
   times from the repeated colonization of lower elevations by
   high-elevation rosette ancestors. The rate of morphological
   diversification increased during the early phase of the radiation, after
   which it decreased steadily towards the present. On the other hand, the
   rate of species diversification in the best-sampled Venezuelan radiation
   was on average very high (3.1 spp/My), with significant rate variation
   among growth-forms (much higher in polycarpic caulescent rosettes). Our
   results point out a scenario where both adaptive morphological evolution
   and geographical isolation due to Pleistocene climatic oscillations
   triggered an exceptionally rapid radiation for a continental plant
   group.},

Abstract = {Chromosome number is a key feature of the higher-order organization of
   the genome, and changes in chromosome number play a fundamental role in
   evolution. Dysploid gains and losses in chromosome number, as well as
   polyploidization events, may drive reproductive isolation and lineage
   diversification. The recent development of probabilistic models of
   chromosome number evolution in the groundbreaking work by Mayrose et al.
   (2010, ChromEvol) have enabled the inference of ancestral chromosome
   numbers over molecular phylogenies and generated new interest in
   studying the role of chromosome changes in evolution. However, the
   ChromEvol approach assumes all changes occur anagenetically (along
   branches), and does not model events that are specifically cladogenetic.
   Cladogenetic changes may be expected if chromosome changes result in
   reproductive isolation. Here we present a new class of models of
   chromosome number evolution (called ChromoSSE) that incorporate both
   anagenetic and cladogenetic change. The ChromoSSE models allow us to
   determine the mode of chromosome number evolution; is chromosome
   evolution occurring primarily within lineages, primarily at lineage
   splitting, or in clade-specific combinations of both? Furthermore, we
   can estimate the location and timing of possible chromosome speciation
   events over the phylogeny. We implemented ChromoSSE in a Bayesian
   statistical framework, specifically in the software RevBayes, to
   accommodate uncertainty in parameter estimates while leveraging the full
   power of likelihood based methods. We tested ChromoSSE's accuracy with
   simulations and re-examined chromosomal evolution in Aristolochia, Carex
   section Spirostachyae, Helianthus, Mimulus sensu lato (s.l.), and
   Primula section Aleuritia, finding evidence for clade-specific
   combinations of anagenetic and cladogenetic dysploid and polyploid modes
   of chromosome evolution.},

Title = {An Evaluation of Different Partitioning Strategies for Bayesian
   Estimation of Species Divergence Times},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The explosive growth ofmolecular sequence data has made it possible to
   estimate species divergence times under relaxed-clockmodels using
   genome-scale data sets withmany gene loci. In order to improve bothmodel
   realism and to best extract information about relative divergence times
   in the sequence data, it is important to account for the heterogeneity
   in the evolutionary process across genes or genomic regions.
   Partitioning is a commonly used approach to achieve those goals. We
   group sites that have similar evolutionary characteristics into the same
   partition and those with different characteristics into different
   partitions, and then use different models or different values of model
   parameters for different partitions to account for the among-partition
   heterogeneity. However, how to partition data in practical phylogenetic
   analysis, and in particular in relaxed-clock dating analysis, is more
   art than science. Here, we use computer simulation and real data
   analysis to study the impact of the partition scheme on divergence time
   estimation. The partition schemes had relatively minor effects on the
   accuracy of posterior time estimates when the prior assumptions were
   correct and the clock was not seriously violated, but showed large
   differences when the clock was seriously violated, when the fossil
   calibrations were in conflict or incorrect, or when the rate prior was
   mis-specified. Concatenation produced the widest posterior intervals
   with the least precision. Use of many partitions increased the
   precision, as predicted by the infinite-sites theory, but the posterior
   intervals might fail to include the true ages because of the conflicting
   fossil calibrations or mis-specified rate priors. We analyzed a data set
   of 78 plastid genes from 15 plant species with serious clock violation
   and showed that time estimates differed significantly among partition
   schemes, irrespective of the rate drift model used. Multiple and precise
   fossil calibrations reduced the differences among partition schemes and
   were important to improving the precision of divergence time estimates.
   While the use of many partitions is an important approach to reducing
   the uncertainty in posterior time estimates, we do not recommend its
   general use for the present, given the limitations of current models of
   rate drift for partitioned data and the challenges of interpreting the
   fossil evidence to construct accurate and informative calibrations.},

Title = {Genomic Signature of an Avian Lilliput Effect across the K-Pg Extinction},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Survivorship following major mass extinctions may be associated with a
   decrease in body size-a phenomenon called the Lilliput Effect. Body size
   is a strong predictor of many life history traits (LHTs), and is known
   to influence demography and intrinsic biological processes. Pronounced
   changes in organismal size throughout Earth history are therefore likely
   to be associated with concomitant genome-wide changes in evolutionary
   rates. Here, we report pronounced heterogeneity in rates of molecular
   evolution (varying up to similar to 20-fold) across a large-scale avian
   phylogenomic data set and show that nucleotide substitution rates are
   strongly correlated with body size and metabolic rate. We also identify
   potential body size reductions associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene
   (K-Pg) transition, consistent with a Lilliput Effect in the wake of that
   mass extinction event. We posit that selection for reduced body size
   across theK-Pg extinction horizon may have resulted in transient
   increases in substitution rate along the deepest branches of the extant
   avian tree of life. This ``hidden{''} rate acceleration may result in
   both strict and relaxed molecular clocks over-estimating the age of the
   avian crown group through the relationship between life history and
   demographic parameters that scale with molecular substitution rate. If
   reductions in body size (and/or selection for related demographic
   parameters like short generation times) are a common property of
   lineages surviving mass extinctions, this phenomenon may help resolve
   persistent divergence time debates across the tree of life. Furthermore,
   our results suggest that selection for certain LHTs may be associated
   with deterministic molecular evolutionary outcomes.},

Title = {Modeling Pulsed Evolution and Time-Independent Variation Improves the
   Confidence Level of Ancestral and Hidden State Predictions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 25},
Abstract = {Ancestral state reconstruction is not only a fundamental tool for
   studying trait evolution, but also very useful for predicting the
   unknown trait values (hidden states) of extant species. A well-known
   problem in ancestral and hidden state predictions is that the
   uncertainty associated with predictions can be so large that predictions
   themselves are of little use. Therefore, for meaningful interpretation
   of predicted traits and hypothesis testing, it is prudent to accurately
   assess the uncertainty of the predictions. Commonly used constant-rate
   Brownian motion (BM) model fails to capture the complexity of tempo and
   mode of trait evolution in nature, making predictions under the BM model
   vulnerable to lack-of-fit errors from model misspecification. Using
   empirical data (mammalian body size and bacterial genome size), we show
   that the distribution of residual Z-scores under the BM model is neither
   homoscedastic nor normal as expected. Consequently, the 95\% confidence
   intervals of predicted traits are so unreliable that the actual coverage
   probability ranges from 33\% (strongly permissive) to 100\% (strongly
   conservative). Alternative methods such as BayesTraits and StableTraits
   that allow variable rates in evolution improve the predictions but are
   computationally expensive. Here, we develop Reconstructing Ancestral
   State under Pulsed Evolution in R by Gaussian Decomposition
   (RasperGade), a method of ancestral and hidden state prediction that
   uses the Levy process to explicitly model gradual evolution, pulsed
   evolution, and time-independent variation. Using the same empirical
   data, we show that RasperGade outperforms both BayesTraits and
   StableTraits in providing reliable confidence estimates and is
   orders-of-magnitude faster. Our results suggest that, when predicting
   the ancestral and hidden states of continuous traits, the rate variation
   should always be assessed and the quality of confidence estimates should
   always be examined. {[}Bacterial genomic traits; model misspecification;

Title = {On the Need for New Measures of Phylogenomic Support},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {917-920},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {The scale of data sets used to infer phylogenies has grown dramatically
   in the last decades, providing researchers with an enormous amount of
   information with which to draw inferences about evolutionary history.
   However, standard approaches to assessing confidence in those inferences
   (e.g., nonparametric bootstrap proportions {[}BP] and Bayesian posterior
   probabilities {[}PPs]) are still deeply influenced by statistical
   procedures and frameworks that were developed when information was much
   more limited. These approaches largely quantify uncertainty caused by
   limited amounts of data, which is often vanishingly small with modern,
   genome-scale sequence data sets. As a consequence, today's phylogenomic
   studies routinely report near-complete confidence in their inferences,
   even when different studies reach strongly conflicting conclusions and
   the sites and loci in a single data set contain much more heterogeneity
   than our methods assume or can accommodate. Therefore, we argue that BPs
   and marginal PPs of bipartitions have outlived their utility as the
   primary means of measuring phylogenetic support for modern phylogenomic
   data sets with large numbers of sites relative to the number of taxa.
   Continuing to rely on these measures will hinder progress towards
   understanding remaining sources of uncertainty in the most challenging
   portions of the Tree of Life. Instead, we encourage researchers to
   examine the ideas and methods presented in this special issue of
   Systematic Biology and to explore the area further in their own work.
   The papers in this special issue outline strategies for assessing
   confidence and uncertainty in phylogenomic data sets that move beyond
   stochastic error due to limited data and offer promise for more
   productive dialogue about the challenges that we face in reaching our
   shared goal of understanding the history of life on Earth.{[}Big data;

Abstract = {Species are crucial to most branches of biological research, yet remain
   controversial in terms of definition, delimitation, and reality. The
   difficulty of resolving the ``species problem{''} stems from the tension
   between their theoretical concept as groups of evolving and highly
   variable organisms and the practical need for a stable and comparable
   unit of biology. Here, we suggest that treating species as a heuristic
   can be consistent with a theoretical definition of what species are and
   with the practical means by which they are identified and delimited.
   Specifically, we suggest that theoretically species are heuristic since
   they comprise clusters of closely related individuals responding in a
   similar manner to comparable sets of evolutionary and ecological forces,
   whilst they are practically heuristic because they are identifiable by
   the congruence of contingent properties indicative of those forces. This
   reconciliation of the theoretical basis of species with their practical
   applications in biological research allows for a loose but relatively
   consistent definition of species based on the strategic analysis and
   integration of genotypic, phenotypic, and ecotypic data. {[}Cohesion;

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that cause heterogeneity among gene trees can
   increase the accuracy of species trees. Discordant signals across the
   genome are commonly produced by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and
   introgression, which in turn can result in reticulate evolution. Species
   tree inference using the multispecies coalescent is designed to deal
   with ILS and is robust to low levels of introgression, but extensive
   introgression violates the fundamental assumption that relationships are
   strictly bifurcating. In this study, we explore the phylogenomics of the
   iconic Liolaemus subgenus of South American lizards, a group of over 100
   species mostly distributed in and around the Andes mountains. Using
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and genome-wide restriction site-associated
   DNA sequencing (RADseq; nDNA hereafter), we inferred a time-calibrated
   mtDNA gene tree, nDNA species trees, and phylogenetic networks. We found
   high levels of discordance between mtDNA and nDNA, which we attribute in
   part to extensive ILS resulting from rapid diversification. These data
   also reveal extensive and deep introgression, which combined with rapid
   diversification, explain the high level of phylogenetic discordance. We
   discuss these findings in the context of Andean orogeny and glacial
   cycles that fragmented, expanded, and contracted species distributions.
   Finally, we use the new phylogeny to resolve long-standing taxonomic
   issues in one of the most studied lizard groups in the New
   World.{[}Andes; ddRADSeq; introgression; lizards; mtDNA; reptiles;

Title = {Concordance-Based Approaches for the Inference of Relationships and
   Molecular Rates with Phylogenomic Data Sets},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 AUG 18},
Abstract = {Gene tree conflict is common and finding methods to analyze and
   alleviate the negative effects that conflict has on species tree
   analysis is a crucial part of phylogenomics. This study aims to expand
   the discussion of inferring species trees and molecular branch lengths
   when conflict is present. Conflict is typically examined in two ways:
   inferring its prevalence and inferring the influence of the individual
   genes (how strongly one gene supports any given topology compared to an
   alternative topology). Here, we examine a procedure for incorporating
   both conflict and the influence of genes in order to infer evolutionary
   relationships. All supported relationships in the gene trees are
   analyzed and the likelihood of the genes constrained to these
   relationships is summed to provide a likelihood for the relationship.
   Consensus tree assembly is conducted based on the sum of likelihoods for
   a given relationship and choosing relationships based on the most likely
   relationship assuming it does not conflict with a relationship that has
   a higher likelihood score. If it is not possible for all most likely
   relationships to be combined into a single bifurcating tree then
   multiple trees are produced and a consensus tree with a polytomy is
   created. This procedure allows for more influential genes to have a
   greater influence on an inferred relationship, does not assume conflict
   has arisen from any one source and does not force the data set to
   produce a single bifurcating tree. Using this approach, on three
   empirical data sets, we examine and discuss the relationship between
   influence and prevalence of gene tree conflict. We find that in one of
   the data sets, assembling a bifurcating consensus tree solely composed
   of the most likely relationships is impossible. To account for conflict
   in molecular rate analysis we also introduce a concordance-based
   approach to the summary and estimation of branch lengths suitable for
   downstream comparative analyses. We demonstrate through simulation that
   even under high levels of stochastic conflict, the mean and median of
   the concordant rates recapitulate the true molecular rate better than
   using a supermatrix approach. Using a large phylogenomic data set, we
   examine rate heterogeneity across concordant genes with a focus on the
   branch subtending crown angiosperms. Notably, we find highly variable
   rates of evolution along the branch subtending crown angiosperms. The
   approaches outlined here have several limitations, but they also
   represent some alternative methods for harnessing the complexity of
   phylogenomic data sets and enrich our inferences of both species
   relationships and evolutionary processes.{[}Branch length estimation;

Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of genomic data provide a powerful means of
   reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among organisms, yet such
   analyses are often hindered by conflicting phylogenetic signals among
   loci. Identifying the signals that are most influential to species-tree
   estimation can help to inform the choice of data for phylogenomic
   analysis. We investigated this in an analysis of 30 phylogenomic data
   sets. For each data set, we examined the association between several
   branch-length characteristics of gene trees and the distance between
   these gene trees and the corresponding species trees. We found that the
   distance of each gene tree to the species tree inferred from the full
   data set was positively associated with variation in root-to-tip
   distances and negatively associated with mean branch support. However,
   no such associations were found for gene-tree length, a measure of the
   overall substitution rate at each locus. We further explored the
   usefulness of the best-performing branch-based characteristics for
   selecting loci for phylogenomic analyses. We found that loci that yield
   gene trees with high variation in root-to-tip distances have a
   disproportionately distant signal of tree topology compared with the
   complete data sets. These results suggest that rate variation across
   lineages should be taken into consideration when exploring and even
   selecting loci for phylogenomic analysis.{[}Branch support; data

Abstract = {Phylogenetic divergence-time estimation has been revolutionized by two
   recent developments: 1) total-evidence dating (or ``tip-dating{''})
   approaches that allow for the incorporation of fossils as tips in the
   analysis, with their phylogenetic and temporal relationships to the
   extant taxa inferred from the data and 2) the fossilized birth-death
   (FBD) class of tree models that capture the processes that produce the
   tree (speciation, extinction, and fossilization) and thus provide a
   coherent and biologically interpretable tree prior. To explore the
   behavior of these methods, we apply them to marattialean ferns, a group
   that was dominant in Carboniferous landscapes prior to declining to its
   modest extant diversity of slightly over 100 species. We show that tree
   models have a dramatic influence on estimates of both divergence times
   and topological relationships. This influence is driven by the strong,
   counter-intuitive informativeness of the uniform tree prior, and the
   inherent nonidentifiability of divergence-time models. In contrast to
   the strong influence of the tree models, we find minor effects of
   differing the morphological transition model or the morphological clock
   model. We compare the performance of a large pool of candidate models
   using a combination of posterior-predictive simulation and Bayes
   factors. Notably, an FBD model with epoch-specific speciation and
   extinction rates was strongly favored by Bayes factors. Our best-fitting
   model infers stem and crown divergences for the Marattiales in the
   mid-Devonian and Late Cretaceous, respectively, with elevated speciation
   rates in the Mississippian and elevated extinction rates in the
   Cisuralian leading to a peak diversity of similar to 2800 species at the
   end of the Carboniferous, representing the heyday of the Psaroniaceae.
   This peak is followed by the rapid decline and ultimate extinction of
   the Psaroniaceae, with their descendants, the Marattiaceae, persisting
   at approximately stable levels of diversity until the present. This
   general diversification pattern appears to be insensitive to potential
   biases in the fossil record; despite the preponderance of available
   fossils being from Pennsylvanian coal balls, incorporating
   fossilization-rate variation does not improve model fit. In addition, by
   incorporating temporal data directly within the model and allowing for
   the inference of the phylogenetic position of the fossils, our study
   makes the surprising inference that the Glade of extant Marattiales is
   relatively young, younger than any of the fossils historically thought
   to be congeneric with extant species. This result is a dramatic
   demonstration of the dangers of node-based approaches to divergence-time
   estimation, where the assignment of fossils to particular Glades is made
   a priori (earlier node-based studies that constrained the minimum ages
   of extant genera based on these fossils resulted in much older age
   estimates than in our study) and of the utility of explicit models of
   morphological evolution and lineage diversification.},

Abstract = {The complex forces that shape butterfly wings have long been a subject
   of experimental and comparative research. Butterflies use their wings
   for flight, camouflage, mate recognition, warning, and mimicry. However,
   general patterns and correlations among wing shape and size evolution
   are still poorly understood. We collected geometric morphometric
   measurements from over 1400 digitized museum specimens of Papilio
   swallowtails and combined them with phylogenetic data to test two
   hypotheses: 1) forewing shape and size evolve independently of hindwing
   shape and size and 2) wing size evolves more quickly than wing shape. We
   also determined the major axes of wing shape variation and discovered
   that most shape variability occurs in hindwing tails and adjacent areas.
   We conclude that forewing shape and size are functionally and
   biomechanically constrained, whereas hindwings are more labile, perhaps
   in response to disruptive selective pressure for Batesian mimicry or
   against predation. The development of a significant, re-usable,
   digitized data resource will enable further investigation on tradeoffs
   between flight performance and ecological selective pressures, along
   with the degree to which intraspecific, local-scale selection may
   explain macroevolutionary patterns.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent simulation studies examining the performance of Bayesian species
   delimitation as implemented in the bpp program have suggested that bpp
   may detect population splits but not species divergences and that it
   tends to over-split when data of many loci are analyzed. Here, we
   confirm these results and provide the mathematical justifications. We
   point out that the distinction between population and species splits
   made in the protracted speciation model (PSM) has no influence on the
   generation of gene trees and sequence data, which explains why no method
   can use such data to distinguish between population splits and
   speciation. We suggest that the PSM is unrealistic as its mechanism for
   assigning species status assumes instantaneous speciation, contradicting
   prevailing taxonomic practice. We confirm the suggestion, based on
   simulation, that in the case of speciation with gene flow, Bayesian
   model selection as implemented in bpp tends to detect population splits
   when the amount of data (the number of loci) increases. We discuss the
   use of a recently proposed empirical genealogical divergence index (gdi)
   for species delimitation and illustrate that parameter estimates
   produced by a full likelihood analysis as implemented in bpp provide
   much more reliable inference under the gdi than the approximate method
   phrapl. We distinguish between Bayesian model selection and parameter
   estimation and suggest that the model selection approach is useful for
   identifying sympatric cryptic species, while the parameter estimation
   approach may be used to implement empirical criteria for determining
   species status among allopatric populations.},

Title = {Why Concatenation Fails Near the Anomaly Zone},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Genome-scale sequencing has been of great benefit in recovering species
   trees but has not provided final answers. Despite the rapid accumulation
   of molecular sequences, resolving short and deep branches of the tree of
   life has remained a challenge and has prompted the development of new
   strategies that can make the best use of available data. One such
   strategy-the concatenation of gene alignments-can be successful when
   coupled with many tree estimation methods, but has also been shown to
   fail when there are high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we
   focus on the failure of likelihood-based methods in retrieving a rooted,
   asymmetric four-taxon species tree from concatenated data when the
   species tree is in or near the anomaly zone-a region of parameter space
   where the most common gene tree does not match the species tree because
   of incomplete lineage sorting. First, we use coalescent theory to prove
   that most informative sites will support the species tree in the anomaly
   zone, and that as a consequence maximum-parsimony succeeds in recovering
   the species tree from concatenated data. We further show that
   maximum-likelihood tree estimation from concatenated data fails both
   inside and outside the anomaly zone, and that this failure cannot be
   easily predicted from the topology of the most common gene tree. We
   demonstrate that likelihood-based methods often fail in a region
   partially overlapping the anomaly zone, likely because of the lower
   relative cost of substitutions on discordant gene tree branches that are
   absent from the species tree. Our results confirm and extend previous
   reports on the performance of these methods applied to concatenated data
   from a rooted, asymmetric four-taxon species tree, and highlight avenues
   for future work improving the performance of methods aimed at recovering
   species tree.},

Title = {Emerging Concepts of Data Integration in Pathogen Phylodynamics},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {E47-E65},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Phylodynamics has become an increasingly popular statistical framework
   to extract evolutionary and epidemiological information from pathogen
   genomes. By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed
   light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses
   about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics
   in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich
   development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of
   sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole
   primary data source. Integrating various sources of information,
   however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious
   diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis
   testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is
   stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology
   which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary
   biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait
   evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling
   information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary
   and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight
   how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can
   generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and
   population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples
   demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host
   on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of
   influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species
   transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza
   antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now
   also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading
   to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed
   reconstructions of transmission trees.},

Title = {An Efficient Coalescent Epoch Model for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 25},
Abstract = {We present a two-headed approach called Bayesian Integrated Coalescent
   Epoch PlotS (BICEPS) for efficient inference of coalescent epoch models.
   Firstly, we integrate out population size parameters, and secondly, we
   introduce a set of more powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   proposals for flexing and stretching trees. Even though population sizes
   are integrated out and not explicitly sampled through MCMC, we are still
   able to generate samples from the population size posteriors. This
   allows demographic reconstruction through time and estimating the timing
   and magnitude of population bottlenecks and full population histories.
   Altogether, BICEPS can be considered a more muscular version of the
   popular Bayesian skyline model. We demonstrate its power and correctness
   by a well-calibrated simulation study. Furthermore, we demonstrate with
   an application to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data that some analyses that have
   trouble converging with the traditional Bayesian skyline prior and
   standard MCMC proposals can do well with the BICEPS approach. BICEPS is
   available as open-source package for BEAST 2 under GPL license and has a
   user-friendly graphical user interface.{[}Bayesian phylogenetics; BEAST

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Distinguishing coral species is not only crucial for physiological,
   ecological, and evolutionary studies but also to enable effective
   management of threatened reef ecosystems. However, traditional
   hypotheses that delineate coral species based on morphological traits
   from the coral skeleton are frequently at odds with tree-based molecular
   approaches. Additionally, a dearth of species-level molecular markers
   has made species delimitation particularly challenging in species-rich
   coral genera, leading to the widespread assumption that interspecific
   hybridization might be responsible for this apparent conundrum. Here, we
   used three lines of evidence-morphology, breeding trials, and molecular
   approaches-to identify species boundaries in a group of ecologically
   important tabular Acropora corals. In contrast to previous studies, our
   morphological analysis yielded groups that were congruent with
   experimental crosses as well as with coalescent-based and allele
   sharing-based multilocus approaches to species delimitation. Our results
   suggest that species of the genus Acropora are reproductively isolated
   and independently evolving units that can be distinguished
   morphologically. These findings not only pave the way for a taxonomic
   revision of coral species but also outline an approach that can provide
   a solid basis to address species delimitation and provide conservation
   support to a wide variety of keystone organisms. {[}Acropora; coral

Title = {Empirical and Methodological Challenges to the Model-Based Inference of
   Diversification Rates in Extinct Clades},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-171},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Changes in speciation and extinction rates are key to the dynamics of
   clade diversification, but attempts to infer them from phylogenies of
   extant species face challenges. Methods capable of synthesizing
   information from extant and fossil species have yielded novel insights
   into diversification rate variation through time, but little is known
   about their behavior when analyzing entirely extinct clades. Here, we
   use empirical and simulated data to assess how two popular methods,
   PyRate and Fossil BAMM, perform in this setting. We inferred the first
   tip-dated trees for ornithischian dinosaurs and combined them with
   fossil occurrence data to test whether the clade underwent an
   end-Cretaceous decline. We then simulated phylogenies and fossil records
   under empirical constraints to determine whether macroevolutionary and
   preservation rates can be teased apart under paleobiologically realistic
   conditions. We obtained discordant inferences about ornithischian
   macroevolution including a long-term speciation rate decline (BAMM),
   mostly flat rates with a steep diversification drop (PyRate) or without
   one (BAMM), and episodes of implausibly accelerated speciation and
   extinction (PyRate). Simulations revealed little to no conflation
   between speciation and preservation, but yielded spuriously correlated
   speciation and extinction estimates while time-smearing tree-wide shifts
   (BAMM) or overestimating their number (PyRate). Our results indicate
   that the small phylogenetic data sets available to vertebrate
   paleontologists and the assumptions made by current model-based methods
   combine to yield potentially unreliable inferences about the
   diversification of extinct clades. We provide guidelines for
   interpreting the results of the existing approaches in light of their
   limitations and suggest how the latter may be mitigated.},

Title = {Introgression and Species Delimitation in the Longear Sunfish Lepomis

Abstract = {Introgression and hybridization are major impediments to genomic-based
   species delimitation because many implementations of the multispecies
   coalescent framework assume no gene flow among species. The sunfish
   genus Lepomis, one of the world's most popular groups of freshwater
   sport fish, has a complicated taxonomic history. The results of ddRAD
   phylogenomic analyses do not provide support for the current taxonomy
   that recognizes two species, Lepomis megalotis and Lepomis peltastes, in
   the L. megalotis complex. Instead, evidence from phylogenomics and
   phenotype warrants recognizing six relatively ancient evolutionary
   lineages in the complex. The introgressed and hybridizing populations in
   the L. megalotis complex are localized and appear to be the result of
   secondary contact or rare hybridization events between nonsister
   species. Segregating admixed populations from our multispecies
   coalescent analyses identifies six species with moderate to high
   genealogical divergence, whereas including admixed populations drives
   all but one lineage below the species threshold of genealogical
   divergence. Segregation of admixed individuals also helps reveal
   phenotypic distinctiveness among the six species in morphological traits
   used by ichthyologists to discover and delimit species over the last two
   centuries. Our protocols allow for the identification and accommodation
   of hybridization and introgression in species delimitation.
   Genomic-based species delimitation validated with multiple lines of
   evidence provides a path towards the discovery of new biodiversity and
   resolving long-standing taxonomic problems.{[}ddRAD; genealogical

Title = {A Codon Model for Associating Phenotypic Traits with Altered Selective
   Patterns of Sequence Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {608-622},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Detecting the signature of selection in coding sequences and associating
   it with shifts in phenotypic states can unveil genes underlying complex
   traits. Of the various signatures of selection exhibited at the
   molecular level, changes in the pattern of selection at protein-coding
   genes have been of main interest. To this end, phylogenetic branch-site
   codon models are routinely applied to detect changes in selective
   patterns along specific branches of the phylogeny. Many of these methods
   rely on a prespecified partition of the phylogeny to branch categories,
   thus treating the course of trait evolution as fully resolved and
   assuming that phenotypic transitions have occurred only at speciation
   events. Here, we present TraitRELAX, a new phylogenetic model that
   alleviates these strong assumptions by explicitly accounting for the
   uncertainty in the evolution of both trait and coding sequences. This
   joint statistical framework enables the detection of changes in
   selection intensity upon repeated trait transitions. We evaluated the
   performance of TraitRELAX using simulations and then applied it to two
   case studies. Using TraitRELAX, we found an intensification of selection
   in the primate SEMG2 gene in polygynandrous species compared to species
   of other mating forms, as well as changes in the intensity of purifying
   selection operating on sixteen bacterial genes upon transitioning from a
   free-living to an endosymbiotic lifestyle.},

Title = {Six-State Amino Acid Recoding is not an Effective Strategy to Offset
   Compositional Heterogeneity and Saturation in Phylogenetic Analyses},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Six-state amino acid recoding strategies are commonly applied to combat
   the effects of compositional heterogeneity and substitution saturation
   in phylogenetic analyses. While these methods have been endorsed from a
   theoretical perspective, their performance has never been extensively
   tested. Here, we test the effectiveness of six-state recoding approaches
   by comparing the performance of analyses on recoded and non-recoded data
   sets that have been simulated under gradients of compositional
   heterogeneity or saturation. In our simulation analyses, non-recoding
   approaches consistently outperform six-state recoding approaches. Our
   results suggest that six-state recoding strategies are not effective in
   the face of high saturation. Furthermore, while recoding strategies do
   buffer the effects of compositional heterogeneity, the loss of
   information that accompanies six-state recoding outweighs its benefits.
   In addition, we evaluate recoding schemes with 9, 12, 15, and 18 states
   and show that these consistently outperform six-state recoding. Our
   analyses of other recoding schemes suggest that under conditions of very
   high compositional heterogeneity, it may be advantageous to apply
   recoding using more than six states, but we caution that applying any
   recoding should include sufficient justification. Our results have
   important implications for the more than 90 published papers that have
   incorporated six-state recoding, many of which have significant bearing
   on relationships across the tree of life.},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {A simple graphical device, the simplex plot of quartet concordance
   factors, is introduced to aid in the exploration of a collection of gene
   trees on a common set of taxa. A single plot summarizes all gene tree
   discord and allows for visual comparison to the expected discord from
   the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) of incomplete lineage sorting on
   a species tree. A formal statistical procedure is described that can
   quantify the deviation from expectation for each subset of four taxa,
   suggesting when the data are not in accord with the MSC, and thus that
   either gene tree inference error is substantial or a more complex model
   such as that on a network may be required. If the collection of gene
   trees is in accord with the MSC, the plots reveal when substantial
   incomplete lineage sorting is present. Applications to both simulated
   and empirical multilocus data sets illustrate the insights provided.

Title = {Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with Expert-Level Accuracy
   Using Effective Feature Transfer from Convolutional Networks},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Pages = {876-895},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rapid and reliable identification of insects is important in many
   contexts, from the detection of disease vectors and invasive species to
   the sorting of material from biodiversity inventories. Because of the
   shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in
   developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been
   based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features,
   but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs) can learn to extract relevant features
   automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching
   expert-level accuracy in CNN identifications requires substantial
   computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not
   available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature
   transfer: a CNN that has been pretrained on a generic image
   classification task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and
   information about its perception of those images is used in training a
   simpler, dedicated identification system. Here, we develop an effective
   method of CNN feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in
   taxonomic identification of insects with training sets of 100 images or
   less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Specifically, we
   extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image
   features from the CNN architecture VGG16 pretrained on the ImageNet data
   set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine
   classifier, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the
   performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks:
   1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong
   to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying
   visually similar species that are difficult to separate even for
   experts. For the first task, our approach reached 92\% accuracy on one
   data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens
   representing unique species), and 96\% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal
   habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90\% of specimens
   belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach
   outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of
   three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97\% accuracy), and
   both humans and traditional automated identification systems on another
   data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 \%
   accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identification tasks
   studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly
   applicable and provides significant improvements over previous methods,
   whether based on dedicated CNNs, CNN feature transfer, or more
   traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be
   highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identification
   systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets
   limited. We conclude by briefly discussing some promising CNN-based
   research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the
   success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.},

Abstract = {By providing a framework of accounting for the shared ancestry inherent
   to all life, phylogenetics is becoming the statistical foundation of
   biology. The importance of model choice continues to grow as
   phylogenetic models continue to increase in complexity to better capture
   micro- and macroevolutionary processes. In a Bayesian framework, the
   marginal likelihood is how data update our prior beliefs about models,
   which gives us an intuitive measure of comparing model fit that is
   grounded in probability theory. Given the rapid increase in the number
   and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating
   marginal likelihoods are increasingly important. Here, we try to provide
   an intuitive description of marginal likelihoods and why they are
   important in Bayesian model testing. We also categorize and review
   methods for estimating marginal likelihoods of phylogenetic models,
   highlighting several recent methods that provide well-behaved estimates.
   Furthermore, we review some empirical studies that demonstrate how
   marginal likelihoods can be used to learn about models of evolution from
   biological data. We discuss promising alternatives that can complement
   marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model choice, including
   posterior-predictive methods. Using simulations, we find one alternative
   method based on approximate-Bayesian computation to be biased. We
   conclude by discussing the challenges of Bayesian model choice and
   future directions that promise to improve the approximation of marginal
   likelihoods and Bayesian phylogenetics as a whole.},

Title = {Predicting Long Pendant Edges in Model Phylogenies, with Applications to
   Biodiversity and Tree Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {575-589},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {In the simplest phylogenetic diversification model (the pure-birth Yule
   process), lineages split independently at a constant rate lambda for
   time t. The length of a randomly chosen edge (either interior or
   pendant) in the resulting tree has an expected value that rapidly
   converges to 1/2 lambda as t grows and thus is essentially independent
   of t. However, the behavior of the length L of the longest pendant edge
   reveals remarkably different behavior: L converges to t/2 as the
   expected number of leaves grows. Extending this model to allow an
   extinction rate mu (where mu < lambda), we also establish a similar
   result for birth-death trees, except that t/2 is replaced by
   t/2.(1-mu/lambda). This ``complete{''} tree may contain subtrees that
   have died out before time t; for the ``reduced tree{''} that just
   involves the leaves present at time t and their direct ancestors, the
   longest pendant edge length L again converges to t/2. Thus, there is
   likely to be at least one extant species whose associated pendant branch
   attaches to the tree approximately half-way back in time to the origin
   of the entire clade. We also briefly consider the length of the shortest
   edges. Our results are relevant to phylogenetic diversity indices in
   biodiversity conservation, and to quantifying the length of aligned
   sequences required to correctly infer a tree. We compare our theoretical
   results with simulations and with the branch lengths from a recent
   phylogenetic tree of all mammals.},

Abstract = {The complex island archipelagoes of Wallacea and Melanesia have provided
   empirical data behind integral theories in evolutionary biology,
   including allopatric speciation and island biogeography. Yet, questions
   regarding the relative impact of the layered biogeographic barriers,
   such as deep-water trenches and isolated island systems, on faunal
   diversification remain underexplored. One such barrier is Wallace's
   Line, a significant biogeographic boundary that largely separates
   Australian and Asian biodiversity. To assess the relative roles of
   biogeographic barriers-specifically isolated island systems and
   Wallace's Line-we investigated the tempo and mode of diversification in
   a diverse avian radiation, Corvides (Crows and Jays, Birds-of-paradise,
   Vangas, and allies). We combined a genus-level data set of thousands of
   ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and a species-level, 12-gene Sanger
   sequence matrix to produce a well-resolved supermatrix tree that we
   leveraged to explore the group's historical biogeography and the effects
   of the biogeographic barriers on their macroevolutionary dynamics. The
   tree is well resolved and differs substantially from what has been used
   extensively for past comparative analyses within this group. We
   confirmed that Corvides, and its major constituent clades, arose in
   Australia and that a burst of dispersals west across Wallace's Line
   occurred after the uplift of Wallacea during the mid-Miocene. We found
   that dispersal across this biogeographic barrier was generally rare,
   though westward dispersals were two times more frequent than eastward
   dispersals. Wallacea's central position between Sundaland and Sahul no
   doubt acted as a bridge for island-hopping dispersal out of Australia,
   across Wallace's Line, to colonize the rest of Earth. In addition, we
   found that the complex island archipelagoes east of Wallace's Line
   harbor the highest rates of net diversification and are a substantial
   source of colonists to continental systems on both sides of this
   biogeographic barrier. Our results support emerging evidence that island
   systems, particularly the geologically complex archipelagoes of the
   Indo-pacific, are drivers of species diversification. {[}Historical

Title = {Target Enrichment and Extensive Population Sampling Help Untangle the

Volume = {72},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Oenothera sect. Calylophus is a North American group of 13 recognized
   taxa in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) with an evolutionary
   history that may include independent origins of bee pollination, edaphic
   endemism, and permanent translocation heterozygosity. Like other groups
   that radiated relatively recently and rapidly, taxon boundaries within
   Oenothera sect. Calylophus have remained challenging to circumscribe. In
   this study, we used target enrichment, flanking noncoding regions, gene
   tree/species tree methods, tests for gene flow modified for
   target-enrichment data, and morphometric analysis to reconstruct
   phylogenetic hypotheses, evaluate current taxon circumscriptions, and
   examine character evolution in Oenothera sect. Calylophus. Because sect.
   Calylophus comprises a clade with a relatively restricted geographic
   range, we were able to extensively sample across the range of
   geographic, edaphic, and morphological diversity in the group. We found
   that the combination of exons and flanking noncoding regions led to
   improved support for species relationships. We reconstructed potential
   hybrid origins of some accessions and note that if processes such as
   hybridization are not taken into account, the number of inferred
   evolutionary transitions may be artificially inflated. We recovered
   strong evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of bee pollination
   from ancestral hawkmoth pollination, edaphic specialization on gypsum,
   and permanent translocation heterozygosity. This study applies newly
   emerging techniques alongside dense infraspecific sampling and
   morphological analyses to effectively reconstruct the recalcitrant
   history of a rapid radiation. {[}Gypsum endemism; Oenothera sect.

Title = {Species Tree Inference Methods Intended to Deal with Incomplete Lineage
   Sorting Are Robust to the Presence of Paralogs},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {367-381},

Abstract = {Many recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring
   species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete
   lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for
   phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus are assumed to
   consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in
   more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from
   the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for
   analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: what happens
   if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy
   is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through
   simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we
   show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide
   accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are
   based directly on the multispecies coalescent model, and some of which
   have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat
   the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as
   paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases, the
   inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using
   single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the
   use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not
   have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase
   the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.{[}Gene

Abstract = {The Neotropics harbor the most species-rich freshwater fish fauna on the
   planet, but the timing of that exceptional diversification remains
   unclear. Did the Neotropics accumulate species steadily throughout their
   long history, or attain their remarkable diversity recently? Biologists
   have long debated the relative support for these museum and cradle
   hypotheses, but few phylogenies of megadiverse tropical clades have
   included sufficient taxa to distinguish between them. We used 1288
   ultraconserved element loci spanning 293 species, 211 genera, and 21
   families of characoid fishes to reconstruct a new, fossil-calibrated
   phylogeny and infer the most likely diversification scenario for a clade
   that includes a third of Neotropical fish diversity. This phylogeny
   implies paraphyly of the traditional delimitation of Characiformes
   because it resolves the largely Neotropical Characoidei as the sister
   lineage of Siluriformes (catfishes), rather than the African
   Citharinodei. Time-calibrated phylogenies indicate an ancient origin of
   major characoid lineages and reveal a much more recent emergence of most
   characoid species. Diversification rate analyses infer increased
   speciation and decreased extinction rates during the Oligocene at around
   30 Ma during a period of mega-wetland formation in the
   proto-Orinoco-Amazonas. Three species-rich and ecomorphologically
   diverse lineages (Anostomidae, Serrasalmidae, and Characidae) that
   originated more than 60 Ma in the Paleocene experienced particularly
   notable bursts of Oligocene diversification and now account collectively
   for 68\% of the approximately 2150 species of Characoidei. In addition
   to paleogeographic changes, we discuss potential accelerants of
   diversification in these three lineages. While the Neotropics
   accumulated a museum of ecomorphologically diverse characoid lineages
   long ago, this geologically dynamic region also cradled a much more
   recent birth of remarkable species-level diversity.},

Abstract = {The analysis of time-resolved phylogenies (timetrees) and geographic
   location data allows estimation of dispersal rates, for example, for
   invasive species and infectious diseases. Many estimation methods are
   based on the Brownian Motion model for diffusive dispersal on a 2D
   plane; however, the accuracy of these methods deteriorates substantially
   when dispersal occurs at global scales because spherical Brownian motion
   (SBM) differs from planar Brownian motion. No statistical method exists
   for estimating SBM diffusion coefficients from a given timetree and tip
   coordinates, and no method exists for simulating SBM along a given time
   tree. Here, I present new methods for simulating SBM along a given
   timetree, and for estimating SBM diffusivity from a given timetree and
   tip coordinates using a modification of Felsenstein's independent
   contrasts and maximum likelihood. My simulation and fitting methods can
   accommodate arbitrary time-dependent diffusivities and scale efficiently
   to trees with millions of tips, thus enabling new analyses even in cases
   where planar BM would be a sufficient approximation. I demonstrate these
   methods using a timetree of marine and terrestrial Cyanobacterial
   genomes, as well as timetrees of two globally circulating Influenza B
   clades. My methods are implemented in the R package ``castor.{''}},

Title = {Global Diversification of Anelosimus Spiders Driven by Long-Distance
   Overwater Dispersal and Neogene Climate Oscillations},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {69},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vicariance and dispersal events, combined with intricate global climatic
   history, have left an imprint on the spatiotemporal distribution and
   diversity of many organisms. Anelosimus cobweb spiders (Theridiidae),
   are organisms ranging in behavior from solitary to highly social, with a
   cosmopolitan distribution in temperate to tropical areas. Their
   evolutionary history and the discontinuous distribution of species
   richness suggest that 1) long-distance overwater dispersal and 2)
   climate change during the Neogene (23-2.6 Ma), may be major factors in
   explaining their distribution and diversification. Here, we test these
   hypotheses, and explicitly test if global Miocene/Pliocene climatic
   cooling in the last 8 Ma affected Anelosimus radiation in parallel in
   South America and Madagascar. To do so, we investigate the phylogeny and
   spatiotemporal biogeography of Anelosimus through a culmination of a
   20-year comprehensive global sampling at the species level (69 species,
   including 84\% of the known 75 species worldwide, represented by 268
   individuals) using nucleotide data from seven loci (5.5 kb). Our results
   strongly support the monophyly of Anelosimus with an Oligocene (similar
   to 30 Ma) South American origin. Major clades on other continents
   originate via multiple, long-distance dispersal events, of solitary or
   subsocial-but not social-lineages, from the Americas. These
   intercontinental dispersals were to Africa, Madagascar (twice), and SE
   Asia/Australasia. The early diversification of Anelosimus spiders
   coincides with a sudden thermal increase in the late Oligocene (similar
   to 27-25 Ma), though no causal connection can be made. Our results,
   however, strongly support the hypothesis that global Neogene climatic
   cooling in the last 8 Ma drove Anelosimus radiation in parallel in South
   America and Madagascar, offering a rare empirical evidence for
   diversification of a socially diverse group driven by an interplay
   between long-distance dispersal and global Neogene climatic changes.},

Title = {Estimating Phylogenies from Shape and Similar Multidimensional Data: Why
   It Is Not Reliable},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been controversy whether multidimensional
   data such as geometric morphometric data or information on gene
   expression can be used for estimating phylogenies. This study uses
   simulations of evolution in multidimensional phenotype spaces to address
   this question and to identify specific factors that are important for
   answering it. Most of the simulations use phylogenies with four taxa, so
   that there are just three possible unrooted trees and the effect of
   different combinations of branch lengths can be studied systematically.
   In a comparison of methods, squared-change parsimony performed similarly
   well as maximum likelihood, and both methods outperformed Wagner and
   Euclidean parsimony, neighbor-joining and UPGMA. Under an evolutionary
   model of isotropic Brownian motion, phylogeny can be estimated reliably
   if dimensionality is high, even with relatively unfavorable combinations
   of branch lengths. By contrast, if there is phenotypic integration such
   that most variation is concentrated in one or a few dimensions, the
   reliability of phylogenetic estimates is severely reduced. Evolutionary
   models with stabilizing selection also produce highly unreliable
   estimates, which are little better than picking a phylogenetic tree at
   random. To examine how these results apply to phylogenies with more than
   four taxa, we conducted further simulations with up to eight taxa, which
   indicated that the effects of dimensionality and phenotypic integration
   extend to more than four taxa, and that convergence among internal nodes
   may produce additional complications specifically for greater numbers of
   taxa. Overall, the simulations suggest that multidimensional data, under
   evolutionary models that are plausible for biological data, do not
   produce reliable estimates of phylogeny.},

   Computed Tomography for Species Delimitation in Cryptic Taxa},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Morphologically cryptic taxa have proved to be a long-standing challenge
   for taxonomists. Lineages that show strong genomic structuring across
   the landscape but are phenotypically similar pose a conundrum, with
   traditional morphological analyses of these cryptic lineages struggling
   to keep up with species delimitation advances. Micro X-ray computed
   tomography (CT) combined with geometric morphometric analyses provides a
   promising avenue for identification of morphologically cryptic taxa,
   given its ability to detect subtle differences in anatomical structures.
   However, this approach has yet to be used in combination with genomic
   data in a comparative analytical framework to distinguish cryptic taxa.
   We present an integrative approach incorporating genomic and geometric
   morphometric evidence to assess the species delimitation of grassland
   earless dragons (Tympanocryptis spp.) in north-eastern Australia. Using
   mitochondrial and nuclear genes (ND2 and RAG1, respectively), along with
   >8500 SNPs (nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms), we assess the
   evolutionary independence of target lineages and several closely related
   species. We then integrate phylogenomic data with osteological cranial
   variation between lineages using landmark-based analyses of
   three-dimensional CT models. High levels of genomic differentiation
   between the three target lineages were uncovered, also supported by
   significant osteological differences. By incorporating multiple lines of
   evidence, we provide strong support for three undescribed cryptic
   lineages of Tympana rypl is in north-eastern Australia that warrant
   taxonomic review. Our approach demonstrates the successful application
   of CT with integrative taxonomic approaches for cryptic species
   delimitation, which is broadly applicable across vertebrates containing
   morphologically similar yet genetically distinct lineages. Additionally,
   we provide a review of recent integrative taxonomic approaches for
   cryptic species delimitation and an assessment of how our approach can

Title = {The Relative Importance of Modeling Site Pattern Heterogeneity Versus
   Partition-Wise Heterotachy in Phylogenomic Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Pages = {1003-1019},

Abstract = {Large taxa-rich genome-scale data sets are often necessary for resolving
   ancient phylogenetic relationships. But accurate phylogenetic inference
   requires that they are analyzed with realistic models that account for
   the heterogeneity in substitution patterns amongst the sites, genes and
   lineages. Two kinds of adjustments are frequently used: models that
   account for heterogeneity in amino acid frequencies at sites in
   proteins, and partitioned models that accommodate the heterogeneity in
   rates (branch lengths) among different proteins in different lineages
   (protein-wise heterotachy). Although partitioned and site-heterogeneous
   models are both widely used in isolation, their relative importance to
   the inference of correct phylogenies has not been carefully evaluated.
   We conducted several empirical analyses and a large set of simulations
   to compare the relative performances of partitioned models,
   site-heterogeneous models, and combined partitioned site heterogeneous
   models. In general, site-homogeneous models (partitioned or not)
   performed worse than site heterogeneous, except in simulations with
   extreme protein-wise heterotachy. Furthermore, simulations using
   empirically-derived realistic parameter settings showed a marked
   long-branch attraction (LBA) problem for analyses employing protein-wise
   partitioning even when the generating model included partitioning. This
   LBA problem results from a small sample bias compounded over many single
   protein alignments. In some cases, this problem was ameliorated by
   clustering similarly-evolving proteins together into larger partitions
   using the PartitionFinder method. Similar results were obtained under
   simulations with larger numbers of taxa or heterogeneity in simulating
   topologies over genes. For an empirical Microsporidia test data set, all
   but one tested site-heterogeneous models (with or without partitioning)
   obtain the correct Microsporidia+Fungi grouping, whereas site-homogenous
   models (with or without partitioning) did not. The single exception was
   the fully partitioned site-heterogeneous analysis that succumbed to the
   compounded small sample LBA bias. In general unless protein-wise
   heterotachy effects are extreme, it is more important to model
   site-heterogeneity than protein-wise heterotachy in phylogenomic
   analyses. Complete protein-wise partitioning should be avoided as it can
   lead to a serious LBA bias. In cases of extreme protein-wise
   heterotachy, approaches that cluster similarly-evolving proteins
   together and coupled with site-heterogeneous models work well for
   phylogenetic estimation.},

Title = {Using Historical Biogeography Models to Study Color Pattern Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {755-766},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Color is among the most striking features of organisms, varying not only
   in spectral properties like hue and brightness, but also in where and
   how it is produced on the body. Different combinations of colors on a
   bird's body are important in both environmental and social contexts.
   Previous comparative studies have treated plumage patches individually
   or derived plumage complexity scores from color measurements across a
   bird's body. However, these approaches do not consider the multivariate
   nature of plumages (allowing for plumage to evolve as a whole) or
   account for interpatch distances. Here, we leverage a rich toolkit used
   in historical biogeography to assess color pattern evolution in a
   cosmopolitan radiation of birds, kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae). We
   demonstrate the utility of this approach and test hypotheses about the
   tempo and mode of color evolution in kingfishers. Our results highlight
   the importance of considering interpatch distances in understanding
   macroevolutionary trends in color diversity and demonstrate how
   historical biogeography models are a useful way to model plumage color
   pattern evolution. Furthermore, they show that distinct color mechanisms
   (pigments or structural colors) spread across the body in different ways
   and at different rates. Specifically, net rates are higher for
   structural colors than pigment-based colors. Together, our study
   suggests a role for both development and selection in driving
   extraordinary color pattern diversity in kingfishers. We anticipate this
   approach will be useful for modeling other complex phenotypes besides
   color, such as parasite evolution across the body.},

Abstract = {As we collect range-wide genetic data for morphologically-defined
   species, we increasingly unearth evidence for cryptic diversity.
   Delimiting this cryptic diversity is challenging, both because the
   divergences span a continuum and because the lack of overt morphological
   differentiation suggests divergence has proceeded heterogeneously.
   Herein, we address these challenges as we diagnose and describe species
   in three co-occurring species groups of Australian lizards. By
   integrating genomic and morphological data with data on hybridization
   and introgression from contact zones, we explore several approaches-and
   their relative benefits and weaknesses-for testing the validity of
   cryptic lineages. More generally, we advocate that genetic delimitations
   of cryptic diversity must consider whether these lineages are likely to
   be durable and persistent through evolutionary time.},

Title = {The Effect of Gene Flow on Coalescent-based Species-Tree Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {770-785},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most current methods for inferring species-level phylogenies under the
   coalescent model assume that no gene flow occurs following speciation.
   Several studies have examined the impact of gene flow (e.g., Eckert and
   Carstens 2008; Chung and Ane 2011; Leache et al. 2014; Solis-Lemus et
   al. 2016) and of ancestral population structure (DeGeorgio and Rosenberg
   2016) on the performance of species-level phylogenetic inference, and
   analytic results have been proven for network models of gene flow (e.g.,
   Solis-Lemus et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016). However, there are few
   analytic results for a continuous model of gene flow following
   speciation, despite the development of mathematical tools that could
   facilitate such study (e.g., Hobolth et al. 2011; Andersen et al. 2014;
   Tian and Kubatko 2016). In this article, we consider a three-taxon
   isolation-with-migration model that allows gene flow between sister taxa
   for a brief period following speciation, as well as variation in the
   effective population sizes across the species tree. We derive the
   probabilities of each of the three gene tree topologies under this
   model, and show that for certain choices of the gene flow and effective
   population size parameters, anomalous gene trees (i.e., gene trees that
   are discordant with the species tree but that have higher probability
   than the gene tree concordant with the species tree) exist. We
   characterize the region of parameter space producing anomalous trees and
   show that the probability of the gene tree that is concordant with the
   species tree can be arbitrarily small. We then show that there is
   theoretical support for using SVDQuartets with an outgroup to infer the
   rooted three-taxon species tree in a model of gene flow between sister
   taxa. We study the performance of SVDQuartets on simulated data and
   compare it to three other commonly-used methods for species tree
   inference, ASTRAL, MP-EST, and concatenation. The simulations show that
   ASTRAL, MP-EST, and concatenation can be statistically inconsistent when
   gene flow is present, while SVDQuartets performs well, though large
   sample sizes may be required for certain parameter choices.},

Abstract = {The supergroup Holomycota, composed of Fungi and several related
   lineages of unicellular organisms (Nucleariida, Rozellida,
   Microsporidia, and Aphelida), represents one of the major branches in
   the phylogeny of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, except for the
   well-established position of Nucleariida as the first holomycotan branch
   to diverge, the relationships among the other lineages have so far
   remained unresolved largely owing to the lack of molecular data for some
   groups. This was notably the case aphelids, a poorly known group of
   endobiotic phagotrophic protists that feed on algae with cellulose
   walls. The first molecular phylogenies including aphelids supported
   their sister relationship with Rozellida and Microsporidia which,
   collectively, formed a new group called Opisthosporidia (the
   ``Opisthosporidia hypothesis{''}). However, recent phylogenomic analyses
   including massive sequence data from two aphelid genera, Paraphelidium
   and Amoeboaphelidium, suggested that the aphelids are sister to fungi
   (the ``Aphelida + Fungi hypothesis{''}). Should this position be
   confirmed, aphelids would be key to understanding the early evolution of
   Holomycota and the origin of Fungi. Here, we carry out phylogenomic
   analyses with an expanded taxonomic sampling for aphelids after
   sequencing the transcriptomes of two species of the genus Aphelidium
   (Aphelidium insulamus and Aphelidium tribonematis) in order to test
   these competing hypotheses. Our new phylogenomic analyses including
   species from the three known aphelid genera strongly rejected the
   Opisthosporidia hypothesis. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses
   further supported the Aphelida + Fungi hypothesis via the identification
   of 19 orthologous genes exclusively shared by these two lineages. Seven
   of them originated from ancient horizontal gene transfer events
   predating the aphelid-fungal split and the remaining 12 likely evolved
   de novo, constituting additional molecular synapomorphies for this lade.
   Ancestral trait reconstruction based on our wellresolved phylogeny of
   Holomycota suggests that the progenitor of both fungi and rozellids, was
   aphelid-like, having an amoeboflagellate state and likely preying
   endobiotically on cellulose-containing, cell-walled organisms. Two
   lineages, which we propose to call Phytophagea and Opisthophagea,
   evolved from this ancestor. Phytophagea, grouping aphelids and classical
   fungi, mainly specialized in endobiotic predation of algal cells. Fungi
   emerged from this lineage after losing phagotrophy in favor of
   osmotrophy. Opisthophagea, grouping rozellids and Microsporidia, became
   parasites, mostly of chitin-containing hosts. This lineage entered a
   progressive reductive process that resulted in a unique lifestyle,
   especially in the highly derived Microsporidia.},

Title = {Towards Large-Scale Integrative Taxonomy (LIT): Resolving the Data
   Conundrum for Dark Taxa},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1404-1422},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {New, rapid, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective species discovery and
   delimitation methods are needed for tackling ``dark taxa,{''} here
   defined as groups for which <10\% of all species are described and the
   estimated diversity exceeds 1,000 species. Species delimitation for
   these taxa should be based on multiple data sources ({''}integrative
   taxonomy{''}) but collecting multiple types of data risks impeding a
   discovery process that is already too slow. We here develop large-scale
   integrative taxonomy (LIT), an explicit method where preliminary species
   hypotheses are generated based on inexpensive data that can be obtained
   quickly and cost-effectively. These hypotheses are then evaluated based
   on a more expensive type of ``validation data{''} that is only obtained
   for specimens selected based on objective criteria applied to the
   preliminary species hypotheses. We here use this approach to sort 18,000
   scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) into 315 preliminary species
   hypotheses based on next-generation sequencing barcode (313 bp) clusters
   (using objective clustering {[}OC] with a 3\% threshold). These clusters
   are then evaluated with morphology as the validation data. We develop
   quantitative indicators for predicting which barcode clusters are likely
   to be incongruent with morphospecies by randomly selecting 100 clusters
   for in-depth validation with morphology. A linear model demonstrates
   that the best predictors for incongruence between barcode clusters and
   morphology are maximum p-distance within the cluster and a newly
   proposed index that measures cluster stability across different
   clustering thresholds. A test of these indicators using the 215
   remaining clusters reveals that these predictors correctly identify all
   clusters that are incongruent with morphology. In our study, all
   morphospecies are true or disjoint subsets of the initial barcode
   clusters so that all incongruence can be eliminated by varying
   clustering thresholds. This leads to a discussion of when a third data
   source is needed to resolve incongruent grouping statements. The
   morphological validation step in our study involved 1,039 specimens
   (5.8\% of the total). The formal LIT protocol we propose would only have
   required the study of 915 (5.1\%: 2.5 specimens per species), as we show
   that clusters without signatures of incongruence can be validated by
   only studying two specimens representing the most divergent haplotypes.
   To test the generality of our results across different barcode
   clustering techniques, we establish that the levels of incongruence are
   similar across OC, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Poisson Tree
   Processes (PTP), and Refined Single Linkage (RESL) (used by Barcode of
   Life Data System to assign Barcode Index Numbers {[}BINS]). OC and ABGD
   achieved a maximum congruence score with the morphology of 89\% while
   PTP was slightly less effective (84\%). RESL could only be tested for a
   subset of the specimens because the algorithm is not public. BINs based
   on 277 of the original 1,714 haplotypes were 86\% congruent with
   morphology while the values were 89\% for OC, 74\% for PTP, and 72\% for
   ABGD.},

Title = {Detecting Phylogenetic Signal and Adaptation in Papionin Cranial Shape

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic reconstruction based on morphometric data is hampered by
   homoplasies. For example, many similarities in cranial form between
   primate taxa more strongly reflect ecological similarities rather than
   phylogenetic relatedness. However, the way in which the different
   cranial bones constitute cranial form is, if at all, of less functional
   relevance and thus largely hidden from selection. We propose that these
   ``constructional details{''} are better indicators of phylogenetic
   history than any large-scale shape feature or raw form variable. Within
   a geometric morphometric context, we show how to analyze the relative
   extent of bones independently of differences in overall shape. We also
   show how to decompose total shape variation into small-scale and
   large-scale shape variation. We apply both methods to the midsagittal
   cranial morphology of papionin monkeys, which are well known for the
   discrepancy between morphological similarities and phylogenetic
   relationships. We study phylogenetic signal and functional adaptation
   using a molecular phylogeny and contextual data on feeding ecology and
   locomotor behavior. As expected, total cranial shape, bone outline
   shape, and large-scale shape features were only weakly associated with
   phylogenetic distance. But the relative bone contributions and
   small-scale shape features were both highly correlated with phylogenetic
   distances. By contrast, the association with ecological and behavioral
   variables was strongest for the outline shape and large-scale shape
   features. Studies of morphological adaptation and phylogenetic history
   thus profit from a decomposition of shape variation into different
   spatial scales.},

Title = {Ultraconserved Elements Improve the Resolution of Difficult Nodes within
   the Rapid Radiation of Neotropical Sigmodontine Rodents (Cricetidae:

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sigmodontine rodents (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae) represent the second
   largest muroid subfamily and the most species-rich group of New World
   mammals, encompassing above 410 living species and ca. 87 genera. Even
   with advances on the clarification of sigmodontine phylogenetic
   relationships that have been made recently, the phylogenetic
   relationships among the 12 main groups of genera (i.e., tribes) remain
   poorly resolved, in particular among those forming the large Glade
   Oryzomyalia. This pattern has been interpreted as consequence of a rapid
   radiation upon the group entrance into South America. Here, we attempted
   to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Sigmodontinae using target
   capture and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements
   (UCEs). We enriched and sequenced UCEs for 56 individuals and collected
   data from four already available genomes. Analyses of distinct data
   sets, based on the capture of 4634 loci, resulted in a highly resolved
   phylogeny consistent across different methods. Coalescent
   species-tree-based approaches, concatenated matrices, and Bayesian
   analyses recovered similar topologies that were congruent at the
   resolution of difficult nodes. We recovered good support for the
   intertribal relationships within Oryzomyalia; for instance, the tribe
   Oryzomyini appears as the sister taxa of the remaining oryzomyalid
   tribes. The estimates of divergence times agree with the results of
   previous studies. We inferred the crown age of the sigmodontine rodents
   at the end of the Middle Miocene, while the main lineages of Oryzomyalia
   appear to have radiated in a short interval during the Late Miocene.
   Thus, the collection of a genomic-scale data set with a wide taxonomic
   sampling provided resolution for the first time of the relationships
   among the main lineages of Sigmodontinae. We expect the phylogeny
   presented here will become the backbone for future systematic and
   evolutionary studies of the group.},

Title = {On the Effect of Asymmetrical Trait Inheritance on Models of Trait
   Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Current phylogenetic comparative methods modeling quantitative trait
   evolution generally assume that, during speciation, phenotypes are
   inherited identically between the two daughter species. This, however,
   neglects the fact that species consist of a set of individuals, each
   bearing its own trait value. Indeed, because descendent populations
   after speciation are samples of a parent population, we can expect their
   mean phenotypes to randomly differ from one another potentially
   generating a ``jump{''} of mean phenotypes due to asymmetrical trait
   inheritance at cladogenesis. Here, we aim to clarify the effect of
   asymmetrical trait inheritance at speciation on macroevolutionary
   analyses, focusing on model testing and parameter estimation using some
   of the most common models of quantitative trait evolution. We developed
   an individual-based simulation framework in which the evolution of
   phenotypes is determined by trait changes at the individual level
   accumulating across generations, and cladogenesis occurs then by
   separation of subsets of the individuals into new lineages. Through
   simulations, we assess the magnitude of phenotypic jumps at cladogenesis
   under different modes of trait inheritance at speciation. We show that
   even small jumps can strongly alter both the results of model selection
   and parameter estimations, potentially affecting the biological
   interpretation of the estimated mode of evolution of a trait. Our
   results call for caution when interpreting analyses of trait evolution,
   while highlighting the importance of testing a wide range of alternative
   models. In the light of our findings, we propose that future
   methodological advances in comparative methods should more explicitly
   model the intraspecific variability around species mean phenotypes and
   how it is inherited at speciation.},

Abstract = {The common ancestor of spiders likely used silk to line burrows or make
   simple webs, with specialized spinning organs and aerial webs
   originating with the evolution of the megadiverse ``true spiders{''}
   (Araneomorphae). The base of the araneomorph tree also concentrates the
   greatest number of changes in respiratory structures, a character system
   whose evolution is still poorly understood, and that might be related to
   the evolution of silk glands. Emphasizing a densesampling of multiple
   araneomorph lineages where tracheal systems likely originated, we
   gathered genomic-scale data and reconstructed a phylogeny of true
   spiders. This robust phylogenomic framework was used to conduct maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian character evolution analyses for respiratory
   systems, silk glands, and aerial webs, based on a combination of
   original and published data. Our results indicate that in true spiders,
   posterior book lungs were transformed into morphologically similar
   tracheal systems six times independently, after the evolution of novel
   silk gland systems and the origin of aerial webs. From these comparative
   data, we put forth a novel hypothesis that early-diverging web-building
   spiders were faced with new energetic demands for spinning, which
   prompted the evolution of similar tracheal systems via convergence; we
   also propose tests of predictions derived from this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Fossils are the only remaining evidence of the majority of species that
   have ever existed, providing a direct window into events in evolutionary
   history that shaped the diversification of life on Earth. Phylogenies
   underpin our ability to make sense of evolution but are routinely
   inferred using only data available from living organisms. Although
   extinct taxa have been shown to add crucial information for inferring
   macroevolutionary patterns and processes (such as ancestral states,
   paleobiogeography and diversification dynamics), the role fossils play
   in reconstructing phylogeny is controversial. Since the early years of
   phylogenetic systematics, different studies have dismissed the impact of
   fossils due to their incompleteness, championed their ability to
   overturn phylogenetic hypotheses or concluded that their behavior is
   indistinguishable from that of extant taxa. Based on taxon addition
   experiments on empirical data matrices, we show that the inclusion of
   paleontological data has a remarkable effect in phylogenetic inference.
   Incorporating fossils often (yet not always) induces stronger
   topological changes than increasing sampling of extant taxa. Fossils
   also produce unique topological rearrangements, allowing the exploration
   of regions of treespace that are never visited by analyses of only
   extant taxa. Previous studies have proposed a suite of explanations for
   the topological behavior of fossils, such as their retention of unique
   morphologies or their ability to break long branches. We develop
   predictive models that demonstrate that the possession of distinctive
   character state combinations is the primary predictor of the degree of
   induced topological change, and that the relative impact of taxa (fossil
   and extant) can be predicted to some extent before any phylogenetic
   analysis. Our results bolster the consensus of recent empirical studies
   by showing the unique role of paleontological data in phylogenetic
   inference, and provide the first quantitative assessment of its
   determinants, with broad consequences for the design of taxon sampling
   in both morphological and total-evidence analyses.},

Abstract = {Molecular sequence data that have evolved under the influence of
   heterotachous evolutionary processes are known to mislead phylogenetic
   inference. We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single
   Topology (GHOST) model of sequence evolution, implemented under a
   maximum-likelihood framework in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE
   (hap://www.iqtree.org). Simulations show that using the GHOST model,
   IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology, branch lengths, and
   substitution model parameters from heterotachously evolved sequences. We
   investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data by
   sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome
   alignment. We then carry out inference under the GHOST model on a
   phylogenomic data set composed of 248 genes from 16 taxa, where we find
   the GHOST model concurs with the currently accepted view, placing
   turtles as a sister lineage of archosaurs, in contrast to results
   obtained using traditional variable rates-across-sites models. Finally,
   we apply the model to a data set composed of a sodium channel gene of 11
   fish taxa, finding that the GHOST model is able to elucidate a subtle
   component of the historical signal, linked to the previously established
   convergent evolution of the electric organ in two geographically
   distinct lineages of electric fish. We compare inference under the GHOST
   model to partitioning by codon position and show that, owing to the
   minimization of model constraints, the GHOST model offers unique
   biological insights when applied to empirical data.},

Title = {Statistical Comparison of Trait-Dependent Biogeographical Models
   Indicates That Podocarpaceae Dispersal Is Influenced by Both Seed Cone
   Traits and Geographical Distance},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The ability of lineages to disperse long distances over evolutionary
   timescales may be influenced by the gain or loss of traits adapted to
   enhance local, ecological dispersal. For example, some species in the
   southern conifer family Podocarpaceae have fleshy cones that encourage
   bird dispersal, but it is unknown how this trait has influenced the
   clade's historical biogeography, or its importance compared with other
   predictors of dispersal such as the geographic distance between regions.
   We answer these questions quantitatively by using a dated phylogeny of
   197 species of southern conifers (Podocarpaceae and their sister family
   Araucariaceae) to statistically compare standard, trait-independent
   biogeography models with new BioGeoBEARS models where an evolving trait
   can influence dispersal probability, and trait history, biogeographical
   history, and model parameters are jointly inferred. We validate the
   method with simulation-inference experiments. Comparing all models,
   those that include trait-dependent dispersal accrue 87.5\% of the
   corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model weight. Averaged
   across all models, lineages with nonfleshy cones had a dispersal
   probability multiplier of 0.49 compared with lineages with fleshy cones.
   Distance is included as a predictor of dispersal in all credible models
   (100\% model weight). However, models with changing geography earned
   only 22.0\% of the model weight, and models submerging New Caledonia/New
   Zealand earned only 0.01\%. The importance of traits and distance
   suggests that long-distance dispersal over macroevolutionary timespans
   should not be thought of as a highly unpredictable chance event.
   Instead, long-distance dispersal can be modeled, allowing statistical
   model comparison to quantify support for different hypotheses.},

Title = {The Effect of Fossil Sampling on the Estimation of Divergence Times with
   the Fossilized Birth-Death Process},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Pages = {124-138},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Timescales are of fundamental importance to evolutionary biology as they
   facilitate hypothesis tests of historical evolutionary processes.
   Through the incorporation of fossil occurrence data, the fossilized
   birth-death (FBD) process provides a framework for estimating divergence
   times using more paleontological data than traditional node calibration
   approaches have allowed. The inclusion of more data can refine
   evolutionary timescale estimates, but for many taxonomic groups it is
   computationally infeasible to include all available fossil occurrence
   data. Here, we utilize both empirical data and a simulation framework to
   identify approaches to subsampling fossil occurrence data that result in
   the most accurate estimates of divergence times. To achieve this we
   assess the performance of the FBD-Skyline model when implementing
   multiple approaches to incorporating subsampled fossil occurrence data.
   Our results demonstrate that it is necessary to account for all
   available fossil occurrence data to achieve the most accurate estimates
   of clade age. We show that this can be achieved if an empirical Bayes
   approach, accounting for fossil sampling through time, is applied to the
   FBD process. Random subsampling of occurrence data can lead to estimates
   of clade age that are incompatible with fossil evidence if no control
   over the affinities of fossil occurrences is enforced. Our results call
   into question the accuracy of previous divergence time studies
   incorporating the FBD process that have used only a subsample of all
   available fossil occurrence data.},

Abstract = {Stochastic birth-death models provide the foundation for studying and
   simulating evolutionary trees in phylodynamics. A curious feature of
   such models is that they exhibit fundamental symmetries when the birth
   and death rates are interchanged. In this article, we first provide
   intuitive reasons for these known transformational symmetries. We then
   show that these transformational symmetries (encoded in algebraic
   identities) are preserved even when individuals at the present are
   sampled with some probability. However, these extended symmetries
   require the death rate parameter to sometimes take a negative value. In
   the last part of this article, we describe the relevance of these
   transformations and their application to computational phylodynamics,
   particularly to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods, as
   well as to model selection.},

Abstract = {Army ants are a charismatic group of organisms characterized by a suite
   of morphological and behavioral adaptations that includes obligate
   collective foraging, frequent colony relocation, and highly specialized
   wingless queens. This army ant syndrome underlies the ecological success
   of army ants and its evolution has been the subject of considerable
   debate. It has been argued to have arisen once or multiple times within
   the ant subfamily Dorylinae. To address this question in a phylogenetic
   framework I generated data from2166 loci and a comprehensive taxon
   sampling representing all 27 genera and 155 or approximately 22\% of
   doryline species. Most analyses show strong support for convergent
   evolution of the army ant syndrome in the Old and New World but certain
   relationships are sensitive to analytics. I examine the signal present
   in this data set and find that conflict is diminished when only loci
   less likely to violate common phylogenetic model assumptions are
   considered. I also provide a temporal and spatial context for doryline
   evolution with time-calibrated, biogeographic, and diversification rate
   shift analyses. This study shows that the army ant syndrome is both an
   example of remarkable convergence of a complex set of traits and a case
   of long-term evolutionary stasis. The sensitivity of some of the
   phylogenetic results underscores the need for cautious analysis of
   phylogenomic data and calls formore efficient algorithms employing
   better-fitting models of molecular evolution. Congruenceamongresults
   obtained using different analytics may be used to assess robustness in
   phylogenomics.},

Title = {Phylogeny, Macroevolutionary Trends and Historical Biogeography of
   Sloths: Insights From a Bayesian Morphological Clock Analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204-218},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sloths, like other xenarthrans, are an extremely interesting group of
   mammals that, after a long history of evolution and diversification in
   South America, became established on islands in the Caribbean and later
   reached North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. In
   all three regions, they were part of the impressive Pleistocene
   megafauna. Most taxa became extinct and only two small, distantly
   related tree-dwelling genera survived. Here, we incorporate several
   recently described genera of sloths into an assembled morphological data
   supermatrix and apply Bayesian inference, using phylogenetic and
   morphological clock methods, to 64 sloth genera. Thus, we investigate
   the evolution of the group in terms of the timing of divergence of
   different lineages and their diversity, morphological disparity and
   biogeographical history. The phylogeny obtained supports the existence
   of the commonly recognized clades for the group. Our results provide
   divergence time estimates for the major clades within Folivora that
   could not be dated with molecular methods. Lineage diversity shows an
   early increase, reaching a peak in the Early Miocene followed by a major
   drop at the end of the Santacrucian (Early Miocene). A second peak in
   the Late Miocene was also followed by a major drop at the end of the
   Huayquerian (Late Miocene). Both events show differential impact at the
   family level. After that, a slight Plio-Pleistocene decline was observed
   before the marked drop with the extinction at the end of the
   Pleistocene. Phenotypic evolutionary rates were high during the early
   history of the clade, mainly associated with Mylodontidae, but rapidly
   decreased to lower values around 25 Ma, whereas Megalonychidae had lower
   rates at the beginning followed by a steady increase, peaking during the
   Late Miocene and the Pliocene. Morphological disparity showed a similar
   trend, with an early increase, followed by a slowly increasing phase
   through the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene, and ending with another
   increase beginning at the middle of the Miocene. Biogeographic analysis
   showed southern South America as the most probable area of origin of the
   clade and the main region in which the early diversification events took
   place. Both Megatheriinae and Nothrotheriinae basal nodes were strongly
   correlated with Andean uplift events, whereas the early history of
   Mylodontidae is closely associated with southern South America and also
   shows an early occupation of the northern regions. Within
   Megalonychidae, our results show Choloepus as a descendant of an island
   dispersing ancestor and a probable re-ingression to South America by a
   clade that originated in Central or North America.},

Title = {Phylogenetic ComparativeMethods on Phylogenetic Networks with
   Reticulations},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {800-820},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The goal of phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) is to study the
   distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The observed
   traits are often seen as the result of a Brownian Motion (BM) along the
   branches of a phylogenetic tree. Reticulation events such as
   hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer, can substantially
   affect a species' traits, but are not modeled by a tree. Phylogenetic
   networks have been designed to represent reticulate evolution. As they
   become available for downstream analyses, new models of trait evolution
   are needed, applicable to networks. One natural extension of the BM is
   to use a weighted average model for the trait of a hybrid, at a
   reticulation point. We develop here an efficient recursive algorithmto
   compute the phylogenetic variance matrix of a trait on a network, in
   only one preorder traversal of the network. We then extend the standard
   PCM tools to this new framework, including phylogenetic regression with
   covariates (or phylogenetic ANOVA), ancestral trait reconstruction, and
   Pagel's lambda test of phylogenetic signal. The trait of a hybrid is
   sometimes outside of the range of its two parents, for instance because
   of hybrid vigor or hybrid depression. These two phenomena are rather
   commonly observed in present-day hybrids. Transgressive evolution can be
   modeled as a shift in the trait value following a reticulation point. We
   develop a general framework to handle such shifts and take advantage of
   the phylogenetic regression view of the problem to design statistical
   tests for ancestral transgressive evolution in the evolutionary history
   of a group of species. We study the power of these tests in several
   scenarios and show that recent events have indeed the strongest impact
   on the trait distribution of present-day taxa. We apply those methods to
   a data set of Xiphophorus fishes, to confirm and complete previous
   analysis in this group. All the methods developed here are available in
   the Julia package PhyloNetworks.},

Abstract = {African cichlids (subfamily: Pseudocrenilabrinae) are among the most
   diverse vertebrates, and their propensity for repeated rapid radiation
   has made them a celebrated model system in evolutionary research.
   Nonetheless, despite numerous studies, phylogenetic uncertainty
   persists, and riverine lineages remain comparatively underrepresented in
   higher-level phylogenetic studies. Heterogeneous gene histories
   resulting from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization are
   likely sources of uncertainty, especially during episodes of rapid
   speciation. We investigate the relationships of Pseudocrenilabrinae and
   its close relatives while accounting for multiple sources of genetic
   discordance using species tree and hybrid network analyses with hundreds
   of single-copy exons. We improve sequence recovery for distant
   relatives, thereby extending the taxonomic reach of our probes, with a
   hybrid reference guided/de novo assembly approach. Our analyses provide
   robust hypotheses for most higher-level relationships and reveal
   widespread gene heterogeneity, including in riverine taxa. ILS and past
   hybridization are identified as the sources of genetic discordance in
   different lineages. Sampling of various Blenniiformes (formerly
   Ovalentaria) adds strong phylogenomic support for convict blennies
   (Pholidichthyidae) as sister to Cichlidae and points to other
   potentially useful protein-coding markers across the order. A reliable
   phylogeny with representatives from diverse environments will support
   ongoing taxonomic and comparative evolutionary research in the cichlid
   model system. {[}African cichlids; Blenniiformes; Gene tree

Abstract = {A prominent question in animal research is how the evolution of
   morphology and ecology interacts in the generation of phenotypic
   diversity. Spiders are some of the most abundant arthropod predators in
   terrestrial ecosystems and exhibit a diversity of foraging styles. It
   remains unclear how spider body size and proportions relate to foraging
   style, and if the use of webs as prey capture devices correlates with
   changes in body characteristics. Here, we present the most extensive
   data set to date of morphometric and ecological traits in spiders. We
   used this data set to estimate the change in spider body sizes and
   shapes over deep time and to test if and how spider phenotypes are
   correlated with their behavioral ecology. We found that phylogenetic
   variation of most traits best fitted an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, which
   is a model of stabilizing selection. A prominent exception was body
   length, whose evolutionary dynamics were best explained with a Brownian
   Motion (free trait diffusion) model. This was most expressed in the
   araneoid clade (ecribellate orb-weaving spiders and allies) that showed
   bimodal trends toward either miniaturization or gigantism. Only few
   traits differed significantly between ecological guilds, most
   prominently leg length and thickness, and although a multivariate
   framework found general differences in traits among ecological guilds,
   it was not possible to unequivocally associate a set of morphometric
   traits with the relative ecological mode. Long, thin legs have often
   evolved with aerial webs and a hanging (suspended) locomotion style, but
   this trend is not general. Eye size and fang length did not differ
   between ecological guilds, rejecting the hypothesis that webs reduce the
   need for visual cue recognition and prey immobilization. For the
   inference of the ecology of species with unknown behaviors, we propose
   not to use morphometric traits, but rather consult (micro-)morphological
   characters, such as the presence of certain podal structures. These
   results suggest that, in contrast to insects, the evolution of body
   proportions in spiders is unusually stabilized and ecological
   adaptations are dominantly realized by behavioral traits and extended
   phenotypes in this group of predators. This work demonstrates the power
   of combining recent advances in phylogenomics with trait-based
   approaches to better understand global functional diversity patterns
   through space and time. {[}Animal architecture; Arachnida; Araneae;

Abstract = {An unprecedented amount of evidence now illuminates the phylogeny of
   living mammals and birds on the Tree of Life. We use this tree to
   measure the phylogenetic value of data typically used in paleontology
   (bones and teeth) from six data sets derived from five published
   studies. We ask three interrelated questions: 1) Can these data
   adequately reconstruct known parts of the Tree of Life? 2) Is accuracy
   generally similar for studies using morphology, or do some morphological
   data sets perform better than others? 3) Does the loss of
   non-fossilizable data cause taxa to occur in misleadingly basal
   positions? Adding morphology to DNA data sets usually increases
   congruence of resulting topologies to the well-corroborated tree, but
   this varies among morphological data sets. Extant taxa with a high
   proportion of missing morphological characters can greatly reduce
   phylogenetic resolution when analyzed together with fossils. Attempts to
   ameliorate this by deleting extant taxa missing morphology are prone to
   decreased accuracy due to long-branch artifacts. We find no evidence
   that fossilization causes extinct taxa to incorrectly appear at or near
   topologically basal branches. Morphology comprises the evidence held in
   common by living taxa and fossils, and phylogenetic analysis of fossils
   greatly benefits from inclusion of molecular and morphological data
   sampled for living taxa, whatever methods are used for phylogeny
   estimation. {[}Concatenation; fossilization; morphology; parsimony;

Title = {Uncertainty in Divergence Time Estimation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {855-861},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding and representing uncertainty is crucial in academic
   research because it enables studies to build on the conclusions of
   previous studies, leading to robust advances in a particular field.
   Here, we evaluate the nature of uncertainty and the manner by which it
   is represented in divergence time estimation, a field that is
   fundamental to many aspects of macroevolutionary research, and where
   there is evidence that uncertainty has been seriously underestimated. We
   address this issue in the context of methods used in divergence time
   estimation, and with respect to the manner by which time-calibrated
   phylogenies are interpreted. With respect to methods, we discuss how the
   assumptions underlying different methods may not adequately reflect
   uncertainty about molecular evolution, the fossil record, or
   diversification rates. Therefore, divergence time estimates may not
   adequately reflect uncertainty and may be directly contradicted by
   subsequent findings. For the interpretation of time-calibrated
   phylogenies, we discuss how the use of time-calibrated phylogenies for
   reconstructing general evolutionary timescales leads to inferences about
   macroevolution that are highly sensitive to methodological limitations
   in how uncertainty is accounted for. By contrast, we discuss how the use
   of time-calibrated phylogenies to test specific hypotheses leads to
   inferences about macroevolution that are less sensitive to
   methodological limitations. Given that many biologists wish to use
   time-calibrated phylogenies to reconstruct general evolutionary
   timescales, we conclude that the development of methods of divergence
   time estimation that adequately account for uncertainty is necessary.},

Title = {Phylogenomics of Parasitic and Nonparasitic Lice (Insecta: Psocodea):
   Combining Sequence Data and Exploring Compositional Bias Solutions in
   Next Generation Data Sets},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The insect order Psocodea is a diverse lineage comprising both parasitic
   (Phthiraptera) and nonparasitic members (Psocoptera). The extreme age
   and ecological diversity of the group may be associated with major
   genomic changes, such as base compositional biases expected to affect
   phylogenetic inference. Divergent morphology between parasitic and
   nonparasitic members has also obscured the origins of parasitism within
   the order. We conducted a phylogenomic analysis on the order Psocodea
   utilizing both transcriptome and genome sequencing to obtain a data set
   of 2370 orthologous genes. All phylogenomic analyses, including both
   concatenated and coalescent methods suggest a single origin of
   parasitism within the order Psocodea, resolving conflicting results from
   previous studies. This phylogeny allows us to propose a stable ordinal
   level classification scheme that retains significant taxonomic names
   present in historical scientific literature and reflects the evolution
   of the group as a whole. A dating analysis, with internal nodes
   calibrated by fossil evidence, suggests an origin of parasitism that
   predates the K-Pg boundary. Nucleotide compositional biases are detected
   in third and first codon positions and result in the anomalous placement
   of the Amphientometae as sister to Psocomorpha when all nucleotide sites
   are analyzed. Likelihood-mapping and quartet sampling methods
   demonstrate that base compositional biases can also have an effect on
   quartet-based methods.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Insights into the Origin of Primary Plastids},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-120},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The origin of plastids was a major evolutionary event that paved the way
   for an astonishing diversification of photosynthetic eukaryotes.
   Plastids originated by endosymbiosis between a heterotrophic eukaryotic
   host and cyanobacteria, presumably in a common ancestor of the primary
   photosynthetic eukaryotes (Archaeplastida). A single origin of primary
   plastids is well supported by plastid evidence but not by nuclear
   phylogenomic analyses, which have consistently failed to recover the
   monophyly of Archaeplastida hosts. Importantly, plastid monophyly and
   nonmonophyletic hosts could be explained under scenarios of independent
   or serial eukaryote-to-eukaryote endosymbioses. Here, we assessed the
   strength of the signal for the monophyly of Archaeplastida hosts in four
   available phylogenomic data sets. The effect of phylogenetic
   methodology, data quality, alignment trimming strategy, gene and taxon
   sampling, and the presence of outlier genes were investigated. Our
   analyses revealed a lack of support for host monophyly in the shorter
   individual data sets. However, when analyzed together under rigorous
   data curation and complex mixture models, the combined nuclear data sets
   supported the monophyly of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes
   (Archaeplastida) and recovered a putative association with
   plastid-lacking Picozoa. This study represents an important step toward
   better understanding deep eukaryotic evolution and the origin of
   plastids.},

Title = {Ecological Opportunity from Innovation, not Islands, Drove the Anole
   Lizard Adaptive Radiation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Islands are thought to facilitate adaptive radiation by providing
   release from competition and predation. Anole lizards are considered a
   classic example of this phenomenon: different ecological specialists
   ({''}ecomorphs{''}) evolved in the Caribbean Greater Antilles (Cuba,
   Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), resulting in convergent
   assemblages that are not observed in mainland Latin America. Yet, the
   role of islands in facilitating adaptive radiation is more often implied
   than directly tested, leaving uncertain the role of biogeography in
   stimulating diversification. Here, we assess the proposed ``island
   effect{''} on anole diversification using Bayesian phylogenetic
   comparative methods that explicitly incorporate rate heterogeneity
   across the tree and demonstrate two cases of would be false positives.
   We discovered that rates of speciation and morphological evolution of
   island and mainland anoles are equivalent, implying that islands provide
   no special context for exceptionally rapid diversification. Likewise,
   rates of evolution were equivalent between island anoles that arose via
   in situ versus dispersal-based mechanisms, and we found no evidence for
   island-specific rates of speciation or morphological evolution.
   Nonetheless, the origin of Anolis is characterized by a speciation pulse
   that slowed over time-a classic signature of waning ecological
   opportunity. Our findings cast doubt on the notion that islands
   catalyzed the anole adaptive radiation and instead point to a key
   innovation, adhesive toe pads, which facilitated the exploitation of
   many arboreal niches sparsely utilized by other iguanian lizards. The
   selective pressures responsible for arboreal niche diversification
   differ between islands and the mainland, but the tempo of
   diversification driven by these discordant processes is
   indistinguishable.},

Title = {Mapping Africa's Biodiversity: More of the Same Is Just Not Good Enough},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {623-633},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Species distribution data are fundamental to the understanding of
   biodiversity patterns and processes. Yet, such data are strongly
   affected by sampling biases, mostly related to site accessibility. The
   understanding of these biases is therefore crucial in systematics,
   biogeography, and conservation. Here we present a novel approach for
   quantifying sampling effort and its impact on biodiversity knowledge,
   focusing on Africa. In contrast to previous studies assessing sampling
   completeness (percentage of species recorded in relation to predicted),
   we investigate whether the lack of knowledge of a site attracts
   scientists to visit these areas and collect samples of species. We then
   estimate the time required to sample 90\% of the continent under a
   Weibull distributed biodiversity sampling rate and the number of
   sampling events required to record 50\% of the species. Using linear and
   spatial regression models, we show that previous sampling has been
   strongly influencing the resampling of areas, attracting repeated
   visits. This bias has existed for over two centuries, has increased in
   recent decades, and is most pronounced among mammals. It may take
   between 172 and 274 years, depending on the group, to achieve at least
   one sampling event per grid cell in the entire continent. Just one visit
   will, however, not be enough: in order to record 50\% of the current
   diversity, it will require at least 12 sampling events for amphibians,
   13 for mammals, and 27 for birds. Our results demonstrate the importance
   of sampling areas that lack primary biodiversity data and the urgency
   with which this needs to be done. Current practice is insufficient to
   adequately classify and map African biodiversity; it can lead to
   incorrect conclusions being drawn from biogeographic analyses and can
   result in misleading and self-reinforcing conservation priorities.},

Title = {Impact of Pleistocene Eustatic Fluctuations on Evolutionary Dynamics in
   Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Pages = {940-960},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pleistocene climatic fluctuations (PCF) are frequently highlighted as
   important evolutionary engines that triggered cycles of biome expansion
   and contraction. Although there is ample evidence of the impact of PCF
   on biodiversity of continental biomes, the consequences in insular
   systems depend on the geology of the islands and the ecology of the taxa
   inhabiting them. The idiosyncratic aspects of insular systems are
   exemplified by the islands of the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia
   (Sundaland), where PCF-induced eustatic fluctuations had complex
   interactions with the geology of the region, resulting in high species
   diversity and endemism. Emergent land in Southeast Asia varied
   drastically with sealevel fluctuations during the Pleistocene.
   Climate-induced fluctuations in sea level caused temporary connections
   between insular and continental biodiversity hotspots in Southeast Asia.
   These exposed lands likely had freshwater drainage systems that extended
   between modern islands: the Paleoriver Hypothesis. Built upon the
   assumption that aquatic organisms are among the most suitable models to
   trace ancient river boundaries and fluctuations of landmass coverage,
   the present study aims to examine the evolutionary consequences of PCF
   on the dispersal of freshwater biodiversity in Southeast Asia.
   Time-calibrated phylogenies of DNA-delimited species were inferred for
   six species-rich freshwater fish genera in Southeast Asia (Clarias,
   Channa, Glyptothorax, Hemirhamphodon, Dermogenys, Nomorhamphus). The
   results highlight rampant cryptic diversity and the temporal
   localization of most speciation events during the Pleistocene, with 88\%
   of speciation events occurring during this period. Diversification
   analyses indicate that sea-level-dependent diversification models poorly
   account for species proliferation patterns for all clades excepting
   Channa. Ancestral area estimations point to Borneo as the most likely
   origin for most lineages, with two waves of dispersal to Sumatra and
   Java during the last 5 myr. Speciation events are more frequently
   associated with boundaries of the paleoriver watersheds, with 60\%, than
   islands boundaries, with 40\%. In total, one-third of speciation events
   are inferred to have occurred within paleorivers on a single island,
   suggesting that habitat heterogeneity and factors other than allopatry
   between islands substantially affected diversification of Sundaland
   fishes. Our results suggest that species proliferation in Sundaland is
   not wholly reliant on Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations isolating
   populations on different islands.},

Title = {Adaptive Tree Proposals for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1015-1032},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bayesian inference of phylogeny with Markov chain Monte Carlo plays a
   key role in the study of evolution. Yet, this method still suffers from
   a practical challenge identified more than two decades ago: designing
   tree topology proposals that efficiently sample tree spaces. In this
   article, I introduce the concept of adaptive tree proposals for unrooted
   topologies, that is, tree proposals adapting to the posterior
   distribution as it is estimated. I use this concept to elaborate two
   adaptive variants of existing proposals and an adaptive proposal based
   on a novel design philosophy in which the structure of the proposal is
   informed by the posterior distribution of trees. I investigate the
   performance of these proposals by first presenting a metric that
   captures the performance of each proposal within a mixture of proposals.
   Using this metric, I compare the performance of the adaptive proposals
   to the performance of standard and parsimony-guided proposals on 11
   empirical data sets. Using adaptive proposals led to consistent
   performance gains and resulted in up to 18-fold increases in mixing
   efficiency and 6-fold increases in convergence rate without increasing
   the computational cost of these analyses.},

Title = {Reticulate Evolution Helps Explain Apparent Homoplasy in Floral Biology

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Baobabs (Adansonia) are a cohesive group of tropical trees with a
   disjunct distribution in Australia, Madagascar, and continental Africa,
   and diverse flowers associated with two pollination modes. We used
   custom-targeted sequence capture in conjunction with new and existing
   phylogenetic comparative methods to explore the evolution of floral
   traits and pollination systems while allowing for reticulate evolution.
   Our analyses suggest that relationships in Adansonia are confounded by
   reticulation, with network inference methods supporting at least one
   reticulation event. The best supported hypothesis involves introgression
   between Adansonia rubrostipa and core Longitubae, both of which are
   hawkmoth pollinated with yellow/red flowers, but there is also some
   support for introgression between the African lineage and Malagasy
   Brevitubae, which are both mammal-pollinated with white flowers. New
   comparative methods for phylogenetic networks were developed that allow
   maximum-likelihood inference of ancestral states and were applied to
   study the apparent homoplasy in floral biology and pollination mode seen
   in Adansonia. This analysis supports a role for introgressive
   hybridization in morphological evolution even in a clade with highly
   divergent and geographically widespread species. Our new comparative
   methods for discrete traits on species networks are implemented in the
   software PhyloNetworks.},

Title = {Macroevolutionary Analyses Suggest That Environmental Factors, Not Venom
   Apparatus, Play Key Role in Terebridae Marine Snail Diversification},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413-430},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {How species diversification occurs remains an unanswered question in
   predatory marine invertebrates, such as sea snails of the family
   Terebridae. However, the anatomical disparity found throughput the
   Terebridae provides a unique perspective for investigating
   diversification patterns in venomous predators. In this study, a new
   dated molecular phylogeny of the Terebridae is used as a framework for
   investigating diversification of the family through time, and for
   testing the putative role of intrinsic and extrinsic traits, such as
   shell size, larval ecology, bathymetric distribution, and anatomical
   features of the venom apparatus, as drivers of terebrid species
   diversification. Macroevolutionary analysis revealed that when
   diversification rates do not vary across Terebridae clades, the whole
   family has been increasing its global diversification rate since 25 Ma.
   We recovered evidence for a concurrent increase in diversification of
   depth ranges, while shell size appeared to have undergone a fast
   divergence early in terebrid evolutionary history. Our data also confirm
   that planktotrophy is the ancestral larval ecology in terebrids, and
   evolutionary modeling highlighted that shell size is linked to larval
   ecology of the Terebridae, with species with long-living pelagic larvae
   tending to be larger and have a broader size range than lecithotrophic
   species. Although we recovered patterns of size and depth trait
   diversification through time and across clades, the presence or absence
   of a venom gland (VG) did not appear to have impacted Terebridae
   diversification. Terebrids have lost their venom apparatus several times
   and we confirm that the loss of a VG happened in phylogenetically
   clustered terminal taxa and that reversal is extremely unlikely. Our
   findings suggest that environmental factors, and not venom, have had
   more influence on terebrid evolution.},

Title = {The Multispecies Coalescent Over-Splits Species in the Case of
   Geographically Widespread Taxa},

Abstract = {Many recent species delimitation studies rely exclusively on limited
   analyses of genetic data analyzed under the multispecies coalescent
   (MSC) model, and results from these studies often are regarded as
   conclusive support for taxonomic changes. However, most MSC-based
   species delimitation methods have well-known and often unmet
   assumptions. Uncritical application of these genetic-based approaches
   (without due consideration of sampling design, the effects of a priori
   group designations, isolation by distance, cytoplasmic-nuclear mismatch,
   and population structure) can lead to over-splitting of species. Here,
   we argue that in many common biological scenarios, researchers must be
   particularly cautious regarding these limitations, especially in cases
   of well-studied, geographically variable, and parapatrically distributed
   species complexes. We consider these points with respect to a
   historically controversial species group, the American milksnakes
   (Lampropeltis triangulum complex), using genetic data from a recent
   analysis (Ruane et al. 2014). We show that over-reliance on the program
   Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography, without adequate
   consideration of its assumptions and of sampling limitations, resulted
   in over-splitting of species in this study. Several of the hypothesized
   species of milksnakes instead appear to represent arbitrary slices of
   continuous geographic clines. We conclude that the best available
   evidence supports three, rather than seven, species within this complex.
   More generally, we recommend that coalescent-based species delimitation
   studies incorporate thorough analyses of geographic variation and
   carefully examine putative contact zones among delimited species before
   making taxonomic changes.},

Title = {A Third Strike Against Perfect Phylogeny},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Pages = {814-827},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Perfect phylogenies are fundamental in the study of evolutionary trees
   because they capture the situation when each evolutionary trait emerges
   only once in history; if such events are believed to be rare, then by
   Occam's Razor such parsimonious trees are preferable as a hypothesis of
   evolution. A classical result states that 2-state characters permit a
   perfect phylogeny precisely if each subset of 2 characters permits one.
   More recently, it was shown that for 3-state characters the same
   property holds but for size-3 subsets. A long-standing open problem
   asked whether such a constant exists for each number of states. More
   precisely, it has been conjectured that for any fixed number of states
   there exists a constant such that a set of -state characters has a
   perfect phylogeny if and only if every subset of at most characters has
   a perfect phylogeny. Informally, the conjecture states that checking
   fixed-size subsets of characters is enough to correctly determine
   whether input data permits a perfect phylogeny, irrespective of the
   number of characters in the input. In this article, we show that this
   conjecture is false. In particular, we show that for any constant ,
   there exists a set of -state characters such that has no perfect
   phylogeny, but there exists a perfect phylogeny for every subset of at
   most characters. Moreover, there already exists a perfect phylogeny when
   ignoring just one of the characters, independent of which character you
   ignore. This negative result complements the two negative results
   ({''}strikes{''}) of Bodlaender et al. (1992,2000). We reflect on the
   consequences of this third strike, pointing out that while it does close
   off some routes for efficient algorithm development, many others remain
   open.},

Title = {Sex-Biased Dispersal Obscures Species Boundaries in Integrative Species
   Delimitation Approaches},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Accurate delimitation of species is crucial for a stable taxonomy, which
   provides the foundation for the study of evolutionary biology, ecology,
   and essentially all biological disciplines. Several approaches toward
   impartial and repeatable taxonomic practices are available but all
   existing methods have potentially unacceptable shortcomings. In
   particular, problems can arise when the underlying model assumptions are
   violated, for instance, in the presence of reduced gene flow. This is
   observed in the context of sex-biased dispersal, which is a common but
   underappreciated feature in many groups of organisms. Previously,
   simulations have indicated that sex-biased dispersal may lead to
   erroneous estimations of the true species numbers. However, this
   phenomenon has never been examined using empirical data. We evaluate the
   bias introduced by extreme female philopatry on a range of de novo
   {[}GMYC, PTP, ABGD, statistical parsimony, trinomial distribution of
   triplets model (tr2)] and validation (STACEY, iBPP) approaches to
   species delimitation in the scarab beetle genus Pachypus. Since female
   philopatry exhibited in this genus in particular can affect
   mitochondrial gene flow, we compared the results from analyses of single
   loci, mitochondrial loci, nuclear loci and combined data, as well as the
   performance of morphometric data as a secondary data source in a fully
   integrative Bayesian framework. Large overestimation of species numbers
   was observed across all analyses of combined and mitochondrial DNA data
   sets, suggesting specimens from nearly every sampling location as
   separate species. The use of nuclear data resulted in more reasonable
   estimations of species boundaries, which were largely supported by
   morphometrics of linear measurements, while geometric morphometrics of
   body outlines resulted in stronger splitting. Simulations of population
   divergence with migration, corresponding to the biology of Pachypus,
   showed that female philopatry strongly increases reciprocal monophyly of
   mitochondrial markers and may substantially contribute to over-splitting
   in species delimitation. Robust results recovered using nuclear DNA and
   morphological data nevertheless enabled us to reach novel conclusions
   about species boundaries in Pachypus. Our findings suggest that
   mitochondrial DNA will be less suited to species delimitation in many
   cases, in particular in the presence of sex-biased dispersal.},

Title = {Full Bayesian Comparative Phylogeography from Genomic Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-395},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A challenge to understanding biological diversification is accounting
   for community-scale processes that cause multiple, co-distributed
   lineages to co-speciate. Such processes predict non-independent,
   temporally clustered divergences across taxa. Approximate-likelihood
   Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches to inferring such patterns from
   comparative genetic data are very sensitive to prior assumptions and
   often biased toward estimating shared divergences. We introduce a
   full-likelihood Bayesian approach, ecoevolity, which takes full
   advantage of information in genomic data. By analytically integrating
   over gene trees, we are able to directly calculate the likelihood of the
   population history from genomic data, and efficiently sample the
   model-averaged posterior via Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Using
   simulations, we find that the new method is much more accurate and
   precise at estimating the number and timing of divergence events across
   pairs of populations than existing approximate-likelihood methods. Our
   full Bayesian approach also requires several orders of magnitude less
   computational time than existing ABC approaches. We find that despite
   assuming unlinked characters (e.g., unlinked single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms), the new method performs better if this assumption is
   violated in order to retain the constant characters of whole linked
   loci. In fact, retaining constant characters allows the new method to
   robustly estimate the correct number of divergence events with high
   posterior probability in the face of character-acquisition biases, which
   commonly plague loci assembled from reduced-representation genomic
   libraries. We apply our method to genomic data from four pairs of
   insular populations of Gekko lizards from the Philippines that are not
   expected to have co-diverged. Despite all four pairs diverging very
   recently, our method strongly supports that they diverged independently,
   and these results are robust to very disparate prior assumptions.},

Title = {Species Limits and Phylogenomic Relationships of Darwin's Finches Remain
   Unresolved: Potential Consequences of a Volatile Ecological Setting},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Island biotas have become paradigms for illustrating many evolutionary
   processes. The fauna of the Galapagos Islands includes several taxa that
   have been focal points for evolutionary studies. Perhaps their most
   famous inhabitants, Darwin's finches, represent a go-to icon when
   thinking about how species originate and adapt to the environment.
   However, unlike other adaptive radiations, past morphological and
   molecular studies of Darwin's finches have yielded inconsistent
   hypotheses of species limits and phylogenetic relationships. Expecting
   that idiosyncrasies of prior data and analytic methods explained
   different proposed classifications, we were surprised to observe that
   three new phylogenetic hypotheses derived mostly from the same genomics
   data were topologically inconsistent. We found that the differences
   between some of these genomics trees were as great as one would expect
   between two random trees with the same number of taxa. Thus, the
   phylogeny of Darwin's finches remains unresolved, as it has for more
   than a century. A component of phylogenetic uncertainty comes from
   unclear species limits, under any species concept, in the ground finches
   (Geospiza) and tree finches (Camarhynchus). We suggest that past authors
   should have tested the species limits of Lack, rather than uncritically
   accepting them. In fact, the impressive amount of genomics data do not
   provide unambiguous hypotheses of the number of species of Geospiza or
   Camarhynchus, although they imply greater species diversity than Lack's
   taxonomy. We suggest that insufficient sampling of species populations
   across islands (35.6\% for morphometrics and 20.4\% for genomics)
   prevents accurate diagnoses of species limits. However, it is unknown
   whether samples from a greater number of islands might result in
   bridging differences between species, or reveal many new ones. We
   conclude that attempts to interpret patterns of variation among the
   finches under standard evolutionary paradigms have obscured some major
   messages, most specifically the ongoing reciprocal interactions between
   geographic isolation and lineage divergence, and dispersal and gene flow
   caused by the volatile ecological conditions in the islands. Although
   the finches provide textbook examples of natural selection, better
   understanding of species limits and a robust phylogenetic hypothesis are
   required to corroborate past hypotheses of speciation and adaptive
   radiation in the finches of the Galapagos.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {916-924},

Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that conflict is common among gene
   trees in phylogenomic studies, and that less than one percent of genes
   may ultimately drive species tree inference in supermatrix analyses.
   Herein, we examined two data sets where supermatrix and coalescent-based
   species trees conflict. We identified two highly influential
   ``outlier{''} genes in each data set. When removed from each data set,
   the inferred supermatrix trees matched the topologies obtained from
   coalescent analyses. We also demonstrate that, while the outlier genes
   in the vertebrate data set have been shown in a previous study to be the
   result of errors in orthology detection, the outlier genes from a plant
   data set did not exhibit any obvious systematic error, and therefore,
   may be the result of some biological process yet to be determined. While
   topological comparisons among a small set of alternate topologies can be
   helpful in discovering outlier genes, they can be limited in several
   ways, such as assuming all genes share the same topology. Coalescent
   species tree methods relax this assumption but do not explicitly
   facilitate the examination of specific edges. Coalescent methods often
   also assume that conflict is the result of incomplete lineage sorting.
   Herein, we explored a framework that allows for quickly examining
   alternative edges and support for large phylogenomic data sets that does
   not assume a single topology for all genes. For both data sets, these
   analyses provided detailed results confirming the support for
   coalescent-based topologies. This framework suggests thatwe can improve
   our understanding of the underlying signal in phylogenomic data sets by
   asking more targeted edge-based questions.},

Title = {An In Silico Comparison of Protocols for Dated Phylogenomics},

Abstract = {In the age of genome-scale DNA sequencing, choice of molecular marker
   arguably remains an important decision in planning a phylogenetic study.
   Using published genomes from 23 primate species, we make a standardized
   comparison of four of the most frequently used protocols in
   phylogenomics, viz., targeted sequence-enrichment using ultraconserved
   element and exon-capture probes, and restriction-site-associated DNA
   sequencing (RADseq and ddRADseq). Here, we present a procedure to
   perform in silico extractions from genomes and create directly
   comparable data sets for each class of marker. We then compare these
   data sets in terms of both phylogenetic resolution and ability to
   consistently and precisely estimate clade ages using fossil-calibrated
   molecular-clockmodels. Furthermore, we were also able to directly
   compare these results to previously published data sets from
   Sanger-sequenced nuclear exons and mitochondrial genomes under the same
   analytical conditions. Our results show-although with the exception of
   the mitochondrial genome data set and the smallest ddRADseq data
   set-that for uncontroversial nodes all data classes performed equally
   well, that is they recovered the same well supported topology. However,
   for one difficult-to-resolve node comprising a rapid diversification, we
   report well supported but conflicting topologies among themarker classes
   consistent with the mismodeling of gene tree heterogeneity as
   demonstrated by species tree analyses of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms. Likewise, clade age estimates showed consistent
   discrepancies between data sets under strict and relaxed clock models;
   for recent nodes, clade ages estimated by nuclear exon data sets were
   younger than those of the UCE, RADseq and mitochondrial data, but vice
   versa for the deepest nodes in the primate phylogeny. This observation
   is explained by temporal differences in phylogenetic informativeness
   (PI), with the data sets with strong PI peaks toward the present
   underestimating the deepest node ages. Finally, we conclude by
   emphasizing that while huge numbers of loci are probably not required
   for uncontroversial phylogenetic questions-for which practical
   considerations such as ease of data generation, sharing, and
   aggregating, therefore become increasingly important-accurately modeling
   heterogeneous data remains as relevant as ever for the more recalcitrant
   problems.},

Title = {Phenotypic and Genetic Structure Support Gene Flow Generating Gene Tree
   Discordances in an Amazonian Floodplain Endemic Species},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {700-718},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Before populations become independent evolutionary lineages, the effects
   of micro evolutionary processes tend to generate complex scenarios of
   diversification that may affect phylogenetic reconstruction. Not
   accounting for gene flow in species tree estimates can directly impact
   topology, effective population sizes and branch lengths, and the
   resulting estimation errors are still poorly understood in wild
   populations. In this study, we used an integrative approach, including
   sequence capture of ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), mtDNA Sanger
   sequencing and morphological data to investigate species limits and
   phylogenetic relationships in face of gene flow in an Amazonian endemic
   species (Myrmoborus lugubris: Aves). We used commonly implemented
   species tree and model-based approaches to understand the potential
   effects of gene flow in phylogenetic reconstructions. The genetic
   structure observed was congruent with the four recognized subspecies of
   M. lugubris. Morphological and UCEs data supported the presence of a
   wide hybrid zone between M. l. femininus from the Madeira river and M.
   l. lugubris from theMiddle and lowerAmazon river, whichwere recovered as
   sister taxa by species tree methods. When fitting gene flowinto
   simulated demographic models with different topologies, the best-fit
   model indicated these two taxa as non-sister lineages, a finding that is
   in agreement with the results of mitochondrial and morphological
   analyses. Our results demonstrated that failing to account for gene
   flowwhen estimating phylogenies at shallowdivergence levels can generate
   topological uncertainty, which can nevertheless be statistically well
   supported, and that model testing approaches using simulated data can be
   useful tools to test alternative phylogenetic hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Modern phylogenetic methods allow inference of ancestral molecular
   sequences given an alignment and phylogeny relating present-day
   sequences. This provides insight into the evolutionary history of
   molecules, helping to understand gene function and to study biological
   processes such as adaptation and convergent evolution across a variety
   of applications. Here, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm for
   fast joint likelihood-based reconstruction of ancestral sequences under
   the Poisson Indel Process (PIP). Unlike previous approaches, our method,
   named ARPIP, enables the reconstruction with insertions and deletions
   based on an explicit indel model. Consequently, inferred indel events
   have an explicit biological interpretation. Likelihood computation is
   achieved in linear time with respect to the number of sequences. Our
   method consists of two steps, namely finding the most probable indel
   points and reconstructing ancestral sequences. First, we find the most
   likely indel points and prune the phylogeny to reflect the insertion and
   deletion events per site. Second, we infer the ancestral states on the
   pruned subtree in a manner similar to FastML. We applied ARPIP
   (Ancestral Reconstruction under PIP) on simulated data sets and on real
   data from the Betacoronavirus genus. ARPIP reconstructs both the indel
   events and substitutions with a high degree of accuracy. Our method
   fares well when compared to established state-of-the-art methods such as
   FastML and PAML. Moreover, the method can be extended to explore both
   optimal and suboptimal reconstructions, include rate heterogeneity
   through time and more. We believe it will expand the range of novel
   applications of ancestral sequence reconstruction. {[}Ancestral

Abstract = {A large variety of pairwise measures of similarity or dissimilarity have
   been developed for comparing phylogenetic trees, for example, species
   trees or gene trees. Due to its intuitive definition in terms of tree
   clades and bipartitions and its computational efficiency, the
   Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is the most widely used for trees with
   unweighted edges and labels restricted to leaves (representing the
   genetic elements being compared). However, in the case of gene trees, an
   important information revealing the nature of the homologous relation
   between gene pairs (orthologs, paralogs, and xenologs) is the type of
   event associated to each internal node of the tree, typically
   speciations or duplications, but other types of events may also be
   considered, such as horizontal gene transfers. This labeling of internal
   nodes is usually inferred from a gene tree/species tree reconciliation
   method. Here, we address the problem of comparing such event-labeled
   trees. The problem differs from the classical problem of comparing
   uniformly labeled trees (all labels belonging to the same alphabet) that
   may be done using the Tree Edit Distance (TED) mainly due to the fact
   that, in our case, two different alphabets are considered for the leaves
   and internal nodes of the tree, and leaves are not affected by edit
   operations. We propose an extension of the RF distance to event-labeled
   trees, based on edit operations comparable to those considered for TED:
   node insertion, node deletion, and label substitution. We show that this
   new Labeled Robinson-Foulds (LRF) distance can be computed in linear
   time, in addition of maintaining other desirable properties: being a
   metric, reducing to RF for trees with no labels on internal nodes and
   maintaining an intuitive interpretation. The algorithm for computing the
   LRF distance enables novel analyses on event-label trees such as
   reconciled gene trees. Here, we use it to study the impact of taxon
   sampling on labeled gene tree inference and conclude that denser taxon
   sampling yields trees with better topology but worse labeling.

Title = {The Implications of Incongruence between Gene Tree and Species Tree
   Topologies for Divergence Time Estimation},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1124-1146},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses are increasingly being performed with data sets
   that incorporate hundreds of loci. Due to incomplete lineage sorting,
   hybridization, and horizontal gene transfer, the gene trees for these
   loci may often have topologies that differ from each other and from the
   species tree. The effect of these topological incongruences on
   divergence time estimation has not been fully investigated. Using a
   series of simulation experiments and empirical analyses, we demonstrate
   that when topological incongruence between gene trees and the species
   tree is not accounted for, the temporal duration of branches in regions
   of the species tree that are affected by incongruence is underestimated,
   whilst the duration of other branches is considerably overestimated.
   This effect becomes more pronounced with higher levels of topological
   incongruence. We show that this pattern results from the erroneous
   estimation of the number of substitutions along branches in the species
   tree, although the effect is modulated by the assumptions inherent to
   divergence time estimation, such as those relating to the fossil record
   or among-branch-substitution-rate variation. By only analyzing loci with
   gene trees that are topologically congruent with the species tree, or
   only taking into account the branches from each gene tree that are
   topologically congruent with the species tree, we demonstrate that the
   effects of topological incongruence can be ameliorated. Nonetheless,
   even when topologically congruent gene trees or topologically congruent
   branches are selected, error in divergence time estimates remains. This
   stems from temporal incongruences between divergence times in species
   trees and divergence times in gene trees, and more importantly, the
   difficulty of incorporating necessary assumptions for divergence time
   estimation. {[}Divergence time estimation; gene trees; species tree;

Abstract = {Integrative taxonomy is central to modern taxonomy and systematic
   biology, including behavior, niche preference, distribution,
   morphological analysis, and DNA barcoding. However, decades of use
   demonstrate that these methods can face challenges when used in
   isolation, for instance, potential misidentifications due to phenotypic
   plasticity for morphological methods, and incorrect identifications
   because of introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, and horizontal
   gene transfer for DNA barcoding. Although researchers have advocated the
   use of integrative taxonomy, few detailed algorithms have been proposed.
   Here, we develop a convolutional neural network method
   (morphology-molecule network {[}MMNet]) that integrates morphological
   and molecular data for species identification. The newly proposed method
   (MMNet) worked better than four currently available alternative methods
   when tested with 10 independent data sets representing varying genetic
   diversity from different taxa. High accuracies were achieved for all
   groups, including beetles (98.1\% of 123 species), butterflies (98.8\%
   of 24 species), fishes (96.3\% of 214 species), and moths (96.4\% of 150
   total species). Further, MMNet demonstrated a high degree of accuracy
   (>98\%) in four data sets including closely related species from the
   same genus. The average accuracy of two modest subgenomic (single
   nucleotide polymorphism) data sets, comprising eight putative subspecies
   respectively, is 90\%. Additional tests show that the success rate of
   species identification under this method most strongly depends on the
   amount of training data, and is robust to sequence length and image
   size. Analyses on the contribution of different data types (image vs.
   gene) indicate that both morphological and genetic data are important to
   the model, and that genetic data contribute slightly more. The
   approaches developed here serve as a foundation for the future
   integration of multimodal information for integrative taxonomy, such as
   image, audio, video, 3D scanning, and biosensor data, to characterize
   organisms more comprehensively as a basis for improved investigation,
   monitoring, and conservation of biodiversity. {[}Convolutional neural

Abstract = {Compared to other regions, the drivers of diversification in Africa are
   poorly understood. We studied a radiation of insects with over 100
   species occurring in a wide range of habitats across the Afrotropics to
   investigate the fundamental evolutionary processes and geological events
   that generate and maintain patterns of species richness on the
   continent. By investigating the evolutionary history of Bicyclus
   butterflies within a phylogenetic framework, we inferred the group's
   origin at the Oligo-Miocene boundary from ancestors in the Congolian
   rainforests of central Africa. Abrupt climatic fluctuations during the
   Miocene (ca. 19-17 Ma) likely fragmented ancestral populations,
   resulting in at least eight early-divergent lineages. Only one of these
   lineages appears to have diversified during the drastic climate and
   biome changes of the early Miocene, radiating into the largest group of
   extant species. The other seven lineages diversified in forest
   ecosystems during the late Miocene and Pleistocene when climatic
   conditions were more favorable-warmer and wetter. Our results suggest
   changing Neogene climate, uplift of eastern African orogens, and biotic
   interactions have had different effects on the various subclades of
   Bicyclus, producing one of the most spectacular butterfly radiations in
   Africa. {[}Afrotropics; biodiversity; biome; biotic interactions; Court

Abstract = {Introgression is an important biological process affecting at least 10\%
   of the extant species in the animal kingdom. Introgression significantly
   impacts inference of phylogenetic species relationships where a strictly
   binary tree model cannot adequately explain reticulate net-like species
   relationships. Here, we use phylogenomic approaches to understand
   patterns of introgression along the evolutionary history of a unique,
   nonmodel insect system: dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). We
   demonstrate that introgression is a pervasive evolutionary force across
   various taxonomic levels within Odonata. In particular, we show that the
   morphologically ``intermediate{''} species of Anisozygoptera (one of the
   three primary suborders within Odonata besides Zygoptera and
   Anisoptera), which retain phenotypic characteristics of the other two
   suborders, experienced high levels of introgression likely coming from
   zygopteran genomes. Additionally, we find evidence for multiple cases of
   deep inter-superfamilial ancestral introgression. {[}Gene flow; Odonata;

Abstract = {Next-generation-sequencing genotype callers are commonly used in studies
   to call variants from newly sequenced species. However, due to the
   current availability of genomic resources, it is still common practice
   to use only one reference genome for a given genus, or even one
   reference for an entire Glade of a higher taxon. The problem with
   traditional genotype callers, such as the one from GATK, is that they
   are optimized for variant calling at the population level. However, when
   these callers are used at the phylogenetic level, the consequences for
   downstream analyses can be substantial. Here, we performed simulations
   to compare the performance between the genotype callers of GATK and
   ATLAS, and present their differences at various phylogenetic scales. We
   show that the genotype caller of GATK substantially underestimates the
   number of variants at the phylogenetic level, but not at the population
   level. We also found that the accuracy of heterozygote calls declines
   with increasing distance to the reference genome. We quantified this
   decline and found that it is very sharp in GATK, while ATLAS maintains
   high accuracy even at moderately divergent species from the reference.
   We further suggest that efforts should be taken towards acquiring more
   reference genomes per species, before pursuing high-scale phylogenomic
   studies.},

Title = {Segmental Series and Size: Clade-Wide Investigation of Molar Proportions
   Reveals a Major Evolutionary Allometry in the Dentition of Placental
   Mammals},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Iterative segments such as teeth or limbs are a widespread
   characteristic of living organisms. While their proportions may be
   governed by similar developmental rules in vertebrates, there is no
   emerging pattern as regards their relation to size. Placental mammals
   span eight orders of magnitude in body size and show a wide spectrum of
   dietary habits associated with size and reflected in their dentitions,
   especially molars. Although variation in size constitutes an important
   determinant for variation in biological traits, few major allometric
   trends have been documented on placental molars so far. Molar
   proportions have been intensively explored in placentals in relation to
   developmental models, but often at a small phylogenetic scale. Here, we
   analyzed the diversity of upper molar proportions in relation to
   absolute size in a large sample of placental species (n =299)
   encompassing most of the group's dental diversity. Our phylogenetically
   informed analyses revealed a 2-fold pattern of evolutionary integration
   among upper molars: while molars covary in size with each other, their
   proportions covary with the absolute size of the entire molar field.
   With increasing absolute size, posterior molars increase in size
   relative to anterior ones, meaning that large-sized species have
   relatively large rear molars while the opposite is true for small-sized
   species. The directionality of proportional increase in the molar row
   exhibits a previously unsuspected allometric patterning among
   placentals, showing how large-scale variations in size may have
   influenced variation in dental morphology. This finding provides new
   evidence that processes regulating the size of individual molars are
   integrated with overall patterns of growth and calls for further testing
   of allometric variation in the dentition and in other segmental series
   of the vertebrate body.},

Title = {Modeling Phylogenetic Biome Shifts on a Planet with a Past},

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of biomes has changed considerably over deep
   time, so the geographical opportunity for an evolutionary lineage to
   shift into a new biome may depend on how the availability and
   connectivity of biomes has varied temporally. To better understand how
   lineages shift between biomes in space and time, we developed a
   phylogenetic biome shift model in which each lineage shifts between
   biomes and disperses between regions at rates that depend on the
   lineage's biome affinity and location relative to the spatial
   distribution of biomes at any given time. To study the behavior of the
   biome shift model in an empirical setting, we developed a
   literature-based representation of paleobiome structure for three mesic
   forest biomes, six regions, and eight time strata, ranging from the Late
   Cretaceous (100 Ma) through the present. We then fitted the model to a
   time-calibrated phylogeny of 119 Viburnum species to compare how the
   results responded to various realistic or unrealistic assumptions about
   paleobiome structure. Ancestral biome estimates that account for
   paleobiome dynamics reconstructed a warm temperate (or tropical) origin
   of Viburnum, which is consistent with previous fossil-based estimates of
   ancestral biomes. Imposing unrealistic paleobiome distributions led to
   ancestral biome estimates that eliminated support for tropical origins,
   and instead inflated support for cold temperate ancestry throughout the
   warmer Paleocene and Eocene. The biome shift model we describe is
   applicable to the study of evolutionary systems beyond Viburnum, and the
   core mechanisms of our model are extensible to the design of richer
   phylogenetic models of historical biogeography and/or lineage
   diversification. We conclude that biome shift models that account for
   dynamic geographical opportunities are important for inferring ancestral
   biomes that are compatible with our understanding of Earth history.},

Title = {Bayesian Inference of Ancestral Host-Parasite Interactions under a
   Phylogenetic Model of Host Repertoire Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1149-1162},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Intimate ecological interactions, such as those between parasites and
   their hosts, may persist over long time spans, coupling the evolutionary
   histories of the lineages involved. Most methods that reconstruct the
   coevolutionary history of such interactions make the simplifying
   assumption that parasites have a single host. Many methods also focus on
   congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, using cospeciation as
   the null model. However, there is an increasing body of evidence
   suggesting that the host ranges of parasites are more complex: that host
   ranges often include more than one host and evolve via gains and losses
   of hosts rather than through cospeciation alone. Here, we develop a
   Bayesian approach for inferring coevolutionary history based on a model
   accommodating these complexities. Specifically, a parasite is assumed to
   have a host repertoire, which includes both potential hosts and one or
   more actual hosts. Over time, potential hosts can be added or lost, and
   potential hosts can develop into actual hosts or vice versa. Thus, host
   colonization is modeled as a two-step process that may potentially be
   influenced by host relatedness. We first explore the statistical
   behavior of our model by simulating evolution of host-parasite
   interactions under a range of parameter values. We then use our
   approach, implemented in the program RevBayes, to infer the
   coevolutionary history between 34 Nymphalini butterfly species and 25
   angiosperm families. Our analysis suggests that host relatedness among
   angiosperm families influences how easily Nymphalini lineages gain new
   hosts.},

Abstract = {Genome architecture is a complex, multidimensional property of an
   organism defined by the content and spatial organization of the genome's
   component parts. Comparative study of entire genome architecture in
   model organisms is shedding light on mechanisms underlying genome
   regulation, evolution, and diversification, but such studies require
   costly analytical approaches which make extensive comparative study
   impractical for most groups. However, lower-cost methods that measure a
   single architectural component (e.g., distribution of one class of
   repeats) have potential as a new data source for evolutionary studies
   insofar as that measure correlates with more complex biological
   phenomena, and for which it could serve as part of an explanatory
   framework. We investigated copy number variation (CNV) profiles in
   ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as a simple measure reflecting the distribution of
   rDNA subcomponents across the genome. We find that signatures present in
   rDNA CNV profiles strongly correlate with species boundaries in the
   breve species group of Bembidion, and vary across broader taxonomic
   sampling in Bembidion subgenus Plataphus. Profiles of several species
   show evidence of re-patterning of rDNA-like sequences throughout the
   genome, revealing evidence of rapid genome evolution (including among
   sister pairs) not evident from analysis of traditional data sources such
   as multigene data sets. Major re-patterning of rDNA-like sequences has
   occurred frequently within the evolutionary history of Plataphus. We
   confirm that CNV profiles represent an aspect of genomic architecture
   (i.e., the linear distribution of rDNA components across the genome) via
   fluorescence in-situ hybridization. In at least one species, novel
   rDNA-like elements are spread throughout all chromosomes. We discuss the
   potential of copy number profiles of rDNA, or other repeats, as a
   low-cost tool for incorporating signal of genomic architecture variation
   in studies of species delimitation and genome evolution.},

Title = {How Well Can We Estimate Diversity Dynamics for Clades in Diversity
   Decline?},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-62},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The fossil record shows that the vast majority of all species that ever
   existed are extinct and that most lineages go through an expansion and
   decline in diversity. However, macroevolutionary analyses based upon
   molecular phylogenies have difficulty inferring extinction dynamics,
   raising questions about whether the neontological record can contribute
   to an understanding of the decline phenomenon. Two recently developed
   diversification methods for molecular phylogenies (RPANDA and BAMM)
   incorporate models that theoretically have the capacity to capture
   decline dynamics by allowing extinction to be higher than speciation.
   However, the performance of these frameworks over a wide range of
   decline scenarios has not been studied. Here, we investigate the
   behavior of these methods under decline scenarios caused by decreasing
   speciation and increasing extinction through time on simulated trees at
   fixed intervals over diversity trajectories with expansion and decline
   phases. We also compared method performance over a comprehensive data
   set of 214 empirical trees. Our results show that both methods perform
   equally well when varying speciation rates control decline. When decline
   was only caused by an increase in extinction rates both methods wrongly
   assign the variation in net diversification to a drop in speciation,
   even though the positive gamma values of those trees would suggest
   otherwise. We also found a tendency for RPANDA to favor increasing
   extinction and BAMM to favor decreasing speciation as the most common
   cause of decline in empirical trees. Overall our results shed light on
   the limitations of both methods, encouraging researchers to carefully
   interpret the results from diversification studies.},

Title = {Optimal Rates for Phylogenetic Inference and Experimental Design in the
   Era of Genome-Scale Data Sets},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-156},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the rise of genome-scale data sets, there has been a call for
   increased data scrutiny and careful selection of loci that are
   appropriate to use in an attempt to resolve a phylogenetic problem. Such
   loci should maximize phylogenetic information content while minimizing
   the risk of homoplasy. Theory posits the existence of characters that
   evolve at an optimum rate, and efforts to determine optimal rates of
   inference have been a cornerstone of phylogenetic experimental design
   for over two decades. However, both theoretical and empirical
   investigations of optimal rates have varied dramatically in their
   conclusions: spanning no relationship to a tight relationship between
   the rate of change and phylogenetic utility. Herein, we synthesize these
   apparently contradictory views, demonstrating both empirical and
   theoretical conditions under which each is correct. We find that optimal
   rates of charactersunot genesuare generally robust to most experimental
   design decisions. Moreover, consideration of site rate heterogeneity
   within a given locus is critical to accurate predictions of utility.
   Factors such as taxon sampling or the targeted number of characters
   providing support for a topology are additionally critical to the
   predictions of phylogenetic utility based on the rate of character
   change. Further, optimality of rates and predictions of phylogenetic
   utility are not equivalent, demonstrating the need for further
   development of comprehensive theory of phylogenetic experimental design.

Title = {Automated Integration of Trees and Traits: A Case Study Using Paired Fin
   Loss Across Teleost Fishes},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {67},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Data synthesis required for large-scale macroevolutionary studies is
   challenging with the current tools available for integration. Using a
   classic question regarding the frequency of paired fin loss in teleost
   fishes as a case study, we sought to create automated methods to
   facilitate the integration of broad-scale trait data with a sizable
   species-level phylogeny. Similar to the evolutionary pattern previously
   described for limbs, pelvic and pectoral fin reduction and loss are
   thought to have occurred independently multiple times in the evolution
   of fishes. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify the
   presence and absence of pectoral and pelvic fins of 12,582 species. To
   do this, we integrated a synthetic morphological supermatrix of
   phenotypic data for the pectoral and pelvic fins for teleost fishes from
   the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (two presence/absence characters for 3047
   taxa) with a species-level tree for teleost fishes from the Open Tree of
   Life project (38,419 species). The integration method detailed herein
   harnessed a new combined approach by utilizing data based on ontological
   inference, as well as phylogenetic propagation, to reduce overall data
   loss. Using inference enabled by ontology-based annotations, missing
   data were reduced from 98.0\% to 85.9\%, and further reduced to 34.8\%
   by phylogenetic data propagation. These methods allowed us to extend the
   data to an additional 11,293 species for a total of 12,582 species with
   trait data. The pectoral fin appears to have been independently lost in
   a minimum of 19 lineages and the pelvic fin in 48. Though interpretation
   is limited by lack of phylogenetic resolution at the species level, it
   appears that following loss, both pectoral and pelvic fins were regained
   several (3) to many (14) times respectively. Focused investigation into
   putative regains of the pectoral fin, all within one clade
   (Anguilliformes), showed that the pectoral fin was regained at least
   twice following loss. Overall, this study points to specific teleost
   clades where strategic phylogenetic resolution and genetic investigation
   will be necessary to understand the pattern and frequency of pectoral
   fin reversals.},

Title = {Analysis of Phylogenomic Tree Space Resolves Relationships Among
   Marsupial Families},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {400-412},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A fundamental challenge in resolving evolutionary relationships across
   the tree of life is to account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary
   signal across loci. Studies of marsupial mammals have demonstrated that
   this heterogeneity can be substantial, leaving considerable uncertainty
   in the evolutionary timescale and relationships within the group. Using
   simulations and a new phylogenomic data set comprising nucleotide
   sequences of 1550 loci from 18 of the 22 extant marsupial families, we
   demonstrate the power of a method for identifying clusters of loci that
   support different phylogenetic trees. We find two distinct clusters of
   loci, each providing an estimate of the species tree that matches
   previously proposed resolutions of the marsupial phylogeny. We also
   identify a well-supported placement for the enigmatic marsupial moles
   (Notoryctes) that contradicts previous molecular estimates but is
   consistent with morphological evidence. The pattern of gene-tree
   variation across tree-space is characterized by changes in information
   content, GC content, substitution-model adequacy, and signatures of
   purifying selection in the data. In a simulation study, we show that
   incomplete lineage sorting can explain the division of loci into the two
   tree-topology clusters, as found in our phylogenomic analysis of
   marsupials. We also demonstrate the potential benefits of minimizing
   uncertainty from phylogenetic conflict for molecular dating. Our
   analyses reveal that Australasian marsupials appeared in the early
   Paleocene, whereas the diversification of present-day families occurred
   primarily during the late Eocene and early Oligocene. Our methods
   provide an intuitive framework for improving the accuracy and precision
   of phylogenetic inference and molecular dating using genome-scale data.},

Title = {Millions of Years Behind: Slow Adaptation of Ruminants to Grasslands},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-157},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Late Cretaceous appearance of grasses, followed by the Cenozoic
   advancement of grasslands as dominant biomes, has contributed to the
   evolution of a range of specialized herbivores adapted to new diets, as
   well as to increasingly open and arid habitats. Many mammals including
   ruminants, the most diversified ungulate suborder, evolved high-crowned
   (hypsodont) teeth as an adaptation to tooth-wearing diets and habitats.
   The impact of different causes of tooth wear is still a matter of
   debate, and the temporal pattern of hypsodonty evolution in relation to
   the evolution of grasslands remains unclear. We present an improved
   time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Cetartiodactyla, with
   phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral ruminant diets and habitats,
   based on characteristics of extant taxa. Using this timeline, as well as
   the fossil record of grasslands, we conduct phylogenetic comparative
   analyses showing that hypsodonty in ruminants evolved as an adaptation
   to both diet and habitat. Our results demonstrate a slow, perhaps
   constrained, evolution of hypsodonty toward estimated optimal states,
   excluding the possibility of immediate adaptation. This augments recent
   findings that slow adaptation is not uncommon on million-year time
   scales.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing accurate historical relationships within a species poses
   numerous challenges, not least in many plant groups in which gene flow
   is high enough to extend well beyond species boundaries. Nonetheless,
   the extent of tree-like history within a species is an empirical
   question on which it is now possible to bring large amounts of genome
   sequence to bear. We assess phylogenetic structure across the geographic
   range of the saguaro cactus, an emblematic member of Cactaceae, a clade
   known for extensive hybridization and porous species boundaries. Using
   200 Gb of whole genome resequencing data from 20 individuals sampled
   from 10 localities, we assembled two data sets comprising 150,000
   biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from protein coding
   sequences. From these, we inferred within-species trees and evaluated
   their significance and robustness using five qualitatively different
   inference methods. Despite the low sequence diversity, large census
   population sizes, and presence of wide-ranging pollen and seed dispersal
   agents, phylogenetic trees were well resolved and highly consistent
   across both data sets and all methods. We inferred that the most likely
   root, based on marginal likelihood comparisons, is to the east and south
   of the region of highest genetic diversity, which lies along the coast
   of the Gulf of California in Sonora, Mexico. Together with striking
   decreases in marginal likelihood found to the north, this supports
   hypotheses that saguaro's current range reflects postglacial expansion
   from the refugia in the south of its range. We conclude with
   observations about practical and theoretical issues raised by
   phylogenomic data sets within species, in which SNP-based methods must
   be used rather than gene tree methods that are widely used when sequence
   divergence is higher. These include computational scalability, inference
   of gene flow, and proper assessment of statistical support in the
   presence of linkage effects. {[}Phylogenomics; phylogeography; rooting;

Abstract = {The use of information criteria to distinguish between phylogenetic
   models has become ubiquitous within the field. However, the variety and
   complexity of available models are much greater now than when these
   practices were established. The literature shows an increasing
   trajectory of healthy skepticism with regard to the use of information
   theory-based model selection within phylogenetics. We add to this by
   analyzing the specific case of comparison between partition and mixture
   models. We argue from a theoretical basis that information criteria are
   inherently more likely to favor partition models over mixture models,
   and we then demonstrate this through simulation. Based on our findings,
   we suggest that partition and mixture models are not suitable for
   information-theory based model comparison. {[}AIC, BIC; information

Abstract = {Understanding variation in rates of evolution and morphological
   disparity is a goal of macroevolutionary research. In a phylogenetic
   comparative methods framework, we present three explicit models for
   linking the rate of evolution of a trait to the state of another
   evolving trait. This allows testing hypotheses about causal influences
   on rates of phenotypic evolution with phylogenetic comparative data. We
   develop a statistical framework for fitting the models with generalized
   least-squares regression and use this to discuss issues and limitations
   in the study of rates of evolution more generally. We show that the
   power to detect effects on rates of evolution is low in that even strong
   causal effects are unlikely to explain more than a few percent of
   observed variance in disparity. We illustrate the models and issues by
   testing if rates of beak-shape evolution in birds are influenced by
   brain size, as may be predicted from a Baldwin effect in which
   presumptively more behaviorally flexible large-brained species generate
   more novel selection on themselves leading to higher rates of evolution.
   From an analysis of morphometric data for 645 species, we find evidence
   that both macro- and microevolution of the beak are faster in birds with
   larger brains, but with the caveat that there are no consistent effects
   of relative brain size.{[}Baldwin effect; beak shape; behavioral drive;

Title = {DNA Barcodes Combined with Multilocus Data of Representative Taxa Can
   Generate Reliable Higher-Level Phylogenies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {382-395},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Taxa are frequently labeled incertae sedis when their placement is
   debated at ranks above the species level, such as their subgeneric,
   generic, or subtribal placement. This is a pervasive problem in groups
   with complex systematics due to difficulties in identifying suitable
   synapomorphies. In this study, we propose combining DNA barcodes with a
   multilocus backbone phylogeny in order to assign taxa to genus or other
   higher-level categories. This sampling strategy generates molecular
   matrices containing large amounts of missing data that are not
   distributed randomly: barcodes are sampled for all representatives, and
   additional markers are sampled only for a small percentage. We
   investigate the effects of the degree and randomness of missing data on
   phylogenetic accuracy using simulations for up to 100 markers in
   1000-tips trees, as well as a real case: the subtribe Polyommatina
   (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), a large group including numerous species with
   unresolved taxonomy. Our simulation tests show that when a strategic and
   representative selection of species for higher-level categories has been
   made for multigene sequencing (approximately one per simulated genus),
   the addition of this multigene backbone DNA data for as few as 5-10\% of
   the specimens in the total data set can produce high-quality
   phylogenies, comparable to those resulting from 100\% multigene
   sampling. In contrast, trees based exclusively on barcodes performed
   poorly. This approach was applied to a 1365-specimen data set of
   Polyommatina (including ca. 80\% of described species), with nearly 8\%
   of representative species included in the multigene backbone and the
   remaining 92\% included only by mitochondrial COI barcodes, a phylogeny
   was generated that highlighted potential misplacements, unrecognized
   major clades, and placement for incertae sedis taxa. We use this
   information to make systematic rearrangements within Polyommatina, and
   to describe two new genera. Finally, we propose a systematic workflow to
   assess higher-level taxonomy in hyperdiverse groups. This research

Abstract = {Phylogenies are increasingly being used as a basis to provide insight
   into macroevolutionary history. Here, we use simulation experiments and
   empirical analyses to evaluate methods that use phylogenies as a basis
   to make estimates of divergence times and rates of diversification. This
   is the first study to present a comprehensive assessment of the key
   variables that underpin analyses in this field-including substitution
   rates, speciation rates, and extinction, plus character sampling and
   taxon sampling. We show that in unrealistically simplistic cases (where
   substitution rates and speciation rates are constant, and where there is
   no extinction), increased character and taxon sampling lead to more
   accurate and precise parameter estimates. By contrast, in more complex
   but realistic cases (where substitution rates, speciation rates, and
   extinction rates vary), gains in accuracy and precision from increased
   character and taxon sampling are far more limited. The lack of accuracy
   and precision even occurs when using methods that are designed to
   account for more complex cases, such as relaxed clocks, fossil
   calibrations, and models that allow speciation rates and extinction
   rates to vary. The problem also persists when analyzing genomic scale
   data sets. These results suggest two interrelated problems that occur
   when the processes that generated the data are more complex. First,
   methodological assumptions are more likely to be violated. Second,
   limitations in the information content of the data become more
   important.},

Title = {Detecting Lineage-Specific Shifts in Diversification: A Proper
   Likelihood Approach},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {389-407},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The branching patterns of molecular phylogenies are generally assumed to
   contain information on rates of the underlying speciation and extinction
   processes. Simple birth-death models with constant, time-varying, or
   diversity-dependent rates have been invoked to explain these patterns.
   They have one assumption in common: all lineages have the same set of
   diversification rates at a given point in time. It seems likely,
   however, that there is variability in diversification rates across
   subclades in a phylogenetic tree. This has inspired the construction of
   models that allow multiple rate regimes across the phylogeny, with
   instantaneous shifts between these regimes. Several methods exist for
   calculating the likelihood of a phylogeny under a specified mapping of
   diversification regimes and for performing inference on the most likely
   diversification history that gave rise to a particular phylogenetic
   tree. Here, we show that the likelihood computation of these methods is
   not correct. We provide a new framework to compute the likelihood
   correctly and show, with simulations of a single shift, that the correct
   likelihood indeed leads to parameter estimates that are on average in
   much better agreement with the generating parameters than the incorrect
   likelihood. Moreover, we show that our corrected likelihood can be
   extended to multiple rate shifts in time-dependent and
   diversity-dependent models. We argue that identifying shifts in
   diversification rates is a nontrivial model selection exercise where one
   has to choose whether shifts in now-extinct lineages are taken into
   account or not. Hence, our framework also resolves the recent debate on
   such unobserved shifts.},

Title = {Cryptic Patterns of Speciation in Cryptic Primates: Microendemic Mouse
   Lemurs and the Multispecies Coalescent},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {203-218},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are a radiation of morphologically cryptic
   primates distributed throughout Madagascar for which the number of
   recognized species has exploded in the past two decades. This taxonomic
   revision has prompted understandable concern that there has been
   substantial oversplitting in the mouse lemur clade. Here, we
   investigatemouse lemur diversity in a region in northeastern Madagascar
   with high levels of microendemism and predicted habitat loss. We
   analyzed RADseq data with multispecies coalescent (MSC) species
   delimitation methods for two pairs of sister lineages that include three
   named species and an undescribed lineage previously identified to have
   divergent mtDNA. Marked differences in effective population sizes,
   levels of gene flow, patterns of isolation-by-distance, and species
   delimitation results were found among the two pairs of lineages. Whereas
   all tests support the recognition of the presently undescribed lineage
   as a separate species, the species-level distinction of two previously
   described species, M. mittermeieri and M. lehilahytsara is not
   supported-a result that is particularly striking when using the
   genealogical discordance index (gdi). Nonsister lineages occur
   sympatrically in two of the localities sampled for this study, despite
   an estimated divergence time of less than 1 Ma. This suggests rapid
   evolution of reproductive isolation in the focal lineages and in the
   mouse lemur clade generally. The divergence time estimates reported here
   are based on the MSC calibrated with pedigree-based mutation rates and
   are considerably more recent than previously published fossil-calibrated
   relaxed-clock estimates. We discuss the possible explanations for this
   discrepancy, noting that there are theoretical justifications for
   preferring the MSC estimates in this case.},

Title = {The Comparative Method is Not Macroevolution: Across-Species Evidence
   for Within-Species Process},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1272-1281},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It is common for studies that employ the comparative method for the
   study of adaptation, that is, documentation of potentially adaptive
   across-species patterns of trait-environment or trait-trait correlation,
   to be designated as ``macroevolutionary.{''} Authors are justified in
   using ``macroevolution{''} in this way by appeal to definitions such as
   ``evolution above the species level.{''} I argue that regarding the
   comparative method as ``macroevolutionary{''} is harmful because it
   hides in serious ways the true causal content of hypotheses tested with
   the comparative method. The comparative method is a means of testing
   hypotheses of adaptation and their alternatives. Adaptation is a
   population-level phenomenon, involving heritable interindividual
   variation that is associated with fitness differences. For example,
   given heritable intrapopulational variation, more streamlined
   individuals in populations of fast-moving aquatic animals have higher
   locomotory efficiency and thus better survivorship and more resources
   directed to reproduction than less streamlined ones. Direct evidence
   consistent with this population-level scenario includes the observation
   that many unrelated species of fast-moving aquatic animals have similar
   streamlined shapes, an example of the comparative method. Crucial to
   note in this example is that although the data are observed across
   species, the comparative method for studying adaptation tests hypotheses
   regarding standard population-level natural selection with no content
   that can be construed as ``macro.{''} Even less ``macro,{''}
   individual-level developmental dynamics can limit or bias the range of
   variants available for selection. Calling any of these studies
   ``macroevolutionary{''} implies that some additional process is at work,
   shrouding the need to test adaptation hypotheses and study the range of
   variants that can be produced in development.},

Abstract = {Evidence from natural systems suggests that hybridization between animal
   species is more common than traditionally thought, but the overall
   contribution of introgression to standing genetic variation within
   species remains unclear for most animal systems. Here, we use targeted
   exon capture to sequence thousands of nuclear loci and complete
   mitochondrial genomes from closely related chipmunk species in the
   Tamias quadrivittatus group that are distributed across the Great Basin
   and the central and southern Rocky Mountains of North America. This
   recent radiation includes six overlapping, ecologically distinct species
   (Tamias canipes, Tamias cinereicollis, Tamias dorsalis, T.
   quadrivittatus, Tamias rufus, and Tamias umbrinus) that showevidence for
   widespread introgression across species boundaries. Such evidence has
   historically been derived from a handful of markers, typically focused
   on mitochondrial loci, to describe patterns of introgression;
   consequently, the extent of introgression of nuclear genes is less well
   characterized. We conducted a series of phylogenomic and species-tree
   analyses to resolve the phylogeny of six species in this group. In
   addition, we performed several population-genomic analyses to
   characterize nuclear genomes and infer coancestry among individuals.
   Furthermore, we used emerging quartets-based approaches to
   simultaneously infer the species tree (SVDquartets) and identify
   introgression (HyDe). We found that, in spite of rampant introgression
   of mitochondrial genomes between some species pairs (and sometimes
   involving up to three species), there appears to be little to no
   evidence for nuclear introgression. These findings mirror other genomic
   results where complete mitochondrial capture has occurred between
   chipmunk species in the absence of appreciable nuclear gene flow. The
   underlying causes of recurrent massive cytonuclear discordance remain
   unresolved in this group but mitochondrial DNA appears highly misleading
   of population histories as a whole. Collectively, it appears that
   chipmunk species boundaries are largely impermeable to nuclear gene flow
   and that hybridization, while pervasive with respect to mtDNA, has
   likely played a relatively minor role in the evolutionary history of
   this group.},

Title = {Ambiguity Coding Allows Accurate Inference of Evolutionary Parameters

Abstract = {How can we best learn the history of a protein's evolution? Ideally, a
   model of sequence evolution should capture both the process that
   generates genetic variation and the functional constraints determining
   which changes are fixed. However, in practical terms the most suitable
   approach may simply be the one that combines the convenience of easily
   available input data with the ability to return useful parameter
   estimates. For example, we might be interested in a measure of the
   strength of selection (typically obtained using a codon model) or an
   ancestral structure (obtained using structural modeling based on
   inferred amino acid sequence and side chain configuration).
   But what if data in the relevant state-space are not readily available?
   We show that it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of the outputs
   of interest using an established method for handling missing data.
   Encoding observed characters in an alignment as ambiguous
   representations of characters in a larger state-space allows the
   application of models with the desired features to data that lack the
   resolution that is normally required. This strategy is viable because
   the evolutionary path taken through the observed space contains
   information about states that were likely visited in the ``unseen{''}
   state-space. To illustrate this, we consider two examples with amino
   acid sequences as input. We show that., a parameter describing the
   relative strength of selection on nonsynonymous and synonymous changes,
   can be estimated in an unbiased manner using an adapted version of a
   standard 61-state codon model. Using simulated and empirical data, we
   find that ancestral amino acid side chain configuration can be inferred
   by applying a 55-state empirical model to 20-state amino acid data.
   Where feasible, combining inputs from both ambiguity-coded and fully
   resolved data improves accuracy. Adding structural information to as few
   as 12.5\% of the sequences in an amino acid alignment results in
   remarkable ancestral reconstruction performance compared to a benchmark
   that considers the full rotamer state information. These examples show
   that our methods permit the recovery of evolutionary information from
   sequences where it has previously been inaccessible.},

Title = {Species Selection Regime and Phylogenetic Tree Shape},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Species selection, the effect of heritable traits in generating
   between-lineage diversification rate differences, provides a valuable
   conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between traits,
   diversification, and phylogenetic tree shape. An important challenge,
   however, is that the nature of real diversification landscapes-curves or
   surfaces which describe the propensity of species-level lineages to
   diversify as a function of one or more traits-remains poorly understood.
   Here, we present a novel, time-stratified extension of the QuaSSE model
   in which speciation/extinction rate is specified as a static or
   temporally shifting Gaussian or skewed-Gaussian function of the
   diversification trait. We then use simulations to show that the
   generally imbalanced nature of real phylogenetic trees, as well as their
   generally greater than expected frequency of deep branching events, are
   typical outcomes when diversification is treated as a dynamic,
   trait-dependent process. Focusing on four basic models
   (Gaussian-speciation with and without background extinction;
   skewed-speciation; Gaussian-extinction), we also show that particular
   features of the species selection regime produce distinct tree shape
   signatures and that, consequently, a combination of tree shape metrics
   has the potential to reveal the species selection regime under which a
   particular lineage diversified. We evaluate this idea empirically by
   comparing the phylogenetic trees of plant lineages diversifying within
   climatically and geologically stable environments of the Greater Cape
   Floristic Region, with those of lineages diversifying in environments
   that have experienced major change through the Late Miocene-Pliocene.
   Consistent with our expectations, the trees of lineages diversifying in
   a dynamic context are less balanced, show a greater concentration of
   branching events close to the present, and display stronger
   diversification rate-trait correlations. We suggest that species
   selection plays an important role in shaping phylogenetic trees but
   recognize the need for an explicit probabilistic framework within which
   to assess the likelihoods of alternative diversification scenarios as
   explanations of a particular tree shape.},

Abstract = {Genomic data have had a profound impact on nearly every biological
   discipline. In systematics and phylogenetics, the thousands of loci that
   are now being sequenced can be analyzed under the multispecies
   coalescent model (MSC) to explicitly account for gene tree discordance
   due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). However, the MSC assumes no
   gene flow post divergence, calling for additional methods that can
   accommodate this limitation. Explicit phylogenetic network methods have
   emerged, which can simultaneously account for ILS and gene flow by
   representing evolutionary history as a directed acyclic graph. In this
   point of view, we highlight some of the strengths and limitations of
   phylogenetic networks and argue that tree-based inference should not be
   blindly abandoned in favor of networks simply because they represent
   more parameter rich models. Attention should be given to model selection
   of reticulation complexity, and the most robust conclusions regarding
   evolutionary history are likely obtained when combining tree- and
   network-based inference.},

Title = {Phylogenomics Uncovers Confidence and Conflict in the Rapid Radiation of
   Australo-Papuan Rodents},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {431-444},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The estimation of robust and accurate measures of branch support has
   proven challenging in the era of phylogenomics. In data sets of
   potentially millions of sites, bootstrap support for bifurcating
   relationships around very short internal branches can be inappropriately
   inflated. Such overestimation of branch support may be particularly
   problematic in rapid radiations, where phylogenetic signal is low and
   incomplete lineage sorting severe. Here, we explore this issue by
   comparing various branch support estimates under both concatenated and
   coalescent frameworks, in the recent radiation Australo-Papuan murine
   rodents (Muridae: Hydromyini). Using nucleotide sequence data from 1245
   independent loci and several phylogenomic inference methods, we
   unequivocally resolve the majority of genus-level relationships within
   Hydromyini. However, at four nodes we recover inconsistency in branch
   support estimates both within and among concatenated and coalescent
   approaches. In most cases, concatenated likelihood approaches using
   standard fast bootstrap algorithms did not detect any uncertainty at
   these four nodes, regardless of partitioning strategy. However, we found
   this could be overcome with two-stage resampling, that is, across genes
   and sites within genes (using-bsam GENESITE in IQ-TREE). In addition,
   low confidence at recalcitrant nodes was recovered using UFBoot2, a
   recent revision to the bootstrap protocol in IQ-TREE, but this depended
   on partitioning strategy. Summary coalescent approaches also failed to
   detect uncertainty under some circumstances. For each of four
   recalcitrant nodes, an equivalent (or close to equivalent) number of
   genes were in strong support (> 75\% bootstrap) of both the primary and
   at least one alternative topological hypothesis, suggesting notable
   phylogenetic conflict among loci not detected using some standard branch
   support metrics. Recent debate has focused on the appropriateness of
   concatenated versus multigenealogical approaches to resolving species
   relationships, but less so on accurately estimating uncertainty in large
   data sets. Our results demonstrate the importance of employing multiple
   approaches when assessing confidence and highlight the need for greater
   attention to the development of robust measures of uncertainty in the
   era of phylogenomics.},

Abstract = {Establishing an accurate evolutionary timescale for green plants
   (Viridiplantae) is essential to understanding their interaction and
   coevolution with the Earth's climate and the many organisms that rely on
   green plants. Despite being the focus of numerous studies, the timing of
   the origin of green plants and the divergence of major clades within
   this group remain highly controversial. Here, we infer the evolutionary
   timescale of green plants by analyzing 81 protein-coding genes from 99
   chloroplast genomes, using a core set of 21 fossil calibrations. We test
   the sensitivity of our divergence-time estimates to various components
   of Bayesian molecular dating, including the tree topology, clock models,
   clock-partitioning schemes, rate priors, and fossil calibrations. We
   find that the choice of clock model affects date estimation and that the
   independent-rates model provides a better fit to the data than the
   autocorrelated-rates model. Varying the rate prior and tree topology had
   little impact on age estimates, with far greater differences observed
   among calibration choices and clock-partitioning schemes. Our analyses
   yield date estimates ranging from the Paleoproterozoic to
   Mesoproterozoic for crown-group green plants, and from the Ediacaran to
   Middle Ordovician for crown-group land plants. We present
   divergence-time estimates of the major groups of green plants that take
   into account various sources of uncertainty. Our proposed timeline lays
   the foundation for further investigations into how green plants shaped
   the global climate and ecosystems, and how embryophytes became dominant
   in terrestrial environments.},

Abstract = {We describe an ``embarrassingly parallel{''} method for Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference, annealed Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), based on
   recent advances in the SMC literature such as adaptive determination of
   annealing parameters. The algorithm provides an approximate posterior
   distribution over trees and evolutionary parameters as well as an
   unbiased estimator for the marginal likelihood. This unbiasedness
   property can be used for the purpose of testing the correctness of
   posterior simulation software. We evaluate the performance of
   phylogenetic annealed SMC by reviewing and comparing with other
   computational Bayesian phylogenetic methods, in particular, different
   marginal likelihood estimation methods. Unlike previous SMC methods in
   phylogenetics, our annealed method can utilize standard Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) tree moves and hence benefit from the large inventory
   of such moves available in the literature. Consequently, the annealed
   SMC method should be relatively easy to incorporate into existing
   phylogenetic software packages based on MCMC algorithms. We illustrate
   our method using simulation studies and real data analysis.},

Abstract = {Processes leading to spectacular diversity of both form and species on
   islands have been well-documented under island biogeography theory,
   where distance from source and island size are key factors determining
   immigration and extinction resistance. But far less understood are the
   processes governing in situ diversification on the world's mega islands,
   where large and isolated land masses produced morphologically distinct
   radiations from related taxa on continental regions. Madagascar has long
   been recognized as a natural laboratory due to its isolation, lack of
   influence from adjacent continents, and diversification of spectacular
   vertebrate radiations. However, only a handful of studies have examined
   rate shifts of in situ diversification for this island. Here, we examine
   rates of diversification in the Malagasy snakes of the family
   Pseudoxyrhophiinae (gemsnakes) to understand if rates of speciation were
   initially high, enhanced by diversification into distinct biomes, and
   associated with key dentition traits. Using a genomic sequence-capture
   data set for 366 samples, we determine that all previously described and
   newly discovered species are delimitable and therefore useful candidates
   for understanding diversification trajectories through time. Our
   analysis detected no shifts in diversification rate between clades or
   changes in biome or dentition type. Remarkably, we demonstrate that
   rates of diversification of the gemsnake radiation, which originated in
   Madagascar during the early Miocene, remained steady throughout the
   Neogene. However, we do detect a significant slowdown in diversification
   during the Pleistocene. We also comment on the apparent paradox where
   most living species originated in the Pleistocene, despite
   diversification rates being substantially higher during the earlier 15
   myr.},

Title = {Golden Orbweavers Ignore Biological Rules: Phylogenomic and Comparative
   Analyses Unravel a Complex Evolution of Sexual Size Dimorphism},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Instances of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) provide the context for
   rigorous tests of biological rules of size evolution, such as Cope's
   rule (phyletic size increase), Rensch's rule (allometric patterns of
   male and female size), as well as male and female body size optima. In
   certain spider groups, such as the golden orbweavers (Nephilidae),
   extreme femalebiased SSD (eSSD, female:male body length >= 2) is the
   norm. Nephilid genera construct webs of exaggerated proportions, which
   can be aerial, arboricolous, or intermediate (hybrid). First, we
   established the backbone phylogeny of Nephilidae using 367 anchored
   hybrid enrichment markers, then combined these data with classical
   markers for a reference specieslevel phylogeny. Second, we used the
   phylogeny to test Cope and Rensch's rules, sex specific size optima, and
   the coevolution of web size, type, and features with female and male
   body size and their ratio, SSD. Male, but not female, size increases
   significantly over time, and refutes Cope's rule. Allometric analyses
   reject the converse, Rensch's rule. Male and female body sizes are
   uncorrelated. Female size evolution is random, but males evolve toward
   an optimum size (3.2-4.9 mm). Overall, female body size correlates
   positively with absolute web size. However, intermediate sized females
   build the largest webs (of the hybrid type), giant female Nephila and
   Trichonephila build smaller webs (of the aerial type), and the smallest
   females build the smallest webs (of the arboricolous type). We propose
   taxonomic changes based on the criteria of clade age, monophyly and
   exclusivity, classification information content, and diagnosability.
   Spider families, as currently defined, tend to be between 37 million
   years old and 98 million years old, and Nephilidae is estimated at 133
   Ma (97-146), thus deserving family status. We, therefore, resurrect the
   family Nephilidae Simon 1894 that contains Clitaetra Simon 1889, the
   Cretaceous Geratonephila Poinar and Buckley (2012), Herennia Thorell
   1877, Indoetra Kuntner 2006, new rank, Nephila Leach 1815, Nephilengys
   L. Koch 1872, Nephilingis Kuntner 2013, Palaeonephila Wunderlich 2004
   from Tertiary Baltic amber, and Trichonephila Dahl 1911, new rank. We
   propose the new clade Orbipurae to contain Araneidae Clerck 1757,
   Phonognathidae Simon 1894, new rank, and Nephilidae. Nephilid female
   gigantism is a phylogenetically ancient phenotype (over 100 Ma), as is
   eSSD, though their magnitudes vary by lineage.},

Title = {Phylogenies and Diversification Rates: Variance Cannot Be Ignored},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {538-550},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A recent pair of articles published in the journal Evolution presented a
   test for assessing the validity of hierarchical macroevolutionary
   models. The premise of the test is to compare numerical point estimates
   of parameters from two levels of analysis; if the estimates differ, the
   hierarchical model is purportedly flawed. The articles in question apply
   their proposed test to BAMM, a scientific software program that uses a
   Bayesian mixture model to estimate rates of evolution from phylogenetic
   trees. The authors use BAMM to estimate rates from large phylogenies (n
   > 60 tips) and they apply the method separately to subclades within
   those phylogenies (median size: n=3 tips); they find that point
   estimates of rates differ between these levels and conclude that the
   method is flawed, but they do not test whether the observed differences
   are statistically meaningful. There is no consideration of sampling
   variation and its impact at any level of their analysis. Here, I show
   that numerical differences across groups that they report are fully
   explained by a failure to account for sampling variation in their point
   estimates. Variance in evolutionary rate estimates-from BAMM and all
   other methods-is an inverse function of clade size; this variance is
   extreme for clades with five or fewer tips (e.g., 70\% of clades in the
   focal study). The articles in question rely on negative results that are
   easily explained by low statistical power to reject their preferred null
   hypothesis, and this low power is a trivial consequence of high variance
   in their point estimates. I describe additional mathematical and
   statistical mistakes that render the proposed testing framework invalid
   on first principles. Evolutionary rates are no different than any other
   population parameters we might wish to estimate, and biologists should
   use the training and tools already at their disposal to avoid erroneous
   results that followfromthe neglect of variance.},

Abstract = {Accurate modeling of the complexity of morphological evolution is
   crucial for morphological phylogenetics and for performing tests on a
   wide variety of evolutionary scenarios. In this context, morphological
   integration and the problem of correlated categorical characters
   represent a major challenge. In particular, the magnitude and
   implications of correlations among serially homologous structures such
   as teeth have been much debated but were never tested statistically
   within a broad phylogenetic context. Here, we present a large-scale
   empirical study analyzing the serial variation of cingular crests on
   successive molars (M1, M2, and M3) of 274 placental species in a
   phylogenetic context. Both likelihood analyses and analysis of
   phylogenetic co-distributions demonstrated highly correlated evolution
   in the entire sample and thus the non-independence of these serial
   features at a macroevolutionary scale. Likelihood analyses show that
   their serial variation should be better scored within a single composite
   character model with constrained paths for transitions enabling
   simultaneous changes on all three molars, which suggests a strong
   developmental or genetic integration. These results are congruent with
   current genetic and developmental knowledge related to dental
   morphological variation and call into question the frequent use of
   separate characters scored on serially homologous structures of the
   dentition in phylogenetic analyses. Overall, they provide long-overdue
   and clear empirical evidence that in-depth studies of patterns of
   integration constitute an essential step toward more realistic character
   construction and modeling. This approach is critical for more accurate
   morphological phylogenetics and, more generally, for testing
   macroevolutionary scenarios on groups of correlated characters.},

Title = {Targeted Sampling and Target Capture: Assessing Phylogeographic
   Concordance with Genome-wide Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Comparative phylogeography provides the necessary framework to examine
   the factors influencing population divergence, persistence, and change
   over time. Avise (2000) outlined four aspects of concordance that result
   when data exhibit significant phylogeographic signal: concordance among
   sites within a locus, among multiple loci within a species, among
   multiple species within a region, and between genetic patterns and
   established biogeographic provinces. To fully address each aspect of
   concordance, we combined target capture of a set of orthologous loci
   with targeted geographic sampling of multiple species, thus removing any
   variability introduced by using different genetic markers and
   heterogeneous sampling distributions. We used hybrid enrichment and
   high-throughput sequencing of four anuran species sampled from 36
   congruent localities in the Southeastern United States Coastal Plain, a
   region that represents one of the classic systems in phylogeography. In
   total, we recovered >375 of the same nuclear loci across species and
   assembled mitochondrial genomes, resulting in one of the most
   comprehensive comparative phylogeographic datasets in any region or
   taxon to date. We used these data to evaluate concordance, compare
   genetic structure across species, and test previously described
   biogeographic features in the region including major river drainages and
   suture zones. We then applied a recently-developed framework to quantify
   concordance across species using phylogeographic concordance factors.
   For the four species examined, which have higher dispersal and
   potentially limited structure compared to many amphibians, we found poor
   resolution in individual nuclear gene trees even with long (similar to
   1400 bp) nuclear sequences. The mitochondrial and multi-locus nuclear
   datasets, however, produced similar patterns within species, indicated
   high discordance among species, and suggested little correspondence of
   genetic patterns with putative biogeographic barriers. Variation in the
   phylogeographic structure detected may be related to differences in
   natural history, in that the two habitat generalists exhibited less
   structure. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining target
   capture, which is highly repeatable and produces comparable datasets,
   with a targeted sampling strategy to quantify phylogeographic
   concordance across diverse taxa in a region with a complex history.},

Abstract = {The invariable site plus Gamma model (I+Gamma) is widely used to model
   rate heterogeneity among alignment sites in maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The proof that the I+ continuous Gamma
   model is identifiable ( model parameters can be inferred correctly given
   enough data) has increased the creditability of its application to
   phylogeny reconstruction. However, most phylogenetic software implement
   the I+ discrete Gamma model, whose identifiability is likely but
   unproven. How well the parameters of the I+ discrete Gamma model are
   estimated is still disputed. Especially the correlation between the
   fraction of invariable sites and the fractions of sites with a slow
   evolutionary rate is discussed as being problematic. We show that
   optimization heuristics as implemented in frequently used phylogenetic
   software (PhyML, RAxML, IQ-TREE, and MrBayes) cannot always reliably
   estimate the shape parameter, the proportion of invariable sites, and
   the tree length. Here, we propose an improved optimization heuristic
   that accurately estimates the three parameters. While research efforts
   mainly focus on tree search methods, our results signify the equal
   importance of verifying and developing effective estimation methods for
   complex models of sequence evolution.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics of abiotic ecological niches across phylogenetic
   history can shed light on large-scale biogeographic patterns,
   macroevolutionary rate shifts, and the relative ability of lineages to
   respond to global change. An unresolved question is how best to
   represent and reconstruct evolution of these complex traits at coarse
   spatial scales through time. Studies have approached this question by
   integrating phylogenetic comparative methods with niche estimates
   inferred from correlative and other models. However, methods for
   estimating niches often produce incomplete characterizations, as they
   are inferred from present-day distributions that may be limited in full
   expression of the fundamental ecological niche by biotic interactions,
   dispersal limitations, and the existing set of environmental conditions.
   Here, we test whether incomplete niche characterizations inherent in
   most estimates of species' niches bias phylogenetic reconstructions of
   niche evolution, using simulations of virtual species with known niches.
   Results establish that incompletely characterized niches inflate
   estimates of evolutionary change and lead to error in ancestral state
   reconstructions. Our analyses also provide a potential mechanism to
   explain the frequent observation that maximum thermal tolerances are
   more conserved than minimum thermal tolerances: populations and species
   experience more spatial variation in minimum temperature than in maximum
   temperature across their distributions and, consequently, may experience
   stronger diversifying selection for cold tolerance.},

Title = {DEPP: Deep Learning Enables Extending Species Trees using Single Genes},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 29},
Abstract = {Placing new sequences onto reference phylogenies is increasingly used
   for analyzing environmental samples, especially microbiomes. Existing
   placement methods assume that query sequences have evolved under
   specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. For example, they
   assume single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) have evolved under
   the GTR model on a gene tree. Placement, however, often has a more
   ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from
   individual genes without knowing the evolutionary model. Addressing this
   challenging problem requires new directions. Here, we introduce
   Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that
   learns to extend species trees using single genes without prespecified
   models. In simulations and on real data, we show that DEPP can match the
   accuracy of model-based methods without any prior knowledge of the
   model. We also show that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial
   tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further
   demonstrate that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single
   tree, enabling community structure analyses that take advantage of both
   sources of data. {[}Deep learning; gene tree discordance; metagenomics;

Abstract = {Whole genome sequences are beginning to revolutionize our understanding
   of phylogenetic relationships. Yet, even whole genome sequences can fail
   to resolve the evolutionary history of the most rapidly radiating
   lineages, where incomplete lineage sorting, standing genetic variation,
   introgression, and other factors obscure the phylogenetic history of the
   group. To overcome such challenges, one emerging strategy is to
   integrate results across different methods. Most such approaches have
   been implemented on reduced representation genomic data sets, but whole
   genomes should provide the maximum possible evidence approach. Here, we
   test the ability of single nucleotide polymorphisms extracted from whole
   genome resequencing data, implemented in an integrative genomic
   approach, to resolve key nodes in the phylogeny of the mbuna,
   rock-dwelling cichlid fishes of Lake Mala \&\#x175;i, which epitomize
   the phylogenetic intractability that often accompanies explosive lineage
   diversification. This monophyletic radiation has diversified at an
   unparalleled rate into several hundred species in less than 2 million
   years. Using an array of phylogenomic methods, we consistently recovered
   four major clades of mbuna, but a large basal polytomy among them.
   Although introgression between clades apparently contributed to the
   challenge of phylogenetic reconstruction, reduction of the data set to
   nonintrogressed sites still did not help to resolve the basal polytomy.
   On the other hand, relationships among six congeneric species pairs were
   resolved without ambiguity, even in one case where existing data led us
   to predict that resolution would be difficult. We conclude that the
   bursts of diversification at the earliest stages of the mbuna radiation
   may be phylogenetically unresolvable, but other regions of the tree are
   phylogenetically clearly supported. Integration of multiple phylogenomic
   approaches will continue to increase confidence in relationships
   inferred from these and other whole-genome data sets. {[}Incomplete

Title = {Maximum Parsimony Inference of Phylogenetic Networks in the Presence of
   Polyploid Complexes},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic networks provide a powerful framework for modeling and
   analyzing reticulate evolutionary histories. While polyploidy has been
   shown to be prevalent not only in plants but also in other groups of
   eukaryotic species, most work done thus far on phylogenetic network
   inference assumes diploid hybridization. These inference methods have
   been applied, with varying degrees of success, to data sets with
   polyploid species, even though polyploidy violates the mathematical
   assumptions underlying these methods. Statistical methods were developed
   recently for handling specific types of polyploids and so were parsimony
   methods that could handle polyploidy more generally yet while excluding
   processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. In this article, we
   introduce a new method for inferring most parsimonious phylogenetic
   networks on data that include polyploid species. Taking gene tree
   topologies as input, the method seeks a phylogenetic network that
   minimizes deep coalescences while accounting for polyploidy. We
   demonstrate the performance of the method on both simulated and
   biological data. The inference method as well as a method for evaluating
   evolutionary hypotheses in the form of phylogenetic networks are
   implemented and publicly available in the PhyloNet software package.

Title = {Accuracy in Near-Perfect Virus Phylogenies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees from real-world data often include short edges with
   very few substitutions per site, which can lead to partially resolved
   trees and poor accuracy. Theory indicates that the number of sites
   needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate
   proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge.
   However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges,
   ``accuracy{''} should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits
   (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus,
   accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a
   ``near-perfect{''} parameter space in which trees are large, the tree
   length (the sum of all edge lengths) is small, and rate variation is
   minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than /3; the exact
   value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false
   positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small and often
   well below 5\% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this
   result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to
   maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing,
   we show that measures of split ``support{''} that rely on bootstrap
   resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the
   false positive rates in nearperfect trees. The near-perfect parameter
   space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus
   diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus,
   Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative
   to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.},

Title = {Phytogeographic History of the Tea Family Inferred Through
   High-Resolution Phylogeny and Fossils},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1256-1271},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The tea family (Theaceae) has a highly unusual amphi-Pacific disjunct
   distribution: most extant species in the family are restricted to
   subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in East Asia, while a handful of
   species occur exclusively in the subtropical and tropical Americas.
   Here, we used an approach that integrates the rich fossil evidence of
   this group with phylogenies in biogeographic analysis to study the
   processes behind this distribution pattern. We first combined
   genome-skimming sequencing with existing molecular data to build a
   robust species-level phylogeny for c.130 Theaceae species, resolving
   most important unclarified relationships. We then developed an empirical
   Bayesian method to incorporate distribution evidence from fossil
   specimens into historical biogeographic analyses and used this method to
   account for the spatiotemporal history of Theaceae fossils. We compared
   our method with an alternative Bayesian approach and show that it
   provides consistent results while significantly reduces computational
   demands which allows analyses of much larger data sets. Our analyses
   revealed a circumboreal distribution of the family from the early
   Cenozoic to the Miocene and inferred repeated expansions and retractions
   of the modeled distribution in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting that
   the current Theaceae distribution could be the remnant of a larger
   continuous distribution associated with the boreotropical forest that
   has been hypothesized to occupy most of the northern latitudes in the
   early Cenozoic. These results contradict with studies that only
   considered current species distributions and showcase the necessity of
   integrating fossil and molecular data in phylogeny-based parametric
   biogeographic models to improve the reliability of inferred
   biogeographical events.},

Title = {Investigating Morphological Complexes Using Informational Dissonance and
   Bayes Factors: A Case Study in Corbiculate Bees},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {295-306},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is widely recognized that different regions of a genome often have
   different evolutionary histories and that ignoring this variation when
   estimating phylogenies can be misleading. However, the extent to which
   this is also true for morphological data is still largely unknown.
   Discordance among morphological traits might plausibly arise due to
   either variable convergent selection pressures or else phenomena such as
   hemiplasy. Here, we investigate patterns of discordance among 282
   morphological characters, which we scored for 50 bee species
   particularly targeting corbiculate bees, a group that includes the
   well-known eusocial honeybees and bumblebees. As a starting point for
   selecting the most meaningful partitions in the data, we grouped
   characters as morphological modules, highly integrated trait complexes
   that as a result of developmental constraints or coordinated selection
   we expect to share an evolutionary history and trajectory. In order to
   assess conflict and coherence across and within these morphological
   modules, we used recently developed approaches for computing Bayesian
   phylogenetic information allied with model comparisons using Bayes
   factors. We found that despite considerable conflict among morphological
   complexes, accounting for among-character and among-partition rate
   variation with individual gammadistributions, rate multipliers, and
   linked branch lengths can lead to coherent phylogenetic inference using
   morphological data. We suggest that evaluating information content and
   dissonance among partitions is a useful step in estimating phylogenies
   from morphological data, just as it is with molecular data. Furthermore,
   we argue that adopting emerging approaches for investigating dissonance
   in genomic datasets may provide new insights into the integration and
   evolution of anatomical complexes.},

Title = {Phylogeny Estimation Given Sequence Length Heterogeneity},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {268-282},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phylogeny estimation is a major step in many biological studies, and has
   many well known challenges. With the dropping cost of sequencing
   technologies, biologists now have increasingly large datasets available
   for use in phylogeny estimation. Here we address the challenge of
   estimating a tree given large datasets with a combination of full-length
   sequences and fragmentary sequences, which can arise due to a variety of
   reasons, including sample collection, sequencing technologies, and
   analytical pipelines. We compare two basic approaches: (1) computing an
   alignment on the full dataset and then computing a maximum likelihood
   tree on the alignment, or (2) constructing an alignment and tree on the
   full length sequences and then using phylogenetic placement to add the
   remaining sequences (which will generally be fragmentary) into the tree.
   We explore these two approaches on a range of simulated datasets, each
   with 1000 sequences and varying in rates of evolution, and two
   biological datasets. Our study shows some striking performance
   differences between methods, especially when there is substantial
   sequence length heterogeneity and high rates of evolution. We find in
   particular that using UPP to align sequences and RAxML to compute a tree
   on the alignment provides the best accuracy, substantially outperforming
   trees computed using phylogenetic placement methods. We also find that
   FastTree has poor accuracy on alignments containing fragmentary
   sequences. Overall, our study provides insights into the literature
   comparing different methods and pipelines for phylogenetic estimation,
   and suggests directions for future method development.},

   (Amazonian and Huanuco varieties within Erythroxylum coca Lam., and
   Colombian and Trujillo varieties within Erythroxylum novogranatense (D.
   Morris) Hieron.) but our understanding of the domestication and
   evolutionary history of these taxa is nominal. In this study, we use
   genomic data from natural history collections to estimate the geographic
   origins and genetic diversity of this economically and culturally
   important crop in the context of its wild relatives. Our phylogeographic
   analyses clearly demonstrate the four varieties of coca comprise two or
   three exclusive groups nested within the diverse lineages of the
   widespread, wild species Erythroxylum gracilipes; establishing a new and
   robust hypothesis of domestication wherein coca originated two or three
   times from this wild progenitor. The Colombian and Trujillo coca
   varieties are descended from a single, ancient domestication event in
   northwestern South America. Huanuco coca was domesticated more recently,
   possibly in southeastern Peru. Amazonian coca either shares a common
   domesticated ancestor with Huanuco coca, or it was the product of a
   third and most recent independent domestication event in the western
   Amazon basin. This chronology of coca domestication reveals different
   Holocene peoples in South America were able to independently transform
   the same natural resource to serve their needs; in this case, a workaday
   stimulant.},

Title = {Evaluating the Performance of Probabilistic Algorithms for Phylogenetic
   Analysis of Big Morphological Datasets: A Simulation Study},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1088-1105},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Reconstructing the tree of life is an essential task in evolutionary
   biology. It demands accurate phylogenetic inference for both extant and
   extinct organisms, the latter being almost entirely dependent on
   morphological data. While parsimony methods have traditionally dominated
   the field of morphological phylogenetics, a rapidly growing number of
   studies are now employing probabilistic methods (maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian inference). The present-day toolkit of probabilistic methods
   offers varied software with distinct algorithms and assumptions for
   reaching global optimality. However, benchmark performance assessments
   of different software packages for the analyses of morphological data,
   particularly in the era of big data, are still lacking. Here, we test
   the performance of four major probabilistic software under variable
   taxonomic sampling and missing data conditions: the Bayesian
   inference-based programs MrBayes and RevBayes, and the maximum
   likelihood-based IQ-TREE and RAxML. We evaluated software performance by
   calculating the distance between inferred and true trees using a variety
   of metrics, including Robinson-Foulds (RF), Matching Splits (MS), and
   Kuhner-Felsenstein (KF) distances. Our results show that increased
   taxonomic sampling improves accuracy, precision, and resolution of
   reconstructed topologies across all tested probabilistic software
   applications and all levels of missing data. Under the RF metric,
   Bayesian inference applications were the most consistent, accurate, and
   robust to variation in taxonomic sampling in all tested conditions,
   especially at high levels of missing data, with little difference in
   performance between the two tested programs. The MS metric favored more
   resolved topologies that were generally produced by IQ-TREE. Adding more
   taxa dramatically reduced performance disparities between programs.
   Importantly, our results suggest that the RF metric penalizes
   incorrectly resolved nodes (false positives) more severely than the MS
   metric, which instead tends to penalize polytomies. If false positives
   are to be avoided in systematics, Bayesian inference should be preferred
   over maximum likelihood for the analysis of morphological data.},

Title = {Reliable Phylogenetic Regressions for Multivariate Comparative Data:
   Illustration with the MANOVA and Application to the Effect of Diet on
   Mandible Morphology in Phyllostomid Bats},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},
Pages = {927-943},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Understanding what shapes species phenotypes over macroevolutionary
   timescales from comparative data often requires studying the
   relationship between phenotypes and putative explanatory factors or
   testing for differences in phenotypes across species groups. In
   phyllostomid bats for example, is mandible morphology associated to diet
   preferences? Performing such analyses depends upon reliable phylogenetic
   regression techniques and associated tests (e.g., phylogenetic
   Generalized Least Squares, pGLS, and phylogenetic analyses of variance
   and covariance, pANOVA, pANCOVA). While these tools are well established
   for univariate data, their multivariate counterparts are lagging behind.
   This is particularly true for high-dimensional phenotypic data, such as
   morphometric data. Here, we implement much-needed likelihood-based
   multivariate pGLS, pMANOVA, and pMANCOVA, and use a recently developed
   penalized-likelihood framework to extend their application to the
   difficult case when the number of traits p approaches or exceeds the
   number of species n. We then focus on the pMANOVA and use intensive
   simulations to assess the performance of the approach as p increases,
   under various levels of phylogenetic signal and correlations between the
   traits, phylogenetic structure in the predictors, and under various
   types of phenotypic differences across species groups. We show that our
   approach outperforms available alternatives under all circumstances,
   with greater power to detect phenotypic differences across species group
   when they exist, and a lower risk of improperly detecting nonexistent
   differences. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our
   pMANOVA on a geometric-morphometric data set describing mandible
   morphology in phyllostomid bats along with data on their diet
   preferences. Overall our results show significant differences between
   ecological groups. Our approach, implemented in the R package mvMORPH
   and illustrated in a tutorial for end-users, provides efficient
   multivariate phylogenetic regression tools for understanding what shapes
   phenotypic differences across species.},

Title = {The Multispecies Coalescent Model Outperforms Concatenation Across
   Diverse Phylogenomic Data Sets},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {795-812},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A statistical framework of model comparison and model validation is
   essential to resolving the debates over concatenation and coalescent
   models in phylogenomic data analysis. A set of statistical tests are
   here applied and developed to evaluate and compare the adequacy of
   substitution, concatenation, and multispecies coalescent (MSC) models
   across 47 phylogenomic data sets collected across tree of life. Tests
   for substitution models and the concatenation assumption of
   topologically congruent gene trees suggest that a poor fit of
   substitution models, rejected by 44\% of loci, and concatenation models,
   rejected by 38\% of loci, is widespread. Logistic regression shows that
   the proportions of GC content and informative sites are both negatively
   correlated with the fit of substitution models across loci. Moreover, a
   substantial violation of the concatenation assumption of congruent gene
   trees is consistently observed across six major groups (birds, mammals,
   fish, insects, reptiles, and others, including other invertebrates). In
   contrast, among those loci adequately described by a given substitution
   model, the proportion of loci rejecting the MSC model is 11\%,
   significantly lower than those rejecting the substitution and
   concatenation models. Although conducted on reduced data sets due to
   computational constraints, Bayesian model validation and comparison both
   strongly favor the MSC over concatenation across all data sets; the
   concatenation assumption of congruent gene trees rarely holds for
   phylogenomic data sets with more than 10 loci. Thus, for large
   phylogenomic data sets, model comparisons are expected to consistently
   and more strongly favor the coalescent model over the concatenation
   model. We also found that loci rejecting the MSC have little effect on
   species tree estimation. Our study reveals the value of model validation
   and comparison in phylogenomic data analysis, as well as the need for
   further improvements of multilocus models and computational tools for
   phylogenetic inference.},

Title = {Phylogenetic Systematics and Evolution of the Spider Infraorder
   Mygalomorphae Using Genomic Scale Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {671-707},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The infraorder Mygalomorphae is one of the three main lineages of
   spiders comprising over 3000 nominal species. This ancient group has a
   worldwide distribution that includes among its ranks large and
   charismatic taxa such as tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and highly
   venomous funnel-web spiders. Based on past molecular studies using
   Sanger-sequencing approaches, numerous mygalomorph families (e.g.,
   Hexathelidae, Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae, and Nemesiidae)
   have been identified as non-monophyletic. However, these data were
   unable to sufficiently resolve the higher-level (intra- and
   interfamilial) relationships such that the necessary changes in
   classification could be made with confidence. Here, we present a
   comprehensive phylogenomic treatment of the spider infraorder
   Mygalomorphae. We employ 472 loci obtained through anchored hybrid
   enrichment to reconstruct relationships among all the mygalomorph spider
   families and estimate the timeframe of their diversification. We sampled
   nearly all currently recognized families, which has allowed us to assess
   their status, and as a result, propose a new classification scheme. Our
   generic-level sampling has also provided an evolutionary framework for
   revisiting questions regarding silk use in mygalomorph spiders. The
   first such analysis for the group within a strict phylogenetic framework
   shows that a sheet web is likely the plesiomorphic condition for
   mygalomorphs, as well as providing insights to the ancestral foraging
   behavior for all spiders. Our divergence time estimates, concomitant
   with detailed biogeographic analysis, suggest that both ancient
   continental-level vicariance and more recent dispersal events have
   played an important role in shaping modern day distributional patterns.
   Based on our results, we relimit the generic composition of the
   Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae, and Nemesiidae. We also elevate
   five subfamilies to family rank: Anamidae (NEW RANK), Euagridae (NEW
   RANK), Ischnothelidae (NEW RANK), Pycnothelidae (NEW RANK), and
   Bemmeridae (NEW RANK). Three families Entypesidae (NEW FAMILY),
   Microhexuridae (NEW FAMILY), and Stasimopidae (NEW FAMILY), and one
   subfamily Australothelinae (NEW SUBFAMILY) are newly proposed. Such a
   major rearrangement in classification, recognizing nine newly
   established family-level rank taxa, is the largest the group has seen in
   over three decades.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between species is one of
   the most formidable tasks in evolutionary biology. Multiple methods
   exist to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, each with their own strengths
   and weaknesses. Both simulation and empirical studies have identified
   several ``zones{''} of parameter space where accuracy of some methods
   can plummet, even for four-taxon trees. Further, some methods can have
   undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency
   and/or the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong
   support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning
   techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding
   problems in biological research. In this study, we designed a deep
   convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from
   multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make
   inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our
   approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming
   traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions
   of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We
   also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more
   accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and
   posterior probability scores from traditional methods. Although numerous
   practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that the deep
   learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more
   accurate phylogenetic inferences.},

Title = {Sexual Dichromatism Drives Diversification within a Major Radiation of

Abstract = {Theory predicts that sexually dimorphic traits under strong sexual
   selection, particularly those involved with intersexual signaling, can
   accelerate speciation and produce bursts of diversification. Sexual
   dichromatism (sexual dimorphism in color) is widely used as a proxy for
   sexual selection and is associated with rapid diversification in several
   animal groups, yet studies using phylogenetic comparative methods to
   explicitly test for an association between sexual dichromatism and
   diversification have produced conflicting results. Sexual dichromatism
   is rare in frogs, but it is both striking and prevalent in African reed
   frogs, a major component of the diverse frog radiation termed
   Afrobatrachia. In contrast to most other vertebrates, reed frogs display
   female-biased dichromatism in which females undergo color
   transformation, often resulting in more ornate coloration in females
   than in males. We produce a robust phylogeny of Afrobatrachia to
   investigate the evolutionary origins of sexual dichromatism in this
   radiation and examine whether the presence of dichromatism is associated
   with increased rates of net diversification. We find that sexual
   dichromatism evolved once within hyperoliids and was followed by
   numerous independent reversals to monochromatism. We detect significant
   diversification rate heterogeneity in Afrobatrachia and find that
   sexually dichromatic lineages have double the average net
   diversification rate of monochromatic lineages. By conducting trait
   simulations on our empirical phylogeny, we demonstrate that our
   inference of trait-dependent diversification is robust. Although sexual
   dichromatism in hyperoliid frogs is linked to their rapid
   diversification and supports macroevolutionary predictions of speciation
   by sexual selection, the function of dichromatism in reed frogs remains
   unclear. We propose that reed frogs are a compelling system for studying
   the roles of natural and sexual selection on the evolution of sexual
   dichromatism across micro- and macroevolutionary timescales.},

Title = {Metapopulation Vicariance, Age of Island Taxa and Dispersal: A Case

Abstract = {Oceanic islands originate from volcanism or tectonic activity without
   connections to continental landmasses, are colonized by organisms, and
   eventually vanish due to erosion and subsidence. Colonization of oceanic
   islands occurs through long-distance dispersals (LDDs) or metapopulation
   vicariance, the latter resulting in lineages being older than the
   islands they inhabit. If metapopulation vicariance is valid, island ages
   cannot be reliably used to provide maximum age constraints for molecular
   dating. We explore the relationships between the ages of members of a
   widespread plant genus (Planchonella, Sapotaceae) and their host islands
   across the Pacific to test various assumptions of dispersal and
   metapopulation vicariance. We sampled three nuclear DNA markers from 156
   accessions representing some 100 Sapotaceae taxa, and analyzed these in
   BEAST with a relaxed clock to estimate divergence times and with a
   phylogeographic diffusion model to estimate range expansions over time.
   The phylogeny was calibrated with a secondary point (the root) and
   fossils from New Zealand. The dated phylogeny reveals that the ages of
   Planchonella species are, in most cases, consistent with the ages of the
   islands they inhabit. Planchonella is inferred to have originated in the
   Sahul Shelf region, to which it back-dispersed multiple times. Fiji has
   been an important source for range expansion in the Pacific for the past
   23 myr. Our analyses reject metapopulation vicariance in all cases
   tested, including between oceanic islands, evolution of an endemic
   Fiji-Vanuatu flora, and westward rollback vicariance between Vanuatu and
   the Loyalty Islands. Repeated dispersal is the only mechanism able to
   explain the empirical data. The longest (8900 km) identified dispersal
   is between Palau in the Pacific and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean,
   estimated at 2.2 Ma (0.4-4.8 Ma). The first split in a Hawaiian lineage
   (P. sandwicensis) matches the age of Necker Island (11.0 Ma), when its
   ancestor diverged into two species that are distinguished by purple and
   yellow fruits. Subsequent establishment across the Hawaiian archipelago
   supports, in part, progression rule colonization. In summary, we found
   no explanatory power in metapopulation vicariance and conclude that
   Planchonella has expanded its range across the Pacific by LDD. We
   contend that this will be seen in many other groups when analyzed in
   detail.},

Title = {Lack of Signal for the Impact of Conotoxin Gene Diversity on Speciation

Abstract = {Understanding why some groups of organisms are more diverse than others
   is a central goal in macroevolution. Evolvability, or the intrinsic
   capacity of lineages for evolutionary change, is thought to influence
   disparities in species diversity across taxa. Over macroevolutionary
   time scales, clades that exhibit high evolvability are expected to have
   higher speciation rates. Cone snails (family: Conidae, 900 spp.) provide
   a unique opportunity to test this prediction because their toxin genes
   can be used to characterize differences in evolvability between clades.
   Cone snails are carnivorous, use prey-specific venom (conotoxins) to
   capture prey, and the genes that encode venom are known and diversify
   through gene duplication. Theory predicts that higher gene diversity
   confers a greater potential to generate novel phenotypes for
   specialization and adaptation. Therefore, if conotoxin gene diversity
   gives rise to varying levels of evolvability, conotoxin gene diversity
   should be coupled with macroevolutionary speciation rates. We applied
   exon capture techniques to recover phylogenetic markers and conotoxin
   loci across 314 species, the largest venom discovery effort in a single
   study. We paired a reconstructed timetree using 12 fossil calibrations
   with species-specific estimates of conotoxin gene diversity and used
   trait-dependent diversification methods to test the impact of
   evolvability on diversification patterns. Surprisingly, we did not
   detect any signal for the relationship between conotoxin gene diversity
   and speciation rates, suggesting that venom evolution may not be the
   rate-limiting factor controlling diversification dynamics in Conidae.
   Comparative analyses showed some signal for the impact of diet and
   larval dispersal strategy on diversification patterns, though detection
   of a signal depended on the dataset and the method. If our results
   remain true with increased taxonomic sampling in future studies, they
   suggest that the rapid evolution of conid venom may cause other factors
   to become more critical to diversification, such as ecological
   opportunity or traits that promote isolation among lineages.},

Title = {A Universal Probe Set for Targeted Sequencing of 353 Nuclear Genes from
   Any Flowering Plant Designed Using k-Medoids Clustering},

Abstract = {Sequencing of target-enriched libraries is an efficient and
   cost-effective method for obtaining DNA sequence data from hundreds of
   nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the cost of
   developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated with the
   generation of preliminary data needed for the identification of
   orthologous loci for probe design. In plants, identifying orthologous
   loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome
   duplication events, especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants). We
   used multiple sequence alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353
   putatively single-copy protein-coding genes identified by the One
   Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative to design a set of targeted
   sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiospermgroup. To
   maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes, while minimizing the
   cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids clustering approach to
   identify the minimum number of sequences necessary to represent each
   coding sequence in the final probe set. Using this method, 5-15
   representative sequences were selected per orthologous locus,
   representing the sequence diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than
   if probes were designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test
   our approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42 species
   spanning all higher-order groups of angiosperms, with a focus on taxa
   not present in the sequence alignments used to design the probes. Out of
   a possible 353 coding sequences, we recovered an average of 283 per
   species and at least 100 in all species. Differences among taxa in
   sequence recovery could not be explained by relatedness to the
   representative taxa selected for probe design, suggesting that there is
   no phylogenetic bias in the probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260
   kbp of coding sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon
   in coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional
   median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across all
   species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe set
   described here is effective for any group of flowering plants and would
   be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species level to
   higher-order groups, including the entire angiosperm clade itself.},

Title = {A General Method for Simultaneously Accounting for Phylogenetic and
   Species Sampling Uncertainty via Rubin's Rules in Comparative Analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {632-641},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), especially ones based on linear
   models, have played a central role in understanding species' trait
   evolution. These methods, however, usually assume that phylogenetic
   trees are known without error or uncertainty, but this assumption is
   most likely incorrect. So far, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based
   Bayesian methods have mainly been deployed to account for such
   ``phylogenetic uncertainty{''} in PCMs. Herein, we propose an approach
   with which phylogenetic uncertainty is incorporated in a simple, readily
   implementable and reliable manner. Our approach uses Rubin's rules,
   which are an integral part of a standard multiple imputation procedure,
   often employed to recovermissing data. We see true phylogenetic trees as
   missing data under this approach. Further, unmeasured species in
   comparative data (i.e., missing trait data) can be seen as another
   source of uncertainty in PCMs because arbitrary sampling of species in a
   given taxon or ``species sampling uncertainty{''} can affect estimation
   in PCMs. Using two simulation studies, we showour method can account for
   phylogenetic uncertainty under many different scenarios (e.g.,
   uncertainty in topology and branch lengths) and, at the same time, it
   can handle missing trait data (i.e., species sampling uncertainty). A
   unique property of the multiple imputation procedure is that an index,
   named ``relative efficiency,{''} could be used to quantify the number of
   trees required for incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty. Thus, by
   using the relative efficiency, we show the required tree number is
   surprisingly small (similar to 50 trees). However, the most notable
   advantage of our method is that it could be combined seamlessly with
   PCMs that utilize multiple imputation to handle simultaneously
   phylogenetic uncertainty (i.e., missing true trees) and species sampling
   uncertainty (i.e., missing trait data) in PCMs.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Signatures of Ancient Introgression in a Rogue Lineage of
   Darters (Teleostei: Percidae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {329-346},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Evolutionary history is typically portrayed as a branching phylogenetic
   tree, yet not all evolution proceeds in a purely bifurcating manner.
   Introgressive hybridization is one process that results in reticulate
   evolution. Most known examples of genome-wide introgression occur among
   closely related species with relatively recent common ancestry; however,
   we present evidence for ancient hybridization and genome-wide
   introgression between major stem lineages of darters, a species-rich
   clade of North American freshwater fishes. Previous attempts to resolve
   the relationships of darters have been confounded by the uncertain
   phylogenetic resolution of the lineage Allohistium. In this study, we
   investigate the phylogenomics of darters, specifically the relationships
   of Allohistium, through analyses of approximately 30,000 RADseq loci
   sampled from 112 species. Our phylogenetic inferences are based on
   traditional approaches in combination with strategies that accommodate
   reticulate evolution. These analyses result in a novel phylogenetic
   hypothesis for darters that includes ancient introgression between
   Allohistium and other two major darter lineages, minimally occurring 20
   million years ago. Darters offer a compelling case for the necessity of
   incorporating phylogenetic networks in reconstructing the evolutionary
   history of diversification in species-rich lineages. We anticipate that
   the growing wealth of genomic data for clades of non-model organisms
   will reveal more examples of ancient hybridization, eventually requiring
   a re-evaluation of how evolutionary history is visualized and utilized
   in macroevolutonary investigations.},

Title = {Ranked Tree Shapes, Nonrandom Extinctions, and the Loss of Phylogenetic
   Diversity},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1025-1040},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a measure of the evolutionary legacy of a
   group of species, which can be used to define conservation priorities.
   It has been shown that an important loss of species diversity can
   sometimes lead to a much less important loss of PD, depending on the
   topology of the species tree and on the distribution of its branch
   lengths. However, the rate of decrease of PD strongly depends on the
   relative depths of the nodes in the tree and on the order in which
   species become extinct. We introduce a new, sampling-consistent,
   three-parameter model generating random trees with covarying topology,
   clades relative depths, and clades relative extinction risks. This model
   can be seen as an extension to Aldous' one parameter splitting model
   (beta, which controls for tree balance) with two additional parameters:
   a new parameter alpha quantifying the relation between age and richness
   of subclades, and a parameter eta quantifying the relation between
   relative abundance and richness of subclades, taken herein as a proxy
   for overall extinction risk. We show on simulated phylogenies that loss
   of PD depends on the combined effect of all three parameters, beta,
   alpha, and eta. In particular, PD may decrease as fast as species
   diversity when high extinction risks are clustered within small, old
   clades, corresponding to a parameter range that we term the ``danger
   zone{''} (beta <-1 or alpha< 0; eta > 1). Besides, when high extinction
   risks are clustered within large clades, the loss of PD can be higher in
   trees that are more balanced (beta > 0), in contrast to the predictions
   of earlier studies based on simpler models. We propose a Monte-Carlo
   algorithm, tested on simulated data, to infer all three parameters.
   Applying it to a real data set comprising 120 bird clades (class Aves)
   with known range sizes, we show that parameter estimates precisely fall
   close to the danger zone: the combination of their ranking tree shape
   and nonrandom extinctions risks makes them prone to a sudden collapse of
   PD.},

Title = {Dating the Species Network: Allopolyploidy and Repetitive DNA Evolution

Abstract = {Allopolyploidy has played an important role in the evolution of the
   flowering plants. Genome mergers are often accompanied by significant
   and rapid alterations of genome size and structure via chromosomal
   rearrangements and altered dynamics of tandem and dispersed repetitive
   DNA families. Recent developments in sequencing technologies and
   bioinformatic methods allow for a comprehensive investigation of the
   repetitive component of plant genomes. Interpretation of evolutionary
   dynamics following allopolyploidization requires both the knowledge of
   parentage and the age of origin of an allopolyploid. Whereas parentage
   is typically inferred from cytogenetic and phylogenetic data, age
   inference is hampered by the reticulate nature of the phylogenetic
   relationships. Treating subgenomes of allopolyploids as if they belonged
   to different species (i.e., no recombination among subgenomes) and
   applying cross-bracing (i.e., putting a constraint on the age difference
   of nodes pertaining to the same event), we can infer the age of
   allopolyploids within the framework of the multispecies coalescent
   within BEAST2. Together with a comprehensive characterization of the
   repetitive DNA fraction using the RepeatExplorer pipeline, we apply the
   dating approach in a group of closely related allopolyploids and their
   progenitor species in the plant genus Melampodium (Asteraceae). We dated
   the origin of both the allotetraploid, Melampodium strigosum, and its
   two allohexaploid derivatives, Melampodium pringlei and Melampodium
   sericeum, which share both parentage and the direction of the cross, to
   the Pleistocene (<1.4 Ma). Thus, Pleistocene climatic fluctuations may
   have triggered formation of allopolyploids possibly in short intervals,
   contributing to difficulties in inferring the precise temporal order of
   allopolyploid species divergence of M. sericeum and M. pringlei. The
   relatively recent origin of the allopolyploids likely played a role in
   the near-absence of major changes in the repetitive fraction of the
   polyploids' genomes. The repetitive elements most affected by the
   postpolyploidization changes represented retrotransposons of the
   Ty1-copia lineage Maximus and, to a lesser extent, also Athila elements
   of Ty3-gypsy family.},

Abstract = {Ascaridoids are among the commonest groups of zooparasitic nematodes
   (roundworms) and occur in the alimentary canal of all major vertebrate
   groups, including humans. They have an extremely high diversity and are
   of major socio-economic importance. However, their evolutionary history
   remains poorly known. Herein, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic
   analysis of the Ascaridoidea. Our results divided the Ascaridoidea into
   six monophyletic major clades, i.e., the Heterocheilidae,
   Acanthocheilidae, Anisakidae, Ascarididae, Toxocaridae, and
   Raphidascarididae, among which the Heterocheilidae, rather than the
   Acanthocheilidae, represents the sister clade to the remaining
   ascaridoids. The phylogeny was calibrated using an approach that
   involves time priors from fossils of the co-evolving hosts, and dates
   the common ancestor of the Ascaridoidea back to the Early Carboniferous
   (approximately 360.47-325.27 Ma). The divergence dates and ancestral
   host types indicated by our study suggest that members of the
   Ascaridoidea first parasitized terrestrial tetrapods, and subsequently,
   extended their host range to elasmobranchs and teleosts. We also propose
   that the fundamental terrestrial-aquatic switches of these nematodes
   were affected by changes in sea-level during the Triassic to the Early
   Cretaceous.},

Title = {Sexual Signals Persist over Deep Time: Ancient Co-option of

Abstract = {Although the diversity, beauty, and intricacy of sexually selected
   courtship displays command the attention of evolutionists, the longevity
   of these traits in deep time is poorly understood. Population-based
   theory suggests sexual selection could either lower or raise extinction
   risk, resulting in high or low persistence of lineages with sexually
   selected traits. Furthermore, empirical studies that directly estimate
   the longevity of sexually selected traits are uncommon. Sexually
   selected signals-including bioluminescent courtship-originated multiple
   times during evolution, allowing the empirical study of their longevity
   after careful phylogenetic and divergence time analyses. Here, we
   estimate the first transcriptome-based molecular phylogeny and
   divergence times of Cypridinidae. We report extreme longevity of
   bioluminescent courtship, a trait important in mate choice and probably
   under sexual selection. Our relaxed-clock estimates of divergence times
   coupled with stochastic character mapping show luminous courtship
   evolved only once in Cypridinidae-in a Sub-Tribe, we name Luxorina-at
   least 151 millions of years ago from cypridinid ancestors that used
   bioluminescence only in antipredator displays, defining a Tribe we name
   Luminini. This time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of cypridinids will
   serve as a foundation for integrative and comparative studies on the
   biochemistry, molecular evolution, courtship, diversification, and
   ecology of cypridinid bioluminescence. The persistence of luminous
   courtship for hundreds of millions of years suggests that sexual
   selection did not cause a rapid loss of associated traits, and that
   rates of speciation within the group exceeded extinction risk, which may
   contribute to the persistence of a diverse clade of signaling species.

Title = {How to Render Species Comparable Taxonomic Units Through Deep Time: A
   Case Study on Intraspecific Osteological Variability in Extant and
   Extinct Lacertid Lizards},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Generally, the species is considered to be the only naturally occurring
   taxon. However, species recognized and defined using different species
   delimitation criteria cannot readily be compared, impacting studies of
   biodiversity through Deep Time. This comparability issue is particularly
   marked when comparing extant with extinct species because the only
   available data for species delimitation in fossils are derived from
   their preserved morphology, which is generally restricted to osteology
   in vertebrates. Here, we quantify intraspecific, intrageneric, and
   intergeneric osteological variability in extant species of lacertid
   lizards using pairwise dissimilarity scores based on a data set of 253
   discrete osteological characters for 99 specimens referred to 24
   species. Variability is always significantly lower intraspecifically
   than between individuals belonging to distinct species of a single
   genus, which is in turn significantly lower than intergeneric
   variability. Average values of intraspecific variability and associated
   standard deviations are consistent (with few exceptions), with an
   overall average within a species of 0.208 changes per character scored.
   Application of the same methods to six extinct lacertid species
   (represented by 40 fossil specimens) revealed that intraspecific
   osteological variability is inconsistent, which can at least in part be
   attributed to different researchers having unequal expectations of the
   skeletal dissimilarity within species units. Such a divergent
   interpretation of intraspecific and interspecific variability among
   extant and extinct species reinforces the incomparability of the species
   unit. Lacertidae is an example where extant species recognized and
   defined based on a number of delimitation criteria show comparable and
   consistent intraspecific osteological variability. Here, as well as in
   equivalent cases, application of those skeletal dissimilarity values to
   paleontological species delimitation potentially provides a way to
   ameliorate inconsistencies created by the use of morphology to define
   species. {[}Intraspecific variation; Lacertidae; morphological

Abstract = {The charismatic trumpetfishes, goatfishes, dragonets, flying gurnards,
   seahorses, and pipefishes encompass a recently defined yet
   extraordinarily diverse Glade of percomorph fishes-the series
   Syngnatharia. This group is widely distributed in tropical and
   warm-temperate regions, with a great proportion of its extant diversity
   occurring in the Indo-Pacific. Because most syngnatharians feature
   long-range dispersal capabilities, tracing their biogeographic origins
   is challenging. Here, we applied an integrative phylogenomic approach to
   elucidate the evolutionary biogeography of syngnatharians. We built upon
   a recently published phylogenomic study that examined ultraconserved
   elements by adding 62 species (total 169 species) and one family
   (Draconettidae), to cover ca. 25\% of the species diversity and all 10
   families in the group. We inferred a set of time-calibrated trees and
   conducted ancestral range estimations. We also examined the sensitivity
   of these analyses to phylogenetic uncertainty (estimated from multiple
   genomic subsets), area delimitation, and biogeographic models that
   include or exclude the jump-dispersal parameter (j). Of the three
   factors examined, we found that the j parameter has the strongest effect
   in ancestral range estimates, followed by number of areas defined, and
   tree topology and divergence times. After accounting for these
   uncertainties, our results reveal that syngnatharians originated in the
   ancient Tethys Sea ca. 87 Ma (84-94 Ma; Late Cretaceous) and
   subsequently occupied the Indo-Pacific. Throughout syngnatharian
   history, multiple independent lineages colonized the eastern Pacific
   (6-8 times) and the Atlantic (6-14 times) from their center of origin,
   with most events taking place following an east-to-west route prior to
   the closure of the Tethys Seaway ca. 12-18 Ma. Ultimately, our study
   highlights the importance of accounting for different factors generating
   uncertainty in macroevolutionary and biogeographic inferences.},

Abstract = {In a recent paper, Poe et al. assert that scientists should abandon
   clade-based approaches, particularly those using named taxonomic ranks.
   Poe et al. attempt to demonstrate that clade selection can have effects
   on the results of evolutionary analyses but unfortunately fall short of
   making any robust conclusions. Here, we demonstrate that the assertions
   made by Poe et al. have two important flaws: (i) an erroneous view of
   modern phylogenetic comparative methods; and (ii) a lack of statistical
   rigor in their analyses. We repeat Poe et al.'s analysis but using
   appropriate phylogenetic comparative approaches. We demonstrate that
   results remain consistent regardless of the clade definition. We go on
   to discuss the value of taxonomic groupings and how they can provide
   meaningful units of comparison in evolutionary study. Unlike the
   disheartening suggestion to abandon the use of clades, scientists can
   instead continue to use phylogenetic ``corrections{''} that are already
   the standard for most comparative evolutionary analyses.},

Title = {Parallel Evolution of Bower-Building Behavior in Two Groups of
   Bowerbirds Suggested by Phylogenomics},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},
Pages = {820-829},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The bowerbirds in New Guinea and Australia include species that build
   the largest and perhaps most elaborately decorated constructions outside
   of humans. The males use these courtship bowers, along with their
   displays, to attract females. In these species, the mating system is
   polygynous and the females alone incubate and feed the nestlings. The
   bowerbirds also include 10 species of the socially monogamous catbirds
   in which the male participates in most aspects of raising the young. How
   the bower-building behavior evolved has remained poorly understood, as
   no comprehensive phylogeny exists for the family. It has been assumed
   that the monogamous catbird lade is sister to all polygynous species. We
   here test this hypothesis using a newly developed pipeline for obtaining
   homologous alignments of thousands of exonic and intronic regions from
   genomic data to build a phylogeny. Our well-supported species tree shows
   that the polygynous, bower-building species are not monophyletic. The
   result suggests either that bower-building behavior is an ancestral
   condition in the family that was secondarily lost in the catbirds, or
   that it has arisen in parallel in two lineages of bowerbirds. We favor
   the latter hypothesis based on an ancestral character reconstruction
   showing that polygyny but not bower-building is ancestral in bowerbirds,
   and on the observation that Scenopoeetes dentirostris, the sister
   species to one of the bower-building clades, does not build a proper
   bower but constructs a court for male display. This species is also
   sexually monomorphic in plumage despite having a polygynous mating
   system. We argue that the relatively stable tropical and subtropical
   forest environment in combination with low predator pressure and rich
   food access (mostly fruit) facilitated the evolution of these unique
   life-history traits.},

Abstract = {We answer two questions raised by Bryant, Francis, and Steel in their
   work on consensus methods in phylogenetics. Consensus methods apply to
   every practical instance where it is desired to aggregate a set of given
   phylogenetic trees (say, gene evolution trees) into a resulting,
   ``consensus{''} tree (say, a species tree). Various stability criteria
   have been explored in this context, seeking to model desirable
   consistency properties of consensus methods as the experimental data are
   updated (e.g., more taxa, or more trees, are mapped). However, such
   stability conditions can be incompatible with some basic regularity
   properties that are widely accepted to be essential in any meaningful
   consensus method. Here, we prove that such an incompatibility does arise
   in the case of extension stability on binary trees and in the case of
   associative stability. Our methods combine general theoretical
   considerations with the use of computer programs tailored to the given
   stability requirements.},

Abstract = {The dissection of the mode and tempo of phenotypic evolution is integral
   to our understanding of global biodiversity. Our ability to infer
   patterns of phenotypes across phylogenetic clades is essential to how we
   infer the macroevolutionary processes governing those patterns. Many
   methods are already available for fitting models of phenotypic evolution
   to data. However, there is currently no comprehensive nonparametric
   framework for characterizing and comparing patterns of phenotypic
   evolution. Here, we build on a recently introduced approach for using
   the phylogenetic spectral density profile (SDP) to compare and
   characterize patterns of phylogenetic diversification, in order to
   provide a framework for nonparametric analysis of phylogenetic trait
   data. We show how to construct the SDP of trait data on a phylogenetic
   tree from the normalized graph Laplacian. We demonstrate on simulated
   data the utility of the SDP to successfully cluster phylogenetic trait
   data into meaningful groups and to characterize the phenotypic
   patterning within those groups. We furthermore demonstrate how the SDP
   is a powerful tool for visualizing phenotypic space across traits and
   for assessing whether distinct trait evolution models are
   distinguishable on a given empirical phylogeny. We illustrate the
   approach in two empirical data sets: a comprehensive data set of traits
   involved in song, plumage, and resource-use in tanagers, and a
   high-dimensional data set of endocranial landmarks in New World monkeys.
   Considering the proliferation of morphometric and molecular data
   collected across the tree of life, we expect this approach will benefit
   big data analyses requiring a comprehensive and intuitive framework.},

Abstract = {Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo explores tree space slowly, in part
   because it frequently returns to the same tree topology. An alternative
   strategy would be to explore tree space systematically, and never return
   to the same topology. In this article, we present an efficient
   parallelized method to map out the high likelihood set of phylogenetic
   tree topologies via systematic search, which we show to be a good
   approximation of the high posterior set of tree topologies on the data
   sets analyzed. Here, ``likelihood{''} of a topology refers to the tree
   likelihood for the corresponding tree with optimized branch lengths. We
   call this method ``phylogenetic topographer{''} (PT). The PT strategy is
   very simple: starting in a number of local topology maxima (obtained by
   hill-climbing from random starting points), explore out using local
   topology rearrangements, only continuing through topologies that are
   better than some likelihood threshold below the best observed topology.
   We show that the normalized topology likelihoods are a useful proxy for
   the Bayesian posterior probability of those topologies. By using a
   nonblocking hash table keyed on unique representations of tree
   topologies, we avoid visiting topologies more than once across all
   concurrent threads exploring tree space. We demonstrate that PT can be
   used directly to approximate a Bayesian consensus tree topology. When
   combined with an accurate means of evaluating per-topology marginal
   likelihoods, PT gives an alternative procedure for obtaining Bayesian
   posterior distributions on phylogenetic tree topologies.},

Title = {Phylotocol: Promoting Transparency and Overcoming Bias in Phylogenetics},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {The integrity of science requires that the process be based on sound
   experimental design and objective methodology. Strategies that increase
   reproducibility and transparency in science protect this integrity by
   reducing conscious and unconscious biases. Given the large number of
   analysis options and the constant development of new methodologies in
   phylogenetics, this field is one that would particularly benefit from
   more transparent research design. Herein, we introduce phylotocol (fi lo
   `ta kol), an a priori protocol-driven approach in which all analyses are
   planned and documented at the start of a project. The phylotocol
   template is simple and the implementation options are flexible to reduce
   administrative burdens and allow researchers to adapt it to their needs
   without restricting scientific creativity. While the primary goal of
   phylotocol is to increase transparency and accountability, it has a
   number of auxiliary benefits including improving study design and
   reproducibility, enhancing collaboration and education, and increasing
   the likelihood of project completion. Our goal with this Point of View
   article is to encourage a dialog about transparency in phylogenetics and
   the best strategies to bring transparent research practices to our
   field.},

Title = {Estimating Correlated Rates of Trait Evolution with Uncertainty},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {412-429},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Correlated evolution among traits, which can happen due to genetic
   constraints, ontogeny, and selection, can have an important impact on
   the trajectory of phenotypic evolution. For example, shifts in the
   pattern of evolutionary integration may allow the exploration of novel
   regions of the morphospace by lineages. Here, we use phylogenetic trees
   to study the pace of evolution of several traits and their pattern of
   evolutionary correlation across clades and over time. We use regimes
   mapped to the branches of the phylogeny to test for shifts in
   evolutionary integration while incorporating the uncertainty related to
   trait evolution and ancestral regimes with joint estimation of all
   parameters of the model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We
   implemented the use of summary statistics to test for regime shifts
   based on a series of attributes of the model that can be directly
   relevant to biological hypotheses. In addition, we extend Felsenstein's
   pruning algorithm to the case of multivariate Brownian motion models
   with multiple rate regimes. We performed extensive simulations to
   explore the performance of the method under a series of scenarios.
   Finally, we provide two test cases; the evolution of a novel buccal
   morphology in fishes of the family Centrarchidae and a shift in the
   trajectory of evolution of traits during the radiation of anole lizards
   to and from the Caribbean islands.},

Abstract = {Scientists building the Tree of Life face an overwhelming challenge to
   categorize phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, physiology) from millions of
   living and fossil species. This biodiversity challenge far outstrips the
   capacities of trained scientific experts. Here we explore whether
   crowdsourcing can be used to collect matrix data on a large scale with
   the participation of nonexpert students, or ``citizen scientists.{''}
   Crowdsourcing, or data collection by nonexperts, frequently via the
   internet, has enabled scientists to tackle some large-scale data
   collection challenges too massive for individuals or scientific teams
   alone. The quality of work by nonexpert crowds is, however, often
   questioned and little data have been collected on how such crowds
   performon complex tasks such as phylogenetic character coding. We
   studied a crowd of over 600 nonexperts and found that they could use
   images to identify anatomical similarity (hypotheses of homology) with
   an average accuracy of 82\% compared with scores provided by experts in
   the field. This performance pattern held across the Tree of Life, from
   protists to vertebrates. We introduce a procedure that predicts the
   difficulty of each character and that can be used to assign harder
   characters to experts and easier characters to a nonexpert crowd for
   scoring. We test this procedure in a controlled experiment comparing
   crowd scores to those of experts and showthat crowds can produce
   matrices with over 90\% of cells scored correctly while reducing the
   number of cells to be scored by experts by 50\%. Preparation time,
   including image collection and processing, for a crowdsourcing
   experiment is significant, and does not currently save time of
   scientific experts overall. However, if innovations in automation or
   robotics can reduce such effort, then large-scale implementation of our
   method could greatly increase the collective scientific knowledge of
   species phenotypes for phylogenetic tree building. For the field of
   crowdsourcing, we provide a rare study with ground truth, or an
   experimental control that many studies lack, and contribute new methods
   on how to coordinate the work of experts and nonexperts. We show that
   there are important instances in which crowd consensus is not a good
   proxy for correctness.},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {The fossilized birth-death (FBD) model is a naturally appealing way of
   directly incorporating fossil information when estimating
   diversification rates. However, an important yet often overlooked
   property of the original FBD derivation is that it distinguishes between
   two types of sampled lineages. Here, we first discuss and demonstrate
   the impact of severely undersampling, and even not including fossils
   that represent samples of lineages that also had sampled descendants. We
   then explore the benefits of including fossils, generally, by
   implementing and then testing two types of FBD models, including one
   that converts a fossil set into stratigraphic ranges, in more complex
   likelihood-based models that assume multiple rate classes across the
   tree. Under various simulation scenarios, including a scenario that
   exists far outside the set of models we evaluated, including fossils
   rarely outperform analyses that exclude them altogether. At best, the
   inclusion of fossils improves precision but does not influence bias.
   Similarly, we found that converting the fossil set to stratigraphic
   ranges, which is one way to remedy the effects of undercounting the
   number of k-type fossils, results in turnover rates and extinction
   fraction estimates that are generally underestimated. Although fossils
   remain essential for understanding diversification through time, in the
   specific case of understanding diversification given an existing,
   largely modern tree, they are not especially beneficial.},

Title = {Impact of Ghost Introgression on Coalescent-Based Species Tree Inference
   and Estimation of Divergence Time},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-49},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {The species studied in any evolutionary investigation generally
   constitute a small proportion of all the species currently existing or
   that have gone extinct. It is therefore likely that introgression, which
   is widespread across the tree of life, involves ``ghosts,{''} that is,
   unsampled, unknown, or extinct lineages. However, the impact of ghost
   introgression on estimations of species trees has rarely been studied
   and is poorly understood. Here, we use mathematical analysis and
   simulations to examine the robustness of species tree methods based on
   the multispecies coalescent model to introgression from a ghost or
   extant lineage. We found that many results originally obtained for
   introgression between extant species can easily be extended to ghost
   introgression, such as the strongly interactive effects of incomplete
   lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression on the occurrence of anomalous
   gene trees. The relative performance of the summary species tree method
   (ASTRAL) and the full-likelihood method ({*}BEAST) varies under
   different introgression scenarios, with the former being more robust to
   gene flow between nonsister species, whereas the latter performing
   better under certain conditions of ghost introgression. When an outgroup
   ghost (defined as a lineage that diverged before the most basal species
   under investigation) acts as the donor of the introgressed genes, the
   time of root divergence among the investigated species generally was
   overestimated, whereas ingroup introgression, as commonly perceived, can
   only lead to underestimation. In many cases of ingroup introgression
   that may or may not involve ghost lineages, the stronger the ILS, the
   higher the accuracy achieved in estimating the time of root divergence,

Abstract = {Using time-reversible Markov models is a very common practice in
   phylogenetic analysis, because although we expect many of their
   assumptions to be violated by empirical data, they provide high
   computational efficiency. However, these models lack the ability to
   infer the root placement of the estimated phylogeny. In order to
   compensate for the inability of these models to root the tree, many
   researchers use external information such as using outgroup taxa or
   additional assumptions such as molecular clocks. In this study, we
   investigate the utility of nonreversible models to root empirical
   phylogenies and introduce a new bootstrap measure, the rootstrap, which
   provides information on the statistical support for any given root
   position. {[}Bootstrap; nonreversible models; phylogenetic inference;

Title = {Phylogenomic Species Delimitation Dramatically Reduces Species Diversity
   in an Antarctic Adaptive Radiation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Application of genetic data to species delimitation often builds
   confidence in delimitations previously hypothesized using morphological,
   ecological, and geographic data and frequently yields recognition of
   previously undescribed cryptic diversity. However, a recent critique of
   genomic data-based species delimitation approaches is that they have the
   potential to conflate population structure with species diversity,
   resulting in taxonomic oversplitting. The need for an integrative
   approach to species delimitation, in which molecular, morphological,
   ecological, and geographic lines of evidence are evaluated together, is
   becoming increasingly apparent. Here, we integrate phylogenetic,
   population genetic, and coalescent analyses of genome-wide sequence data
   with investigation of variation in multiple morphological traits to
   delimit species within the Antarctic barbeled plunderfishes
   (Artedidraconidae: Pogonophryne). Pogonophryne currently comprises 29
   valid species, most of which are distinguished solely by variation in
   the ornamentation of the mental barbel that projects from the lower jaw,
   a structure previously shown to vary widely within a single species.
   However, our genomic and phenotypic analyses result in a dramatic
   reduction in the number of distinct species recognized within the clade,
   providing evidence to support the recognition of no more than six
   species. We propose to synonymize 24 of the currently recognized species
   with five species of Pogonophryne. We find genomic and phenotypic
   evidence for a new species of Pogonophryne from specimens collected in
   the Ross Sea. Our findings represent a rare example in which the
   application of molecular data provides evidence of taxonomic
   oversplitting on the basis of morphology, clearly demonstrating the
   utility of an integrative species delimitation framework.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Dispersal-Driven Speciation and Divergence
   with Gene Flow in Lesser Sunda Flying Lizards (Genus Draco)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {221-241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Lesser Sunda Archipelago offers exceptional potential as a model
   system for studying the dynamics of dispersal-driven diversification.
   The geographic proximity of the islands suggests the possibility for
   successful dispersal, but this is countered by the permanence of the
   marine barriers and extreme intervening currents that are expected to
   hinder gene flow. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses of
   flying lizards (genus Draco) using single mitochondrial genes, complete
   mitochondrial genomes, and exome-capture data sets identified 9-11
   deeply divergent lineages including single-island endemics, lineages
   that span multiple islands, and parapatrically distributed nonsister
   lineages on the larger islands. Population clustering and PCA confirmed
   these genetic boundaries with isolation-by-distance playing a role in
   some islands or island sets. While gdi estimates place most candidate
   species comparisons in the ambiguous zone, migration estimates suggest 9
   or 10 species exist with nuclear introgression detected across some
   intra-island contact zones. Initial entry of Draco into the archipelago
   occurred at 5.5-7.5 Ma, with most inter-island colonization events
   having occurred between 1-3 Ma. Biogeographical model testing favors
   scenarios integrating geographic distance and historical island
   connectivity, including an initial stepping-stone dispersal process from
   the Greater Sunda Shelf through the Sunda Arc as far eastward as Lembata
   Island. However, rather than reaching the adjacent island of Pantar by
   dispersing over the 15-km wide Alor Strait, Draco ultimately reached
   Pantar (and much of the rest of the archipelago) by way of a circuitous
   route involving at least five overwater dispersal events. These findings
   suggest that historical geological and oceanographic conditions heavily
   influenced dispersal pathways and gene flow, which in turn drove species
   formation and shaped species boundaries.},

Title = {A Total-Evidence Dated Phylogeny of Echinoidea Combining Phylogenomic
   and Paleontological Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-439},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phylogenomic and paleontological data constitute complementary resources
   for unraveling the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of
   lineages, yet few studies have attempted to fully integrate them.
   Several unique properties of echinoids (sea urchins) make them
   especially useful for such synthesizing approaches, including a
   remarkable fossil record that can be incorporated into explicit
   phylogenetic hypotheses. We revisit the phylogeny of crown group
   Echinoidea using a total-evidence dating approach that combines the
   largest phylogenomic data set for the clade, a large-scale morphological
   matrix with a dense fossil sampling, and a novel compendium of tip and
   node age constraints. To this end, we develop a novel method for
   subsampling phylogenomic data sets that selects loci with high
   phylogenetic signal, low systematic biases, and enhanced clock-like
   behavior. Our results demonstrate that combining different data sources
   increases topological accuracy and helps resolve conflicts between
   molecular and morphological data. Notably, we present a new hypothesis
   for the origin of sand dollars, and restructure the relationships
   between stem and crown echinoids in a way that implies a long stretch of
   undiscovered evolutionary history of the crown group in the late
   Paleozoic. Our efforts help bridge the gap between phylogenomics and
   phylogenetic paleontology, providing a model example of the benefits of
   combining the two.},

Abstract = {The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to produce
   genome-scale data sets was expected to settle some long-standing
   controversies across the Tree of Life, particularly in areas where short
   branches occur at deep timescales. Instead, these data sets have often
   yielded many well-supported but conflicting topologies, and highly
   variable genetree distributions. A variety of branch-support metrics
   beyond the nonparametric bootstrap are now available to assess how
   robust a phylogenetic hypothesis may be, as well as new methods to
   quantify gene-tree discordance. We applied multiple branch-support
   metrics to a study of an ancient group of marine fishes (Teleostei:
   Pelagiaria) whose interfamilial relationships have proven difficult to
   resolve due to a rapid accumulation of lineages very early in its
   history. We analyzed hundreds of loci including published ultraconserved
   elements and newly generated exonic data along with their flanking
   regions to represent all 16 extant families for more than 150 out of 284
   valid species in the group. Branch support was typically lower at inter-
   than intra-familial relationships regardless of the type of marker used.
   Several nodes that were highly supported with bootstrap had a very low
   site and gene-tree concordance, revealing underlying conflict. Despite
   this conflict, we were able to identify four consistent interfamilial
   clades, each comprised of two or three families. Combining exons with
   their flanking regions also produced increased branch lengths at the
   deep branches of the pelagiarian tree. Our results demonstrate the
   limitations of employing current metrics of branch support and
   species-tree estimation when assessing the confidence of ancient
   evolutionary radiations and emphasize the necessity to embrace
   alternative measurements to explore phylogenetic uncertainty and
   discordance in phylogenomic data sets.},

Title = {Delayed Adaptive Radiation among New Zealand Stream Fishes: Joint
   Estimation of Divergence Time and Trait Evolution in a Newly Delineated
   Island Species Flock},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptive radiations are generally thought to occur soon after a lineage
   invades a region offering high levels of ecological opportunity.
   However, few adaptive radiations beyond a handful of exceptional
   examples are known, so a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics
   is still lacking. Here, we present a novel case of an island species
   flock of freshwater fishes with a radically different tempo of adaptive
   history than that found in many popular evolutionary model systems.
   Using a phylogenomic data set combined with simultaneous Bayesian
   estimation of divergence times and trait-based speciation and extinction
   models, we show that the New Zealand Gobiomorphus gudgeons comprise a
   monophyletic assemblage, but surprisingly, the radiation did not fully
   occupy freshwater habitats and explosively speciate until more than 10
   myr after the lineage invaded the islands. This shift in speciation rate
   was not accompanied by an acceleration in the rate of morphological
   evolution in the freshwater crown clade relative to the other species,
   but is correlated with a reduction in head pores and scales as well as
   an increase in egg size. Our results challenge the notion that clades
   always rapidly exploit ecological opportunities in the absence of
   competing lineages. Instead, we demonstrate that adaptive radiation can
   experience a slow start before undergoing accelerated diversification
   and that lineage and phenotypic diversification may be uncoupled in
   young radiations.},

Title = {The Cumulative Indel Model: Fast and Accurate Statistical Evolutionary
   Alignment},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {236-257},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sequence alignment is essential for phylogenetic and molecular evolution
   inference, as well as in many other areas of bioinformatics and
   evolutionary biology. Inaccurate alignments can lead to severe biases in
   most downstream statistical analyses. Statistical alignment based on
   probabilistic models of sequence evolution addresses these issues by
   replacing heuristic score functions with evolutionary model-based
   probabilities. However, score-based aligners and fixed-alignment
   phylogenetic approaches are still more prevalent than methods based on
   evolutionary indel models, mostly due to computational convenience.
   Here, I present new techniques for improving the accuracy and speed of
   statistical evolutionary alignment. The ``cumulative indel model{''}
   approximates realistic evolutionary indel dynamics using differential
   equations. ``Adaptive banding{''} reduces the computational demand of
   most alignment algorithms without requiring prior knowledge of
   divergence levels or pseudo-optimal alignments. Using simulations, I
   show that these methods lead to fast and accurate pairwise alignment
   inference. Also, I showthat it is possible, with these methods, to align
   and infer evolutionary parameters from a single long synteny block
   (similar to 530 kbp) between the human and chimp genomes. The cumulative
   indel model and adaptive banding can therefore improve the performance
   of alignment and phylogenetic methods.},

Title = {A Phenotype-Genotype Codon Model for Detecting Adaptive Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {722-738},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A central objective in biology is to link adaptive evolution in a gene
   to structural and/or functional phenotypic novelties. Yet most analytic
   methods make inferences mainly from either phenotypic data or genetic
   data alone. A small number of models have been developed to infer
   correlations between the rate of molecular evolution and changes in a
   discrete or continuous life history trait. But such correlations are not
   necessarily evidence of adaptation. Here, we present a novel approach
   called the phenotype-genotype branch-site model (PG-BSM) designed to
   detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with
   discrete-state phenotype evolution. An episode of adaptation is inferred
   under standard codon substitution models when there is evidence of
   positive selection in the form of an elevation in the
   nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio to a value . As it is becoming
   increasingly clear that can occur without adaptation, the PG-BSM was
   formulated to infer an instance of adaptive evolution without appealing
   to evidence of positive selection. The null model makes use of a
   covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (i.e., random
   changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative
   model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for
   phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific
   mechanisms of molecular adaptation. These include 1) a persistent
   increase/decrease in at a site following a change in phenotype (the
   pattern) consistent with an increase/decrease in the functional
   importance of the site (the mechanism); and 2) a transient increase in
   at a site along a branch over which the phenotype changed (the pattern)
   consistent with a change in the site's optimal amino acid (the
   mechanism). Rejection of the null is followed by post hoc analyses to
   identify sites with strongest evidence for adaptation in association
   with changes in the phenotype as well as the most likely evolutionary
   history of the phenotype. Simulation studies based on a novel method for
   generating mechanistically realistic signatures of molecular adaptation
   show that the PG-BSM has good statistical properties. Analyses of real
   alignments show that site patterns identified post hoc are consistent
   with the specific mechanisms of adaptation included in the alternate
   model. Further simulation studies show that the covarion-like component
   of the PG-BSM plays a crucial role in mitigating recently discovered
   statistical pathologies associated with confounding by accounting for
   heterotachy-by-any-cause.},

Title = {19 Dubious Ways to Compute the Marginal Likelihood of a Phylogenetic
   Tree Topology},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-220},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The marginal likelihood of a model is a key quantity for assessing the
   evidence provided by the data in support of a model. The marginal
   likelihood is the normalizing constant for the posterior density,
   obtained by integrating the product of the likelihood and the prior with
   respect to model parameters. Thus, the computational burden of computing
   the marginal likelihood scales with the dimension of the parameter
   space. In phylogenetics, where we work with tree topologies that are
   high-dimensional models, standard approaches to computing marginal
   likelihoods are very slow. Here, we study methods to quickly compute the
   marginal likelihood of a single fixed tree topology. We benchmark the
   speed and accuracy of 19 different methods to compute the marginal
   likelihood of phylogenetic topologies on a suite of real data sets under
   the JC69 model. These methods include several new ones that we develop
   explicitly to solve this problem, as well as existing algorithms that we
   apply to phylogenetic models for the first time. Altogether, our results
   show that the accuracy of these methods varies widely, and that accuracy
   does not necessarily correlate with computational burden. Our newly
   developed methods are orders of magnitude faster than standard
   approaches, and in some cases, their accuracy rivals the best
   established estimators.},

Abstract = {Phylogenomic analyses have increasingly adopted species tree

   using pipelines that require both human effort and computational
   resources. As the number of available genomes continues to increase, a
   new problem is facing researchers. Once more species become available,
   they have to repeat the whole process from the beginning because
   updating species trees is currently not possible. However, the de novo
   inference can be prohibitively costly in human effort or machine time.
   In this article, we introduce INSTRAL, a method that extends ASTRAL to
   enable phylogenetic placement. INSTRAL is designed to place a new
   species on an existing species tree after sequences from the new species
   have already been added to gene trees; thus, INSTRAL is complementary to
   existing placement methods that update gene trees.},

Title = {Quartet-Based Computations of Internode Certainty Provide Robust
   Measures of Phylogenetic Incongruence},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {308-324},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Incongruence, or topological conflict, is prevalent in genome-scale data
   sets. Internode certainty (IC) and related were recently introduced to
   explicitly quantify the level of incongruence of a given internal branch
   among a set of phylogenetic trees and complement regular branch support
   measures (e.g., bootstrap, posterior probability) that instead assess
   the statistical confidence of inference. Since most phylogenomic studies
   contain data partitions (e.g., genes) with missing taxa and IC scores
   stem from the frequencies of bipartitions (or splits) on a set of trees,
   IC score calculation typically requires adjusting the frequencies of
   bipartitions from these partial gene trees. However, when the proportion
   of missing taxa is high, the scores yielded by current approaches that
   adjust bipartition frequencies in partial gene trees differ
   substantially from each other and tend to be overestimates. To overcome
   these issues, we developed three new IC measures based on the
   frequencies of quartets, which naturally apply to both complete and
   partial trees. Comparison of our new quartet-based measures to previous
   bipartition-based measures on simulated data shows that: (1) on complete
   data sets, both quartet-based and bipartition-based measures yield very
   similar IC scores; (2) IC scores of quartet-based measures on a given
   data set with and without missing taxa are more similar than the scores
   of bipartition-based measures; and (3) quartet-based measures are more
   robust to the absence of phylogenetic signal and errors in phylogenetic
   inference than bipartition-based measures. Additionally, the analysis of
   an empirical mammalian phylogenomic data set using our quartet-based
   measures reveals the presence of substantial levels of incongruence for
   numerous internal branches. An efficient open-source implementation of
   these quartet-based measures is freely available in the program
   OuartetScores (https://github.com/lutteropp/QuartetScores).},

Title = {Stochastic Character Mapping of State-Dependent Diversification Reveals
   the Tempo of Evolutionary Decline in Self-Compatible Onagraceae Lineages},

Abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to identify key evolutionary
   transitions that correspond with shifts in speciation and extinction
   rates. Stochastic character mapping has become the primary method used
   to infer the timing, nature, and number of character state transitions
   along the branches of a phylogeny. The method is widely employed for
   standard substitution models of character evolution. However, current
   approaches cannot be used for models that specifically test the
   association of character state transitions with shifts in
   diversification rates such as state-dependent speciation and extinction
   (SSE) models. Herein, we introduce a new stochastic character mapping
   algorithm that overcomes these limitations, and apply it to study mating
   system evolution over a time-calibrated phylogeny of the plant family
   Onagraceae. Utilizing a hidden state SSE model we tested the association
   of the loss of self-incompatibility (SI) with shifts in diversification
   rates. We found that self-compatible lineages have higher extinction
   rates and lower net-diversification rates compared with
   self-incompatible lineages. Furthermore, these results provide empirical
   evidence for the ``senescing{''} diversification rates predicted in
   highly selfing lineages: our mapped character histories show that the
   loss of SI is followed by a short-termspike in speciation rates, which
   declines after a time lag of severalmillion years resulting in negative
   net-diversification. Lineages that have long been self-compatible, such
   as Fuchsia and Clarkia, are in a previously unrecognized and ongoing
   evolutionary decline. Our results demonstrate that stochastic character
   mapping of SSE models is a powerful tool for examining the timing and
   nature of both character state transitions and shifts in diversification
   rates over the phylogeny.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {905-915},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We give a non-technical introduction to convergence-divergence models, a
   new modeling approach for phylogenetic data that allows for the usual
   divergence of lineages after lineage-splitting but also allows for taxa
   to converge, i.e. become more similar over time. By examining the
   3-taxon case in some detail, we illustrate that phylogeneticists have
   been ``spoiled{''} in the sense of not having to think about the
   structural parameters in their models by virtue of the strong assumption
   that evolution is tree-like. We show that there are not always good
   statistical reasons to prefer the usual class of tree-like models over
   more general convergence-divergence models. Specifically, we show many
   3-taxon data sets can be equally well explained by supposing violation
   of the molecular clock due to change in the rate of evolution along
   different edges, or by keeping the assumption of a constant rate of
   evolution but instead assuming that evolution is not a purely divergent
   process. Given the abundance of evidence that evolution is not strictly
   tree-like, our discussion is an illustration that as phylogeneticists we
   need to think clearly about the structural form of the models we use.
   For cases with four taxa, we show that there will be far greater ability
   to distinguish models with convergence from non-clock-like tree models.},

Title = {Resolving Recent Plant Radiations: Power and Robustness of
   Genotyping-by-Sequencing},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {250-268},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Disentangling species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships within
   recent evolutionary radiations is a challenge due to the poor
   morphological differentiation and low genetic divergence between
   species, frequently accompanied by phenotypic convergence, interspecific
   gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting. Here we employed a
   genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, in combination with
   morphometric analyses, to investigate a small western Mediterranean
   clade in the flowering plant genus Linaria that radiated in the
   Quaternary. After confirming the morphological and genetic distinctness
   of eight species, we evaluated the relative performances of
   concatenation and coalescent methods to resolve phylogenetic
   relationships. Specifically, we focused on assessing the robustness of
   both approaches to variations in the parameter used to estimate sequence
   homology (clustering threshold). Concatenation analyses suffered from
   strong systematic bias, as revealed by the high statistical support for
   multiple alternative topologies depending on clustering threshold
   values. By contrast, topologies produced by two coalescent-based methods
   (NJ(st), SVDquartets) were robust to variations in the clustering
   threshold. Reticulate evolution may partly explain incongruences between
   NJ(st), SVDquartets and concatenated trees. Integration of morphometric
   and coalescent-based phylogenetic results revealed (i) extensive
   morphological divergence associated with recent splits between
   geographically close or sympatric sister species and (ii) morphological
   convergence in geographically disjunct species. These patterns are
   particularly true for floral traits related to pollinator
   specialization, including nectar spur length, tube width and corolla
   color, suggesting pollinator-driven diversification. Given its
   relatively simple and inexpensive implementation, GBS is a promising
   technique for the phylogenetic and systematic study of recent
   radiations, but care must be taken to evaluate the robustness of results
   to variation of data assembly parameters.},

Abstract = {Soil has become a major hotspot of biodiversity studies, yet the pattern
   and timing of the evolution of soil organisms are poorly known because
   of the scarcity of paleontological data. To overcome this limitation, we
   conducted a genome-based macroevolutionary study of an ancient,
   diversified, and widespread lineage of soil fauna, the elongate-bodied
   springtails (class Collembola, order Entomobryomorpha). To build the
   first robust backbone phylogeny of this previously refractory group, we
   sampled representatives of major higher taxa (6 out of 8 families, 11
   out of 16 subfamilies) of the order with an emphasis on the most
   problematic superfamily Tomoceroidea, applied whole-genome sequencing
   methods, and compared the performance of different combinations of data
   sets (universal single-copy orthologs {[}USCO] vs. ultraconserved
   elements]) and modeling schemes. The fossil-calibrated timetree was used
   to reconstruct the evolution of body size, sensory organs, and
   pigmentation to establish a time frame of the ecomorphological
   divergences. The resultant trees based on different analyses were
   congruent in most nodes. Several discordant nodes were carefully
   evaluated by considering method fitness, morphological information, and
   topology test. The evaluation favored the well-resolved topology from
   analyses using USCO amino acid matrices and complex site-heterogeneous
   models (CAT+GTR and LG-PPMSF (C60)). The preferred topology supports the
   monophyletic superfamily Tomoceroidea as an early-diverging lineage and
   a sister relationship between Entomobryoidea and Isotomoidea. The family
   Tomoceridae was recovered as monophyletic, whereas Oncopoduridae was
   recovered as paraphyletic, with Harlomillsia as a sister to Tomoceridae
   and hence deserving a separate family status as Harlomillsiidae Yu and
   Zhang fam. n. Ancestral Entomobryomorpha were reconstructed as
   surface-living, supporting independent origins of soil-living groups
   across the Paleozoic-Mesozoic, and highlighting the ancient evolutionary
   interaction between aboveground and belowground fauna.},

Abstract = {Morphology remains a primary source of phylogenetic information for many
   groups of organisms, and the only one for most fossil taxa. Organismal
   anatomy is not a collection of randomly assembled and independent
   ``parts{''}, but instead a set of dependent and hierarchically nested
   entities resulting from ontogeny and phylogeny. How do we make sense of
   these dependent and at times redundant characters? One promising
   approach is using ontologies-structured controlled vocabularies that
   summarize knowledge about different properties of anatomical entities,
   including developmental and structural dependencies. Here, we assess
   whether evolutionary patterns can explain the proximity of
   ontology-annotated characters within an ontology. To do so, we measure
   phylogenetic information across characters and evaluate if it matches
   the hierarchical structure given by ontological knowledge-in much the
   same way as across-species diversity structure is given by phylogeny. We
   implement an approach to evaluate the Bayesian phylogenetic information
   (BPI) content and phylogenetic dissonance among ontology-annotated
   anatomical data subsets. We applied this to data sets representing two
   disparate animal groups: bees (Hexapoda: Hymenoptera: Apoidea, 209
   chars) and characiform fishes (Actinopterygii: Ostariophysi:
   Characiformes, 463 chars). For bees, we find that BPI is not
   substantially explained by anatomy since dissonance is often high among
   morphologically related anatomical entities. For fishes, we find
   substantial information for two clusters of anatomical entities
   instantiating concepts from the jaws and branchial arch bones, but
   among-subset information decreases and dissonance increases
   substantially moving to higher-level subsets in the ontology. We further
   applied our approach to address particular evolutionary hypotheses with
   an example of morphological evolution in miniature fishes. While we show
   that phylogenetic information does match ontology structure for some
   anatomical entities, additional relationships and processes, such as
   convergence, likely play a substantial role in explaining BPI and
   dissonance, and merit future investigation. Our work demonstrates how
   complex morphological data sets can be interrogated with ontologies by
   allowing one to access how information is spread hierarchically across
   anatomical concepts, how congruent this information is, and what sorts
   of processes may play a role in explaining it: phylogeny, development,
   or convergence. {[}Apidae; Bayesian phylogenetic information;

Title = {Bayesian Inference of Clonal Expansions in a Dated Phylogeny},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Microbial population genetics models often assume that all lineages are
   constrained by the same population size dynamics over time. However,
   many neutral and selective events can invalidate this assumption and can
   contribute to the clonal expansion of a specific lineage relative to the
   rest of the population. Such differential phylodynamic properties
   between lineages result in asymmetries and imbalances in phylogenetic
   trees that are sometimes described informally but which are difficult to
   analyze formally. To this end, we developed a model of how clonal
   expansions occur and affect the branching patterns of a phylogeny. We
   show how the parameters of this model can be inferred from a given dated
   phylogeny using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to assess the
   probability that one or more clonal expansion events occurred. For each
   putative clonal expansion event, we estimate its date of emergence and
   subsequent phylodynamic trajectory, including its long-term evolutionary
   potential which is important to determine how much effort should be
   placed on specific control measures. We demonstrate the applicability of
   our methodology on simulated and real data sets. Inference under our

Abstract = {Species tree inference from gene family trees is a significant problem
   in computational biology. However, gene tree heterogeneity, which can be
   caused by several factors including gene duplication and loss, makes the
   estimation of species trees very challenging. While there have been
   several species tree estimation methods introduced in recent years to
   specifically address gene tree heterogeneity due to gene duplication and
   loss (such as DupTree, FastMulRFS, ASTRAL-Pro, and SpeciesRax), many
   incur high cost in terms of both running time and memory. We introduce a
   new approach, DISCO, that decomposes the multi-copy gene family trees
   into many single copy trees, which allows for methods previously
   designed for species tree inference in a single copy gene tree context
   to be used. We prove that using DISCO with ASTRAL (i.e., ASTRAL-DISCO)
   is statistically consistent under the GDL model, provided that
   ASTRAL-Pro correctly roots and tags each gene family tree. We evaluate
   DISCO paired with different methods for estimating species trees from
   single copy genes (e.g., ASTRAL, ASTRID, and IQ-TREE) under a wide range
   of model conditions, and establish that high accuracy can be obtained
   even when ASTRAL-Pro is not able to correctly roots and tags the gene
   family trees. We also compare results using MI, an alternative
   decomposition strategy from Yang Y. and Smith S.A. (2014), and find that
   DISCO provides better accuracy, most likely as a result of covering more
   of the gene family tree leafset in the output decomposition.

Title = {A Likelihood-Ratio Test for Lumpability of Phylogenetic Data: Is the
   Markovian Property of an Evolutionary Process Retained in Recoded DNA?},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {660-675},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {In molecular phylogenetics, it is typically assumed that the
   evolutionary process for DNA can be approximated by independent and
   identically distributed Markovian processes at the variable sites and
   that these processes diverge over the edges of a rooted bifurcating
   tree. Sometimes the nucleotides are transformed from a 4-state alphabet
   to a 3- or 2-state alphabet by a procedure that is called recoding,
   lumping, or grouping of states. Here, we introduce a likelihood-ratio
   test for lumpability for DNA that has diverged under different Markovian
   conditions, which assesses the assumption that the Markovian property of
   the evolutionary process over each edge is retained after recoding of
   the nucleotides. The test is derived and validated numerically on
   simulated data. To demonstrate the insights that can be gained by using
   the test, we assessed two published data sets, one of mitochondrial DNA
   from a phylogenetic study of the ratites and the other of nuclear DNA
   from a phylogenetic study of yeast. Our analysis of these data sets
   revealed that recoding of the DNA eliminated some of the compositional
   heterogeneity detected over the sequences. However, the Markovian
   property of the original evolutionary process was not retained by the
   recoding, leading to some significant distortions of edge lengths in
   reconstructed trees.{[}Evolutionary processes; likelihood-ratio test;

   speciation events. We quantify known inaccuracy issues with divergence
   time estimates using the popular strategy of concatenating molecular

Title = {Is Sexual Conflict a Driver of Speciation? A Case Study With a Tribe of
   Brush-footed Butterflies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms governing the uneven
   distribution of species richness across the tree of life is a great
   challenge in biology. Scientists have long argued that sexual conflict
   is a key driver of speciation. This hypothesis, however, has been highly
   debated in light of empirical evidence. Recent advances in the study of
   macroevolution make it possible to test this hypothesis with more data
   and increased accuracy. In the present study, we use phylogenomics
   combined with four different diversification rate analytical approaches
   to test whether sexual conflict is a driver of speciation in
   brush-footed butterflies of the tribe Acraeini. The presence of a
   sphragis, an external mating plug found in most species among Acraeini,
   was used as a proxy for sexual conflict. Diversification analyses
   statistically rejected the hypothesis that sexual conflict is associated
   with shifts in diversification rates in Acraeini. This result contrasts
   with earlier studies and suggests that the underlying mechanisms driving
   diversification are more complex than previously considered. In the case
   of butterflies, natural history traits acting in concert with abiotic
   factors possibly play a stronger role in triggering speciation than does
   sexual conflict.},

Abstract = {Symbiosis is a key driver of evolutionary novelty and ecological
   diversity, but our understanding of how macroevolutionary processes
   originate extant symbiotic associations is still very incomplete.
   Cophylogenetic tools are used to assess the congruence between the
   phylogenies of two groups of organisms related by extant associations.
   If phylogenetic congruence is higher than expected by chance, we
   conclude that there is cophylogenetic signal in the system under study.
   However, how to quantify cophylogenetic signal is still an open issue.
   We present a novel approach, Random Tanglegram Partitions (Random TaPas)
   that applies a given global-fit method to random partial tanglegrams of
   a fixed size to identify the associations, terminals, and nodes that
   maximize phylogenetic congruence. By means of simulations, we show that
   the output value produced is inversely proportional to the number and
   proportion of cospeciation events employed to build simulated
   tanglegrams. In addition, with time-calibrated trees, Random TaPas can
   also distinguish cospeciation from pseudocospeciation. Random TaPas can
   handle large tanglegrams in affordable computational time and
   incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty in the analyses. We demonstrate
   its application with two real examples: passerine birds and their
   feather mites, and orchids and bee pollinators. In both systems, Random
   TaPas revealed low cophylogenetic signal, but mapping its variation onto
   the tanglegram pointed to two different coevolutionary processes. We
   suggest that the recursive partitioning of the tanglegram buffers the
   effect of phylogenetic nonindependence occurring in current global-fit
   methods and therefore Random TaPas is more reliable than regular
   global-fit methods to identify host-symbiont associations that
   contribute most to cophylogenetic signal. Random TaPas can be
   implemented in the public-domain statistical software R with scripts
   provided herein. A User's Guide is also available at GitHub.},

   selection, host population structure, or other demographic and
   epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric
   statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in
   time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting
   estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic
   ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent
   framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development
   of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree
   for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or
   epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include
   identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid
   expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the
   utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new
   methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1
   partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had
   grown rapidly in the recent past and was significantly concentrated in
   young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group.
   Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study
   of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large
   phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae
   sequences. We find that population structure detected using these
   methods closely overlaps with the appearance and expansion of mutations
   conferring antimicrobial resistance.},

Title = {Longer is Not Always Better: Optimizing Barcode Length for Large-Scale
   Species Discovery and Identification},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {New techniques for the species-level sorting of millions of specimens
   are needed in order to accelerate species discovery, determine how many
   species live on earth, and develop efficient biomonitoring techniques.
   These sorting methods should be reliable, scalable, and cost-effective,
   as well as being largely insensitive to low-quality genomic DNA, given
   that this is usually all that can be obtained from museum specimens.
   Mini-barcodes seem to satisfy these criteria, but it is unclear how well
   they perform for species-level sorting when compared with full-length
   barcodes. This is here tested based on 20 empirical data sets covering
   ca. 30,000 specimens (5500 species) and six Glade-specific data sets
   from GenBank covering ca. 98,000 specimens (>20,000 species). All
   specimens in these data sets had full-length barcodes and had been
   sorted to species-level based on morphology. Mini-barcodes of different
   lengths and positions were obtained in silico from full-length barcodes
   using a sliding window approach (three windows: 100 bp, 200 bp, and 300
   bp) and by excising nine mini-barcodes with established primers (length:
   94-407 bp). We then tested whether barcode length and/or position
   reduces species-level congruence between morphospecies and molecular
   operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) that were obtained using three
   different species delimitation techniques (Poisson Tree Process,
   Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, and Objective Clustering).
   Surprisingly, we find no significant differences in performance for both
   species- or specimen-level identification between full-length and
   mini-barcodes as long as they are of moderate length (>200 bp). Only
   very short mini-barcodes (<200 bp) perform poorly, especially when they
   are located near the 5' end of the Folmer region. The mean congruence
   between morphospecies and mOTUs was ca. 75\% for barcodes >200 bp and
   the congruent mOTUs contain ca. 75\% of all specimens. Most conflict is
   caused by ca. 10\% of the specimens that can be identified and should be
   targeted for reexamination in order to efficiently resolve conflict. Our
   study suggests that large-scale species discovery, identification, and
   metabarcoding can utilize mini-barcodes without any demonstrable loss of
   information compared to full-length barcodes.},

Abstract = {We use a computational modeling approach to explore whether it is
   possible to infer a solid tumor's cellular proliferative hierarchy under
   the assumptions of the cancer stem cell hypothesis and neutral
   evolution. We work towards inferring the symmetric division probability
   for cancer stem cells, since this is believed to be a key driver of
   progression and therapeutic response. Motivated by the advent of
   multiregion sampling and resulting opportunities to infer tumor
   evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the
   phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumor's evolution in different
   regions of parameter space and through time. We find strikingly
   different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division
   probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints. These
   results give us a starting point to begin stratifying tumors by this
   biological parameter and also generate a number of actionable clinical
   and biological hypotheses regarding changes during therapy, and through
   tumor evolutionary time.},

Title = {Estimating Diversification Rates on Incompletely Sampled Phylogenies:
   Theoretical Concerns and Practical Solutions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {602-611},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Molecular phylogenies are a key source of information about the tempo
   and mode of species diversification. However, most empirical phylogenies
   do not contain representatives of all species, such that diversification
   rates are typically estimated from incompletely sampled data. Most
   researchers recognize that incomplete sampling can lead to biased rate
   estimates, but the statistical properties of methods for accommodating
   incomplete sampling remain poorly known. In this point of view, we
   demonstrate theoretical concerns with the widespread use of analytical
   sampling corrections for sparsely sampled phylogenies of higher
   taxonomic groups. In particular, corrections based on ``sampling
   fractions{''} can lead to low statistical power to infer rate variation
   when it is present, depending on the likelihood function used for
   inference. In the extreme, the sampling fraction correction can lead to
   spurious patterns of diversification that are driven solely by
   unbalanced sampling across the tree in concert with low overall power to
   infer shifts. Stochastic polytomy resolution provides an alternative to
   sampling fraction approaches that avoids some of these biases. We show
   that stochastic polytomy resolvers can greatly improve the power of
   common analyses to estimate shifts in diversification rates. We
   introduce a new stochastic polytomy resolution method (Taxonomic
   Addition for Complete Trees {[}TACT]) that uses birth-death-sampling
   estimators across an ultrametric phylogeny to estimate branching times
   for unsampled taxa, with taxonomic information to compatibly place new
   taxa onto a backbone phylogeny. We close with practical recommendations
   for diversification inference under several common scenarios of
   incomplete sampling.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Species are the starting point for most studies of ecology and
   evolution, but the proper circumscription of species can be extremely
   difficult in morphologically variable lineages, and there are still few
   convincing examples of molecularly informed species delimitation in
   plants. Here, we focus on the Viburnum nudum complex, a highly variable
   clade that is widely distributed in eastern North America. Taxonomic
   treatments have mostly divided this complex into northern (V. nudum var.
   cassinoides) and southern (V. nudum var. nudum) entities, but additional
   names have been proposed. We used multiple lines of evidence, including
   RADseq, morphological, and geographic data, to test how many
   independently evolving lineages exist within the V. nudum complex.
   Genetic clustering and phylogenetic methods revealed three distinct
   groupsone lineage that is highly divergent, and two others that are
   recently diverged and morphologically similar. A combination of evidence
   that includes reciprocal monophyly, lack of introgression, and discrete
   rather than continuous patterns of variation supports the recognition of
   all three lineages as separate species. These results identify a
   surprising case of cryptic diversity in which two broadly sympatric
   species have consistently been lumped in taxonomic treatments. The
   clarity of our findings is directly related to the dense sampling and
   high-quality genetic data in this study. We argue that there is a
   critical need for carefully sampled and integrative species delimitation
   studies to clarify species boundaries even in well-known plant lineages.
   Studies following the model that we have developed here are likely to
   identify many more cryptic lineages and will fundamentally improve our
   understanding of plant speciation and patterns of species richness.},

Abstract = {Nonparametric population genetic modeling provides a simple and flexible
   approach for studying demographic history and epidemic dynamics using
   pathogen sequence data. Existing Bayesian approaches are premised on
   stochastic processes with stationary increments whichmay provide an
   unrealistic prior for epidemic histories which feature extended period
   of exponential growth or decline. We show that nonparametric models
   defined in terms of the growth rate of the effective population size can
   provide amore realistic prior for epidemic history. We propose a
   nonparametric autoregressive model on the growth rate as a prior for
   effective population size, which corresponds to the dynamics expected
   under many epidemic situations. We demonstrate the use of this model
   within a Bayesian phylodynamic inference framework. Our method correctly
   reconstructs trends of epidemic growth and decline from pathogen
   genealogies even when genealogical data are sparse and conventional
   skyline estimators erroneously predict stable population size. We also
   propose a regression approach for relating growth rates of pathogen
   effective population size and time-varying variables that may impact the
   replicative fitness of a pathogen. The model is applied to real data
   fromrabies virus and Staphylococcus aureus epidemics. We find a close
   correspondence between the estimated growth rates of a lineage
   ofmethicillin-resistant S. aureus and populationlevel prescription rates
   of beta-lactam antibiotics. The new models are implemented in an open
   source R package called skygrowth which is available at
   https://github.com/mrc-ide/skygrowth.},

Title = {Multivariate Phylogenetic Comparative Methods: Evaluations, Comparisons,
   and Recommendations},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen increased interest in phylogenetic comparative
   analyses of multivariate data sets, but to date the varied proposed
   approaches have not been extensively examined. Here we review the
   mathematical properties required of any multivariate method, and
   specifically evaluate existing multivariate phylogenetic comparative
   methods in this context. Phylogenetic comparative methods based on the
   full multivariate likelihood are robust to levels of covariation among
   trait dimensions and are insensitive to the orientation of the data set,
   but display increasing model misspecification as the number of trait
   dimensions increases. This is because the expected evolutionary
   covariance matrix (V) used in the likelihood calculations becomes more
   ill-conditioned as trait dimensionality increases, and as evolutionary
   models become more complex. Thus, these approaches are only appropriate
   for data sets with few traits and many species. Methods that summarize
   patterns across trait dimensions treated separately (e.g., SURFACE)
   incorrectly assume independenceamongtrait dimensions, resulting in
   nearly a 100\% model misspecification rate. Methods using pairwise
   composite likelihood are highly sensitive to levels of trait
   covariation, the orientation of the data set, and the number of trait
   dimensions. The consequences of these debilitating deficiencies are that
   a user can arrive at differing statistical conclusions, and therefore
   biological inferences, simply from a dataspace rotation, like principal
   component analysis. By contrast, algebraic generalizations of the
   standard phylogenetic comparative toolkit that use the trace of
   covariance matrices are insensitive to levels of trait covariation, the
   number of trait dimensions, and the orientation of the data set.
   Further, when appropriate permutation tests are used, these approaches
   display acceptable Type I error and statistical power. We conclude that
   methods summarizing information across trait dimensions, aswell as
   pairwise composite likelihood methods should be avoided, whereas
   algebraic generalizations of the phylogenetic comparative toolkit
   provide a useful means of assessing macroevolutionary patterns in
   multivariate data. Finally, we discuss areas in which multivariate
   phylogenetic comparative methods are still in need of future
   development; namely highlymultivariateOrnstein-Uhlenbeckmodels and
   approaches for multivariate evolutionary model comparisons.},

Title = {Resolving Rapid Radiations within Angiosperm Families Using Anchored
   Phylogenomics},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the promise that molecular datawould provide a seemingly
   unlimited source of independent characters, many plant phylogenetic
   studies are still based on only two regions, the plastid genome and
   nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). Their popularity can be explained by
   high-copy numbers and universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers
   that make their sequences easily amplified and converted into parallel
   datasets. Unfortunately, their utility is limited by linked loci and
   limited characters resulting in low confidence in the accuracy of
   phylogenetic estimates, especially when rapid radiations occur. In
   another contribution on anchored phylogenomics in angiosperms, we
   presented flowering plantspecific anchored enrichment probes for
   hundreds of conserved nuclear genes and demonstrated their use at the
   level of all angiosperms. In this contribution, we focus on a common
   problem in phylogenetic reconstructions below the family level: Weak or
   unresolved backbone due to rapid radiations (<= 10 million years)
   followed by long divergence, using the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae
   (CDS, Cyperaceae) clade as a test case. By comparing our nuclear matrix
   of 461 genes to a typical Sanger-sequence dataset consisting of a
   fewplastid genes (matK, ndhF) and an nrDNAmarker (ETS), we demonstrate
   that our nuclear data is fully compatible with the Sanger dataset and
   resolves short backbone internodes with high support in both
   concatenated and coalescence-based analyses. In addition, we show that
   nuclear gene tree incongruence is inversely proportional to phylogenetic
   information content, indicating that incongruence is mostly due to gene
   tree estimation error. This suggests that large numbers of conserved
   nuclear loci could produce more accurate trees than sampling rapidly
   evolving regions prone to saturation and long-branch attraction. The
   robust phylogenetic estimates obtained here, and high congruence with
   previous morphological and molecular analyses, are strong evidence for a
   complete tribal revision of CDS clade. The anchored hybrid enrichment
   probes used in this study should be similarly effective in other
   flowering plant groups.},

Title = {The Importance of Contact Zones for Distinguishing Interspecific from
   Intraspecific Geographic Variation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-371},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {With limited sampling, geographic variation within a single species can
   be difficult to distinguish from interspecific variation, confounding
   our ability to draw accurate species boundaries. We argue that thorough
   sampling and analysis of contact zones between putative taxa can
   determine if assortative mating or selection against hybrids exists
   (supporting the presence of two distinct species), or alternatively if
   mating is random among genotypes and admixture among adjacent
   populations is gradual and continuous (supporting geographic variation
   within a single species). Here, we test two alternative hypotheses for
   two pairs of named taxa at contact zones within the American milksnake
   (Lampropeltis triangulum) complex. A prior morphological analysis found
   areas of gradual intergradation among named taxa, and concluded that the
   taxa represented geographical races of a single polytypic species. In
   contrast, a subsequent analysis of gene sequence data, but with limited
   sampling near the contact zones, hypothesized distinct boundaries
   between species at the contact zones. At the contact zone between
   proposed species L. triangulum and Lampropeltis gentilis, we examined a
   similar to 700 km-wide transect across the states of Kansas and
   Missouri, with thorough sampling and reduced-representation
   genomic-level sequencing, to test the two opposing taxonomic hypotheses.
   Our transect analyses included examinations of population structure,
   fixed differences, dine-fitting, and an admixture index analysis. These
   analyses all supported a gradual and continuous geographic dine across a
   broad intergrade zone between two geographic forms of L. Iriangulum,
   thus providing strong support for a single species in this region (and
   no support for the recognition of L. gentilis as a distinct species). At
   a second contact zone between proposed species L. triangulum and
   Lampropeltis elapsoides (but variously treated as species or subspecies
   by different researchers) in Kentucky and Tennessee, we re-evaluated
   morphological data. In this case, the contact zone analysis indicated
   sympatry and reproductive isolation of the two taxa, and thus strongly
   supported L. triangulum and L. elapsoides as distinct species. We
   conclude that detailed studies of contact zones, based on either genetic
   or morphological data, are essential for distinguishing intraspecific
   from interspecific variation in the case of widely and continuously
   distributed taxa.},

Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Gastropods have survived several mass extinctions during their
   evolutionary history resulting in extraordinary diversity in morphology,
   ecology, and developmental modes, which complicate the reconstruction of
   a robust phylogeny. Currently, gastropods are divided into six
   subclasses: Caenogastropoda, Heterobranchia, Neomphaliones,
   Neritimorpha, Patellogastropoda, and Vetigastropoda. Phylogenetic
   relationships among these taxa historically lack consensus, despite
   numerous efforts using morphological and molecular information. We
   generated sequence data for transcriptomes derived from 12 taxa
   belonging to clades with little or no prior representation in previous
   studies in order to infer the deeper cladogenetic events within
   Gastropoda and, for the first time, infer the position of the deep-sea
   Neomphaliones using a phylogenomic approach. We explored the impact of
   missing data, homoplasy, and compositional heterogeneity on the inferred
   phylogenetic hypotheses. We recovered a highly supported backbone for
   gastropod relationships that is congruent with morphological and
   mitogenomic evidence, in which Patellogastropoda, true limpets, are the
   sister lineage to all other gastropods (Orthogastropoda) which are
   divided into two main clades 1) Vetigastropoda s.l. (including
   Pleurotomariida + Neomphaliones) and 2) Neritimorpha + (Caenogastropoda
   + Heterobranchia). As such, our results support the recognition of five
   subclasses (or infraclasses) in Gastropoda: Patellogastropoda,
   Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda, and Heterobranchia.

Title = {Rapid Parallel Morphological and Mechanical Diversification of South

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-133},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Explosive bouts of diversification are one of the most conspicuous
   features of the tree of life. When such bursts are repeated in similar
   environments, it suggests some degree of predictability in the
   evolutionary process. We assess parallel adaptive radiation of South
   American pike cichlids (Crenicichla) using phylogenomics and
   phylogenetic comparative methods. We find that species flocks in the
   Uruguay and Iguazu River basins rapidly diversified into the same set of
   ecomorphs that reflect feeding ecology. Both adaptive radiations involve
   expansion of functional morphology, resulting in unique jaw phenotypes.
   Yet, form and function were decoupled such that most ecomorphs share
   similar mechanical properties of the jaws (i.e., jaw motion during a
   feeding strike). Prey mobility explained 6- to 9-fold differences in the
   rate of morphological evolution but had no effect on the rate of
   mechanical evolution. We find no evidence of gene flow between species
   flocks or with surrounding coastal lineages that may explain their rapid
   diversification. When compared with cichlids of the East African Great
   Lakes and other prominent adaptive radiations, pike cichlids share many
   themes, including the rapid expansion of phenotypic diversity,
   specialization along the benthic-to-pelagic habitat and soft-to-hard
   prey axes, and the evolution of conspicuous functional innovations. Yet,
   decoupled evolution of form and function and the absence of
   hybridization as a catalyzing force are departures from patterns
   observed in other adaptive radiations. Many-to-one mapping of morphology
   to mechanical properties is a mechanism by which pike cichlids attain a
   diversity of feeding ecologies while avoiding exacerbating underlying
   mechanical trade-offs. {[}Adaptive radiation; ecological opportunity;

Title = {nQMaker: Estimating Time Nonreversible Amino Acid Substitution Models},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Amino acid substitution models are a key component in phylogenetic
   analyses of protein sequences. All commonly used amino acid models
   available to date are time-reversible, an assumption designed for
   computational convenience but not for biological reality. Another
   significant downside to time-reversible models is that they do not allow
   inference of rooted trees without outgroups. In this article, we
   introduce a maximum likelihood approach nQMaker, an extension of the
   recently published QMaker method, that allows the estimation of time
   nonreversible amino acid substitution models and rooted phylogenetic
   trees from a set of protein sequence alignments. We show that the
   nonreversible models estimated with nQMaker are a much better fit to
   empirical alignments than pre-existing reversible models, across a wide
   range of data sets including mammals, birds, plants, fungi, and other
   taxa, and that the improvements in model fit scale with the size of the
   data set. Notably, for the recently published plant and bird trees,
   these nonreversible models correctly recovered the commonly estimated
   root placements with very high-statistical support without the need to
   use an outgroup. We provide nQMaker as an easy-to-use feature in the
   IQ-TREE software (http://www.iqtree.org), allowing users to estimate
   nonreversible models and rooted phylogenies from their own protein data
   sets.},

Title = {The Frequency and Topology of Pseudoorthologs},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {649-659},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Phylogenetics has long relied on the use of orthologs, or genes related
   through speciation events, to infer species relationships. However,
   identifying orthologs is difficult because gene duplication can obscure
   relationships among genes. Researchers have been particularly concerned
   with the insidious effects of pseudoorthologs-duplicated genes that are
   mistaken for orthologs because they are present in a single copy in each
   sampled species. Because gene tree topologies of pseudoorthologs may
   differ from the species tree topology, they have often been invoked as
   the cause of counterintuitive results in phylogenetics. Despite these
   perceived problems, no previous work has calculated the probabilities of
   pseudoortholog topologies or has been able to circumscribe the regions
   of parameter space in which pseudoorthologs are most likely to occur.
   Here, we introduce a model for calculating the probabilities and branch
   lengths of orthologs and pseudoorthologs, including concordant and
   discordant pseudoortholog topologies, on a rooted three-taxon species
   tree. We show that the probability of orthologs is high relative to the
   probability of pseudoorthologs across reasonable regions of parameter
   space. Furthermore, the probabilities of the two discordant topologies
   are equal and never exceed that of the concordant topology, generally
   being much lower. We describe the species tree topologies most prone to
   generating pseudoorthologs, finding that they are likely to present
   problems to phylogenetic inference irrespective of the presence of
   pseudoorthologs. Overall, our results suggest that pseudoorthologs are
   unlikely to mislead inferences of species relationships under the
   biological scenarios considered here.{[}Birth-death model; orthologs;

Title = {Phylogenomics of Bony-Tongue Fishes (Osteoglossomorpha) Shed Light on
   the Craniofacial Evolution and Biogeography of the Weakly Electric Clade
   (Mormyridae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {1032-1044},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Bonytongues (Osteoglossomorpha) constitute an ancient clade of teleost
   fishes distributed in freshwater habitats throughout the world. The
   group includes well-known species such as arowanas, featherbacks,
   pirarucus, and the weakly electric fishes in the family Mormyridae.
   Their disjunct distribution, extreme morphologies, and electrolocating
   capabilities (Gymnarchidae and Mormyridae) have attracted much
   scientific interest, but a comprehensive phylogenetic framework for
   comparative analysis is missing, especially for the species-rich family
   Mormyridae. Of particular interest are disparate craniofacial
   morphologies among mormyrids which might constitute an exceptional model
   system to study convergent evolution. We present a phylogenomic analysis
   based on 546 exons of 179 species (out of 260), 28 out of 29 genera, and
   all six families of extant bonytongues. Based on a recent reassessment
   of the fossil record of osteoglossomorphs, we inferred dates of
   divergence among transcontinental clades and the major groups. The
   estimated ages of divergence among extant taxa (e.g., Osteoglossomorpha,
   Osteoglossiformes, and Mormyroidea) are older than previous reports, but
   most of the divergence dates obtained for clades on separate continents
   are too young to be explained by simple vicariance hypotheses.
   Biogeographic analysis of mormyrids indicates that their high species
   diversity in the Congo Basin is a consequence of range reductions of
   previously widespread ancestors and that the highest diversity of
   craniofacial morphologies among mormyrids originated in this basin.
   Special emphasis on a taxon-rich representation for mormyrids revealed
   pervasive misalignment between our phylogenomic results and mormyrid
   taxonomy due to repeated instances of convergence for extreme
   craniofacial morphologies. Estimation of ancestral phenotypes revealed
   contingent evolution of snout elongation and unique projections from the
   lower jaw to form the distinctive Schnauzenorgan. Synthesis of
   comparative analyses suggests that the remarkable craniofacial
   morphologies of mormyrids evolved convergently due to niche
   partitioning, likely enabled by interactions between their exclusive
   morphological and electrosensory adaptations. {[}Africa; ancestral state

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Gonyleptoidea, largely restricted to the Neotropics, constitutes the
   most diverse superfamily of Opiliones and includes the largest and
   flashiest representatives of this arachnid order. However, the
   relationships among its main lineages (families and subfamilies) and the
   timing of their origin are not sufficiently understood to explain how
   this tropical Glade has been able to colonize the temperate zone. Here,
   we used transcriptomics and divergence time dating to investigate the
   phylogeny of Gonyleptoidea. Our results support the monophyly of
   Gonyleptoidea and all of its families with more than one species
   represented. Resolution within Gonyleptidae s.s. is achieved for many
   clades, but some subfamilies are not monophyletic (Gonyleptinae,
   Mitobatinae, and Pachylinae), requiring taxonomic revision. Our data
   show evidence for one colonization of today's temperate zone early in
   the history of Gonyleptidae, during the Paleogene, at a time when the
   Neotropical area extended poleward into regions now considered
   temperate. This provides a possible mechanism for the colonization of
   the extratropics by a tropical group following the Paleocene-Eocene
   Thermal Maximum, explaining how latitudinal diversity gradients can be
   established. Taxonomic acts: Ampycidae Kury 2003 is newly ranked as
   family; Neosadocus Mello-Leitao is transferred to Progonyleptoidellinae
   (new subfamilial assignment).},

Abstract = {The phylogenetic bootstrap is the most commonly used method for
   assessing statistical confidence in estimated phylogenies by
   non-Bayesian methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood
   (ML). It is observed that bootstrap support tends to be high in large
   genomic data sets whether or not the inferred trees and clades are
   correct. Here, we study the asymptotic behavior of bootstrap support for
   the ML tree in large data sets when the competing phylogenetic trees are
   equally right or equally wrong. We consider phylogenetic reconstruction
   as a problem of statistical model selection when the compared models are
   nonnested and misspecified. The bootstrap is found to have qualitatively
   different dynamics from Bayesian inference and does not exhibit the
   polarized behavior of posterior model probabilities, consistent with the
   empirical observation that the bootstrap is more conservative than
   Bayesian probabilities. Nevertheless, bootstrap support similarly shows
   fluctuations among large data sets, with no convergence to a point
   value, when the compared models are equally right or equally wrong.
   Thus, in large data sets strong support for wrong trees or models is
   likely to occur. Our analysis provides a partial explanation for the
   high bootstrap support values for incorrect clades observed in empirical
   data analysis.},

Abstract = {The evolution of key innovations-unique features that enable a lineage
   to interact with the environment in a novel way-may drive broad patterns
   of adaptive diversity. However, traditional tests of the key innovation
   hypothesis, those which attempt to identify the evolutionary effect of a
   purported key innovation by comparing patterns of diversity between
   lineages with and without the key trait, have been challenged on both
   conceptual and statistical grounds. Here, we explore alternative,
   untested hypotheses of the key innovation framework. In lizards,
   adhesive toepad structures increase grip strength on vertical and smooth
   surfaces such as tree trunks and leaves and have independently evolved
   multiple times. As such, toepads have been posited as a key innovation
   for the evolution of arboreality. Leveraging a habitat use data set
   applied to a global phylogeny of 2692 lizard species, we estimated
   multiple origins of toepads in three major clades and more than 100
   origins of arboreality widely across the phylogeny. Our results suggest
   that toepads arise adaptively in arboreal lineages and are subsequently
   rarely lost while maintaining arboreal ecologies. Padless lineages
   transition away from arboreality at a higher rate than those with
   toepads, and high rates of invasion of arboreal niches by nonarboreal
   padbearing lineages provide further evidence that toepads may be a key
   to unlocking evolutionary access to the arboreal zone. Our results and
   analytical framework provide novel insights to understand and evaluate
   the ecological and evolutionary consequences of key innovations.},

Abstract = {Hybridization may often be an important source of adaptive variation,
   but the extent and long-term impacts of introgression have seldom been
   evaluated in the phylogenetic context of a radiation. Hares (Lepus)
   represent a widespread mammalian radiation of 32 extant species
   characterized by striking ecological adaptations and recurrent
   admixture. To understand the relevance of introgressive hybridization
   during the diversification of Lepus, we analyzed whole exome sequences
   (61.7 Mb) from 15 species of hares (1-4 individuals per species),
   spanning the global distribution of the genus, and two outgroups. We
   used a coalescent framework to infer species relationships and
   divergence times, despite extensive genealogical discordance. We found
   high levels of allele sharing among species and show that this reflects
   extensive incomplete lineage sorting and temporally layered
   hybridization. Our results revealed recurrent introgression at all
   stages along the Lepus radiation, including recent gene flow between
   extant species since the last glacial maximum but also pervasive ancient
   introgression occurring since near the origin of the hare lineages. We
   show that ancient hybridization between northern hemisphere species has
   resulted in shared variation of potential adaptive relevance to highly
   seasonal environments, including genes involved in circadian rhythm
   regulation, pigmentation, and thermoregulation. Our results illustrate
   how the genetic legacy of ancestral hybridization may persist across a
   radiation, leaving a long-lasting signature of shared genetic variation
   that may contribute to adaptation.},

Title = {Genomic Characterization and Curation of UCEs Improves Species Tree
   Reconstruction},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {307-321},

Abstract = {Ultraconserved genomic elements (UCEs) are generally treated as
   independent loci in phylogenetic analyses. The identification pipeline
   for UCE probes does not require prior knowledge of genetic identity,
   only selecting loci that are highly conserved, single copy, without
   repeats, and of a particular length. Here, we characterized UCEs from 11
   phylogenomic studies across the animal tree of life, from birds to
   marine invertebrates. We found that within vertebrate lineages, UCEs are
   mostly intronic and intergenic, while in invertebrates, the majority are
   in exons. We then curated four different sets of UCE markers by genomic
   category from five different studies including: birds, mammals, fish,
   Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees), and Coleoptera (beetles). Of genes
   captured by UCEs, we find that many are represented by two or more UCEs,
   corresponding to nonoverlapping segments of a single gene. We considered
   these UCEs to be nonindependent, merged all UCEs that belonged to a
   particular gene, constructed gene and species trees, and then evaluated
   the subsequent effect of merging cogenic UCEs on gene and species tree
   reconstruction. Average bootstrap support for merged UCE gene trees was
   significantly improved across all data sets apparently driven by the
   increase in loci length. Additionally, we conducted simulations and
   found that gene trees generated from merged UCEswere more accurate than
   those generated by unmerged UCEs. As loci length improves gene tree
   accuracy, this modest degree of UCE characterization and curation
   impacts downstream analyses and demonstrates the advantages of
   incorporating basic genomic characterizations into phylogenomic
   analyses.},

Title = {Implementing Large Genomic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Data Sets in
   Phylogenetic Network Reconstructions: A Case Study of Particularly Rapid
   Radiations of Cichlid Fish},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The Midas cichlids of the Amphilophus citrinellus spp. species complex
   from Nicaragua (13 species) are an extraordinary example of adaptive and
   rapid radiation (<24,000 years old). These cichlids are a very
   challenging group to infer its evolutionary history in phylogenetic
   analyses, due to the apparent prevalence of incomplete lineage sorting
   (ILS), as well as past and current gene flow. Assuming solely a vertical
   transfer of genetic material from an ancestral lineage to new lineages
   is not appropriate in many cases of genes transferred horizontally in
   nature. Recently developed methods to infer phylogenetic networks under
   such circumstances might be able to circumvent these problems. These
   models accommodate not just ILS, but also gene flow, under the
   multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) model, processes that are at work
   in young, hybridizing, and/or rapidly diversifying lineages. There are
   currently only a few programs available that implement MSNC for
   estimating phylogenetic networks. Here, we present a novel way to
   incorporate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data into the currently
   available PhyloNetworks program. Based on simulations, we demonstrate
   that SNPs can provide enough power to recover the true phylogenetic
   network. We also show that it can accurately infer the true network more
   often than other similar SNP-based programs (PhyloNet and HyDe).
   Moreover, our approach results in a faster algorithm compared to the
   original pipeline in PhyloNetworks, without losing power. We also
   applied our new approach to infer the phylogenetic network of Midas
   cichlid radiation. We implemented the most comprehensive genomic data
   set to date (RADseq data set of 679 individuals and >37K SNPs from 19
   ingroup lineages) and present estimated phylogenetic networks for this
   extremely young and fast-evolving radiation of cichlid fish. We
   demonstrate that the MSNC is more appropriate than the multispecies
   coalescent alone for the analysis of this rapid radiation.},

Volume = {69},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Placing a new species on an existing phylogeny has increasing relevance
   to several applications. Placement can be used to update phylogenies in
   a scalable fashion and can help identify unknown query samples using
   (meta-)barcoding, skimming, or metagenomic data. Maximum likelihood (ML)
   methods of phylogenetic placement exist, but these methods are not
   scalable to reference trees with many thousands of leaves, limiting
   their ability to enjoy benefits of dense taxon sampling in modern
   reference libraries. They also rely on assembled sequences for the
   reference set and aligned sequences for the query. Thus, ML methods
   cannot analyze data sets where the reference consists of unassembled
   reads, a scenario relevant to emerging applications of genome skimming
   for sample identification. We introduce APPLES, a distance-based method
   for phylogenetic placement. Compared to ML, APPLES is an order of
   magnitude faster and more memory efficient, and unlike ML, it is able to
   place on large backbone trees (tested for up to 200,000 leaves). We show
   that using dense references improves accuracy substantially so that
   APPLES on dense trees is more accurate than ML on sparser trees, where
   it can run. Finally, APPLES can accurately identify samples without
   assembled reference or aligned queries using kmer-based distances, a
   scenario that ML cannot handle. APPLES is available publically at
   github.com/balabanmetin/apples.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-556},

Abstract = {As the size of phylogenetic trees and comparative data continue to grow
   and more complex models are developed to investigate the processes that
   gave rise to them, macroevolutionary analyses are becoming increasingly
   limited by computational requirements. Here, we introduce a novel
   algorithm, based on the ``flow{''} of the differential equations that
   describe likelihoods along tree edges in backward time, to reduce
   redundancy in calculations and efficiently compute the likelihood of
   various macroevolutionary models. Our algorithm applies to several
   diversification models, including birth-death models and models that
   account for state- or time-dependent rates, as well as many commonly
   used models of discrete-trait evolution, and provides an alternative way
   to describe macroevolutionary model likelihoods. As a demonstration of
   our algorithm's utility, we implemented it for a popular class of
   state-dependent diversification models-BiSSE, MuSSE, and their
   extensions to hidden-states. Our implementation is available through the
   R package . We show that, for these models, our algorithm is one or more
   orders of magnitude faster than existing implementations when applied to
   large phylogenies. Our algorithm thus enables the fitting of
   state-dependent diversification models to modern massive phylogenies
   with millions of tips and may lead to potentially similar computational
   improvements for many other macroevolutionary models.},

Title = {A Bayesian Approach for Inferring the Impact of a Discrete Character on

Abstract = {Understanding how and why rates of character evolution vary across the
   Tree of Life is central to many evolutionary questions; for example,
   does the trophic apparatus (a set of continuous characters) evolve at a
   higher rate in fish lineages that dwell in reef versus nonreef habitats
   (a discrete character)? Existing approaches for inferring the
   relationship between a discrete character and rates of
   continuous-character evolution rely on comparing a null model (in which
   rates of continuous-character evolution are constant across lineages) to
   an alternative model (in which rates of continuous-character evolution
   depend on the state of the discrete character under consideration).
   However, these approaches are susceptible to a ``straw-man{''} effect:
   the influence of the discrete character is inflated because the null
   model is extremely unrealistic. Here, we describe MuSSCRat, a Bayesian
   approach for inferring the impact of a discrete trait on rates of
   continuous-character evolution in the presence of alternative sources of
   rate variation ({''}background-rate variation{''}). We demonstrate by
   simulation that our method is able to reliably infer the degree of
   state-dependent rate variation, and show that ignoring background-rate
   variation leads to biased inferences regarding the degree of
   state-dependent rate variation in grunts (the fish group Haemulidae).},

Title = {True Homoplasy of Retrotransposon Insertions in Primates},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {482-493},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {How reliable are the presence/absence insertion patterns of the
   supposedly homoplasy-free retrotransposons, which were randomly inserted
   in the quasi infinite genomic space? To systematically examine this
   question in an up-to-date, multigenome comparison, we screened millions
   of primate transposed Alu SINE elements for incidences of homoplasious
   precise insertions and deletions. In genome-wide analyses, we identified
   and manually verified nine cases of precise parallel Alu insertions of
   apparently identical elements at orthologous positions in two ape
   lineages and twelve incidences of precise deletions of previously
   established SINEs. Correspondingly, eight precise parallel insertions
   and no exact deletions were detected in a comparison of lemuriform
   primate and human insertions spanning the range of primate diversity.
   With an overall frequency of homoplasious Alu insertions of only 0.01\%
   (for human-chimpanzee-rhesus macaque) and 0.02-0.04\% (for
   human-bushbaby-lemurs) and precise Alu deletions of 0.001-0.002\% (for
   human-chimpanzee-rhesus macaque), real homoplasy is not considered to be
   a quantitatively relevant source of evolutionary noise. Thus,
   presence/absence patterns of Alu retrotransposons and, presumably, all
   LINE1-mobilized elements represent indeed the virtually homoplasy-free
   markers they are considered to be. Therefore, ancestral incomplete
   lineage sorting and hybridization remain the only serious sources of
   conflicting presence/absence patterns of retrotransposon insertions, and
   as such are detectable and quantifiable.},

Title = {Impacts of Inference Method and Data set Filtering on Phylogenomic
   Resolution in a Rapid Radiation of Ground Squirrels (Xerinae: Marmotini)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {298-316},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phylogenomic data sets are illuminating many areas of the Tree of Life.
   However, the large size of these data sets alone may be insufficient to
   resolve problematic nodes in the most rapid evolutionary radiations,
   because inferences in zones of extraordinarily low phylogenetic signal
   can be sensitive to the model and method of inference, as well as the
   information content of loci employed. We used a data set of 3950
   ultraconserved element (UCE) loci from a classic mammalian radiation,
   ground-dwelling squirrels of the tribe Marmotini (Sciuridae: Xerinae),
   to assess sensitivity of phylogenetic estimates to varying per-locus
   information content across four different inference methods (RAxML,
   ASTRAL, NJst, and SVDquartets). Persistent discordance was found in
   topology and bootstrap support between concatenation- and
   coalescent-based inferences; among methods within the coalescent
   framework; and within all methods in response to different filtering
   scenarios. Contrary to some recent empirical UCE-based studies,
   filtering by information content did not promote complete among-method
   concordance. Nevertheless, filtering did improve concordance relative to
   randomly selected locus sets, largely via improved consistency of
   two-step summary methods (particularly NJst) under conditions of higher
   average per-locus variation (and thus increasing gene tree precision).
   The benefits of phylogenomic data set filtering are variable among
   classes of inference methods and across different evolutionary
   scenarios, reiterating the complexities of resolving rapid radiations,
   even with robust taxon and character sampling.},

Title = {How Well Does Your Phylogenetic Model Fit Your Data?},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-167},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The test for model-to-data fitness is a fundamental principle within the
   statistical sciences. The purpose of such a test is to assess whether
   the selected best-fitting model adequately describes the behavior in the
   data. Despite their broad application across many areas of statistics,
   goodness of fit tests for phylogenetic models have received much less
   attention than model selection methods in the last decade. At present a
   number of approaches have been suggested. However, these are often
   flawed, with problems ranging from the presence of systematic error in
   the models themselves to the difficulties presented by the nature of
   phylogenetic data. Ultimately these problems lead to an inadequate
   choice of statistic. This is one of the main reasons why goodness of fit
   assessment is often a neglected step within phylogenetic analysis. We
   argue not only for the necessity of these goodness of fit measures to
   test how well the model reflects the data, but additionally for the need
   for useful tests that explain why the model-to-data fit may be
   inadequate. Such tests are a critical part of the model building
   process, allowing the model to be adapted to provide a better
   model-to-data fit or to reject a model class outright due to such an
   inadequate fit that the intended use of the class may be compromised.
   Proposed and existing methods in both the maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian framework will be discussed here, whilst highlighting their
   strengths and limitations for assessing goodness of fit. The final
   section discusses some critical open statistical problems in goodness of
   fit assessment for this field, with the hope of encouraging more
   research into such a fundamental yet underdeveloped area of phylogenetic
   inference. {[}Bayesian phylogenetics; Goodness of fit; maximum

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},
Pages = {997-1009},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic reconstructions are essential in genomics data analyses and
   depend on accurate multiple sequence alignment (MSA) models. We show
   that all currently available large-scale progressive multiple alignment
   methods are numerically unstable when dealing with amino-acid sequences.
   They produce significantly different output when changing sequence input
   order. We used the HOMFAM protein sequences dataset to show that on
   datasets larger than 100 sequences, this instability affects on average
   21.5\% of the aligned residues. The resulting Maximum Likelihood (ML)
   trees estimated from these MSAs are equally unstable with over 38\% of
   the branches being sensitive to the sequence input order. We established
   that about two-thirds of this uncertainty stems from the unordered
   nature of children nodes within the guide trees used to estimate MSAs.
   To quantify this uncertainty we developed unistrap, a novel approach
   that estimates the combined effect of alignment uncertainty and site
   sampling on phylogenetic tree branch supports. Compared with the regular
   bootstrap procedure, unistrap provides branch support estimates that
   take into account a larger fraction of the parameters impacting tree
   instability when processing datasets containing a large number of
   sequences.},

Title = {Impact of Model Violations on the Inference of Species Boundaries Under
   the Multispecies Coalescent},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The use of genetic data for identifying species-level lineages across
   the tree of life has received increasing attention in the field of
   systematics over the past decade. The multispecies coalescent model
   provides a framework for understanding the process of lineage divergence
   and has become widely adopted for delimiting species. However, because
   these studies lack an explicit assessment of model fit, in many cases,
   the accuracy of the inferred species boundaries are unknown. This is
   concerning given the large amount of empirical data and theory that
   highlight the complexity of the speciation process. Here, we seek to
   fill this gap by using simulation to characterize the sensitivity of
   inference under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) to several violations
   of model assumptions thought to be common in empirical data. We also
   assess the fit of the MSC model to empirical data in the context of
   species delimitation. Our results show substantial variation in model
   fit across data sets. Posterior predictive tests find the poorest model
   performance in data sets that were hypothesized to be impacted by model
   violations. We also show that while the inferences assuming the MSC are
   robust to minor model violations, such inferences can be biased under
   some biologically plausible scenarios. Taken together, these results
   suggest that researchers can identify individual data sets in which
   species delimitation under the MSC is likely to be problematic, thereby
   highlighting the cases where additional lines of evidence to identify
   species boundaries are particularly important to collect. Our study
   supports a growing body of work highlighting the importance of model
   checking in phylogenetics, and the usefulness of tailoring tests of
   model fit to assess the reliability of particular inferences.},

Title = {Use of Continuous Traits Can Improve Morphological Phylogenetics},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {328-339},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The recent surge in enthusiasm for simultaneously inferring
   relationships from extinct and extant species has reinvigorated interest
   in statistical approaches for modeling morphological evolution. Current
   statistical methods use the Mk model to describe substitutions between
   discrete character states. Although representing a significant step
   forward, the Mk model presents challenges in biological interpretation,
   and its adequacy in modeling morphological evolution has not been well
   explored. Another major hurdle in morphological phylogenetics concerns
   the process of character coding of discrete characters. The often
   subjective nature of discrete character coding can generate discordant
   results that are rooted in individual researchers' subjective
   interpretations. Employing continuous measurements to infer phylogenies
   may alleviate some of these issues. Although not widely used in the
   inference of topology, models describing the evolution of continuous
   characters have been well examined, and their statistical behavior is
   well understood. Also, continuous measurements avoid the substantial
   ambiguity often associated with the assignment of discrete characters to
   states. I present a set of simulations to determine whether use of
   continuous characters is a feasible alternative or supplement to
   discrete characters for inferring phylogeny. I compare relative
   reconstruction accuracy by inferring phylogenies from simulated
   continuous and discrete characters. These tests demonstrate significant
   promise for continuous traits by demonstrating their higher overall
   accuracy as compared to reconstruction from discrete characters under Mk
   when simulated under unbounded Brownian motion, and equal performance
   when simulated under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Continuous characters
   also perform reasonably well in the presence of covariance between
   sites. I argue that inferring phylogenies directly from continuous
   traits may be benefit efforts to maximize phylogenetic information in
   morphological data sets by preserving larger variation in state space
   compared to many discretization schemes. I also suggest that the use of
   continuous trait models in phylogenetic reconstruction may alleviate
   potential concerns of discrete character model adequacy, while
   identifying areas that require further study in this area. This study
   provides an initial controlled demonstration of the efficacy of
   continuous characters in phylogenetic inference.},

Title = {Temperature-Dependent Evolutionary Speed Shapes the Evolution of
   Biodiversity Patterns Across Tetrapod Radiations},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Biodiversity varies predictably with environmental energy around the
   globe, but the underlaying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
   The evolutionary speed hypothesis predicts that environmental kinetic
   energy shapes variation in speciation rates through temperature- or life
   history-dependent rates of evolution. To test whether variation in
   evolutionary speed can explain the relationship between energy and
   biodiversity in birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, we simulated
   diversification over 65 myr of geological and climatic change with a
   spatially explicit eco-evolutionary simulation model. We modeled four
   distinct evolutionary scenarios in which speciation-completion rates
   were dependent on temperature (M1), life history (M2), temperature and
   life history (M3), or were independent of temperature and life-history
   (M0). To assess the agreement between simulated and empirical data, we
   performed model selection by fitting supervised machine learning models
   to multidimensional biodiversity patterns. We show that a model with
   temperature-dependent rates of speciation (M1) consistently had the
   strongest support. In contrast to statistical inferences, which showed
   no general relationships between temperature and speciation rates in
   tetrapods, we demonstrate how process-based modeling can disentangle the
   causes behind empirical biodiversity patterns. Our study highlights how
   environmental energy has played a fundamental role in the evolution of
   biodiversity over deep time. {[}Biogeography; diversification; machine

Title = {Phylogenetic Diversity Rankings in the Face of Extinctions: The
   Robustness of the Fair Proportion Index},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {606-615},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Planning for the protection of species often involves difficult choices
   about which species to prioritize, given constrained resources. One way
   of prioritizing species is to consider their ``evolutionary
   distinctiveness,{''} (ED) that is, their relative evolutionary isolation
   on a phylogenetic tree. Several evolutionary isolation metrics or
   phylogenetic diversity indices have been introduced in the literature,
   among them the so-called Fair Proportion (FP) index (also known as the
   ED score). This index apportions the total diversity of a tree among all
   leaves, thereby providing a simple prioritization criterion for
   conservation. Here, we focus on the prioritization order obtained from
   the FP index and analyze the effects of species extinction on this
   ranking. More precisely, we analyze the extent to which the ranking
   order may change when some species go extinct and the FP index is
   recomputed for the remaining taxa. We show that for each phylogenetic
   tree, there are edge lengths such that the extinction of one leaf per
   cherry completely reverses the ranking. Moreover, we show that even if
   only the lowest-ranked species goes extinct, the ranking order may
   drastically change. We end by analyzing the effects of these two
   extinction scenarios (extinction of the lowest-ranked species and
   extinction of one leaf per cherry) for a collection of empirical and
   simulated trees. In both cases, we can observe significant changes in
   the prioritization orders, highlighting the empirical relevance of our
   theoretical findings.},

Title = {Unifying Phylogenetic Birth-Death Models in Epidemiology and
   Macroevolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {172-189},

Abstract = {Birth-death stochastic processes are the foundations of many
   phylogenetic models and are widely used to make inferences about
   epidemiological and macroevolutionary dynamics. There are a large number
   of birth-death model variants that have been developed; these impose
   different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and
   about the sampling process. As each of these variants was individually
   derived, it has been difficult to understand the relationships between
   them as well as their precise biological and mathematical assumptions.
   Without a common mathematical foundation, deriving new models is
   nontrivial. Here, we unify these models into a single framework, prove
   that many previously developed epidemiological and macroevolutionary
   models are all special cases of a more general model, and illustrate the
   connections between these variants. This unification includes both
   models where the process is the same for all lineages and those in which
   it varies across types. We also outline a straightforward procedure for
   deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex
   birth-death(-sampling) models that will hopefully allow researchers to
   explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible. By
   rederiving existing single-type birth-death sampling models, we clarify
   and synthesize the range of explicit and implicit assumptions made by
   these models.},

Title = {Gene Flow Increases Phylogenetic Structure and Inflates Cryptic Species
   Estimations: A Case Study on Widespread Philippine Puddle Frogs

Abstract = {In cryptic amphibian complexes, there is a growing trend to equate high
   levels of genetic structure with hidden cryptic species diversity.
   Typically, phylogenetic structure and distance-based approaches are used
   to demonstrate the distinctness of clades and justify the recognition of
   new cryptic species. However, this approach does not account for gene
   flow, spatial, and environmental processes that can obfuscate
   phylogenetic inference and bias species delimitation. As a case study,
   we sequenced genome-wide exons and introns to evince the processes that
   underlie the diversification of Philippine Puddle Frogs-a group that is
   widespread, phenotypically conserved, and exhibits high levels of
   geographically based genetic structure. We showed that widely adopted
   tree- and distance-based approaches inferred up to 20 species, compared
   to genomic analyses that inferred an optimal number of five distinct
   genetic groups. Using a suite of clustering, admixture, and phylogenetic
   network analyses, we demonstrate extensive admixture among the five
   groups and elucidate two specific ways in which gene flow can cause
   overestimations of species diversity: 1) admixed populations can be
   inferred as distinct lineages characterized by long branches in
   phylograms; and 2) admixed lineages can appear to be genetically
   divergent, even from their parental populations when simple measures of
   genetic distance are used. We demonstrate that the relationship between
   mitochondrial and genome-wide nuclear-distances is decoupled in admixed
   clades, leading to erroneous estimates of genetic distances and,
   consequently, species diversity. Additionally, genetic distance was also
   biased by spatial and environmental processes. Overall, we showed that
   high levels of genetic diversity in Philippine Puddle Frogs
   predominantly comprise metapopulation lineages that arose through
   complex patterns of admixture, isolation-by-distance, and
   isolation-by-environment as opposed to species divergence. Our findings
   suggest that speciation may not be the major process underlying the high
   levels of hidden diversity observed in many taxonomic groups and that
   widely adopted tree- and distance-based methods overestimate species
   diversity in the presence of gene flow.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees based on genome-wide sequence data may not always
   represent the true evolutionary history for a variety of reasons. One
   process that can lead to incorrect reconstruction of species phylogenies
   is gene flow, especially if interspecific gene flow has affected large
   parts of the genome. We investigated phylogenetic relationships within a
   clade comprising eight species of passerine birds (Phylloscopidae,
   Phylloscopus, leafwarblers) using one de novo genome assembly and 78
   resequenced genomes. Onthe basis of hypothesis-exclusion trials based on
   D-statistics, phylogenetic network analysis, and demographic inference
   analysis, we identified ancient gene flow affecting large parts of the
   genome between one species and the ancestral lineage of a sister species
   pair. This ancient gene flow consistently caused erroneous
   reconstruction of the phylogeny when using large amounts of genome-wide
   sequence data. In contrast, the true relationships were captured when
   smaller parts of the genome were analyzed, showing that the
   ``winner-takes-all democratic majority tree{''} is not necessarily the
   true species tree. Under this condition, smaller amounts of data may
   sometimes avoid the effects of gene flow due to stochastic sampling, as
   hidden reticulation histories are more likely to emerge from the use of
   larger data sets, especially whole-genome data sets. In addition, we
   also found that genomic regions affected by ancient gene flow generally
   exhibited higher genomic differentiation but a lower recombination rate
   and nucleotide diversity. Our study highlights the importance of
   considering reticulation in phylogenetic reconstructions in the genomic
   era.},

Title = {A New Method for Integrating Ecological Niche Modeling with
   Phylogenetics to Estimate Ancestral Distributions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1033-1045},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ancestral range estimation and projection of niche models into the past
   have both become common in evolutionary studies where the ancient
   distributions of organisms are in question. However, these methods are
   hampered by complementary hurdles: discrete characterization of areas in
   ancestral range estimation can be overly coarse, especially at shallow
   timescales, and niche model projection neglects evolution. Phylogenetic
   niche modeling accounts for both of these issues by incorporating
   knowledge of evolutionary relationships into a characterization of
   environmental tolerances. We present a new method for phylogenetic niche
   modeling, implemented in R. Given past and present climate data, taxon
   occurrence data, and a time-calibrated phylogeny, our method constructs
   niche models for each extant taxon, uses ancestral character estimation
   to reconstruct ancestral niche models, and projects these models into
   paleoclimate data to provide a historical estimate of the geographic
   range of a lineage. Models either at nodes or along branches of the
   phylogeny can be estimated. We demonstrate our method on a small group
   of dendrobatid frogs and show that it can make inferences given species
   with restricted ranges and little occurrence data. We also use
   simulations to showthat our method can reliably reconstruct the niche of
   a known ancestor in both geographic and environmental space. Our method
   brings together fields as disparate as ecological niche modeling,
   phylogenetics, and ancestral range estimation in a user-friendly
   package.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Sampling across tree space is one of the major challenges in Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
   Standard MCMC tree moves consider small random perturbations of the
   topology, and select from candidate trees at random or based on the
   distance between the old and new topologies. MCMC algorithms using such
   moves tend to get trapped in tree space, making them slow in finding the
   globally most probable trees (known as ``convergence{''}) and in
   estimating the correct proportions of the different types of them (known
   as ``mixing{''}). Here, we introduce a new class of moves, which propose
   trees based on their parsimony scores. The proposal distribution derived
   from the parsimony scores is a quickly computable albeit rough
   approximation of the conditional posterior distribution over candidate
   trees. We demonstrate with simulations that parsimony-guided moves
   correctly sample the uniform distribution of topologies from the prior.
   We then evaluate their performance against standard moves using six
   challenging empirical data sets, for which we were able to obtain
   accurate reference estimates of the posterior using long MCMC runs, a
   mix of topology proposals, and Metropolis coupling. On these data sets,
   ranging in size from 357 to 934 taxa and from 1740 to 5681 sites, we
   find that single chains using parsimony-guided moves usually converge an
   order of magnitude faster than chains using standard moves. They also
   exhibit better mixing, that is, they cover the most probable trees more
   quickly. Our results show that tree moves based on quick and dirty
   estimates of the posterior probability can significantly outperform
   standard moves. Future research will have to show to what extent the
   performance of such moves can be improved further by finding better ways
   of approximating the posterior probability, taking the trade-off between
   accuracy and speed into account.},

   Estimation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {69},

Pages = {660-670},

Abstract = {Rate variation adds considerable complexity to divergence time
   estimation in molecular phylogenies. Here, we evaluate the impact of
   lineage-specific rates-which we define as among-branch-rate-variation
   that acts consistently across the entire genome. We compare its impact
   to residual rates-defined as among-branch-rate-variation that shows a
   different pattern of rate variation at each sampled locus, and
   gene-specific rates-defined as variation in the average rate across all
   branches at each sampled locus. We show that lineage-specific rates lead
   to erroneous divergence time estimates, regardless of how many loci are
   sampled. Further, we show that stronger lineage-specific rates lead to
   increasing error. This contrasts to residual rates and gene-specific
   rates, where sampling more loci significantly reduces error. If
   divergence times are inferred in a Bayesian framework, we highlight that
   error caused by lineage-specific rates significantly reduces the
   probability that the 95\% highest posterior density includes the correct
   value, and leads to sensitivity to the prior. Use of a more complex rate
   prior-which has recently been proposed to model rate variation more
   accurately-does not affect these conclusions. Finally, we show that the
   scale of lineage-specific rates used in our simulation experiments is
   comparable to that of an empirical data set for the angiosperm genus
   Ipomoea. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that lineage-specific
   rates cause error in divergence time estimates, and that this error is
   not overcome by analyzing genomic scale multilocus data sets.},

Abstract = {We address some of the taxonomic and classification changes proposed by
   Kuntner et al. (2019) in a comparative study on the evolution of sexual
   size dimorphism in nephiline spiders. Their proposal to recircumscribe
   araneids and to rank the subfamily Nephilinae as a family is
   fundamentally flawed as it renders the family Araneidae paraphyletic. We
   discuss the importance of monophyly, outgroup selection, and taxon
   sampling, the subjectivity of ranks, and the implications of the age of
   origin criterion to assign categorical ranks in biological
   classifications. We explore the outcome of applying the approach of
   Kuntner et al. (2019) to the classification of spiders with emphasis on
   the ecribellate orb-weavers (Araneoidea) using a recently published
   dated phylogeny. We discuss the implications of including the putative
   sister group of Nephilinae (the sexually dimorphic genus
   Paraplectanoides) and the putative sister group of Araneidae (the
   miniature, monomorphic family Theridiosomatidae). We propose
   continuation of the phylogenetic classification put forth by Dimitrov et
   al. (2017), and we formally rank Nephilinae and Phonognathinae as
   subfamilies of Araneidae. Our classification better reflects the
   understanding of the phylogenetic placement and evolutionary history of
   nephilines and phonognathines while maintaining the diagnosability of
   Nephilinae. It also fulfills the fundamental requirement that taxa must
   be monophyletic, and thus avoids the paraphyly of Araneidae implied by
   Kuntner et al. (2019).},

Abstract = {Incomplete or geographically biased sampling poses significant problems
   for research in phylogeography, population genetics, phylogenetics, and
   species delimitation. Despite the power of using genome-wide genetic
   markers in systematics and related fields, approaches such as the
   multispecies coalescent remain unable to easily account for unsampled
   lineages. The Empidonax difficilis/Empidonax occidentalis complex of
   small tyrannid flycatchers (Aves: Tyrannidae) is a classic example of
   widely distributed species with limited phenotypic geographic variation
   that was broken into two largely cryptic (or ``sibling{''}) lineages
   following extensive study. Though the group is well-characterized north
   of the US Mexico border, the evolutionary distinctiveness and
   phylogenetic relationships of southern populations remain obscure. In
   this article, we use dense genomic and geographic sampling across the
   majority of the range of the E. difficilis/E. occidentalis complex to
   assess whether current taxonomy and species limits reflect underlying
   evolutionary patterns, or whether they are an artifact of historically
   biased or incomplete sampling. We find that additional samples from
   Mexico render the widely recognized species-level lineage E.
   occidentalis paraphyletic, though it retains support in the best-fit
   species delimitation model from clustering analyses. We further identify
   a highly divergent unrecognized lineage in a previously unsampled
   portion of the group's range, which a cline analysis suggests is more
   reproductively isolated than the currently recognized species E.
   difficilis and E. occidentalis. Our phylogeny supports a southern origin
   of these taxa. Our results highlight the pervasive impacts of biased
   geographic sampling, even in well-studied vertebrate groups like birds,
   and illustrate what is a common problem when attempting to define
   species in the face of recent divergence and reticulate evolution.},

Abstract = {The last half century of paleornithological research has transformed the
   way that biologists perceive the evolutionary history of birds. This
   transformation has been driven, since 1969, by a series of exciting
   fossil discoveries combined with intense scientific debate over how best
   to interpret these discoveries. Ideally, as evidence accrues and results
   accumulate, interpretive scientific agreement forms. But this has not
   entirely happened in the debate over avian origins: the accumulation of
   scientific evidence and analyses has had some effect, but not a
   conclusive one, in terms of resolving the question of avian origins.
   Although the majority of biologists have come to accept that birds are
   dinosaurs, there is lingering and, in some quarters, strident opposition
   to this view. In order to both understand the ongoing disagreement about
   avian origins and generate a prediction about the future of the debate,
   here we use a revised model of scientific practice to assess the current
   and historical state of play surrounding the topic of bird evolutionary
   origins. Many scientists are familiar with the metascientific scholars
   Sir Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, and these are the primary figures that
   have been appealed to so far, in prior attempts to assess the dispute.
   But we demonstrate that a variation of Imre Lakatos's model of
   progressive versus degenerative research programmes provides a novel and
   productive assessment of the debate. We establish that a refurbished
   Lakatosian account both explains the intractability of the dispute and
   predicts a likely outcome for the debate about avian origins. In short,
   here, we offer a metascientific tool for rationally assessing competing
   theories-one that allows researchers involved in seemingly intractable
   scientific disputes to advance their debates.},

Title = {Morphological Data Sets Fit a Common Mechanism Much More Poorly than DNA
   Sequences and Call Into Question the Mkv Model},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {494-504},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Mkv evolutionary model, based on minor modifications to models of
   molecular evolution, is being increasingly used to infer phylogenies
   from discrete morphological data, often producing different results from
   parsimony. The critical difference between Mkv and parsimony is the
   assumption of a ``common mechanism{''} in the Mkv model, with branch
   lengths determining that probability of change for all characters
   increases or decreases at the same tree branches by the same exponential
   factor. We evaluate whether the assumption of a common mechanism applies
   to morphology, by testing the implicit prediction that branch lengths
   calculated from different subsets of characters will be significantly
   correlated. Our analysis shows that DNA (38 data sets tested) is often
   compatible with a common mechanism, but morphology (86 data sets tested)
   generally is not, showing very disparate branch lengths for different
   character partitions. The low levels of branch length correlation
   demonstrated for morphology (fitting models without a common mechanism)
   suggest that the Mkv model is too unrealistic and inadequate for the
   analysis of most morphological data sets.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the problem of estimating a species tree from
   multilocus data in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and
   migration. I develop a mathematical model similar to IMa2 (Hey 2010) for
   the relevant evolutionary processes which allows both the population
   size parameters and the migration rates between pairs of species tree
   branches to be integrated out. I then describe a BEAST2 package DENIM
   (Divergence estimation notwithstanding ILS and migration) which is based
   on this model and which uses an approximation to sample from the
   posterior. The approximation is based on the assumption that migrations
   are rare, and it only samples from certain regions of the posterior
   which seem likely given this assumption. The method breaks down if there
   is a lot of migration. Using simulations, Leach et al. (2014) showed
   that using the standard multispecies coalescent model to infer a species
   tree can result in poor accuracy if migration is present. I reanalyze
   this simulated data to explore DENIMs performance and demonstrate
   substantial improvements in accuracy over {*}BEAST. I also reanalyze an
   empirical data set.},

Title = {The Grass was Greener: Repeated Evolution of Specialized Morphologies

   South America},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While grasslands, one of Earths major biomes, are known for their close
   evolutionary ties with ungulate grazers, these habitats are also
   paramount to the origins and diversification of other animals. Within
   the primarily South American spider subfamily Amaurobioidinae
   (Anyphaenidae), several species are found living in the continents
   grasslands, with some displaying putative morphological adaptations to
   dwelling unnoticed in the grass blades. Herein, a dated molecular
   phylogeny provides the backbone for analyses revealing the ecological
   and morphological processes behind these spiders grassland adaptations.
   The multiple switches from Patagonian forests to open habitats coincide
   with the expansion of South Americas grasslands during the Miocene,
   while the specialized morphology of several grass-dwelling spiders
   originated at least three independent times and is best described as the
   result of different selective regimes operating on macroevolutionary
   timescales. Although grass-adapted lineages evolved towards different
   peaks in adaptive landscape, they all share one characteristic: an
   anterior narrowing of the prosoma allowing spiders to extend the first
   two pairs of legs, thus maintaining a slender resting posture in the
   grass blade. By combining phylogenetic, morphological, and biogeographic
   perspectives we disentangle multiple factors determining the evolution
   of a clade of terrestrial invertebrate predators alongside their biomes.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {743-755},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most phylogenies are typically represented as purely bifurcating.
   However, as genomic data have become more common in phylogenetic
   studies, it is not unusual to find reticulation among terminal lineages
   or among internal nodes (deep time reticulation; DTR). In these
   situations, gene flow must have happened in the same or adjacent
   geographic areas for these DTRs to have occurred and therefore
   biogeographic reconstruction should provide similar area estimates for
   parental nodes, provided extinction or dispersal has not eroded these
   patterns. We examine the phylogeny of the widely distributed New World
   kingsnakes (Lampropeltis), determine if DTR is present in this group,
   and estimate the ancestral area for reticulation. Importantly, we
   develop a new method that uses coalescent simulations in amachine
   learning framework to show conclusively that this phylogeny is best
   represented as reticulating at deeper time. Using joint probabilities of
   ancestral area reconstructions on the bifurcating parental lineages from
   the reticulating node, we show that this reticulation likely occurred in
   northwestern Mexico / southwestern US, and subsequently, led to the
   diversification of the Mexican kingsnakes. This region has been
   previously identified as an area important for understanding speciation
   and secondary contact with gene flow in snakes and other squamates. This
   research shows that phylogenetic reticulation is common, even in
   well-studied groups, and that the geographic scope of ancient
   hybridization is recoverable.},

Title = {When Darwin's Special Difficulty Promotes Diversification in Insects},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {873-887},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Eusociality, Darwin's special difficulty, has been widely investigated
   but remains a topic of great debate in organismal biology. Eusocial
   species challenge existing theories, and the impact of highly integrated
   societies on diversification dynamics is controversial with opposing
   assertions and hypotheses in the literature. Here, using phylogenetic
   approaches in termites-the first group that has evolved eusociality-we
   assessed the fundamental prediction that eusocial lineages have higher
   diversification rates than non-eusocial clades. We found multiple lines
   of evidence that eusociality provided higher diversification as compared
   to non-eusociality. This is particularly exacerbated for eusocial
   species with ``true{''} workers as compared to species with ``false{''}
   workers. Because most species with ``true{''} workers have an entirely
   prokaryotic microbiota, the latter feature is also related to higher
   diversification rates, but it should be investigated further, notably in
   relation to angiosperm diversification. Overall, this study suggests
   that societies with ``true{''} workers are not only more successful at
   ecological timescales but also over millions of years, which further
   implies that both organism and species-level traits act on species
   selection.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods explore the relationships between
   quantitative traits adjusting for shared evolutionary history. This
   adjustment often occurs through a Brownian diffusion process along the
   branches of the phylogeny that generates model residuals or the traits
   themselves. For high-dimensional traits, inferring all pair-wise
   correlations within the multivariate diffusion is limiting. To
   circumvent this problem, we propose phylogenetic factor analysis (PFA)
   that assumes a small unknown number of independent evolutionary factors
   arise along the phylogeny and these factors generate clusters of
   dependent traits. Set in a Bayesian framework, PFA provides measures of
   uncertainty on the factor number and groupings, combines both continuous
   and discrete traits, integrates over missing measurements and
   incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty with the help of molecular
   sequences. We develop Gibbs samplers based on dynamic programming to
   estimate the PFA posterior distribution, over 3-fold faster than for
   multivariate diffusion and a further order-of-magnitude more efficiently
   in the presence of latent traits. We further propose a novel marginal
   likelihood estimator for previously impractical models with discrete
   data and find that PFA also provides a better fit than multivariate
   diffusion in evolutionary questions in columbine flower development,
   placental reproduction transitions and triggerfish fin morphometry.},

Abstract = {The multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) is a stochastic process that
   captures how gene trees grow within the branches of a phylogenetic
   network. Coupling the MSNC with a stochastic mutational process that
   operates along the branches of the gene trees gives rise to a generative
   model of how multiple loci from within and across species evolve in the
   presence of both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulation
   (e.g., hybridization). We report on a Bayesian method for sampling the
   parameters of this generative model, including the species phylogeny,
   gene trees, divergence times, and population sizes, from DNA sequences
   of multiple independent loci. We demonstrate the utility of our method
   by analyzing simulated data and reanalyzing an empirical data set. Our
   results demonstrate the significance of not only coestimating species
   phylogenies and gene trees, but also accounting for reticulation and ILS
   simultaneously. In particular, we show that when gene flow occurs, our
   method accurately estimates the evolutionary histories, coalescence
   times, and divergence times. Tree inference methods, on the other hand,
   underestimate divergence times and overestimate coalescence times when
   the evolutionary history is reticulate. While the MSNC corresponds to an
   abstract model of ``intermixture,{''} we study the performance of the
   model and method on simulated data generated under a gene flow model. We
   show that the method accurately infers the most recent time at which
   gene flowoccurs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the new
   method to a 106-locus yeast data set.},

Abstract = {The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has allowed for the
   collection of large portions of the genome for phylogenetic analysis.
   Hybrid enrichment and transcriptomics are two techniques that leverage
   next-generation sequencing and have shown much promise. However, methods
   for processing hybrid enrichment data are still limited. We developed a
   pipeline for anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) read assembly, orthology
   determination, contamination screening, and data processing for
   sequences flanking the target ``probe{''} region. We apply this approach
   to study the phylogeny of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), a
   megadiverse group of more than 157,000 described species with poorly
   understood deep-level phylogenetic relationships. We introduce a new,
   855 locus AHE kit for Lepidoptera phylogenetics and compare resulting
   trees to those from transcriptomes. The enrichment kit was designed from
   existing genomes, transcriptomes, and expressed sequence tags and was
   used to capture sequence data from 54 species from 23 lepidopteran
   families. Phylogenies estimated from AHE data were largely congruent
   with trees generated from transcriptomes, with strong support for
   relationships at all but the deepest taxonomic levels. We combineAHEand
   transcriptomic data to generate a new Lepidoptera phylogeny,
   representing 76 exemplar species in 42 families. The tree provides
   robust support for many relationships, including those among the seven
   butterfly families. The addition of AHE data to an existing
   transcriptomic dataset lowers node support along the Lepidoptera
   backbone, but firmly places taxa with AHE data on the phylogeny.
   Combining taxa sequenced for AHE with existing transcriptomes and
   genomes resulted in a tree with strong support for (Calliduloidea +
   Gelechioidea + Thyridoidea) + (Papilionoidea + Pyraloidea +
   Macroheterocera). To examine the efficacy ofAHEat a shallowtaxonomic
   level, phylogenetic analyseswere also conducted on a sister group
   representing amore recent divergence, the Saturniidae and Sphingidae.
   These analyses utilized sequences from the probe region and data
   flanking it, nearly doubled the size of the dataset; resulting trees
   supported new phylogenetics relationships, especially within the
   Saturniidae and Sphingidae (e.g., Hemarina derived in the latter). We
   hope that our data processing pipeline, hybrid enrichment gene set, and
   approach of combining AHE data with transcriptomes will be useful for
   the broader systematics community.},

Title = {Linking White-Tailed Deer Density, Nutrition, and Vegetation in a
   Stochastic Environment},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {202},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-63},

Abstract = {Density-dependent behavior underpins white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) theory and management application in North America, but
   strength or frequency of the phenomenon has varied across the geographic
   range of the species. The modifying effect of stochastic environments
   and poor-quality habitats on density-dependent behavior has been
   recognized for ungulate populations around the world, including
   white-tailed deer populations in South Texas, USA. Despite the
   importance of understanding mechanisms influencing density dependence,
   researchers have concentrated on demographic and morphological
   implications of deer density. Researchers have not focused on linking
   vegetation dynamics, nutrition, and deer dynamics. We conducted a series
   of designed experiments during 2004-2012 to determine how strongly
   white-tailed deer density, vegetation composition, and deer nutrition
   (natural and supplemented) are linked in a semi-arid environment where
   the coefficient of variation of annual precipitation exceeds 30\%. We
   replicated our study on 2 sites with thornshrub vegetation in Dimmit
   County, Texas. During late 2003, we constructed 6 81-ha enclosures
   surrounded by 2.4-m-tall woven wire fence on each study site. The
   experimental design included 2 nutrition treatments and 3 deer densities
   in a factorial array, with study sites as blocks. Abundance targets for
   low, medium, and high deer densities in enclosures were 10 deer
   (equivalent to 13 deer/km(2)), 25 deer (31 deer/km(2)), and 40 deer (50
   deer/km(2)), respectively. Each study site had 2 enclosures with each
   deer density. We provided deer in 1 enclosure at each density with a
   high-quality pelleted supplement ad libitum, which we termed enhanced
   nutrition; deer in the other enclosure at each density had access to
   natural nutrition from the vegetation. We conducted camera surveys of
   deer in each enclosure twice per year and added or removed deer as
   needed to approximate the target densities. We maintained >50\% of deer
   ear-tagged for individual recognition. We maintained adult sex ratios of
   1:1-1:1.5 (males:females) and a mix of young and older deer in
   enclosures. We used reconstruction, validated by comparison to known
   number of adult males, to make annual estimates of density for each
   enclosure in analysis of treatment effects. We explored the effect of
   deer density on diet composition, diet quality, and intake rate of
   tractable female deer released into low- and high-density enclosures
   with natural nutrition on both study sites (4 total enclosures) between
   June 2009 and May 2011, 5 years after we established density treatments
   in enclosures. We used the bite count technique and followed 2-3
   tractable deer/enclosure during foraging bouts across 4 seasons.
   Proportion of shrubs, forbs, mast, cacti, and subshrubs in deer diets
   did not differ (P > 0.57) between deer density treatments. Percent grass
   in deer diets was higher (P = 0.05) at high deer density but composed
   only 1.3 +/- 0.3\% (SE) of the diet. Digestible protein and
   metabolizable energy of diets were similar (P > 0.45) between deer
   density treatments. Likewise, bite rate, bite size, and dry matter
   intake did not vary (P > 0.45) with deer density. Unlike deer density,
   drought had dramatic (P <= 0.10) effects on foraging of tractable deer.
   During drought conditions, the proportion of shrubs and flowers
   increased in deer diets, whereas forbs declined. Digestible protein was
   31\%, 53\%, and 54\% greater (P = 0.
   06) during non-drought than drought during autumn, winter, and spring,
   respectively. We studied the effects of enhanced nutrition on the
   composition and quality of tractable female deer diets between April
   2007 and February 2009, 3 years after we established density treatments
   in enclosures. We also estimated the proportion of supplemental feed in
   deer diets. We used the 2 low-density enclosures on each study site, 1
   with enhanced nutrition and 1 with natural nutrition (4 total
   enclosures). We again used the bite count technique and 2-3 tractable
   deer living in each enclosure. We estimated proportion of pelleted feed
   in diets of tractable deer and non-tractable deer using ratios of stable
   isotopes of carbon. Averaged across seasons and nutrition treatments,
   shrubs composed a majority of the vegetation portion of deer diets
   (44\%), followed by mast (26\%) and forbs (15\%). Enhanced nutrition
   influenced the proportion of mast, cacti, and flowers in the diet, but
   the nature and magnitude of the effect varied by season and year. The
   trend was for deer in natural-nutrition enclosures to eat more mast. We
   did not detect a statistical difference (P = 0.15) in the proportion of
   shrubs in diets between natural and enhanced nutrition, but deer with
   enhanced nutrition consumed 7-24\% more shrubs in 5 of 8 seasons. Deer
   in enhanced-nutrition enclosures had greater (P = 0.03) digestible
   protein in their overall diet than deer in natural-nutrition enclosures.
   The effect of enhanced nutrition on metabolizable energy in overall
   diets varied by season and was greater (P < 0.04) for enhanced-nutrition
   deer during summer and autumn 2007 and winter 2008. In the
   enhanced-nutrition treatment, supplemental feed averaged 47-80\% of the
   diet of tractable deer. Of non-tractable deer in all density treatments
   with enhanced nutrition, 97\% (n = 128 deer) ate supplemental feed. For
   non-tractable deer averaged across density treatments, study sites, and
   years, percent supplemental feed in deer diets exceeded 70\% for all sex
   and age groups. We determined if increasing deer density and enhanced
   nutrition resulted in a decline in preferred forbs and shrubs and an
   increase in plants less preferred by deer. We sampled all 12 enclosures
   via 20, 50-m permanent transects in each enclosure. Percent canopy cover
   of preferred forbs was similar (P = 0.13) among deer densities averaged
   across nutrition treatments and sampling years (low density: 305; = 8\%,
   SE range 6-10; medium density: 5\%, 4-6; high density: 4\%, 3-5; SE
   ranges are presented because SEs associated with backtransformed means
   are asymetrical). Averaged across deer densities, preferred forb canopy
   cover was similar between nutrition treatments in 2004; but by 2012
   averaged 20 +/- 17-23\% in enhanced-nutrition enclosures compared to 10
   +/- 8-13\% in natural-nutrition enclosures (P = 0.107). Percent canopy
   cover of other forbs, preferred shrubs, other shrubs, and grasses, as
   well as Shannon's index, evenness, and species richness were similar (P
   > 0.10) among deer densities, averaged across nutrition treatments and
   sampling years. We analyzed fawn:adult female ratios, growth rates of
   fawns and yearlings, and survival from 6 to 14 months of age and for
   adults >14 months of age. We assessed adult body mass and population
   growth rates (lambda apparent, lambda(APP)) to determine density and
   nutrition effects on deer populations in the research enclosures during
   2004-2012.
   Fawn:adult female ratios declined (P = 0.04) from low-medium density to
   high density in natural-nutrition enclosures but were not affected (P =
   0.48) by density in enhanced nutrition enclosures although, compared to
   natural nutrition, enhanced nutrition increased fawn:adult female ratios
   by 0.15 +/- 0.12 fawns:adult female at low-medium density and 0.44 +/-
   0.17 fawns:adult female at high density. Growth rate of fawns was not
   affected by deer density under natural or enhanced nutrition (P > 0.17)
   but increased 0.03 +/- 0.01 kg/day in enhanced-nutrition enclosures
   compared to natural nutrition (P < 0.01). Growth rate of yearlings was
   unaffected (P > 0.71) by deer density, but growth rate increased for
   males in some years at some density levels in enhanced-nutrition
   enclosures. Adult body mass declined in response to increasing deer
   density in natural-nutrition enclosures for both adult males (P < 0.01)
   and females (P = 0.10). Enhanced nutrition increased male body mass, but
   female mass did not increase compared to natural nutrition. Survival of
   adult males was unaffected by deer density in natural- (P = 0.59) or
   enhanced- (P = 0.94) nutrition enclosures. Survival of adult females was
   greatest in medium-density enclosures with natural nutrition but similar
   at low and high density (P = 0.04). Enhanced nutrition increased
   survival of females (P < 0.01) and marginally for males (P = 0.11).
   Survival of fawns 6-14 months old was unaffected (P > 0.35) by density
   in either natural- or enhanced-nutrition treatments but was greater (P =
   0.04) under enhanced nutrition. Population growth rate declined (P =
   0.06) with increasing density in natural-nutrition enclosures but not (P
   = 0.55) in enhanced nutrition. Enhanced nutrition increased lambda(APP)
   by 0.32. Under natural nutrition, we found only minor effects of deer
   density treatments on deer diet composition, nutritional intake, and
   plant communities. However, we found density-dependent effects on
   fawn:adult female ratios, adult body mass, and population growth rate.
   In a follow-up study, deer home ranges in our research enclosures
   declined with increasing deer density. We hypothesized that habitat
   quality varied among home ranges and contributed to density-dependent
   responses. Variable precipitation had a greater influence on deer diets,
   vegetation composition, and population parameters than did deer density.
   Also, resistance to herbivory and low forage quality of the thornshrub
   vegetation of our study sites likely constrained density-dependent
   behavior by deer. We posit that it is unlikely that, at our high-density
   (50 deer/km(2)) and perhaps even medium-density (31 deer/km(2)) levels,
   negative density dependence would occur without several wet years in
   close association. In the past century, this phenomenon has only
   happened once (1970s). Thus, density dependence would likely be
   difficult to detect in most years under natural nutrition in this
   region. Foraging by deer with enhanced nutrition did not result in a
   reduction in preferred plants in the vegetation community and had a
   protective effect on preferred forbs because <= 53\% of deer diets
   consisted of vegetation. However, enhanced nutrition improved fitness of
   individual deer and deer populations, clearly demonstrating that
   nutrition is limiting for deer populations under natural conditions in
   western South Texas. (c) 2019 The Authors. Wildlife Monographs published

Title = {Modeling Elk Nutrition and Habitat Use in Western Oregon and Washington},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {199},

Abstract = {Studies of habitat selection and use by wildlife, especially large
   herbivores, are foundational for understanding their ecology and
   management, especially if predictors of use represent habitat
   requirements that can be related to demography or fitness. Many ungulate
   species serve societal needs as game animals or subsistence foods, and
   also can affect native vegetation and agricultural crops because of
   their large body size, diet choices, and widespread distributions.
   Understanding nutritional resources and habitat use of large herbivores
   like elk (Cervus canadensis) can benefit their management across
   different land ownerships and management regimes. Distributions of elk
   in much of the western United States have shifted from public to private
   lands, leading to reduced hunting and viewing opportunities on the
   former and increased crop damage and other undesired effects on the
   latter. These shifts may be caused by increasing human disturbance
   (e.g., roads and traffic) and declines of early-seral vegetation, which
   provides abundant forage for elk and other wildlife on public lands.
   Managers can benefit from tools that predict how nutritional resources,
   other environmental characteristics, elk productivity and performance,
   and elk distributions respond to management actions. We present a
   large-scale effort to develop regional elk nutrition and habitat-use
   models for summer ranges spanning 11 million ha in western Oregon and
   Washington, USA (hereafter Westside). We chose summer because
   nutritional limitations on elk condition (e.g., body fat levels) and
   reproduction in this season are evident across much of the western
   United States. Our overarching hypothesis was that elk habitat use
   during summer is driven by a suite of interacting covariates related to
   energy balance: acquisition (e.g., nutritional resources, juxtaposition
   of cover and foraging areas), and loss (e.g., proximity to open roads,
   topography). We predicted that female elk consistently select areas of
   higher summer nutrition, resulting in better animal performance in more
   nutritionally rich landscapes. We also predicted that factors of human
   disturbance, vegetation, and topography would affect elk use of
   landscapes and available nutrition during summer, and specifically
   predicted that elk would avoid open roads and areas far from
   cover-forage edges because of their preference for foraging sites with
   secure patches of cover nearby. Our work had 2 primary objectives: 1) to
   develop and evaluate a nutrition model that estimates regional
   nutritional conditions for elk on summer ranges, using predictors that
   reflect elk nutritional ecology; and 2) to develop a summer habitat-use
   model that integrates the nutrition model predictions with other
   covariates to estimate relative probability of use by elk, accounting
   for ecological processes that drive use. To meet our objectives, we used
   25 previously collected data sets on elk nutrition, performance, and
   distributions from 12 study areas. We demonstrated the management
   utility of our regional-scale models via application in 2 landscapes in
   Washington.
   The elk nutrition model predicts levels of digestible energy in elk
   diets (DDE; kcal DE/g of consumed forage) during summer. Model input
   data were from foraging experiments using captive female elk and field
   measurements of site characteristics at fine scales (similar to 0.5 ha).
   The nutrition model included a set of equations that predicted forage
   biomass as a function of site characteristics and a second set that
   predicted DDE primarily as a function of forage biomass. We used the
   nutrition model to develop a DDE map across the Westside. We then
   evaluated performance of the model by comparing predicted DDE to
   nutritional resource selection by elk and to population-level estimates
   of autumn body fat and pregnancy rates of lactating elk. To model elk
   habitat use, we compiled 13 unique telemetry data sets from female elk
   (n = 173) in 7 study areas (data collected June-August 1991-2009). We
   used a generalized linear model with 5 of the data sets, coupled with
   ecologically relevant covariates characterizing nutrition, human
   disturbance, vegetation, and physical conditions, to estimate intensity
   of use with the negative binomial model. We evaluated model performance
   by mapping predicted habitat use with the regional model and comparing
   predictions with counts of elk locations using 8 independent telemetry
   data sets.
   The nutrition model explained a reasonably high amount of variation in
   forage biomass (r(2) = 0.46-0.72) and included covariates of overstory
   canopy cover, proportion of hardwoods in the canopy, potential natural
   vegetation (PNV) zone, and study area. Dietary DE equations in the model
   explained about 50\% of the variation in DDE(r(2) = 0.39-0.57) as a
   function of forage biomass by PNV zone and study area. Broad-scale
   application of the nutrition model in the Westside region illustrated
   the predominance of landscapes that failed to meet nutritional needs of
   lactating females(<= 2.58 kcal/g) and their calves, especially at
   moderate elevations in closed-canopy forests in both the Coast Range and
   the southern Cascades. Areas providing DDE at (>2.58-2.75 kcal/g) or in
   excess (>2.75 kcal/g) of the basic requirement of lactating females were
   uncommon (<15\% of area) or rare (<5\% of area), respectively, and
   primarily occurred in early-seral communities, particularly at higher
   elevations. Wild elk avoided areas with DDE below basic requirement and
   selected for areas with DDE >2.60 kcal/g. Percentage of elk ranges
   providing DDE levels near or above basic requirement was highly
   correlated with pregnancy rates of lactating females. Autumn body fat
   levels were highly correlated with percentage of elk ranges providing
   DDE levels above basic requirement.
   The regional model of elk habitat use with greatest support in the
   empirical data included 4 covariates: DDE, distance to nearest road open
   to motorized use by the public, distance to cover-forage edge, and
   slope. Elk preferred habitats that were relatively high in DDE, far from
   roads, close to cover-forage edges, and on gentle slopes. Based on
   standardized coefficients, changes in slope (-0.949) were most important
   in predicting habitat use, followed by DDE (0.656), distance to edge
   (-0.305), and distance to open road (0.300). Use ratios for the regional
   model indicated these changes in relative probability of use by elk: a
   111.2\% increase in use for each 0.1-unit increase in DDE; a 22.7\%
   increase in use for each kilometer away from an open road; an 8.1\%
   decrease in use for each 100-m increase in distance to edge; and a 5.3\%
   decrease in use for each percent increase in slope. The regional model
   validated well overall, with high correlation between predicted use and
   observed values for the 4 Washington sites (r(s) >= 0.96) but lower
   correlation in southwestern Oregon sites (r(s) = 0.32-0.87).
   Our results demonstrated that nutrition data collected at fine scales
   with captive elk can be used to predict nutritional resources at large
   scales, and that these predictions directly relate to habitat use and
   performance of free-ranging elk across the Westside region. These
   results also highlight the importance of including summer nutrition in
   habitat evaluation and landscape planning for Westside elk. The models
   can inform management strategies to achieve objectives for elk across
   land ownerships. The regional model provides a useful tool to understand
   and document spatially explicit habitat requirements and distributions
   of elk in current or future landscapes. The 2 examples of management
   application demonstrated how effects of management on elk nutrition and
   habitat use can be evaluated at landscape scales, and in turn how animal
   performance and distribution are affected. Results further illustrated
   the importance of managing for nutrition in combination with other
   covariates (i.e., roads, slope, cover-forage edges) that affect elk use
   of nutritional resources to achieve desired distributions of elk. Our
   meta-analysis approach to habitat modeling provides a useful framework
   for research and management of wildlife species with coarse-scale
   habitat requirements by identifying commonalities in habitat-use
   patterns that are robust across multiple modeling areas and a large
   geographic range. Use of such methods in future modeling, including
   application in monitoring programs and adaptive management, will
   continue to advance ecological knowledge and management of wildlife
   species like elk. (C) 2018 The Authors. Wildlife Monographs published by

Title = {MAMMALIAN DIVERSITY AND MATSES ETHNOMAMMALOGY IN AMAZONIAN PERU PART 4:
   BATS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {451},
Pages = {1-199},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {In this report, the fourth of our monographic series on mammalian
   diversity and Matses ethnomammalogy in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial
   region of northeastern Peru, we document the occurrence of 98 species of
   bats, including 11 emballonurids, 2 noctilionids, 66 phyllostomids, 1
   furipterid, 4 thyropterids, 7 vespertilionids, and 7 molossids. New
   species based on specimens collected in this region (Peropteryx
   pallidoptera, Micronycteris matses, Hsunycteris dashe, Sturnira giannae,
   and Thyroptera wynneae) have already been described elsewhere, but
   noteworthy distributional and taxonomic results newly reported here
   include the first specimen of Diclidurus isabella from Peru and the
   diagnosis of Glossophaga bakeri as a species distinct from G.
   commissarisi. Lists of examined voucher specimens, identification
   criteria, essential taxonomic references, and summaries of natural
   history observations are provided for all species. Original natural
   history information reported herein includes numerous observations of
   roosting behavior obtained by indigenous Matses collaborators.
   We assess the Yavari-Ucayali bat inventory for completeness and conclude
   that more species remain to be discovered in the region, where as many
   as 116 species might be expected. Most of the ``missing{''} species
   (those expected based on geographic criteria but not actually observed)
   are aerial insectivores, a guild that is notoriously difficult to sample
   by mistnetting. Of the 98 species in the observed regional fauna, only
   71 are known to occur sympatrically at Jenaro Herrera, by far the
   best-sampled locality between the Yavari and Ucayali rivers. Faunal
   comparisons with extralimital inventories (e.g., from Brazil, Ecuador,
   and French Guiana) suggest that frugivorous bats are substantially more
   speciose in western Amazonia than in eastern Amazonia, a result that is
   consistent with previous suggestions of an east-to-west gradient in the
   trophic structure of Amazonian mammal faunas.
   As previously reported, the Matses have only a single name for
   ``bat,{''} but they recognize the existence of many unnamed local
   species, which they distinguish on the basis of morphology and behavior.
   However, by contrast with the well-documented accuracy of Matses
   observations about primates and other game species, recorded Matses
   monologs about bat natural history contain numerous factual errors and
   ambiguities. Linguistic underdifferentiation of bat diversity and
   inaccurate natural history knowledge are both explained by cultural
   inattention to small, inedible, and inoffensive nocturnal fauna.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2020},
Number = {443},

Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Although studies of anuran hand and foot musculature began in the first
   half of the 19th century, all studies to date have been taxonomically or
   anatomically restricted in scope, and none has considered the diversity
   of autopodial myology in Anura as a whole. As a model for future
   comparisons, we thoroughly describe the hand and foot musculature of an
   arboreal species (the hylid Triprion petasatus), define the layers in
   which these muscles are arranged, and attribute presumed functions. On
   the basis of our myological analysis of 155 species representing 46 of
   the 54 currently recognized families and main clades of anurans, we
   describe 20 characters related to hand and foot muscles. Optimization of
   these characters on the most recent and inclusive phylogenetic
   hypothesis of Anura results in synapomorphies for several major clades
   (Bombinatoridae, Alytidae, Xenoanura + Acosmanura, Xenoanura, Pipidae,
   Acosmanura, Anomocoela, Scaphiopodidae, Pelodytidae + Pelobatidae +
   Megophryidae, Megophryidae, Neobatrachia, Heleophrynidae, Sooglossidae,
   Laurentobatrachia, Calyptocephalellidae, Myobatrachoidea, and
   Nobleobatrachia), including new, nonhomoplastic synapomorphies for
   clades previously supported only by molecular evidence and a few
   conflicting phenotypic characters (e.g., Acosmanura, Anomocoela,
   Neobatrachia). Additionally, we (1) address controversies regarding the
   homology of anuran and caudate muscles in the context of putative
   synapomorphies for Ascaphidae + Leiopelmatidae and its sister Glade
   Lalagobatrachia; (2) evaluate a recently proposed terminology for anuran
   hand and foot musculature; (3) discuss the identities of several hand
   and foot muscles with problematic homologies; (4) establish a unified
   terminology for anuran hand and foot muscles, including a list of
   synonyms for all names employed in the literature; and (5) propose
   hypotheses for the origin of several myological novelties (neomorphs).},

Title = {LATE QUATERNARY FOSSIL MAMMALS FROM THE CAYMAN ISLANDS, WEST INDIES},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {428},
Pages = {1-79},

Abstract = {Abundant fossils of nesophontid lipotyphlan insectivores and capromyid
   rodents have been collected from late Quaternary deposits on the Cayman
   Islands, an island group separated by a major marine barrier from other
   Caribbean landmasses and isolated from anthropogenic impacts until the
   arrival of Columbus in 1503 CE. These collections have not previously
   been formally described. Using morphological and ancient DNA approaches,
   we document three new taxa of extinct endemic terrestrial mammals from
   this island group: Nesophontes hemicingulus (Grand Cayman and Cayman
   Brac), Capromys pilorides lewisi (Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and
   Cayman Brac), and Geocapromys caymanensis (Grand Cayman and Cayman
   Brac). Morphometric comparisons with other extinct and living West
   Indian mammals indicate that the biogeographic origins of all three new
   taxa are from source populations on Cuba. Ancient DNA data indicate very
   low sequence divergence of Capromys pilorides lewisi from mainland Cuban
   C. pilorides (only 0.5\% across the entire mitogenome). Using
   probabilistic analysis of existing and new radiometric dates, we
   calculate an estimated extinction date of 1700 CE (95\% confidence
   interval = 1632-1774 CE) for the Cayman Brac Capromys population. This
   result suggests that at least one endemic Cayman terrestrial mammal
   population survived for well over a century following first European
   arrival in the Cayman Islands. The West Indies lost nearly all its
   species-rich late Quaternary land mammal fauna during the late Holocene
   due to direct or indirect human impacts, and this study provides a new
   baseline to understand the magnitude of human-caused mammal extinctions
   during the recent past.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {431},

Abstract = {We provide a general compilation of the diversity and geographical
   distribution of Amazonian fishes, updated to the end of 2018. Our
   database includes documented distributions of 4214 species (both
   Amazonian and from surrounding basins), compiled from published
   information plus original data from ichthyological collections. Our
   results show that the Amazon basin comprises the most diverse regional
   assemblage of freshwater fishes in the world, with 2716 valid species
   (1696 of which are endemic) representing 529 genera, 60 families, and 18
   orders. These data permit a view of the diversity and distribution of
   Amazonian fishes on a basinwide scale, which in turn allows the
   identification of congruent biogeographical patterns, here defined as
   the overlapping distributions of two or more lineages (species or
   monophyletic groups). We recognize 20 distinct distributional patterns
   of Amazonian fishes, which are herein individually delimited, named, and
   diagnosed. Not all these patterns are associated with identifiable
   geographical barriers, and some may result from ecological constraints.
   All the major Amazonian subdrainages fit into more than one
   biogeographical pattern. This fact reveals the complex history of
   hydrographical basins and shows that modern basin-defined units
   contribute relatively little as explanatory factors for the present
   distributions of Amazonian fishes. An understanding of geomorphological
   processes and associated paleographic landscape changes provides a far
   better background for interpreting observed patterns. Our results are
   expected to provide a framework for future studies on the
   diversification and historical biogeography of the Amazonian aquatic
   biota.},

Abstract = {Based on 372 specimens examined, we integrated information from two
   mitochondrial and four nuclear gene sequences, morphological comparisons
   and morphometric analyses, as well as distributional patterns and
   ecological occurrences to revise the Eliurus tanala species group
   (Nesomyinae), a rodent complex endemic to Madagascar's forests. These
   evidentiary sources generally proved concordant, supporting description
   of a new species, E. tsingimbato, indigenous to western dry deciduous
   forest, mostly associated with limestone karst (tsingy); the two other
   members of this species group, E. ellermani and E. tanala, are
   restricted to eastern montane humid forest. Phylogenetic relationships
   among the three species were poorly resolved, suggesting that their
   speciation was both recent and rapid. We encountered one instance of
   conflict between mitochondrial DNA and all other data sources, which we
   interpret as incomplete lineage sorting involving a population of the
   new western species. Attention was focused on molecular and morphometric
   discrimination of the E. tanala and E. antsingy groups where their
   species distributions overlap in limestone-associated forests of western
   and northern Madagascar. Phyletic divisions demonstrated within the E.
   tanala species group are discussed apropos of current models of
   speciation identified for Malagasy forest-welling organisms.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The North American vinegaroon, Mastigoproctus giganteus (Lucas, 1835),
   is demonstrated to comprise a complex of range-restricted species rather
   than a single widespread polymorphic species. Seven species are
   recognized based on morphological characters of the adult males,
   including the arrangement of spines on the prodorsal margin of the
   pedipalp trochanter, the position of the epis-toma on the carapace, the
   presence of a stridulatory organ on opposing surfaces of the chelicerae
   and the pedipalp coxa, the presence of a patch of setae on sternite V,
   and the shape and macrosculpture of the retrolateral surface of the
   pedipalp femur. The two currently recognized subspecies are elevated to
   species: Mastigoproctus mexicanus (Butler, 1872), stat. nov., and
   Mastigoproctus scabrosus (Pocock, 1902), stat. nov. Mastigoproctus
   floridanus (Lonnberg, 1897) is revalidated from synonymy with M.
   giganteus. Redescriptions of M. giganteus and the other three species,
   based on both sexes, are provided, and three new species described:
   Mastigoproctus cinteotl, sp. nov., from Tamaulipas, Mexico;
   Mastigoproctus tohono, sp. nov., from Arizona and Sonora, Mexico;
   Mastigoproctus vande-venderi, sp. nov., from Sonora, Mexico. The present
   contribution raises the diversity of the Order Thelyphonida Latreille,
   1804, in North America from one species to seven. Three species occur in
   the United States (one each in Arizona, Texas, and Florida), six species
   occur in Mexico, and two species occur in both countries.},

Title = {The Catastrophic Decline of Tortoises at a Fenced Natural Area},

Abstract = {Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), a threatened species of
   the southwestern United States, has severely declined to the point where
   76\% of populations in critical habitat (Tortoise Conservation Areas)
   are below viability. The potential for rapid recovery of wild
   populations is low because females require 12-20 years to reach
   reproductive maturity and produce few eggs annually. We report on a
   34-year mark-recapture study of tortoises initiated in 1979 at the
   Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area in the western Mojave Desert,
   California, USA, and provide substantive data on challenges faced by the
   species. In 1980, the United States Congress designated the Research
   Natural Area and protected the land from recreational vehicles,
   livestock grazing, and mining with a wildlife-permeable fence. The
   7.77-km(2)study area, centered on interpretive facilities, included land
   both within the Natural Area and outside the fence. We expected greater
   benefits to accrue to the tortoises and habitat inside compared to
   outside. Our objectives were to conduct a demographic study, analyze and
   model changes in the tortoise population and habitat, and compare the
   effectiveness of fencing to protect populations and habitat inside the
   fence versus outside, where populations and habitat were unprotected. We
   conducted surveys in spring in each of 7 survey years from 1979, when
   the fence was under construction, through 2012. We compared populations
   inside to those outside the fence by survey year for changes in
   distribution, structure by size and relative age, sex ratios, death
   rates of adults, and causes of death for all sizes of tortoises. We used
   a Bayesian implementation of a Jolly Seber model for mark-recapture
   data. We modeled detection, density, growth and transition of tortoises
   to larger size-age classes, movements from inside the protective fence
   to outside and vice versa, and survival. After the second and subsequent
   survey years, we added surveys to monitor vegetation and habitat
   changes, conduct health assessments, and collect data on counts of
   predators and predator sign. At the beginning of the study, counts and
   densities for all sizes of tortoises were high, but densities were
   approximately 24\% higher inside the fence than outside. By 2002, the
   low point in densities, densities had declined 90\% inside the fence and
   95\% outside. Between 2002 and 2012, the population inside the fence
   showed signs of improving with a 54\% increase in density. Outside the
   fence, densities remained low. At the end of the study, when we
   considered the initial differences in location, densities inside the
   fence were roughly 2.5 times higher than outside. The pattern of
   densities was similar for male and female adults. When evaluating
   survival by blocks of years, survivorship was higher in 1979-1989 than
   in 1989-2002 (the low point) and highest from 2002 to 2012. Recruitment
   and survival of adult females into the population was important for
   growing the population, but survival of all sizes, including juveniles,
   was also critical. Major events and activities driving the decline in
   populations both inside and outside the fence included illegal
   collecting, upper respiratory tract disease, and hyperpredation by the
   common raven (Corvus corax) on juvenile tortoises. Other sources of
   death were gunshots, vehicles, and predation by mammals. Outside the
   fence, fragmentation and deterioration of habitat was a critical driver.
   Between the first and last surveys, 2 different ecosystem processes were
   underway: recovery of vegetation and soils from grazing and vehicles
   inside the fence and continued deterioration outside the fence. Habitat
   outside the fence became increasingly denuded of shrubs and fragmented
   by roads and trails, and habitat fragments increased 50-fold. Outside
   the fence, biomass of non-native annual plants was higher and the cover
   of shrubs was lower, a reflection of ongoing deterioration. These
   changes and losses of habitat resulted in loss of shrub cover and sites
   for burrows, reduction in preferred food plants, and greater exposure to
   predators and extremes in temperature. Overall, the tortoise population
   and habitat inside the fence appeared to benefit from protection and
   showed signs of recovery at the end of the study. Fencing, control of
   vehicular access, and removal of livestock grazing were among several
   recommended management actions for critical habitat in the first
   recovery plan in 1994. At the end of the study, the Natural Area
   remained as 1 of 2 fenced, official protected areas for the species in
   the geographic range. We attribute fencing to continuing higher
   densities of adults inside the fence compared with outside the fence and
   promising signs of recovery. Densities of adults at the Natural Area
   also were 2.3 to 5.5 times higher than in 16 of the 17 Tortoise
   Conservation Areas (critical habitat units) within the geographic range.

Title = {EVOLUTION IN THE GENUS RHINELLA: A TOTAL EVIDENCE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
   OF NEOTROPICAL TRUE TOADS (ANURA: BUFONIDAE)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {True toads of the genus Rhinella are among the most common and diverse
   group of Neotropical anurans. These toads are widely distributed
   throughout South America, inhabiting a great diversity of environments
   and ecoregions. Currently, however, the genus is defined solely on the
   basis of molecular characters, and it lacks a proper diagnosis. Although
   some phenetic species groups have traditionally been recognized within
   Rhinella, the monophyly of some of them have been rejected in previous
   phylogenetic analyses, and many species remain unassigned to these
   poorly defined groups. Additionally, the identity and taxonomy of
   several species are problematic and hinder the specific recognition and
   description of undescribed taxa. In this work, we first perform
   phylogenetic analyses of separate mitochondrial and nuclear datasets to
   test the possible occurrence of hybridization and/or genetic
   introgression in the genus. The comparative analysis of both datasets
   revealed unidirectional mitochondrial introgressions of an unknown
   parental species into R. horribilis ({''}ghost introgression{''}) and of
   R. dorbignyi into R. bernardoi; therefore, the mitochondrial and nuclear
   datasets of these species were considered separately in subsequent
   analyses. We performed total-evidence phylogenetic analyses that
   included revised molecular (four mitochondrial and five nuclear genes)
   and phenotypic (90 characters) datasets for 83 nominal species of
   Rhinella, plus several undescribed and problematic species and multiple
   outgroups. Results demonstrate that Rhinella was nonmonophyletic due to
   the position of R. ceratophrys, which was recovered as the sister taxon
   of Rhaebo nasicus with strong support. Among our outgroups, the strongly
   supported Anaxyrus + Incilius is the sister clade of all other species
   of Rhinella. Once R. ceratophrys is excluded, the genus Rhinella is
   monophyletic, well supported, and composed of two major clades. One of
   these is moderately supported and includes species of the former R.
   spinulosa Group (including R. gallardoi); the monophyletic R. granulosa,
   R. crucifer, and R. marina Groups; and a clade composed of the
   mitochondrial sequences of R. horribilis. The other major clade is
   strongly supported and composed of all the species from the
   non-monophyletic R. veraguensis and R. margaritifera Groups, the former
   R. acrolopha Group, and R. sternosignata. Consistent with these results,
   we define eight species groups of Rhinella that are mostly diagnosed by
   phenotypic synapomorphies in addition to a combination of morphological
   character states. Rhinella sternosignata is the only species that
   remains unassigned to any group. We also synonymize nine species, treat
   three former subspecies as full species, and suggest that 15 lineages
   represent putative undescribed species. Lastly, we discuss the
   apparently frequent occurrence of hybridization, deep mitochondrial
   divergence, and ``ghost introgression{''}; the incomplete phenotypic
   evidence (including putative character systems that could be used for
   future phylogenetic analyses); and the validity of the known fossil
   record of Rhinella as a source of calibration points for divergence
   dating analyses.},

Abstract = {Six new genera of Australian Phylinae are described on the basis of
   existing collections. The tribe Exaeretini-represented by the two new
   genera Eucalyptophylus (two new species) and Melaleucaphylus (18 new
   species)-is recognized for the first time as occurring in Australia.
   Nine new taxa of Semiini, subtribe Exocarpocorina, are proposed: Four
   new genera, Calytriphylus, Melaleucacoris, Teddus (each monotypic), and
   Leptospermia (two new species), and four new species placed in
   Ancoraphylus Weirauch, 2007 (one species), Xiphoidelhis Weirauch and
   Schuh, 2011 (one species), and Xiphoides Eyles and Schuh, 2003 (two
   species). Based on specimen data almost all the new taxa are associated
   with Myrtaceae plant hosts in the tribes Chamelaucieae, Eucalypteae,
   Leptospermeae, and Melaleuceae. A new species of Restiophylus Leon and
   Weirauch, 2016, taken in coastal New South Wales and perhaps associated
   with Leptocarpus tenax (Restionaceae), represents the first record for
   this genus beyond the southwest coast of Western Australia.
   Documentation is provided in the form of diagnoses and descriptions of
   all genera and species, color habitus images of males (and females when
   available) of all species, distributional maps, color images of male
   genitalic structures of all species, female genitalic structures in most
   species, and scanning electron micrographs of representative morphology
   of some taxa. Host-plant information is provided for most species, along
   with representative images of hosts and habitats. New distribution
   records for Xiphoidellus dumosus Weirauch and Schuh, 2011, and scanning
   micrographs of the pretarsus for Scholtzicoris linnavuorii Schuh, 2016

Abstract = {Two species of scaphitid ammonites (Arnmonoidea: Ancyloceratina) from
   the Upper Cretaceous (lower Maastrichtian) of the Western Interior of
   North America are described. Hoploscaphites racer, n. sp., is medium

   body chamber, and closely spaced ventrolateral tubercles. It occurs in
   the upper part of the Baculites baculus Zone and lower part of the
   overlying B. grandis Zone in the Pierre Shale in Montana, Wyoming, and
   Colorado, and in the Bearpaw Shale in Montana. Hoploscaphites
   crip-tonodosus (Riccardi, 1983) is larger and more coarsely ornamented,
   including one or two rows of lateral tubercles on the flanks of the
   phragmocone. It occurs in the upper part of the Baculites baculus Zone
   and overlying B. grandis Zone in the Pierre Shale in Montana, Wyoming,
   Colorado, and possibly South Dakota, and in the Bearpaw Shale in Montana

Abstract = {The current literature on marsupial phylogenetics includes numerous
   studies based on analyses of morphological data with limited sampling of
   Recent and fossil taxa, and many studies based on analyses of molecular
   data with dense sampling of Recent taxa, but few studies have combined
   both data types. Another dichotomy in the marsupial phylogenetic
   literature is between studies focused on New World taxa and those
   focused on Sahulian taxa. To date, there has been no attempt to assess
   the phylogenetic relationships of the global marsupial fauna based on
   combined analyses of morphology and molecular sequences for a dense
   sampling of Recent and fossil taxa. For this report, we compiled
   morphological and molecular data from an unprecedented number of Recent
   and fossil marsupials. Our morphological data consist of 180
   craniodental characters that we scored for 97 terminals representing
   every currently recognized Recent genus, 42 additional ingroup
   (crown-clade marsupial) terminals represented by well-preserved fossils,
   and 5 outgroups (nonmarsupial metatherians). Our molecular data comprise
   24.5 kb of DNA sequences from whole-mitochondrial genomes and six
   nuclear loci (APOB, BRCA1, GHR, RAG1, RBP3 and VWF) for 97 marsupial
   terminals (the same Recent taxa scored for craniodental morphology) and
   several placental and monotreme outgroups. The results of separate and
   combined analyses of these data using a wide range of phylogenetic
   methods support many currently accepted hypotheses of ingroup
   (marsupial) relationships, but they also underscore the difficulty of
   placing fossils with key missing data (e.g., dagger Evolestes), and the
   unique difficulty of placing others that exhibit mosaics of
   plesiomorphic and autapomorphic traits (e.g., +Yalkaparidon). Unique
   contributions of our study are (1) critical discussions and
   illustrations of marsupial craniodental morphology including features
   never previously coded for phylogenetic analysis; (2) critical
   assessments of relative support for many suprageneric clades; (3)
   estimates of divergence times derived from tip-and-node dating based on
   uniquely taxon-dense analyses; and (4) a revised, higher-order
   classification of marsupials accompanied by lists of supporting
   craniodental synapomorphies. Far from the last word on these topics,
   this report lays the foundation for future research that may be enabled
   by the discovery of new fossil taxa, better-preserved material of
   previously described taxa, novel morphological characters (e.g., from
   the postcranium), and improved methods of phylogenetic analysis.},

Abstract = {The origin of flight in birds and its relationship to bird origins
   itself has achieved something of a renaissance in recent years, driven
   by the discovery of a suite of small-bodied taxa with large pennaceous
   feathers. As some of these specimens date back to the Middle Jurassic
   and predate the earliest known birds, understanding how these potential
   aerofoil surfaces were used is of great importance to answering the
   question: which came first, the bird or the wing? Here we seek to
   address this question by directly comparing key members of three of the
   major clades of paravians: anchiornithines, Microraptor and
   Archaeopteryx across their known size classes to see how they differ in
   terms of major flight-related parameters (wing loading; disc loading;
   specific lift; glide speed; takeoff potential). Using specimens with
   snout to vent length (SVL) ranging from around 150 mm to 400 mm and mass
   ranging from approximately 130 g to 2 kg, we investigated patterns of
   inter- and intraspecific changes in flight potential. We find that
   anchiornithines show much higher wing- and discloading values and
   correspondingly high required minimum glide and takeoff speeds, along
   with lower specific lift and flapping running outputs suggesting little
   to no flight capability in this clade. In contrast, we see good support
   for flight potential, either gliding or powered flight, for all size
   classes of both Microraptor and Archaeopteryx, though there are
   differing patterns of how this shifts ontogenetically. These findings,
   coupled with previous findings of a lack of wing-based locomotion in
   early-diverging troodontids or dromaeosaurids, suggest that flight was
   not a synapomorphy of Paraves. This supports the contention that flight
   capacity and potentially powered flight itself arose convergently in at
   least two distinct paravian lineages, first in birds minimally 150
   million years ago, then in the microraptorines 20-30 million years
   later. Our work indicates that the origin of flight among paravians was
   likely a more complex phenomenon than previously appreciated.},

Abstract = {The spider family Tetragnathidae Menge is a cosmopolitan, relatively
   well-studied spider clade with some members readily identifiable by
   their elongate chelicerae and/or their horizontal orb webs. It has four
   recognized subfamilies-Tetragnathinae, Metainae, Leucauginae, and the
   Australasian endemic Nanometinae-although many genera remain unassigned
   to subfamilial groups. Nanometinae alpha taxonomy is the least well
   understood of these lineages despite the inclusion of members of the
   subfamily in a number of phylogenetic analyses over the past decade.
   Here we describe 10 new species and revise seven additional
   tetragnathids from Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Papua New
   Guinea in the genera Nanometa, Taraire, gen. nov., Tawhai, gen. nov.,
   Harlanethis, gen. nov., and Iamarra, gen. nov. These 17 species are:
   Nanometa gentilis Simon, 1908, N. trivittata (Keyserling, 1887), comb.
   nov., N. sarasini (Berland, 1924), comb. nov., N. lagenifera (Urquhart,
   1888), comb. nov., N. purpurapunctata (Urquhart, 1889), comb. nov., N.
   fea, sp. nov., N. tasmaniensis, sp. nov., N. tetracaena, sp. nov., N.
   dimitrovi, sp. nov., N. dutrorum, sp. nov., N. forsteri, sp. nov.,
   Taraire rufolineata (Urquhart, 1889), comb. nov., Taraire oculta, sp.
   nov., Tawhai arborea (Urquhart, 1891), comb. nov., Harlanethis
   lipscombae, sp. nov., H. weintrauborum, sp. nov., and Iamarra
   multitheca, sp. nov. We also synonymize Nediphya Marusik and Omelko,
   2017, and the monotypic genus Eryciniolia Strand, 1912, with Nanometa,
   bringing the total number of species in the genus from one to 14. Using
   an expanded taxon sampling for prior studies based on six molecular
   markers-12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I, and histone H3-and both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   methods, we place these taxa in the tetragnathid tree of life.
   Nanometinae and its constituent genera Nanometa and Pinkfloydia are
   reciprocally monophyletic. Harlanethis belongs to Leucauginae. The
   genera Taraire, Tawhai, and Iamarra defy robust phylogenetic placement
   and are not yet assigned to subfamily.},

Title = {Behavioral and Demographic Responses of Mule Deer to Energy Development
   on Winter Range},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat modification is a major driver of global
   biodiversity loss. In North America, one of the primary sources of
   habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for
   and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which
   has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife
   species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has
   become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation
   practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties
   involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population
   responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development
   predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these
   responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant
   assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to
   gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective
   mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and
   behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas
   development on winter range in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, USA, from
   2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined
   from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity
   (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule
   deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels
   of hydrocarbon development within the Piceance Basin.
   We assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development
   features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining
   habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule
   deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological
   effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and
   overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, December fawn mass,
   adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal
   counts, and lactation rates in December between the 2 study areas.
   Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were
   apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development
   during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for
   foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat
   presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree.
   Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more
   well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these
   areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in
   use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the
   phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human
   presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite
   divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development
   on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any
   of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population
   level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher
   in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations
   did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs
   measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below
   winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density
   between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our
   study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in
   habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival;
   however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these
   mechanisms.
   Given our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high
   densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly
   lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient
   vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are
   below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling
   phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this
   activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were
   directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced
   footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral
   responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation
   efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic,
   light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that
   attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final
   development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system,
   minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning
   would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria).
   Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments
   of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of
   how wildlife respond to habitat modification. (c) 2021 The Wildlife

Abstract = {We describe three species of large scaphitid ammonites (Ammonoidca:
   Ancyloccratina) from the Upper Cretaceous (upper Campanian-lower
   Maastrichtian) of the Western Interior of North America. Each species
   occurs as two dimorphs, referred to as macroconch and microconch. All
   three species share a similar pattern of ornamentation consisting of
   long, thin, nonbifurcating ribs on the adoral part of the phragmocone,
   suggesting that they constitute a single monophyletic Glade. Macroconchs
   of Hoploscaphites crassus (Coryell and Salmon, 1934) are characterized
   by a globose whorl section, with closely spaced ventrolateral tubercles
   on the body chamber, usually persisting to the aperture. Macroconchs of
   Hoploscaphites plenus (Meek and Hayden, 1860) differ from those of II.
   crassus in having a more subquadrate whorl section with flatter flanks,
   and fewer, larger, and more widely spaced ventrolateral tubercles.
   Macroconchs of Hoploscaphites peterseni, n. sp., closely resemble those
   of H. crassus, but differ in being nearly circular in side view with a
   more compressed whorl section. All three species lived at approximately
   the same time in the same general area and depositional environment.
   They are abundant in the Baculites baculus Zone but also occasionally
   occur in the B. eliasi Zone and possibly lower part of the B. grandis
   Zone. They are present in the Pierre Shale of east-central Montana and
   east-central Wyoming, the Lewis Shale of south-central Wyoming, and the
   Bearpaw Shale of northeast Montana. It is possible that these three
   species represent subspecies within a single species or a ``flock{''} of
   very closely related species, similar to the ``species flocks{''}
   observed in modern cichlid fishes.},

Title = {MAMMALIAN DIVERSITY AND MATSES ETHNOMAMMALOGY IN AMAZONIAN PERU PART 3:
   MARSUPIALS (DIDELPHIMORPHIA)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {This report is the third in our monographic series on mammalian
   diversity and Matses ethnomammalogy in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial
   region of northeastern Peru. Based on taxonomic analysis of specimens
   collected in the region, we document the occurrence of 19 species of
   marsupials in the genera Caluromys, Glironia, Hyladelphys, Marmosa,
   Monodelphis, Metachirus, Chironectes, Didelphis, Philander,
   Gracilinanus, and Marmosops. Our principal taxonomic results include the
   following: (1) we provide a phylogenetic analysis of previously
   unpublished mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data for Caluromys that
   supports the reciprocal monophyly of all currently recognized species in
   the genus but reveals substantial heterogeneity in one extralimital
   taxon; (2) we explain why Marmosa constantiae is the correct name for
   the southwestern Amazonian taxon previously known as Mar. demerarae, and
   we diagnose Mar. constantiae from Mar. rapposa, a superficially similar
   species from southern Peru, eastern Bolivia, and central Brazil; (3) we
   explain why Mar. rutteri is the correct name for one of the Amazonian
   species currently known as Mar. regina, and we restrict the latter name
   to the transAndean holotype; (4) we recognize Metachirus myosuros as a
   species distinct from Met. nudicaudatus based on morphological
   comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis of new mtDNA sequence data; and
   (5) we name a new species of Marmosops to honor the late
   Finnish-Peruvian naturalist Pekka Soini.
   Of the 19 marsupial species known to occur in the Yavari-Ucayali
   interfluve, 16 have been recorded in sympatry at Nuevo San Juan, the
   Matses village where we based most of our fieldwork from 1995 to 1999.
   We explain why we believe the marsupial species list from Nuevo San Juan
   to be complete (or nearly so), and we compare it with a species list
   obtained by similarly intensive fieldwork at Paracou (French Guiana).
   Although Nuevo San Juan and Paracou are 2500 km apart on opposite sides
   of Amazonia, the same opossum genera are present at both sites, the
   lists differing only in the species represented in each fauna. We
   briefly discuss current explanations for spatial turnover in species of
   terrestrial vertebrates across Amazonian landscapes and provide evidence
   that the upper Amazon is a significant dispersal barrier for marsupials.
   Marsupials are not important to the Matses in any way. In keeping with
   their cultural inattention to mammals that are inconspicuous, harmless,
   and too small to be of dietary significance, the Matses lexically
   distinguish only a few kinds of opossums, and they are not close
   observers of opossum morphology or behavior.},

Abstract = {After nearly a decade of field inventories in which we preserved voucher
   specimens of the small terrestrial mammals of Sulawesi, we combined
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of morphological traits with
   molecular phylogenetics to better understand the diversity of shrews
   (Soricidae: Crocidura) on the island. We examined the morphology of 1368
   specimens and obtained extensive molecular data from many of them,
   including mitochondrial DNA sequences from 851 specimens, up to five
   nuclear exons from 657 specimens, and thousands of ultraconserved
   elements from 90 specimens. By iteratively testing species limits using
   distinct character datasets and appropriate taxon sampling, we found
   clear, mostly consistent evidence for the existence of 21 species of
   shrews on Sulawesi, only seven of which were previously recognized. We
   divide these 21 species into five morphogroups, provide emended
   diagnoses of the seven previously named species, and describe 14 new
   species. The Long-Tailed Group contains Crocidura caudipilosa, C.
   elongata, C. microelongata, new species, and C. quasielongata, new
   species; the Rhoditis Group contains C. rhoditis, C. pseudorhoditis, new
   species, C. australis, new species, and C. pallida, new species; the
   Small-Bodied Group contains C. lea, C. levicula, C. baletei, new
   species, C. mediocris, new species, C. parva, new species, and C.
   tenebrosa, new species; the Thick-Tailed Group contains C. brevicauda,
   new species and C. caudicrassa, new species; and the Ordinary Group
   contains C. musseri, C. nigripes, C. normalis, new species, C.
   ordinaria, new species, and C. solita, new species. Documenting these
   endemic species reveals a local radiation (20 of the 21 species are
   members of an endemic clade) in which elevational gradients played a
   prominent role in either promoting speciation, or at a minimum,
   fostering the cooccurrence of phenotypically similar species. As now
   understood, the species-level diversity of Crocidura on Sulawesi is
   nearly three times the known diversity of any other insular shrew fauna.
   This study highlights the fact that if we wish to understand the true
   extent of biodiversity on Earth, large-scale, vouchered organismal
   inventories followed up with thorough examinations of genetic,
   morphological, and geographic traits are sorely needed in montane
   tropical regions, even for purportedly well-studied groups such as
   mammals.},

Abstract = {Unseen and difficult-to-see soft tissues of fossil birds revealed by
   laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF) shed light on their functional
   morphology. Here we study a well-preserved specimen of the early
   pygostylian Sapeornis chaoyangensis under LSF and use the newly observed
   soft-tissue data to refine previous modeling of its aerial performance
   and to test its proposed thermal soaring capabilities. Under LSF, the
   body's lateral outline is observed, permitting direct estimates of the
   body's disc surface that generates drag during flight (S-b). This
   surface and the body drag coefficient-which is better estimated knowing
   S-b- are influential parameters in modeling flight dynamics. In
   particular, we focus on two aspects of flight dynamics: the calculation
   of the power margin during flapping flight (power curve), and the
   sinking speed during gliding (glide polar). Results from revised models
   using our direct soft-tissue measurements support the notion that
   Sapeornis was a thermal soarer that glided for long periods. LSF also
   confirms the absence of a true alula in Sapeornis. While the deployment
   of the alular digit could have enhanced control during slow flight, the
   position of this digit along the handwing (distal part of the wing)
   suggests limited maneuverability. This study demonstrates how
   soft-tissue preservation can be incorporated into modeling of flight
   dynamics in light of ever-improving palaeontological imaging techniques.},

Title = {Effects of power lines on habitat use and demography of greater
   sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {200},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Energy development and its associated infrastructure, including power
   lines, may influence wildlife population dynamics through effects on
   survival, reproduction, and movements of individuals. These
   infrastructure impacts may be direct or indirect, the former occurring
   when development acts directly as an agent of mortality (e.g.,
   collision) and the latter when impacts occur as a by-product of other
   processes that are altered by infrastructure presence. Functional or
   numerical responses by predators to power-line corridors are indirect
   impacts that may suppress demographic rates for certain species, and
   perceived predation risk may affect animal behaviors such as habitat
   selection. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are a species
   of conservation concern across western North America that may be
   affected by power lines. Previous studies, however, have not provided
   evidence for causal mechanisms influencing demographic rates. Our
   primary objective was to assess the influence of power lines on multiple
   sage-grouse vital rates, greater sage-grouse habitat selection, and
   ultimately greater sage-grouse population dynamics. We used demographic
   and behavioral data for greater sage-grouse collected from 2003 to 2012
   in central Nevada, USA, accounting for sources of underlying
   environmental heterogeneity. We also concurrently monitored populations
   of common ravens (Corvus corax), a primary predator of sage-grouse nests
   and young. We focused primarily on a single 345kV transmission line that
   was constructed at the beginning of our study; however, we also
   determined if similar patterns were associated with other nearby,
   preexisting power lines. We found that numerous behaviors (e.g.,
   nest-site selection, brood-site selection) and demographic rates (e.g.,
   nest survival, recruitment, and population growth) were affected by
   power lines, and that these negative effects were predominantly
   explained by temporal variation in the relative abundance of common
   ravens. Specifically, in years of high common raven abundance, avoidance
   of the transmission line was extended farther from the line, re-nesting
   propensity was reduced, and nest survival was lower near the
   transmission line relative to areas more distant from the transmission
   line. Additionally, we found that before and immediately after
   construction of the transmission line, habitats near the footprint of
   the transmission line were generally more productive (e.g., greater
   reproductive success and population growth) than areas farther from the
   transmission line. However, multiple demographic rates (i.e.,
   pre-fledging chick survival, annual male survival, per capita
   recruitment, and population growth) for groups of individuals that used
   habitats near the transmission line declined to a greater extent than
   for individuals using habitats more distant in the years following
   construction of the transmission line. These decreases were correlated
   with an increase in common raven abundance. The geographical extent to
   which power lines negatively influence greater sage-grouse demographic
   processes was thus contingent on local raven abundance and behavior. In
   this system, we found that effects of power lines, depending on the
   behavior or demographic rate, extended 2.5-12.5km, which exceeds current
   recommendations for the placement of structures in areas around
   sage-grouse leks. Nests located 12.5km from the transmission line had
   0.06 to 0.14 higher probabilities of hatching in years of average to
   high levels of raven abundance, relative to nests located within 1km of
   the transmission line.
   Similarly, leks located 5km from the transmission line had 0.02 to 0.16
   higher rates of population growth (lambda) in years of average to high
   levels of raven abundance, relative to leks located within 1km of the
   transmission line. Our finding that negative impacts of the transmission
   line were associated with common raven abundance suggest that management
   actions that decouple this association between common raven abundance
   and power lines may reduce the negative indirect impacts of power lines
   on greater sage-grouse population dynamics. However, because the removal
   of common ravens or the use of perch deterrents on power lines has not
   been demonstrated to be consistently effective in reducing common raven
   predation rates on greater sage-grouse nests, we recommend preferential
   treatment to mitigation strategies that reduce the number of elevated
   structures placed within 10km of critical greater sage-grouse habitat.

Abstract = {The Coelurosauria are a group of mostly feathered theropods that gave
   rise to birds, the only dinosaurians that survived the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and are still found today. Between
   their first appearance in the Middle Jurassic up to the end Cretaceous,
   coelurosaurians were party to dramatic geographic changes on the Earth's
   surface, including the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the
   formation of the Atlantic Ocean. These plate tectonic events are thought
   to have caused vicariance or dispersal of coelurosaurian faunas,
   influencing their evolution. Unfortunately, few coelurosaurian
   biogeographic hypotheses have been supported by quantitative evidence.
   Here, we report the first, broadly sampled quantitative analysis of
   coelurosaurian biogeography using the likelihood-based package
   BioGeoBEARS. Mesozoic geographic configurations and changes are
   reconstructed and employed as constraints in this analysis, including
   their associated uncertainties. We use a comprehensive time-calibrated
   coelurosaurian evolutionary tree produced from the Theropod Working
   Group phylogenetic data matrix. Six biogeographic models in the
   BioGeoBEARS package with different assumptions about the evolution of
   spatial distributions are tested against geographic constraints. Our
   results statistically favor the DIVALIKE+J and DEC+J models, which allow
   vicariance and founder events, supporting continental vicariance as an
   important factor in coelurosaurian evolution. Ancestral range estimation
   indicates frequent dispersal events via the Apulian route (connecting
   Europe and Africa during the Early Cretaceous) and the Bering land
   bridge (connecting North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous).
   These quantitative results are consistent with commonly inferred
   Mesozoic dinosaurian dispersals and continental-fragmentationinduced
   vicariance events. In addition, we recognize the importance of Europe as
   a dispersal center and gateway in the Early Cretaceous, as well as other
   vicariance events such as those triggered by the disappearance of land
   bridges.},

Abstract = {One of the major challenges in attempting to parse the ecological
   setting for the origin of flight in Pennaraptora is determining the
   minimal fluid and solid biomechanical limits of gliding and powered
   flight present in extant forms and how these minima can be inferred from
   the fossil record. This is most evident when we consider the fact that
   the flight apparatus in extant birds is a highly integrated system with
   redundancies and safety factors to permit robust performance even if one
   or more components of their flight system are outside their optimal
   range. These subsystem outliers may be due to other adaptive roles,
   ontogenetic trajectories, or injuries that are accommodated by a robust
   flight system. This means that many metrics commonly used to evaluate
   flight ability in extant birds are likely not going to be precise in
   delineating flight style, ability, and usage when applied to
   transitional taxa. Here we build upon existing work to create a
   functional landscape for flight behavior based on extant observations.
   The functional landscape is like an evolutionary adaptive landscape in
   predicting where estimated biomechanically relevant values produce
   functional repertoires on the landscape. The landscape provides a
   quantitative evaluation of biomechanical optima, thus facilitating the
   testing of hypotheses for the origins of complex biomechanical
   functions. Here we develop this model to explore the functional
   capabilities of the earliest known avialans and their sister taxa. This
   mapping allows us to determine where they are placed on the landscape
   and how phylogenetic trends may course over the landscape. Moreover, the
   mapping develops a novel tool for assessing potential selection
   pressures and directions using the quantitative tools developed for
   adaptive landscapes. Combining these findings with previous work on the
   ontogeny of the flight stroke, especially in chukar partridges, allows
   us to test whether this widely used proxy is really suitable and whether
   we can use ontogenetic trajectories for reconstructing the evolutionary
   trajectory of the nonavialan theropod to bird transition.},

   formation crops out over an area from New Mexico and Oklahoma to Montana
   and Utah and encompasses a time span of approximately eight million
   years. Recent studies indicate a high diversity of gigantic, herbivorous
   sauropod dinosaurs, but the geographic and temporal distributions of
   species or even genera of these animals remain poorly understood. In
   particular, sauropod specimens from northern outcrops of the formation
   have rarely been studied in detail, and temporal relationships among
   sites are imprecise. Here, we reassess the taxonomic diversity of the
   sauropods from a historic Carnegie Museum locality in northern Wyoming.
   Previous referrals of material to the well-known diplodocid genera
   Apatosaurus and Diplodocus cannot be confidently confirmed; instead, all
   these specimens more likely represent elements from the recently
   recognized Galeamopus. Specimens previously assigned to Camarasaurus and
   Haplocanthosaurus could not be referred to these genera based on
   apomorphies, due to a lack of detailed knowledge concerning the genus-
   and species-level taxonomy of these sauropods. Our findings imply that
   many referrals of incomplete diplodocid skeletons to Apatosaurus and
   Diplodocus must be reassessed. These reassessments are particularly
   important with regard to specimens from northern localities of the
   Morrison Formation, as it is becoming increasingly evident that
   diplodocids from this area were distinct from better-known, more
   southerly taxa. This geographic segregation does not seem to apply to
   nondiplodocid sauropods; however, these taxa are also in need of
   systematic revision, which may reveal species-level patterns similar to
   those observed in Diplodocidae.},

Abstract = {We present the results of an inventory of small mammals in the Mayo
   River basin, one of the least-studied regions of the Central Andes in
   Peru. We conducted inventories at three locations in May 2007. We
   collected 47 species of small mammals in the study area: five
   marsupials, 31 bats, and 11 rodents. A new species of Sturnira was
   encountered and is described. The new species, which was previously
   confused with S. lilium, occurs east of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador,
   Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, the Guianas, and Brazil, with an isolated
   record on the western slope of the Andes in Peru. Additionally, we
   report the presence of Anoura geoffroyi in Peru, Carollia sp. sensu
   Solari and Baker (2006) south of the Maranon River, and extend the
   elevational range of Neacomys spinosus and Oligoryzomys destructor. Our
   results highlight the need to conduct additional inventories to increase
   our understanding of the biodiversity of this rich and increasingly
   impacted region.},

Title = {THE CREVICE WEAVER SPIDER GENUS KUKULCANIA (ARANEAE: FILISTATIDAE)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {426},
Pages = {1-151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Filistatidae is one of the most phylogenetically enigmatic spider
   groups, and the genus Kukulcania Lehtinen includes the commonest
   representatives of the family. Its type species, K. hibernalis (Hentz,
   1842), remains a favorite candidate for studies on spider phylogeny and
   comparative morphology. However, little is known about the taxonomy,
   species limits, and distribution of its closest relatives, because no
   generic revision has ever been undertaken. We present the first
   comprehensive assessment of the taxonomy of Kukulcania. The species K.
   hibernalis, K. arizonica (Chamberlin and Ivie, 1935), K. utahana
   (Chamberlin and Ivie, 1935), K. hurca (Chamberlin and Ivie, 1942), K.
   brignolii (Alayon, 1981) comb. nov. (transferred here from Filistata
   Latreille), K. tractans (O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1896), and K. geophila
   (Chamberlin and Ivie, 1935) are redescribed based on our examination of
   type material. We show that the name Filistata brevipes Keyserling,
   1883, which had previously been placed in Kukulcania, actually belongs
   to a prithine spider, and propose the new combination Pikelinia brevipes
   (Keyserling, 1883). Filistata geophila wawona Chamberlin and Ivie, 1942,
   is newly synonymized with Kukulcania geophila. Eight new species of
   Kukulcania are described: K. cochimi, sp. nov. (from Baja California),
   K. gertschi, sp. nov. (northern Mexico), K. mexicana, sp. nov. (central
   Mexico), K. santosi, sp. nov. (southern Mexico to northern South
   America; previously misidentified as K. brevipes), K. tequila, sp. nov.
   (western Mexico), K. chingona, sp. nov. (western Mexico), K. benita, sp.
   nov. (endemic to the San Benito Islands in Baja California) and K.
   bajacali, sp. nov. (Baja California). With this, the number of
   recognized species in the genus is increased to 15. All species have
   their distributions mapped and both sexes illustrated. The first
   identification key to the genus is presented. A study on the morphology
   of the genus is undertaken using light and scanning electron microscopy,
   and the phylogenetic position of Kukulcania within the Filistatinae is
   briefly discussed. A novel putative synapomorphy for the subfamily is
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Paleontological datasets often have large amounts of missing entries
   that result in multiple most parsimonious trees. Highly incomplete and
   conflictive taxa produce a collapsed strict consensus and several
   methods have been developed for identifying these unstable or rogue taxa
   in optimal trees derived from phylogenetic analyses. In addition to
   decreasing consensus resolution, incomplete or conflictive taxa can also
   severely affect the support values of phylogenetic analysis in
   paleontological datasets. Here, we explore a protocol for the
   identification of taxa that decrease jackknife support values in
   parsimony analysis. The taxa identified are excluded from majority rule
   jackknife trees, revealing nodes that have either low or high support
   irrespective of the uncertainties in the placement of unstable taxa. A
   recently published dataset of coelurosaurian relationships based on 164
   taxa and 853 characters is explored using this protocol; our protocol
   detects a total of 40 unstable taxa as the most detrimental for node
   supports. Major clades that are well supported in the reduced jackknife
   tree include Coelurosauria, Maniraptoriformes, Compsognathidae,
   Ornithomimosauria, Alvarezsauroidea, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria.
   Clades with moderate support instead include Maniraptora, Pennaraptora,
   Paraves, Dromaeosauridae, Troodontidae, Anchiornithinae, and
   early-diverging clades of Avialae.},

Abstract = {The study of early theropod flight involves avialans as well as other
   pennaraptorans. It requires the study of anatomy that is familiar to the
   modern ornithologist, but also very different and alien. Early theropod
   flight therefore necessitates study methods that can incorporate what we
   know about sophisticated powered and unpowered flight in living birds
   while being mindful of the differences between them and the earliest
   theropod flyers. In this chapter we will survey key methods and
   approaches, covering their best-practice applications along the timeline
   of early theropod flight evolution and priorities for future method
   development.},

Title = {Roles of maternal condition and predation in survival of juvenile Elk in
   Oregon},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-60},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Understanding bottom-up, top-down, and abiotic factors along with
   interactions that may influence additive or compensatory effects of
   predation on ungulate population growth has become increasingly
   important as carnivore assemblages, land management policies, and
   climate variability change across western North America. Recruitment and
   population trends of elk (Cervus canadensis) have been downward in the
   last 4 decades across the northern Rocky Mountains and Pacific
   Northwest, USA. In Oregon, changes in vegetation composition and land
   use practices occurred, cougar (Puma concolor) populations recovered
   from near-extirpation, and black bear (Ursus americanus) populations
   increased. Our goal was to provide managers with insight into the
   influence of annual climatic variation, and bottom-up and top-down
   factors affecting recruitment of elk in Oregon. We conducted our
   research in southwestern (SW; Toketee and Steamboat) and northeastern
   (NE; Wenaha and Sled Springs) Oregon, which had similar predator
   assemblages but differed in patterns of juvenile recruitment, climate,
   cougar densities, and vegetative characteristics. We obtained monthly
   temperature and precipitation measures from Parameter-elevation
   Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and estimates of
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each study area to
   assess effects of climate and vegetation growth on elk vital rates. To
   evaluate the nutritional status of elk in each study area, we captured,
   aged, and radio-collared adult female elk in SW (n = 69) in 2002-2005
   and NE (n = 113) in 2001-2007. We repeatedly captured these elk in
   autumn (n = 232) and spring (n = 404) and measured ingesta-free body fat
   (IFBF), mass, and pregnancy and lactation status. We fitted pregnant elk
   with vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) in spring and captured their
   neonates in SW (n = 46) and NE (n = 100). We placed expandable
   radio-collars on these plus an additional 110 neonates in SW and 360
   neonates in NE captured by hand or net-gunning via helicopter and
   estimated their age at capture, birth mass from mass at capture, and
   sex. We monitored their fates and documented causes of mortality until 1
   year of age. We estimated density of cougars by population
   reconstruction of captured (n = 96) and unmarked cougars killed (n = 27)
   and of black bears from DNA analysis of hair collected from snares. We
   found evidence in lactating females of nutritional limitations on all 4
   study areas where IFBFautumn was below 12\%, a threshold above which
   there are few nutritional limitations (9.8\% {[}SE = 0.64\%, n = 17] at
   Toketee, 7.9\% {[}SE = 0.78\%, n = 17] at Steamboat, 7.3\% {[}SE =
   0.33\%, n = 46] at Sled Springs, and 8.9\% {[}SE = 0.51\%, n = 23] at
   Wenaha). In spring, of females known to have been lactating the previous
   autumn, 48\% (SE = 3.3\%, n = 56) had IFBFspring <2\%, a level
   indicating severe nutritional limitations, compared to 20\% (SE = 1.7\%,
   n = 91) of those not lactating the previous autumn. These low levels of
   IFBFspring of lactating females likely resulted from a carry-over effect
   of inadequate nutrition during summer and early autumn. We found a
   positive relationship between summer precipitation and IFBFautumn in NE,
   and that IFBFautumn of pregnant females was inversely related to birth
   date of their neonates the following spring (F-1,F- 52 = 20.37, P <
   0.001, R-adj(2) = 0.27). Mean pregnancy rates of lactating females were
   below 0.
   90, a threshold indicating nutritional limitations, at Toketee (0.67, SE
   = 0.12, n = 15), Wenaha (0.70, SE = 0.10, n = 23), and Sled Springs
   (0.87, SE = 0.05, n = 47) but not Steamboat (0.93, SE = 0.07, n = 14).
   Of elk where we sampled femur fat during winter in NE, we saw evidence
   of imminent starvation in 3 of 21 juveniles (12\%) with all 3 killed by
   cougars, and 2 of 12 adult elk (17\%) that both died from non-predation
   events. Birth mass was <13 kg for 6.5\% and 2\% of VIT neonates in SW
   and NE, respectively, a mass associated with reduced probability of
   survival in previous studies. Birth mass of VIT neonates was greater in
   Sled Springs (x over bar = 18.3 kg, SD = 2.5, n = 59) than Steamboat (x
   over bar = 16.3 kg, SD = 2.1, n = 21) or Toketee (x over bar = 16.1 kg,
   SD = 2.8, n = 24) but not Wenaha (x over bar = 17.1 kg, SD = 2.8, n =
   36; F-3,F- 132 = 7.63, P < 0.001). Median and mean birth date (29 May)
   for VIT neonates did not differ between regions (F-1,F- 136 = 0.33, P =
   0.56), but NE had greater variation around the mean, indicating a longer
   parturition interval. We documented 293 mortalities of juveniles across
   study areas and years, and predation was the proximate cause of
   mortality in 262 cases primarily from cougar (n = 203), black bear (n =
   34), and other or unknown predation (n = 25). We also documented causes
   of mortality as unknown (n = 16), human-caused (n = 8), and disease or
   starvation (n = 7). We recorded abandonment of 2 (1.4\%) and predation
   mortality of 4 (2.7\%) VIT neonates prior to being collared. We found
   4-fold differences between regions of subadult female and adult cougar
   densities (0.90-4.29/100 km(2)) and 2-fold differences within study
   areas across years, with cougar density lower in SW than NE. Black bear
   densities varied from 15-20/100 km(2) across our study areas. We
   estimated survival of neonates to 30 days, 16 weeks, and 12 months using
   known fates models in Program MARK. Survival of neonates born to females
   with VITs was associated with cougar density, IFBFspring, and female
   mass but not female age or neonate birth date or birth mass. Survival
   was higher for juveniles born to females with lower IFBF and mass in
   spring, opposite of what we predicted. In a post hoc analysis, we found
   females successful in raising their neonate to recruitment were more
   likely to be successful the following year compared to those not
   successful the previous year, which may explain this unexpected finding.
   As cougar density increased, survival of juveniles born to females of
   known nutritional condition declined. We conducted separate analyses of
   survival by region for all neonates captured to evaluate effects of
   climate, bottom-up (but not maternal condition), and top-down factors.
   In NE, juvenile survival was little affected by annual variation in
   climate but decreased as cougar densities increased and as birth date
   became later. For SW, survival was higher with less April-May
   precipitation and for later born neonates but less affected by cougar
   density than observed in NE. Across our 4 study areas, survival varied
   annually from 0.61 (SE = 0.08) to 1.00 during the first 30 days, 0.41
   (SE = 0.11) to 0.90 (SE = 0.09) the first 16 weeks, and 0.18 (SE = 0.06)
   to 0.57 (SE = 0.11) through 12 months (recruitment) with survival higher
   in SW than NE. Survival of juvenile elk was inversely related to cougar
   density through 30 days (F-1,F- 18 = 16.59, R-adj(2) = 0.45, P < 0.001),
   16 weeks (F-1,F- 18 = 21.07, R-adj(2) = 0.51, P < 0.
   001), and 12 months (F-1,F- 11 = 18.94, R-adj(2) = 0.60, P = 0.001). We
   found that as rates of cougar-specific mortality increased, juvenile
   survival declined (beta<SIC> = -0.63, 95\% CI = -0.84 to -0.42)
   suggesting cougar predation was partially additive mortality because the
   estimated regression coefficient was significantly less than 0 but
   greater than -1. We did not observe a similar relationship with rates of
   black bear-specific mortality because the estimated regression
   coefficient overlapped 0, suggesting predation by black bears on
   juvenile elk was compensatory. Our results suggest that recruitment in
   NE but not SW was primarily limited by predation from cougars, which was
   partially additive mortality. Given that we observed nutritional
   limitations that influenced juvenile survival in all 4 study areas, we
   were unable to explicitly quantify how much of the cougar predation was
   additive mortality. Thus, we caution that a reduction in cougar density
   may not result in an equivalent increase in recruitment, and maintaining
   or enhancing summer and winter ranges of elk in our study areas is also
   vitally important for sustaining populations and distributions. In SW,
   where cougar densities were lower, maintaining, and enhancing existing
   elk habitat may be the only management option to improve recruitment.
   Given the differences we found between regions monitored, basing
   management on an incomplete understanding of causative factors affecting
   elk population dynamics may result in ineffective actions to address low
   recruitment. (c) 2018 The Authors. Wildlife Monographs Published by

Title = {A NEW MORMOOPID BAT FROM THE OLIGOCENE (WHITNEYAN AND EARLY ARIKAREEAN)
   OF FLORIDA, AND PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF THE MAJOR GLADES OF
   MORMOOPIDAE (MAMMALIA CHIROPTERA)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Abstract = {A new genus and species of fossil bat, Koopmanycteris palaeomormoops,
   representing an ancient member of the endemic Neotropical family
   Mormoopidae, is described from the Oligocene of Florida. This new
   species is known from two paleokarst deposits in northern peninsular
   Florida, the early Oligocene (Whitneyan, 30-32 Ma) 1-75 Local Fauna in
   Alachua County and the late Oligocene (early Arikareean, 26-28 Ma)
   Brooksville 2 Local Fauna in Hernando County. The discovery of
   Koopmanycteris extends the fossil record of the Mormoopidae back in time
   almost 30 million years. Compared to most other described taxa of North
   American Tertiary bats, the fossil sample of Koopmanycteris
   palaeomormoops is substantial, consisting of 50 specimens including: P4,
   all lower teeth from p3 through m3, dentary, petrosal, humerus, proximal
   radius, and femur. Koopmanycteris is morphologically intermediate
   between the two living genera of mormoopids, Mormoops and Pteronotus,
   but is most similar to the former taxon. Characters shared by
   Koopmanycteris and Mormoops include: large anterolabial basin on P4;
   large, double-rooted p3; secondary process ventral to angular process on
   dentary; absence of groove separating capitulum into medial and lateral
   portions on distal humerus; presence of prominent ridge on
   posterolateral edge of distal humeral shaft; rounded extremity on
   proximal radius; and presence of a prominent ridge or tubercle on
   posterodistal shaft of femur. All of these features appear to be
   relatively derived, with the exception of the large, double-rooted p3.
   In several mandibular characters, Koopmanycteris more closely resembles
   Pteronotus, including: pronounced posteroventral process on the
   symphysis; lack of curvature of ventral edge of horizontal ramus between
   posterior edge of symphysis and p4; and less pronounced dorsal upturning
   of ascending ramus compared to Mormoops. Koopmanycteris retains the
   primitive dental morphology of Mormoops, with a large double-rooted p3,
   and the primitive posterior mandibular morphology of Pteronotus, with
   the lesser degree of dorsal flexion of the ascending ramus. A
   phylogenetic analysis including all known extant mormoopid lineages as
   well as representative outgroups from other noctilionoid clades confirms
   that Koopmanycteris and Mormoops are sister taxa. These findings
   indicate that the lineages leading to Pteronotus and Mormoops were
   distinct by -30 Ma. The fossil record tentatively indicates that the
   Mormoopidae originated in North America in the early Oligocene or
   earlier, and may not have reached South America until the Pliocene
   following the onset of the Great American Biotic Interchange. Several
   lines of evidence support this hypothesis: (1) the earliest fossil
   record of the Mormoopidae is in the early Oligocene of Florida; (2) the
   greatest diversity and endemism of modern mormoopid species is in the
   West Indies; and (3) the absence of a pre-late Pleistocene record, lack
   of endemism, and marginal recent distribution of mormoopids in South
   America. Most species of living mormoopids are obligate cave dwellers,
   suggesting that the occurrence of caves and paleokarst deposits has
   affected both their modern distribution and fossil record.},

Title = {Best Management Practices for Trapping Furbearers in the United

Abstract = {Humans have used wild furbearers for various purposes for thousands of
   years. Today, furbearers are sustainably used by the public for their
   pelts, leather, bones, glands, meat, or other purposes. In North
   America, contemporary harvest of furbearers has evolved along with trap
   technologies and societal concerns, and is now highly regulated and more
   closely coupled with harvest analysis and population monitoring. Traps
   and regulated trapping programs provide personal or cultural rewards
   that can also support conservation, and can assist with advancing
   ecological knowledge through research, protecting endangered species,
   restoring populations or habitats, protecting personal property, and
   enhancing public health and safety. However, animal welfare and trap
   selectivity remain important topics for furbearer management in North
   America, as they have for more than a century. A related international
   challenge to modern furbearer management came with the Wild Fur
   Regulation by the European Union, which passed in 1991. This regulation
   prohibited use of foothold traps in many European countries and the
   importation of furs and manufactured fur products to Europe from
   countries that allowed use of foothold traps or trapping methods that
   did not meet internationally agreed-upon humane trapping standards. To
   address existing national concerns and requirements of the Wild Fur
   Regulation, the United States and European Union signed a non-binding
   bilateral understanding that included a commitment by the United States
   to evaluate trap performance and advance the use of improved traps
   through development of best management practices (BMPs) for trapping.
   Our testing followed internationally accepted restraining-trap standards
   for quantifying injuries and capture efficiency, and we established BMP
   pass-fail thresholds for these metrics. We also quantified furbearer
   selectivity, and qualitatively assessed practicality and user safety for
   each trap, yielding overall species-specific performance profiles for
   individual trap models. We present performance data for 84 models of
   restraining traps (6 cage traps, 68 foothold traps, 9 foot-encapsulating
   traps, and 1 power-activated footsnare) on 19 furbearing species, or 231
   trap-species combinations. We conducted post-mortem examinations on
   8,566 furbearers captured by trappers. Of the 231 trap model-species
   combinations tested, we had sufficient data to evaluate 173
   combinations, of which about 59\% met all BMP criteria. Pooling species,
   cage traps produced the lowest average injury score (common injuries
   included tooth breakage), with minimal differences across other trap
   types; species-specific patterns were generally similar, with the
   exception of raccoons (Procyon lotor) for which foot-encapsulating traps
   performed better than other foot-restraining trap types. Padded-jaw
   foothold traps performed better than standard-jaw models for many
   species, though often similar to and occasionally worse than offset- or
   laminated-jaw models. Most traps we tested had high capture efficiency;
   only 5 (3\%) failed BMP standards strictly because of poor efficiency.
   Average furbearer selectivity was high across all trap types we
   evaluated and was lowest for footsnares (88\%) and highest for
   foot-encapsulating traps (99\%). Mortality from trap-related injury in
   restraining traps we tested was very rare for furbearers (0.5\% of
   animals).
   In over 230,000 trap-nights across a 21-year period, no individuals of a
   threatened or endangered species were captured. Of 9,589 total captures,
   11\% were non-furbearers, of which 83\% were alive upon trap inspection;
   nearly all non-furbearer mortalities were birds, rabbits, or squirrels.
   Approximately 2\% of total captures were feral or free-ranging dogs
   (Canis familiaris), of which none died or were deemed in need of
   veterinary care by either our technicians or the owners (if located).
   Similarly, 3\% of total captures were feral or free-ranging cats (Felis
   catus); 2 were dead, and although locating potential owners was often
   impossible, none of the remaining cats were deemed in need of veterinary
   care by technicians or owners. Our results show that furbearer
   selectivity was high for all trap types evaluated, mortality or
   significant injury was very rare for domestic (or feral) animals, and
   the most potential for mortality or injury of non-furbearers was with
   smaller animals, a majority of which were squirrels and rabbits. Our
   results suggest that injury scores for a given trap-species combination
   are unlikely to vary significantly across states or regions of the
   United States, provided similar methods are employed. Our data also
   suggest that taxonomic affiliation and body-size groupings are
   correlated with injury scores, presumably through morphological,
   physiological, or behavioral adaptations or responses that influence
   injury potential during restraint; higher injury scores in
   foot-restraining trap types were more likely in smaller or more
   dexterous species, whereas injury scores were typically lowest for the
   felids we evaluated. For some species (e.g., American badger {[}Taxidea
   taxus], bobcat {[}Lynx rufus]), most restraining traps we tested met BMP
   standards, whereas few restraining traps we tested met standards for
   other species (e.g., muskrat {[}Ondatra zibethicus], striped skunk
   {[}Mephitis mephitis]). Comparison of our results with survey
   information collected during 2015 on trap use in the United States
   indicates that approximately 75\% of all target furbearers harvested
   were taken in BMP-compliant traps, with another 10\% taken in traps yet
   to be tested on that species. Future trap testing and development should
   focus on commonly used traps not yet tested on a species, species for
   which few passing traps currently pass BMP criteria, and trap models and
   modifications most likely to minimize trap injuries given a species
   morphology, physiology, and behavior. Outreach efforts should focus on
   general BMP awareness, discouraging use of traps that fail BMP standards
   for a given species, and public outreach on trapping. Restraining (and
   other) traps have evolved substantially in recent decades and offer
   numerous benefits to individuals, conservation, and society. However,
   continuing to address societal concerns remains a critical component of
   modern regulated trapping and furbearer management. Published trapping
   BMPs are regularly updated online and may include additional approved
   restraining and killing traps that were evaluated as part of testing by
   Canada. We will periodically update the trap performance tables and
   figures we presented and make them available online at the Association
   of Fish and Wildlife Agencies website. Published 2020. This article is a

Title = {REVISION OF THE NEARCTIC SPECIES OF THE GENUS AMIOTA LOEW (DIPTERA:

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {458},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Thorough biotic inventories are still needed even in families with
   paradigm organisms like Drosophilidae, including well-studied areas such
   as North America. This work presents a taxonomic revision of the species
   of the genus Amiota Loew in North America and the Nearctic portion of
   Mexico. Amiota steganoptera Malloch is currently excluded from the
   Nearctic and Amiota setigera Malloch is synonymized under Amiota
   humeralis Loew. Specimens of Amiota subtusradiata Duda were not
   encountered during this study along with its synonym Amiota quadrata
   Takada and Toda; however, based on previous descriptions we include A.
   subtusradiata in the Nearctic fauna. All other previously described
   species from the Nearctic are redescribed. Thirty-six species are
   described as new: Amiota amputata, A. antitormentum, A. avipes, A.
   biacuminis, A. brayi, A. byersi, A. cervites, A. cruciatum, A. didens,
   A. durangoensis, A. elsaltoensis, A. floridiensis, A. forceps, A.
   fulvitibia, A. hyalou, A. imperator, A. incurva, A. laevifurca, A.
   latilabrum, A. mcalpinei, A. multiplex, A. nanonigrescens, A.
   occidentalis, A. onyx, A. oviraptor, A. pseudominor, A. raripennis, A.
   sinaloensis, A. subnebojsa, A. tessae, A. texas, A. tibialis, A.
   tormentum, A. uniacuminis, A. wheeleri, and A. zaliskoi. This increases
   the total species known in the Nearctic from 13 to 49. All species in
   the Nearctic are illustrated, adult diagnostic features are discussed,
   and distributions are provided.
   A cladogram based on parsimony analysis of 46 morphological characters
   established species groups in the genus. Most of the Nearctic species
   were accommodated into 10 species groups. Three species groups were
   previously erected for species in China and Europe. Seven species groups
   are newly established: the avipes, cervites, hsui, mariae, nebojsa,
   nigrescens, and subtusradiata groups.
   Diversity in Amiota appears to be partially dependent on elevation and
   latitude in the Nearctic, with high diversity found in southern Ontario,
   the Appalachians, the Ozarks, mountain forests of Arizona and New
   Mexico, and the Sierra Madre of central Mexico. The taxonomic history of
   the Nearctic species is reviewed, and various aspects of their biology
   is presented. Males of species in the A. mariae species group are
   polymorphic for mirror-image, asymmetric genitalia, called chiral
   variants. Besides morphology, larval saproxyly, adult lachryphagy, and
   biogeography are reviewed. Challenges to the study of Amiota and future
   prospects are discussed.},

   with this project. At the AMNH: Steve Davis helped organize and plan
   laboratory work. A large part of this study would not have gone as
   smoothly without him. His friendship is appreciated, as well as the
   untold number of annoying questions, favors, and conversations
   (scientific and not) asked of him by L.E.J. Other AMNH colleagues
   include Courtney Richenbacher and Suzanne Rab Green, who fielded too
   many requests and questions to remember. Mary Knight offered
   nomenclatural assistance on all things Latin and Greek. Charlotte
   Holden, illustrator extraordinaire, rendered the shading for the
   genitalic plates from D.A.G.'s pencil sketches and line drawings. Lee
   Herman offered advice to L.E.J. on the nitty gritty of nomenclature and
   procedural taxonomy. Lance's brother, Jessten Hughes, accompanied him on
   two large collecting trips. In total, 15 states were visited with him in
   this study from California to Mississippi. Over approximately 7000 of
   miles of driving, Jesse managed to collect nearly five species, one new
   to science. Christian Liriano accompanied a trip in upstate New York.
   KeyLyn Song accompanied several trips around Florida. Lin Li accompanied
   many trips around the New York Botanical Garden. Kitty Sopow accompanied
   trips in southern Illinois. Ryan Mannion generously laid out, labeled,
   and sized all the figures in this study. In addition, he accompanied
   Lance on a trip to Maine and New Hampshire. He also looked over parts of
   the manuscript. His kind attitude for the intense nature over the past
   five years of this project is appreciated. Amy Berkov (City College of
   New YorkCUNY) is thanked for her help over the last five years. Amy
   served on the master's committee of the first author when this study was
   a thesis topic. Her patience, guidance, and encouragement pushed this
   study along in many ways. She imparted a love of urban and suburban
   biodiversity to a student who originally thought natural areas were the
   only places worthy of study. Amy's insight was prescient: insect
   taxonomy projects always end up becoming larger than one anticipates.
   Staff at the AMNH Southwest Research Station (Michele Lanan), Black Rock
   Forest Consortium (William Schuster), and the New York Botanical Garden
   (Jessica Arcate-Schuler) are thanked for assistance and permissions for
   L.E.J. to conduct fieldwork. The American Museum of Natural History is
   greatly appreciated for their financial assistance of fieldwork through
   generous funding by a Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Fund Grant to L.E.J.
   The Williston Diptera Fund at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History
   provided funds for L.E.J. to attend Fly School in California in 2017,
   where more collections of Amiota were made. Countless collectors and
   their specimens form the foundation for this study, among them Marshall
   R. Wheeler, William B. Heed, Stephen Marshall, James F. McAlpine, and
   Donald M. Wood. Marshall R. Wheeler deserves special appreciation. His
   collections throughout the United States formed a significant proportion
   of all museum collections consulted for this study. Combined with his
   papers, his contributions to this study are huge-and would have been
   woefully incomplete without them. When the late George Steyskal learned
   of D.A.G.'s study on drosophilids, beginning 40 years ago, he offered up
   all his notes and drawings. Thomas Werner and John Jaenike graciously
   donated valuable series of specimens for study.; The Museum of
   Comparative Zoology at Harvard (MCZC) provided photographs of Loew's
   type specimens and permitted their use in this text.},

Abstract = {Scorpions of the genus Buthacus Birula, 1908 (Buthidae C.L. Koch, 1837),
   commonly known as ``sand scorpions,{''} are widespread in the sandy
   deserts of the Palearctic, from West Africa to India. Although many new
   species of Buthacus were described in recent years, no modern revision
   exists for the genus and the limits of many infrageneric taxa remain
   unclear. The present contribution addresses the species of Buthacus
   recorded from the Levant, defined here as the region of the Middle East
   including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories,
   and the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt). Prior to this study, five species and
   subspecies, including several synonyms, were recognized from the region.
   Based on extensive new collections, a reassessment of the morphology
   (including multivariate statistical analysis), and a phylogenetic
   analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data, published elsewhere,
   seven species of Buthacus are now recognized from the Levant, raising
   the number of species in the genus to 30. Three new species are
   described: Buthacus amitaii, sp. nov., endemic to Israel; Buthacus
   arava, sp. nov., endemic to Israel and Jordan; and Buthacus levyi, sp.
   nov., endemic to Egypt, Israel, and perhaps Libya. Buthacus arenicola
   (Simon, 1885) is redescribed and restricted to northeastern Algeria and
   central Tunisia, and Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg, 1829) redescribed
   and restricted to Egypt, Sudan, and perhaps Libya. Buthacus armasi
   Lourenco, 2013, stat. rev., from southern Algeria, and Buthacus spatzi
   (Birula, 1911), stat. rev., from southern Tunisia and western Libya, are
   revalidated, and Buthacus fuscata Pallary, 1929, stat. nov. et stat.
   rev., from southern Algeria, revalidated and elevated to the rank of
   species. Buthacus nitzani Levy et al., 1973, stat. nov., currently
   restricted to Israel but probably present in the Sinai Peninsula
   (Egypt), is elevated to the rank of species. Buthacus tadmorensis
   (Simon, 1892), stat. rev., recorded from Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and
   Turkey, and Buthacus yotvatensis Levy et al., 1973, stat. rev., endemic
   to Israel and Jordan, are redescribed and revalidated. Three new
   synonyms are presented: Androctonus (Leiurus) macrocentrus Ehrenberg,
   1828 = Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg, 1829), syn. nov.; Buthus
   pietschmanni Penther, 1912 = Buthacus tadmorensis (Simon, 1892), syn.
   nov.; Buthacus granosus Borelli, 1929 = Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg,
   1829), syn. nov. Buthacus arenicola and the seven species of Buthacus
   occurring in the Levant are diagnosed and illustrated to modern
   standards, with updated distribution maps. A list of the currently
   recognized species of Buthacus, and a key to identification of the
   species occurring in the Levant are also presented.},

Abstract = {The genera and species of the Asian forest scorpions (Scorpionidae
   Latreille, 1802) are revised based on a phylogenetic analysis of 186
   morphological characters and 4188 base pairs of concatenated DNA
   sequence from three mitochondrial loci and two nuclear loci. Revision of
   the Asian scorpionids required a critical reappraisal of the
   suprageneric classification of Scorpionidae, on the basis of which the
   monotypic Indian scorpionoid genus, Rugodentus Bastawade et al., 2005,
   stat. rev., and its type species, Rugodentus keralaensis Bastawade et
   al., 2005, stat. rev., are revalidated, and subfamily Rugodentinae
   Bastawade et al., 2005, revalidated and elevated to the rank of family,
   Rugodentidae Bastawade et al., 2005, stat. nov. et stat. rev.;
   Heterometrinae Simon, 1879, stat. nov., and Opistophthalminae Rossi,
   2016, stat. nov., are elevated to the rank of subfamily; Pandinopsis
   Vachon, 1974, stat. nov., and Pandipalpus Rossi, 2015, stat. nov., are
   elevated to the rank of genus, resulting in two new combinations:
   Pandinopsis dictator (Pocock, 1888), comb. nov., and Pandipalpus
   viatoris (Pocock, 1890), comb. nov.; and 10 new synonyms are presented:
   Pandinopsini Rossi, 2016 = Pandininae Thorell, 1876, syn. nov.;
   Protophthalmini Rossi, 2016 = Opistophthalminae Rossi, 2016, syn. nov.;
   Protophthalmus Lawrence, 1969 = Opistophthalmus C.L. Koch, 1837, syn.

   (Pocock, 1890), syn. nov.; Pandinus intermedius Borelli, 1919 =
   Pandinurus citernii (Borelli, 1919), syn. nov. The following revisions
   are implemented to the classification of the Asian forest scorpions
   (Heterometrinae). Three former subgenera of Heterometrus Ehrenberg, 1828
   are revalidated and elevated to the rank of genus: Chersonesometrus
   Couzijn, 1978, stat. nov. et stat. rev.; Javanimetrus Couzijn, 1981,
   stat. nov. et stat. rev.; and Srilankametrus Couzijn, 1981, stat. nov.
   et stat. rev. One subgenus is elevated to the rank of genus:
   Gigantometrus Couzijn, 1978, stat. nov. Two new genera and eight new
   species are described: Deccanometrus, gen. nov.; Sahyadrimetrus, gen.
   nov.; Chersonesometrus bastawadei, sp. nov.; Chersonesometrus
   hendersoni, sp. nov.; Chersonesometrus nathanorum, sp. nov.;
   Chersonesometrus shivashankari, sp. nov.; Sahyadrimetrus mathewi, gen.
   et sp. nov.; Sahyadrimetrus tikaderi, gen. et sp. nov.; Srilankametrus
   couzijni, sp. nov.; Srilankametrus pococki, sp. nov. Heterometrus sensu
   stricto is restricted to eight species of the nominotypical subgenus,
   all other species, formerly placed in Heterometrus, are transferred to
   appropriate genera, five species are revalidated, and two subspecies
   elevated to the rank of species, resulting in 28 new combinations:

Abstract = {New and important pennaraptoran specimens continue to be discovered on a
   regular basis. Yet, with these discoveries the number of viable
   phylogenetic hypotheses has increased, including ones that challenge the
   traditional grouping of dromaeosaurids and troodontids within a
   monophyletic Deinonychosauria. This chapter will cover recent efforts to
   address prevailing phylogenetic uncertainties and controversies, both
   between and within key clades, including deinonychosaurian monophyly,
   the phylogenetic position of anchiornithines and scansoriopterygids, and
   the interrelationships of enantiornithines. While recent discoveries
   mainly from Asia have created much of the latest uncertainty and
   controversy, new material, particularly from Asia, promises to rather
   fittingly address these issues. Further curatorship of long-standing
   phylogenetic datasets and more prevalent use of extended analytical
   protocols will be essential to meeting this challenge, especially for
   groups whose boundaries have been blurred. As it becomes increasingly
   difficult to study all fossil materials, owing to their growing numbers
   and ever disparate locations, broader use of digital fossils and online
   character databases for character coding is acutely needed to ensure
   that errors arising from remote, rather than firsthand, scoring are
   reduced as far as possible, particularly at this time of rapid data
   accumulation.},

Abstract = {An unabated surge of new and important discoveries continues to
   transform knowledge of pen-naraptoran biology and evolution amassed over
   the last 150+ years. This chapter summarizes progress made thus far in
   sampling the pennaraptoran fossil record of the Mesozoic and Paleocene
   and proposes priority areas of attention moving forward.
   Oviraptorosaurians are bizarre, nonparavian pennaraptorans first
   discovered in North America and Mongolia within Late Cretaceous rocks in
   the early 20th century. We now know that oviraptorosaurians also
   occupied the Early Cretaceous and their unquestionable fossil record is
   currently limited to Laurasia. Early Cretaceous material from China
   preserves feathers and other soft tissues and ingested remains including
   gastroliths and other stomach contents, while brooding specimens and
   age-structured, single-species accumulations from China and Mongolia
   provide spectacular behavioral insights. Less specialized early
   oviraptorosaurians like Incisivosaurus and Microvenator remain rare, and
   ancestral forms expected in the Late Jurassic are yet to be discovered,
   although some authors have suggested Epidexipteryx and possibly other
   scansoriopterygids may represent early-diverging oviraptorosaurians.
   Long-armed scansoriopterygids from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Laurasia
   are either early-diverging oviraptorosaurians or paravians, and some
   have considered them to be early-diverging avialans. Known from five (or
   possibly six) feathered specimens from China, only two mature
   individuals exist, representing these taxa. These taxa, Yi and
   Ambopteryx, preserve stylopod-supported wing membranes that are the only
   known alternative to the feathered, muscular wings that had been
   exclusively associated with dinosaurian flight. Thus, scansoriopterygid
   specimens-particularly those preserving soft tissue-remain a key
   priority for future specimen collection.
   Dromaeosaurids and troodontids were first discovered in North America
   and Mongolia in Late Cretaceous rocks. More recent discoveries show that
   these animals originated in the Late Jurassic, were strikingly
   feathered, lived across diverse climes and environments, and at least in
   the case of dromaeosaurids, attained a global distribution and the
   potential for aerial locomotion at small size.
   Gondwanan troodontids are almost unknown compared to southern
   dromaeosaurids, so the fidelity of this biogeographical signal is worth
   further exploration. Discovery of well-preserved Middle-Late Jurassic
   material will be crucial for understanding the origin of key
   dromaeosaurid and troodontid traits, with the controversial
   anchiornithines potentially already offering this if their troodontid
   status can be solidified.
   In line with the preferences of most theropod palaeontologists, birds
   are defined herein as members of Avialae, including stem and crown taxa,
   whilst Aves herein refers to crown-group birds (see Pittman et al.,
   chapter 1, for the precise definition of Avialae adopted; elsewhere,
   typically among ornithologists, Aves refers to stem and crown taxa
   whilst Neornithes refers to crown-group birds). Despite taphonomic bias
   against avialans in the fossil record, their Early Cretaceous record is
   fairly robust largely due to the high taxonomic and ecological diversity
   preserved within the rich Jehol deposits of northeastern China.
   Archaeopteryx (and possibly the controversial Middle-Late Jurassic
   anchiornithines) show what some of the earliest birds were like, but
   better-preserved soft tissues hold the key to understanding their
   substantially different anatomy and flight capabilities to crown-group
   birds (Aves).
   The Late Cretaceous-early Paleocene fossil record of crown birds is
   especially poor, and improved sampling will be necessary to clarify our
   understanding of avialan survivorship, ecological selectivity, and
   recovery across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Deposits of Eocene
   age, such as Messel and Green River, have been especially useful for
   documenting the early evolutionary history of crown birds. However, the
   discovery of new Cretaceous and/or Palaeogene bird-bearing lagerstatten
   from Gondwana will be important for accurately determining ancestral
   biogeographic patterns.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effectiveness of harvest regulations to manipulate
   population abundances is a priority for wildlife managers, and reliable
   methods are needed to monitor populations. This is particularly true in
   controversial situations such as integrated carnivore-ungulate
   management. We used an observational before-after-control-treatment
   approach to evaluate a case study in west-central Montana, USA, that
   applied conservative ungulate harvest together with liberalized
   carnivore harvest to achieve short-term decreases in carnivore abundance
   and increases in ungulate recruitment. Our study areas included the
   Bitterroot treatment area and the Clark Fork control area, where
   mountain lion populations (Felis concolor) were managed for a 30\%
   reduction and for stability, respectively. The goals of the mountain
   lion harvest were to provide a short-term reduction of mountain lion
   predation on elk (Cervus canadensis) calves and an increase in elk
   recruitment, elk population growth rate, and ultimately elk abundance.
   We estimated mountain lion population abundance in the Bitterroot
   treatment and Clark Fork control areas before and 4 years after
   implementation of the 2012 harvest treatment. We developed a
   multi-strata spatial capture-recapture model that integrated recapture
   and telemetry data to evaluate mountain lion population responses to
   harvest changes. Mountain lion abundance declined with increasing
   harvest in the Bitterroot treatment area from 161 (90\% credible
   interval {[}CrI] = 104, 233) to 115 (CrI = 69, 173). The proportion of
   males changed from 0.50 (CrI = 0.33, 0.67) to 0.28 (CrI = 0.17, 0.40),
   which translated into a decline in the abundance of males, and similar
   abundances of females (before: males = 80 {[}CrI = 52, 116], females =
   81 {[}CrI = 52, 117]; after: males = 33 {[}CrI = 20, 49], females = 82
   {[}CrI = 49, 124]). In the Clark Fork control area, an area twice as
   large as the Bitterroot treatment area, we found no evidence of changes
   in overall abundance or proportion of males in the population. The
   proportion of males changed from 0.42 (CrI = 0.26, 0.58) to 0.39 (CrI =
   0.25, 0.54), which translated into similar abundances of males and
   females (before: males = 24 {[}CrI = 16, 36], females = 33 {[}CrI = 21,
   39]; after: males = 28 {[}CrI = 18, 41], females = 44 {[}CrI = 29, 64]).
   To evaluate if elk recruitment and population growth rate increased
   following treatment, we developed an integrated elk population model. We
   compared recruitment and population growth rate during the 5 years prior
   to and 5 years following implementation of the mountain lion harvest
   treatment for 2 elk populations within the Bitterroot treatment area and
   2 elk populations within the Clark Fork control area. We found strong
   evidence that temporal trends differed between the 2 areas. In the
   Bitterroot treatment area, per capita elk recruitment was stable around
   an estimated median value of 0.23 (CrI = 0.17, 0.36) in the
   pre-treatment period (2007-2011), increased immediately after treatment
   (2013) to 0.42 (CrI = 0.29, 0.56), and then declined to 0.21 (CrI =
   0.11, 0.32) in 2017. In contrast, per capita elk recruitment estimates
   in the Clark Fork control area had similar median values during the pre-
   (2007-2011: 0.30, CrI = 0.2, 0.
   35) and post-treatment periods (2013-2017: 0.31, CrI = 0.26, 0.36).
   These changes in recruitment corresponded to similar changes in elk
   population growth rate, although population growth rates were also
   subject to variation due to changing elk harvest. In the Bitterroot
   treatment area, population growth rates in the pre-treatment period were
   stable to slightly declining, with an estimated median value of 0.92
   (CrI = 0.88, 1.07) in the pre-treatment period (2007-2011). Population
   growth rate during the post-treatment period increased immediately after
   treatment (2012: 1.17, CrI = 1.14, 1.20) prior to declining to 1.06 (CrI
   = 1.04, 1.09) in 2016. In contrast, the median population growth rates
   were roughly equal in the Clark Fork control area during the
   pre-treatment period (1.01, CrI = 0.86, 1.09) from 2007 to 2011 and
   post-treatment period (1.00, CrI = 0.83, 1.15) from 2013 to 2017.
   Together, these results indicate that the harvest treatment achieved a
   moderate (i.e., 29\%) reduction in mountain lion population abundance
   within the treatment area that corresponded with short-term increases in
   elk recruitment and population growth. Elk population demographic
   responses suggest that the harvest treatment effect was strongest
   immediately after the mountain lion harvest treatment was implemented
   and lessened over time as the harvest treatment was reduced. This
   suggests that the short-term harvest treatment resulted in short-term
   demographic responses in elk populations, and more sustained harvest
   treatments would be necessary to achieve longer-term elk population
   demographic responses. We recommend that wildlife managers seeking to
   balance carnivore and ungulate population objectives design rigorous
   carnivore and ungulate population monitoring programs to assess the
   effects of harvest management programs. Assessing and understanding
   effects of carnivore harvest management programs will help to set
   realistic expectations regarding the effects of management programs on
   carnivore and ungulate populations and allow managers to better design
   programs to meet desired carnivore and ungulate population objectives.},

   restricted than the usual delimitation of the subfamily. We found no
   consistent evidence that a Glade with Docosia Winnertz, Novakia Strobl,
   Ectrepesthoneura Enderlein, and Tetragoneura Winnertz group together
   with the remaining genera of Leiinae. A name with subfamily
   rank-Tetragoneurinae, already present in the literature-is used here to
   refer to this group. The allactoneurine genera Sticholeia Soli and
   Allactoneura de Meijere form a Glade with the leiine genus Leiella and
   the genera of Manotinae, which is deeply nested within the Leiinae. The
   male terminalia patterns found within the subfamily are analyzed and
   illustrated. A classification for the Leiinae is proposed grouping 33
   genera in seven clades ranked as tribes: Selkirkiini Enderlein,
   Megophthalmidiini, trib. nov., Rondaniellini, trib. nov., Cycloneurini
   Shaw and Shaw, Manotini Edwards, Anomalomyiini, trib. nov., and Leiini
   Edwards. A key for the world genera of Leiinae is also provided. The
   Cretaceous mycetophilid fossil record is revisited and the biogeographic
   evolution of the Leiinae is discussed.},

Abstract = {Unravelling the phylogenetic relationships among the major groups of
   living birds has been described as the greatest outstanding problem in
   dinosaur systematics. Recent work has identified portions of the avian
   tree of life that are particularly challenging to reconstruct, perhaps
   as a result of rapid cladogenesis early in crown bird evolutionary
   history (specifically, the interval immediately following the
   end-Cretaceous mass extinction). At face value this hypothesis enjoys
   support from the crown bird fossil record, which documents the first
   appearances of most major crown bird lineages in the early Cenozoic-in
   line with a model of rapid postextinction niche-filling among surviving
   avian lineages. However, molecular-clock analyses have yielded
   strikingly variable estimates for the age of crown birds, and
   conflicting inferences on the impact of the end-Cretaceous mass
   extinction on the extant bird radiation. This uncertainty has often been
   ascribed to a patchy avian fossil record, but the possibility of model
   misspecification in molecular divergence-time analyses represents an
   important and relatively underexplored alternative hypothesis. Here, we
   highlight the necessity of further developing and using models that
   account for coordinated variation in rates of molecular evolution across
   a phylogeny (e.g., molecular early burst) as a means of assessing
   support for a rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of crown birds. We discuss
   how relationships between life history and substitution rates can
   mislead divergence-time studies that do not account for directional
   changes in substitution rates over time, and suggest that these effects
   might have caused some of the variation in existing molecular date
   estimates for birds. We suggest multiple paths forward that could help
   resolve this and similar conflicts within other major eukaryotic clades.},

Title = {A REVISION OF THE DIDELPHID MARSUPIAL GENUS MARMOSA PART 2. SPECIES OF
   THE RAPPOSA GROUP (SUBGENUS MICOUREUS)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2020},
Number = {439},
Pages = {1-60},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In this report, the second of a revisionary series on mouse opossums
   (Marmosa), we analyze cytochrome b sequence data from 166 specimens of
   the subgenus Micoureus and delimit putative species using the multirate
   Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP) method. That analysis identifies 21
   putative species, many of which can be matched with available names,
   including alstoni, constantiae, demerarae, limae, germana, meridae,
   paraguayana, parda, perplexa, phaea, rapposa, and rutteri. However, some
   of these nominal taxa are not morphologically diagnosable, and in the
   absence of other corroborating evidence, we do not recommend that they
   all be recognized as valid. Phylogenetic analyses of a multigene dataset
   suggest that putative species of Micoureus belong to several
   wellsupported clades, one of which (the ``Rapposa Group{''}) is revised
   in this report. As defined herein, the Rapposa Group includes at least
   three valid species: M. rapposa Thomas, 1899 (including budini Thomas,
   1920); M. parda Tate, 1931; and M. rutteri Thomas, 1924. Herein we
   document their ecogeographic distributions and diagnostic traits,
   comment on their taxonomic histories, and list the specimens we examined
   (including all relevant type material).},

Title = {BASAL CYCLORRHAPHA IN AMBER FROM THE CRETACEOUS AND TERTIARY(INSECTA:
   DIPTERA), AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS: BRACHYCERA IN CRETACEOUS AMBER PART
   IX},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2018},
Number = {423},
Pages = {3-97},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Diverse new basal (aschizan) Cyclorrhapha fossilized in amber are
   described from the Tertiary and Cretaceous, and their relationships are
   examined with character-based phylogenetic hypotheses for each family or
   family group. There are 18 new species in 15 genera (11 of them new) and
   four families plus the Syrphoidea. Fossils are from the Early Cretaceous
   of Lebanon, Late Cretaceous of New Jersey (United States) and Alberta
   (Canada), Eocene of the eastern Baltic coast, and Miocene of the
   Dominican Republic, but predominantly from the mid-Cretaceous of
   Myanmar. Stem-group Lonchopteroidea are Alonchoptera lebanica, n. gen.,
   n. sp., and Lonchopterites burmensis, n. sp. Platypezidae include the
   stem groups Burmapeza radicis, n. gen., n. sp., Canadopeza biacrosticha,
   n. gen., n. sp., and Calvopeza divergens, n. gen., n. sp. An unnamed
   Microsania sp. is the first definitive Platypezidae in Baltic amber;
   Lebanopeza azari, n. gen., n. sp., is a stem group to the Microsaniinae
   and Melanderomyiinae. Chandleromyia anomala, n. gen., n. sp., is an
   anomalously derived Platypezinae from the Cretaceous, and two new
   species of the diverse Recent genus Lindneromyia are in Dominican amber
   (L. neomedialis and L. dominicana). Fossils of the relict family
   Ironomyiidae (with 3 living species from eastern Australia) include two
   stem-group genera with two new species each, all in Burmese amber:
   Palaeopetia dorsalis and P. terminus, Proironia (n. gen.) gibbera and P.
   burmitica. All other species of Palaeopetia are compression fossils from
   the Cretaceous of Asia and Eurasia. For Phoridae, a new defining feature
   is a stridulatum on the procoxa and profemur in both sexes, occuring in
   most fossil taxa where observable. New sciadocerines include
   Eosciadocera pauciseta, n. sp., a very large species in Baltic amber,
   and two stem groups in Burmese amber, Prophora dimorion, n. gen., n.
   sp., and a very small, undescribed taxon. Archiphora pria Grimaldi and
   Cumming in Turonian-aged New Jersey amber is transferred to Hennigophora
   Brown, based on evidence from a new specimen. Prioriphorinae (not
   taxonomically treated here) is a paraphyletic, Cretaceous grade to the
   very diverse, crown-group radiation of Euphorida that occurred in the
   Cenozoic. Two syrphoids occur in Burmese amber: Prosyrphus thompsoni, n.
   gen., n. sp. (an apparent stem group to the Syrphidae), and Aschizomyia
   burmensis, n. gen., n. sp. (with more ambiguous affinities). Several
   immatures of undetermined family are reported, one a probable phorid
   larva. No definitive Schizophora are yet known from the Cretaceous.},

Title = {SYSTEMATICS OF THE RELICTUAL ASIAN SCORPION FAMILY PSEUDOCHACTIDAE
   GROMOV, 1998, WITH A REVIEW OF CAVERNICOLOUS, TROGLOBITIC, AND
   TROGLOMORPHIC SCORPIONS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {453},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The first integrative systematic revision of the relictual Asian
   scorpion family Pseudochactidae Gromov, 1998, making use of an
   unprecedented collection of material acquired during several expeditions
   to most of the type localities, is presented. The subfamilies, genera
   and species of Pseudochactidae are revised based on a phylogenetic
   analysis of 140 morphological characters and 8608 nucleotide base pairs
   of concatenated DNA sequence from two nuclear and three mitochondrial
   gene loci, and a multivariate statistical analysis of 22 ratios and 8
   counts for 60 specimens. Three subfamilies, four genera and six species
   are recognized in the family. Troglokhammouaninae, subfam. nov., is
   created to restore the monophyly of the nominotypical subfamily
   Pseudochactinae Gromov, 1998. Aemngvantom, gen. nov., is created to
   accommodate Aemngvantom lao (Lourenco, 2012), comb. nov., and
   Aemngvantom thamnongpaseuam gen. et sp. nov. Four new synonyms are
   presented: Troglokhammouanus louisanneorum Lourenco, 2017 =
   Troglokhammouanus steineri Lourenco, 2007, syn. nov.; Vietbocap
   thienduongensis Lourenco and Pham, 2012 = Vietbocap canhi Lourenco and
   Pham, 2010, syn. nov.; Vietbocap aurantiacus Lourenco et al., 2018 = V.
   canhi, syn. nov.; Vietbocap quinquemilia Lourenco et al., 2018 = V.
   canhi, syn. nov. Revised diagnoses of the subfamilies, genera and
   species, with comparative images, a key and distribution maps are
   provided, along with a summary of available data on ecology and
   conservation status, where applicable. Among the Southeast Asian
   pseudochactids, all of which appear to be obligately cavernicolous, the
   three species of Vietbocapinae Lourenco, 2012, are highly troglomorphic
   whereas the sole species of Troglokhammouaninae is barely so. Applying
   recently revised definitions of the Schiner-Racovitza system for the
   classification of subterranean organisms, only Vietbocapinae can be
   considered troglobitic. The global diversity of cavernicolous,
   troglomorphic and troglobitic scorpions is similarly revisited and a key
   to ecological classification of cavernicolous and troglomorphic
   scorpions presented. The world totals of troglomorphic vs. troglobitic
   scorpions are currently 58 vs. 28 species, in 29 vs. 17 genera and 15
   vs. 13 families, respectively.},

Title = {SYSTEMATICS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RADIATION OF ORTHOTYLINI PLANT BUGS
   ASSOCIATED WITH CALLITROID CONIFERS IN AUSTRALIA: DESCRIPTION OF FIVE
   NEW GENERA AND 32 NEW SPECIES (HETEROPTERA: MIRIDAE: ORTHOTYLINAE)},

Abstract = {Orthotyline plant bugs inhabiting the southern conifer genus Callitris
   in Australia are investigated and classified systemically for the first
   time, with the description of 5 new genera and 32 new species from
   Australia. The five new callitroid-inhabiting Orthotylini genera
   proposed are Avititerra, Blattakeraia, Callitricola, Erysivena, and
   Ngullamiris. The 32 new species accommodated by these genera are:
   Avititerra lepidothrix, A. xerophila, Blattakeraia actinostrobi, B.
   hochuli, Callitricola ballina, C. boorabbin, C. cordylina, C. finke, C.
   finlayae, C. gammonensis, C. graciliphila, C. parawirra, C. pullabooka,
   C. silveirae, C. tatarnici, C. wiradjuri, C. wollemi, Erysivena apta, E.
   bundjalung, E. drepanomorpha, E. emeraldensis, E. endlicheriphila, E.
   kalbarri, E. majori, E. mareeba, E. molloy, E. notodytika, E. paluma, E.
   schuhi, E. schwartzi, E. sydneyensis, and Ngullamiris whadjuk. A key to
   the newly described Australian taxa, habitus photographs of all species,
   illustrations of male and female genitalia, and scanning electron
   micrographs of representative species are given. A phylogenetic analysis
   of these callitroid-inhabiting Orthotylini was undertaken, incorporating
   described Orthotylus Fieber species extralimital to Australia and other
   recently described Australian Orthotylini. Callitris host plants are
   mapped to the implied-weights phylogenetic analysis, and their
   associations are discussed. Associations between related species of
   Orthotylini and related species of Callitris were detected, as were
   three independent colonisations by a paraphyletic assemblage of
   callitroid-inhabiting Orthotylini. Generic concepts within Orthotylini
   are discussed, with reference to Orthotylus species extralimital to
   Australia and includes a comparison of key character systems. It is
   demonstrated that the endosomal spicule characters are primary
   determinants of generic limits in the Orthotylini, which are supported
   by other characters of the male and female genitalia and external
   characters.},

Abstract = {The genus Actinopus Perty, 1833, is revised for Argentina, comprising a
   total of 23 species. The female of A. insignis (Holmberg, 1881) is
   described for the first time; the species is found in northern Buenos
   Aires, southern Santa Fe, and Uruguay. The female of A. longipalpis
   (Koch, 1842), previously known only from the male type from Uruguay, is
   described for the first time, and the species is newly cited for
   Argentina (Entre Rios). Twenty new species are recognized, described and
   illustrated. Thirteen of the new species are based on males and females
   (A. reycali, sp. nov., from Jujuy and Salta; A. clavero, sp. nov., from
   Cordoba; A. szumikae, sp. nov., from Cordoba, southern Buenos Aires,
   Santa Fe and Corrientes; A. coylei, sp. nov., from Salta and Santiago

   Chaco, and Misiones, A. excavatus, sp. nov., from Cordoba, A. casuhati,
   sp. nov., from southern Buenos Aires). Only one of the new species
   described is based on females only (A. indiamuerta, sp. nov., from
   Tucuman); and the remaining six on males (A. puelche, sp. nov., from
   southern Buenos Aires and Uruguay, A. cordobensis, sp. nov., from San
   Luis and Cordoba, A. magnus, sp. nov., from Cordoba, A. ariasi, sp.
   nov., from Formosa, A. palmar, sp. nov., from Entre Rios, and A.
   balcarce, sp. nov., from southern Buenos Aires). New morphological
   characters that can help solve phylogenetic relationships within the
   genus are described. A dichotomous key for all the species from
   Argentina is provided, as well as maps of the known geographic
   distribution for all the species. Three of the species treated here (A.
   gerschiapelliarum, A. puelche, and A. insignis) are recorded also for

Abstract = {Recent discoveries of exquisitely preserved nonavialan and avialan
   theropod dinosaurs have not only prompted studies of theropod tooth
   morphologies, but have also provided information about the origin and
   early evolution of avian beaks. Recent studies on beak morphologies and
   morphogenesis in Darwin's finches have greatly improved our
   understanding of how avian beaks adapt to various ecological niches, but
   the question of how birds lost their teeth during the course of
   evolution has long been debated. Evolutionary developmental experiments
   performed on extant bird embryos bridge the gap between paleontological
   and neontological evidence, suggesting that the avian beak could have
   originated through heterochronic truncation of odontogenesis over
   evolutionary time. Here, we systematically review independently evolved
   regional and complete edentulism present in nonavialan and avialan
   theropod dinosaurs, and suggest that the tooth-reduction processes of
   different jaw bones are likely to be independently controlled. Through
   reviewing the recent advances of molecular regulations involved in tooth
   and avian beak morphogenic processes, we suggest that several molecules
   regulating the development of the avian beak also mediate the growth of
   keratinous rhamphothecae, and the divergence of odontogenic signalling
   pathways are likely to have accounted for both of these processes.},

Abstract = {Oviraptorosauria and Scansoriopterygidae are theropod clades that
   include members suggested to have partially or fully herbivorous diets.
   Obligate herbivory and carnivory are two ends of the spectrum of dietary
   habits along which it is unclear how diet within these two clades might
   have varied. Clarifying their diet is important as it helps
   understanding of dietary evolution close to the dinosaur-bird
   transition. Here, diets are investigated by conventional comparative
   anatomy, as well as measuring mandibular characteristics that are
   plausibly indicative of the animal's feeding habit, with reference to
   modern herbivores that may also have nonherbivorous ancestry. In
   general, the skulls of scansoriopterygids appear less adapted to
   herbivory compared with those of oviraptorids because they have a lower
   dorsoventral height, a smaller lateral temporal fenestra, and a smaller
   jaw-closing mechanical advantage and they lack a tall coronoid process
   prominence. The results show that oviraptorid mandibles are more adapted
   to herbivory than those of caenagnathids, early-diverging
   oviraptorosaurians and scansoriopterygids. It is notable that some
   caenagnathids possess features like an extremely small articular offset,
   and low average mandibular height may imply a more carnivorous diet than
   the higher ones of other oviraptorosaurians. Our study provides a new
   perspective to evaluate different hypotheses on the diets of
   scansoriopterygids and oviraptorosaurians, and demonstrates the high
   dietary complexity among early-diverging pennaraptorans.},

Abstract = {Discussions about the origin of flight almost unanimously assume that
   early birds positioned (and moved) their wings in the same basic manner
   as living flying birds, with reconstructed wings extended with the
   airfoil surface parallel to the ground and forelimbs moving in a
   dorsoventral arc. Such reconstructions of wing posture and movements for
   extinct avialans are based on highly specialized flying neognaths, in
   which the glenoid cavity is horizontally extended and laterodorsally
   faced, thus allowing wide humeral rotation and increased upward
   excursion. However, living ratites exhibit a sharply different pattern
   of pectoral girdle (or shoulder girdle) morphology and associated wing
   movements: in both Rhea and Struthio the glenoid cavity faces laterally,
   but its major axis is almost vertical. In consequence, wings
   predominantly move following an anterolateral to posteromedial
   abduction-adduction arc. Initial experimental results with Rhea
   americana demonstrate their inability to perform WAIR (wing-assisted
   incline running), suggesting a causal relationship between the inability
   to flap the wings vigorously and its pectoral girdle morphology (with
   glenoid cavity subvertically oriented, poorly developed acrocoracoid
   process, and m. supracoracoideus playing a protractor rather than
   elevator function). Early-diverging paravians (e.g., Saurornitholestes,
   Buitreraptor, Microraptor) and early-diverging birds (e.g.,
   Archaeopteryx, Anchiornis) share a closely similar morphology of scapula
   and coracoid, with a glenoid cavity facing laterally and with its
   greater axis oriented subvertically. This condition of the glenoid
   resembles that of ratites, allowing one to infer that fully extended
   wings of early-diverging paravians (including Archaeopteryx) oriented
   their surface obliquely to the ground. Experimental results, in
   conjunction with anatomical observations in both flying and flightless
   living birds, warn about the purported generalized ability of
   early-diverging paravians to perform WAIR. Even if they were capable of
   symmetrical flapping, their wing movements were different from those of
   living neognaths, because the glenoid retained both a plesiomorphic
   morphology and orientation. Wing strokes as hypothesized here for
   early-diverging paravians may have generated thrust with little or no
   lift. WAIR behavior was present in the common ancestor of Neognathae,
   and also probably present in early-diverging ornithothoracines. However,
   WAIR performance among early-diverging paravians and early birds remains
   uncertain. In agreement with recent contributions, we conclude that the
   origin of flapping flight (and eventually WAIR) emerged in birds that
   diverged later than Archaeopteryx, with the acquisition of a
   horizontally placed major glenoid axis, which allowed wider dorsoventral
   forelimb excursions.},

Title = {SYSTEMATICS OF THE ``GIANT{''} RICINULEI (RICINOIDIDAE: RICINOIDES) OF

Abstract = {The Ricinulei Thorell, 1876, or ``hooded tick-spiders,{''} are among the
   rarest and least studied arachnid orders. Ricinoides Ewing, 1929, the
   only Old World genus of extant ricinuleids, with 11 species described
   from tropical West Africa, is the most neglected of the three genera
   currently recognized. A lack of attention to the systematics of
   Ricinoides has created a disparity between its taxonomic diversity and
   that of the New World genera, Cryptocellus Westwood, 1874, and
   Pseudocellus Platnick, 1980, in which many new species have been
   described in recent decades. The present contribution provides a revised
   diagnosis of Ricinoides, which includes two new, putative synapomorphies
   for the genus and addresses the systematics and morphology of a group of
   West African species, which includes the world's largest ricinuleids and
   the type species of the genus. This group of nine species, referred to
   as the ``giant{''} Ricinulei, shares a unique combination of characters,
   many of which appear to be unique to the group, and appears to be
   monophyletic. Four species of this group are redescribed, with revised
   diagnoses, based on reexamination of the type material: Ricinoides
   afzelii (Thorell, 1892), from Sierra Leone; Ricinoides atewa Naskrecki,
   2008, from Ghana; Ricinoides feae (Hansen, 1921), from Guinea-Bissau;
   and Ricinoides westermannii (Guerin-Meneville, 1838), from Togo. Five
   new species are described, raising the number of species in the genus to
   16: Ricinoides eburneus, sp. nov., and Ricinoides taii, sp. nov., from
   Cote d'Ivoire; Ricinoides iita, sp. nov., from Nigeria; Ricinoides
   kakum, sp. nov., from Ghana; and Ricinoides nzerekorensis, sp. nov.,
   from Guinea. Comparative illustrations of the adult morphology are
   presented for all nine species. The male copulatory apparatus is
   described and illustrated in detail, and new terminology and characters
   presented. The female spermathecae are described and illustrated for six
   species in which the females are known, representing the first
   illustrated comparison of these structures in African ricinuleids.
   Geographical distribution records are revised and updated for the
   different species, and their distributions mapped.},

Abstract = {Abundant evidence supports the benefits accrued to the Florida panther
   (Puma concolor coryi) population via the genetic introgression project
   implemented in South Florida, USA, in 1995. Since then, genetic
   diversity has improved, the frequency of morphological and biomedical
   correlates of inbreeding depression have declined, and the population
   size has increased. Nevertheless, the panther population remains small
   and isolated and faces substantial challenges due to deterministic and
   stochastic forces. Our goals were 1) to comprehensively assess the
   demographics of the Florida panther population using long-term
   (1981-2015) field data and modeling to gauge the persistence of benefits
   accrued via genetic introgression and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness
   of various potential genetic management strategies. Translocation and
   introduction of female pumas (Puma concolor stanleyana) from Texas, USA,
   substantially improved genetic diversity. The average individual
   heterozygosity of canonical (non-introgressed) panthers was 0.386 +/-
   0.012 (SE); for admixed panthers, it was 0.615 +/- 0.007. Survival rates
   were strongly age-dependent (kittens had the lowest survival rates),
   were positively affected by individual heterozygosity, and decreased
   with increasing population abundance. Overall annual kitten survival was
   0.32 +/- 0.09; sex did not have a clear effect on kitten survival.
   Annual survival of subadult and adult panthers differed by sex;
   regardless of age, females exhibited higher survival than males. Annual
   survival rates of subadult, prime adult, and old adult females were 0.97
   +/- 0.02, 0.86 +/- 0.03, and 0.78 +/- 0.09, respectively. Survival rates
   of subadult, prime adult, and old adult males were 0.66 +/- 0.06, 0.77
   +/- 0.05, and 0.65 +/- 0.10, respectively. For panthers of all ages,
   genetic ancestry strongly affected survival rate, where first filial
   generation (F1) admixed panthers of all ages exhibited the highest rates
   and canonical (mostly pre-introgression panthers and their
   post-introgression descendants) individuals exhibited the lowest rates.
   The most frequently observed causes of death of radio-collared panthers
   were intraspecific aggression and vehicle collision. Cause-specific
   mortality analyses revealed that mortality rates from vehicle collision,
   intraspecific aggression, other causes, and unknown causes were
   generally similar for males and females, although males were more likely
   to die from intraspecific aggression than females. The probability of
   reproduction and the annual number of kittens produced varied by age;
   evidence that ancestry or abundance influenced these parameters was
   weak. Predicted annual probabilities of reproduction were 0.35 +/- 0.08,
   0.50 +/- 0.05, and 0.25 +/- 0.06 for subadult, prime adult, and old
   adult females, respectively. The number of kittens predicted to be
   produced annually by subadult, prime adult, and old adult females were
   2.80 +/- 0.75, 2.67 +/- 0.43, and 2.28 +/- 0.83, respectively. The
   stochastic annual population growth rate estimated using a matrix
   population model was 1.04 (95\% CI = 0.72-1.41). An individual-based
   population model predicted that the probability that the population
   would fall below 10 panthers within 100 years (quasi-extinction) was
   1.4\% (0-0.8\%) if the adverse effects of genetic erosion were ignored.
   However, when the effect of genetic erosion was considered, the
   probability of quasi-extinction within 100 years increased to 17\%
   (0-100\%).
   Mean times to quasi-extinction, conditioned on going quasi-extinct
   within 100 years, was 22 (0-75) years when the effect of genetic erosion
   was considered. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the probability of
   quasi-extinction and expected time until quasi-extinction were most
   sensitive to changes in kitten survival parameters. Without genetic
   management intervention, the Florida panther population would face a
   substantially increased risk of quasi-extinction. The question,
   therefore, is not whether genetic management of the Florida panther
   population is needed but when and how it should be implemented. Thus, we
   evaluated genetic and population consequences of alternative genetic
   introgression strategies to identify optimal management actions using
   individual-based simulation models. Releasing 5 pumas every 20 years
   would cost much less (\$200,000 over 100 years) than releasing 15 pumas
   every 10 years (\$1,200,000 over 100 years) yet would reduce the risk of
   quasi-extinction by comparable amount (44-59\% vs. 40-58\%). Generally,
   releasing more females per introgression attempt provided little added
   benefit. The positive effects of the genetic introgression project
   persist in the panther population after 20 years. We suggest that
   managers contemplate repeating genetic introgression by releasing 5-10
   individuals from other puma populations every 20-40 years. We also
   recommend that managers continue to collect data that will permit
   estimation and monitoring of kitten, adult, and subadult survival. We
   identified these parameters via sensitivity analyses as most critical in
   terms of their impact on the probability of and expected times to
   quasi-extinction. The continuation of long-term monitoring should permit
   the adaptation of genetic management strategies as necessary while
   collecting data that have proved essential in assessing the genetic and
   demographic health of the population. The prospects for recovery of the
   panther will certainly be improved by following these guidelines. (c)

Abstract = {Multiple factors involved in the evolutionary transformation of the
   manus across the maniraptoran radiation, including its current
   morphology in modern birds, remain unexplored. Specifically, the
   morphological disparity of the manus has never been studied
   quantitatively, and there are no hypotheses about the possible
   mechanisms and constraints underlying its evolution. Morphological
   disparity is best studied with shape-analysis tools based on Procrustes
   methods, because they guarantee the independence of shape from size
   while depicting the results in expressive graphics. However, this
   methodology compares fixed configurations of coordinates, preventing
   their use in highly articulated and movable structures such as the
   maniraptoran manus. Here, we propose a new protocol, the one-dimensional
   Procrustes analysis (OPA), for transforming the chord lengths of these
   bones into unidimensional Cartesian coordinates, enabling treatment of
   the data under the operational advantages of the Procrustes methods. Our
   results applying this new method on a sample encompassing 174
   maniraptoran dinosaurs manus, including 79 fossils (both avialan and
   nonavialan taxa) and 95 extant paleognathans and neognathans, document
   the morphological transition between early-diverging maniraptorans,
   nonavialan paravians, and birds over morphospace, highlighting an
   unexpectedly low disparity in the crown group when compared to
   early-diverging taxa. Within this transition, we show a common trend of
   proportional reduction and loss of distal elements, mostly in the minor
   and alular digits. Furthermore, our study reveals an allometric pattern
   characterizing manus morphological variation between early-diverging
   maniraptorans and enantiornithine avialans that disappears in crown
   birds and their closest early-diverging counterparts. This previously
   unnoticed allometric trend suggests a complex interplay of
   developmental, functional, and historical constraints in the evolution
   of the maniraptoran manus.},

Title = {Distance sampling surveys: using components of detection and total error
   to select among approaches},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {210},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wildlife population estimators often require formal adjustment for
   imperfect detection of individuals during surveys. Conventional distance
   sampling (CDS) and its extensions (mark-recapture distance sampling
   {[}MRDS], temporary emigration distance sampling {[}TEDS]) are popular
   approaches for producing unbiased estimators of wildlife abundance.
   However, despite extensive discussion and development of distance
   sampling theory in the literature, deciding which of these alternatives
   is most appropriate for a particular scenario can be confusing. Some of
   this confusion may stem from an incomplete understanding of how each
   approach addresses the components of the detection process. Here we
   describe the proper application of CDS, MRDS, and TEDS approaches and
   use applied examples to help clarify their differing assumptions with
   respect to the components of the detection process. To further aid the
   practitioner, we summarize the differences in a decision tree that can
   be used to identify cases where a more complex alternative (e.g., MRDS
   or TEDS) may be appropriate for a given survey application. Although the
   more complex approaches can account for additional sources of bias, in
   practical applications one also must consider estimator precision.
   Therefore, we also review the concept of total estimator error in the
   context of comparing competing methods for a given application to aid in
   the selection of the most appropriate distance sampling approach.
   Finally, we detail how the use of more advanced techniques (i.e.,
   informed priors, open-population distance sampling models, and
   integrated modeling approaches) can further reduce total estimator error
   by leveraging information from existing and ongoing data collection. By
   synthesizing the existing literature on CDS, MRDS, TEDS and their
   extensions, in conjunction with the concepts of total estimator error
   and the components of the detection process, we provide a comprehensive
   guide that can be used by the practitioner to more efficiently,
   effectively, and appropriately apply distance sampling in a variety of
   settings.},

Abstract = {Melanosomes are membrane-bound organelles of varying geometry, commonly
   found within a range of vertebrate tissues, that contain the pigment
   melanin. Melanosomes have been identified in the fossil record in many
   exceptionally preserved fossils allowing reconstructions of the
   coloration of many extinct animals. However, these microstructures have
   also been interpreted as ``microbial cells{''} or melanin-producing
   bacteria based on their geometric similarities to melanosomes. Here we
   test these two conflicting hypotheses experimentally. Our results
   demonstrate multiple lines of evidence that these fossil microbodies are
   indeed melanosomes: the geometry of decay-associated microbes differs
   significantly from fossil microbodies; fossil microbodies are very
   strongly localized to in vivo melanized tissues and are absent in
   tissues typically unmelanized in vivo, in all fossils examined
   regardless of lithology or age.
   On the basis of these results, as well as a thorough review of existing
   literature on melaninlike pigments, we are able to rule out a bacterial
   origin for fossil microbodies associated with exceptional vertebrate
   fossils and demonstrate that fossil microbodies are in fact preserved
   melanosomes.},

Title = {SOUTH AMERICAN LEAF-CUTTER BEES (GENUS MEGACHILE) OF THE SUBGENERA
   RHYSSOMEGACHILE AND ZONOMEGACHILE, WITH TWO NEW SUBGENERA (HYMENOPTERA:
   MEGACHILIDAE)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2018},

Pages = {1-73},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Leaf-cutter bees (genus Megachile Latreille) are among the most common
   and diverse group of bees. However, the identity and taxonomic placement
   of many species are problematic and species identification is often
   difficult. Some species are known only from a single specimen or from
   one of the sexes, and identification keys are not available for many
   groups. We address these taxonomic issues for the subgenera
   Rhyssomegachile Mitchell and Zonomegachile Mitchell, two poorly known
   South American lineages of leaf-cutter bees. We provide comparative
   diagnoses, redescriptions, illustrated identification keys, new
   geographical records, and designate needed neotypes for Megachile cara
   Mitchell, M. gigas Schrottky, M. guayaqui Schrottky, M. reliqua
   Mitchell, M. sanctipauli Schrottky, M. stabilis Mitchell, and M.
   turbulenta Mitchell. We resurrect M. tricosa Cockerell from synonymy
   with M. urbana Smith and synonymize M. turbulenta under M. tricosa. We
   recognize four species in Rhyssomegachile and eight species in
   Zonomegachile. In the latter subgenus, we revalidate M. reliqua from
   synonymy with M. moderata and propose the following four new species:
   Megachile kalina, new species, from French Guiana; M. durantae, new
   species, from Rondonia, Brazil; M. paisa, new species, from Antioquia,
   Colombia; and M. uncinata, new species, from Catamarca, Argentina. We
   confirm sex associations in Zonomegachile and describe its nest for the
   first time. Megachile tricosa, M. ardua Mitchell, and M. tacanensis
   Moure, currently assigned to Rhyssomegachile, exhibit morphological
   features that do not fit any of the known subgenera. Thus, we use a
   cladistic analysis to explore their phylogenetic relationships and
   establish two new subgenera for these species: Aporiochile Gonzalez and
   Engel, new subgenus, for M. tricosa and Chalepochile Gonzalez and Engel,
   new subgenus, for the remaining two species. We provide an updated key
   to the subgenera of Megachile s.l. of the Western Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {Species concepts are morphologically revised and updated for members of
   the mycophagous genus Hirtodrosophila Duda that occur in America north
   of Mexico. Photomicrographs of external features, illustrations of male
   and female terminalia, and detailed descriptions are provided for 12
   species. One species, H. cinerea (Patterson and Wheeler) is known only
   from the original description; its status is uncertain. Species
   exclusively from the southwestern United States are H. grisea (Patterson
   and Wheeler), H. longala (Patterson and Wheeler), and H. orbospiracula
   (Patterson and Wheeler). Hirtodrosophila alabamensis (Sturtevant) and H.
   duncani (Sturtevant) are widespread throughout the eastern half of North
   America; the latter species is morphologically disparate for
   Hirtodrosophila but provisionally retained in the genus. Hirtodrosophila
   chagrinensis (Stalker and Spencer) is very rare, known only from two
   female specimens from the northern United States. Hirtodrosophila
   ordinaria (Coquillett) is the most widespread species of the genus in
   North America, occurring throughout the northern half of the continent
   up to Alaska; H. shaitanensis (Sidorenko) from far eastern Russia may be
   a junior synonym. A preliminary scheme of relationships in the H.
   melanderi species group (including H. ordinaria) is presented. Two
   species from Florida (H. pictiventris {[}Duda], H. prognatha
   {[}Sturtevant]) and one from Florida plus other Gulf states (H. thoracis
   {[}Williston]) are widespread throughout the Caribbean, Central America,
   and portions of South America. Hirtodrosophila mendeli (Mourao et al.),
   from Brazil, may be a junior synonym of H. prognatha. Two new species
   are described from southern Florida: H. florida, n. sp., and H. jaenikei
   n. sp., the latter in the nigrohalterata species complex. A key to the
   North American species is provided.},

Title = {SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ISLAND-DWELLING KOGAIONIDAE
   (MAMMALIA, MULTITUBERCULATA) IN THE UPPERMOST CRETACEOUS OF TRANSYLVANIA
   (WESTERN ROMANIA)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {456},
Pages = {1-109},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The latest Cretaceous kogaionid multituberculates from Transylvania
   (western Romania) were part of an endemic European clade of mammals that
   underwent an insular radiation at the end of the Cretaceous and then
   survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction that extinguished many
   groups of contemporary therians. Transylvanian kogaionids lived on what
   was an island during the latest Cretaceous-{''}Hateg Island{''}-and
   their fossils are found in the uppermost Campanian to upper
   Maastrichtian deposits of the Hateg, Rusca Montana, and southwestern
   Transylvanian basins. This fossil record has improved dramatically over
   the past several decades, in part resulting from our decade-long joint
   Romanian-American-Scottish fieldwork, and comprises one of the most
   impressive and complete archives of Mesozoic mammals, including not only
   jaws and teeth but several incomplete skulls and partial skeletons.
   We here review the fossil record of kogaionids from Transylvania. We
   report four new occurrences from the Hateg Basin, update information on
   previously described ones, and use our database to reassess the
   chronostratigraphical and geographical distribution of kogaionids and
   their evolutionary patterns.
   Although it was previously suggested that large and small kogaionids had
   largely mutually exclusive spatial distributions, we recognize the
   cooccurrence of small and large taxa in various units, suggesting a
   sympatric distribution across their entire chronostratigraphic range. We
   also identify a novel pattern: small kogaionids appear somewhat earlier
   than their larger relatives in all well-sampled sedimentary successions,
   suggesting that kogaionid colonizations of Hateg Island and component
   regions took place at small body size and that body size increased only
   later through local evolution. We find correlations between body size,
   preservation style, and sedimentary context, which give insight into
   kogaionid paleobiology and diversity. Larger kogaionids are represented
   more often by partial skulls and occasionally skeletons compared with
   small kogaionids, which are usually represented only by isolated teeth,
   regardless of provenance. Larger kogaionids currently have a higher
   recognized local taxic diversity than their smaller relatives. We
   hypothesize that this may be in part a consequence of preservational
   bias related to body size, as more complete specimens may be more easily
   diagnosed as distinct taxa than those that are represented by more
   fragmentary and/or incomplete fossils. If true, the taxic diversity of
   smaller kogaionids may currently be underestimated. Finally, we identify
   correspondence between sedimentary facies and preservation style.
   Red-colored fine-grained rocks, suggestive of well-drained, oxidized
   floodplain paleoenvironments, yield more complete specimens than drab,
   greenish or grayish sediments deposited in more poorly drained parts of
   the floodplain. This pattern may suggest habitat preferences for
   better-drained floodplain environments and a semifossorial lifestyle for
   some taxa.
   As the kogaionid fossil record improves, we can further test the
   hypotheses and patterns outlined above. The pace of new kogaionid
   discoveries by our team and others indicates that a more complete
   picture of kogaionid distribution, paleobiology, and evolution will
   emerge in the coming years, contributing to a more profound
   understanding of this peculiar group of island-dwelling Mesozoic
   mammals.},

Abstract = {Haya griva is an early-diverging neornithischian
   ({''}hypsilophodontid{''}) dinosaur known from several well-preserved
   skulls and articulated postcranial skeletons, in addition to dozens of
   partial or isolated finds from the Upper Cretaceous Khugenetslavkant and
   Zos Canyon localities (Javkhlant Formation and equivalent beds) in the
   Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Collectively, nearly the entire skeletal
   anatomy of Haya is known, including partial growth series of skulls and
   femora. Detailed description and comparisons with other ornithischians,
   including novel anatomical information about the palate and braincase
   gleaned through high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, reveals
   a wealth of osteological data for understanding the growth and
   relationships of this key taxon. Though the Haya specimens span a wide
   size range, bone histology reveals that all are likely perinatal to
   subadult individuals, with specimens of intermediate age the most
   common, and skeletally mature specimens absent. Phylogenetic analyses
   place Haya as one of the few Asian members of Thescelosauridae, an
   important noncerapodan neornithischian group of the Late Cretaceous.},

   ATLANTIC},

Year = {2021},
Number = {444},

Abstract = {Brazil has the longest coastline in South America with more than 7491 km
   of hydrologically and topologically complex continental margin. Despite
   its extensive coast, the sea anemone fauna of the country is sparsely
   known with only 54 species recorded. Difficulties of accessing Brazil's
   highly diversified coast and the historical small number of dredging
   expeditions and sea anemone taxonomists have contributed to the limited
   knowledge of its sea anemone diversity particularly in deep waters. Most
   species recorded from Brazil correspond to large, conspicuous intertidal
   species and only five species have been recorded from depths greater
   than 200 m: two small burrowing edwardslids and three hormathiids from
   the southern coast of Brazil. Here, we provide complete descriptions,
   images of external and internal anatomy, microanatomy, cnidae, and
   geographic distribution for 10 species, six off the coast of Brazil and
   four from the southern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, one of which
   is also present in the Southern Ocean. Four of the six species found in
   Brazil represent new records of geographically widespread species for
   the country and the remaining two endemic species have their geographic
   and bathymetric ranges significantly extended northward. As a result,
   the number of species known for the Brazilian coast is raised to 63
   species, 14 of which are known from the deep sea. We also recorded four
   deep-sea species in the south Mid-Atlantic Ridge (SMAR), including
   Actinernus mercedae, sp. nov., and two new records for the South
   Atlantic. We found that the deep-sea fauna of Brazil shares two deep-sea
   species with Argentina and two with the North Atlantic. Thus, La Plata
   River acts as a filter for shallow water species between Brazil and
   Argentina but is less effective for deep-sea anemones. The diversity of
   sea anemones recorded for SMAR shows similarities to the southwestern
   Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Finally, our finding of representatives of
   Bolocera in the SMAR and Actinoscyphia off the Brazilian coast suggests
   that they are bipolar genera with tropical emergence.},

   systems for the diagnosis of schizomid genera discussed. The integration
   of morphological and molecular data not only increased knowledge of the
   schizomid diversity in the New World but disentangled what was once
   considered a homoplastic and variable morphology in a large
   ``catch-all{''} genus into discrete units each diagnosable by unique
   character combinations.},

Title = {STRATIGRAPHY AND PALEOBIOLOGY OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS-LOWER PALEOGENE
   SEDIMENTS FROM THE TRANS-SAHARAN SEAWAY IN MALI},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {436},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {An epicontinental sea bisected West Africa periodically from the Late
   Cretaceous to the early Eocene, in dramatic contrast to the current
   Sahara Desert that dominates the same region today. Known as the
   Trans-Saharan Seaway, this warm and shallow ocean was a manifestation of
   globally elevated sea level associated with the rapid break-up of the
   supercontinent Gondwana in the late Mesozoic. Although it varied in size
   through time, the Trans-Saharan Seaway is estimated to have covered as
   much as 3000 km(2) of the African continent and was approximately 50 m
   deep. The edges of the sea were defined in part by the high topography
   of the Precambrian cratons and mobile belts of West Africa. Over its
   approximately 50 million year episodic existence, through six major
   periods of transgression and regression, the Trans-Saharan Seaway left
   behind extensive nearshore marine sedimentary strata with abundant
   fossils. The waters that yielded these deposits supported and preserved
   the remains of numerous vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, and microbial
   species that are now extinct. These species document a regional picture
   of ancient tropical life that spanned two major Earth events: the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal
   Maximum (PETM). Whereas extensive epeiric seas flooded the interior
   portions of most continents during these intervals, the emerging
   multicontinental narrative has often overlooked the Trans-Saharan
   Seaway, in part because fundamental research, including the naming of
   geological formations and the primary description and analysis of fossil
   species, remained to be done. We provide such synthesis here based on
   two decades of fieldwork and analyses of sedimentary deposits in the
   Republic of Mali. Northern parts of the Republic of Mali today include
   some of the farthest inland reaches of the ancient sea.
   We bring together and expand on our prior geological and paleontological
   publications and provide new information on ancient sedimentary rocks
   and fossils that document paleoequatorial life of the past. Ours is the
   first formal description of and nomenclature for the Upper Cretaceous
   and lower Paleogene geological formations of this region and we tie
   these names to regional correlations over multiple modern territorial
   boundaries. The ancient seaway left intriguing and previously
   unclassified phosphate deposits that, quite possibly, represent the most
   extensive vertebrate macrofossil bone beds known from anywhere on Earth.
   These bone beds, and the paper shales and carbonates associated with
   them, have preserved a diverse assemblage of fossils, including a
   variety of new species of invertebrates and vertebrates, rare mammals,
   and trace fossils. The shallow marine waters included a wide range of
   paleoenvironments from delta systems, to hypersaline embayments,
   protected lagoons, and carbonate shoals.
   Our overarching goal has been to collect vertebrate fossils tied to a
   K-Pg stratigraphic section in Africa. We provide such a section and,
   consistent with prior ideas, indicate that there is a gap in
   sedimentation in Malian rocks in the earliest Paleocene, an unconformity
   also proposed elsewhere in West Africa. Our phylogenetic analyses of
   several vertebrate clades across the K-Pg boundary have clarified
   clade-by-clade species-level survivorship and range extensions for
   multiple taxa. Few macrofossil species from the Trans-Saharan Seaway
   show conspicuous change at either the K-Pg boundary or the PETM based on
   current evidence, although results are very preliminary. Building on our
   earlier report of the first record of rock-boring bivalves from the
   Paleocene of West Africa, we further describe here a Cretaceous and
   Paleogene mollusk fauna dominated by taxa characteristic of the modern
   tropics. Among the newly discovered fossil osteichthyans, large body
   size characterizes both the pycnodonts and a new freshwater Eocene
   catfish species, one of the largest fossil catfishes found in Africa.
   Our new paleoecological and faunal reconstructions show an evergreen,
   broadleaf forest that included some of the oldest mangroves known. The
   ancient Malian ecosystem had numerous apex predators including
   Crocodyliformes, Serpentes, and Amiidae, some of which were among the
   largest species in their clades. The Trans-Saharan Seaway exhibited
   intermittent isolation from major seas. This environmental variable may
   have created aquatic centers of endemism, stimulating selection for
   gigantism as previously observed for species on terrestrial islands.},

Title = {CRANIAL MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF TRIGONOSTYLOPS
   WORTMANI, AN EOCENE SOUTH AMERICAN NATIVE UNGULATE},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {449},
Pages = {1-183},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {In 1933 George G. Simpson described a remarkably complete skull of
   Trigonostylops, an Eocene South American native ungulate (SANU) whose
   relationships were, in his mind, quite uncertain. Although some
   authorities, such as Florentino Ameghino and William B. Scott, thought
   that a case could be made for regarding Trigonostylops as an
   astrapothere, Simpson took a different position, emphasizing what would
   now be regarded as autapomorphies. He pointed out a number of features
   of the skull of Trigonostylops that he thought were not represented in
   other major clades of SANUs, and regarded these as evidence of its
   phyletic uniqueness. Arguing that the lineage that Trigonostylops
   represented must have departed at an early point from lineages that gave
   rise to other SANU orders, Simpson reserved the possibility that
   Astrapotheriidae might still qualify (in modern terms) as its sister
   group. Even so, he argued that the next logical step was to place
   Trigonostylops and its few known allies in a separate order,
   Trigonostylopoidea, coordinate with Astrapotheria, Notoungulata,
   Litopterna, and Pyrotheria. Simpson's classification was not favored by
   most later authors, and in recent decades trigonostylopids have been
   almost universally assigned to Astrapotheria. However, his evaluation of
   the allegedly unique characters of Trigonostylops and its allies has
   never been systematically treated, which is the objective of this paper.
   Using computed tomography, the skull of Trigonostylops is compared,
   structure by structure, to a variety of representative SANUs as well as
   extant perissodactylans (which together comprise the clade
   Panperissodactyla) and the ``condylarthran{''} Meniscotherium. In
   addition to placing Simpson's character evaluations in a comparative
   context, we also provide detailed assessments of many vascular and
   pneumatization-related features of panperissodactylans never previously
   explored. Overall, we found that this new assessment strengthened the
   placement of Trigonostylops within a monophyletic group that includes
   Astrapotherium and Astraponotus, to the exclusion of other SANU clades.
   Although Trigonostylops cannot be considered as morphologically distinct
   or unusual as Simpson thought, our comparative and phylogenetic analyses
   have helped to generate a number of hypotheses about character evolution
   and function in SANUs that may now be fruitfully tested using other
   taxon combinations.},

Title = {CAUDAL CRANIUM OF THYLACOSMILUS ATROX MAMMALIA, METATHERIA,
   SPARASSODONTA A SOUTH AMERICAN PREDACEOUS SABERTOOTH},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The caudal cranium of the South American sabertooth Thylacosmilus atrox
   (Thylacosmilidae, Sparassodonta, Metatheria) is described in detail,
   with emphasis on the constitution of the walls of the middle ear,
   cranial vasculature, and major nerve pathways. With the aid of micro-CT
   scanning of the holotype and paratype, we have established that five
   cranial elements (squamosal, alisphenoid, exoccipital, petrosal, and
   ectotympanic) and their various outgrowths participate in the tympanic
   floor and roof of this species. Thylacosmilus possessed a U-shaped
   ectotympanic that was evidently situated on the medial margin of the
   external acoustic meatus. The bulla itself is exclusively composed of
   the tympanic process of the exoccipital and rostral and caudal tympanic
   processes of the squamosal. Contrary to previous reports, neither the
   alisphenoid nor the petrosal participate in the actual tympanic floor,
   although they do contribute to the roof. In these regards Thylacosmilus
   is distinctly different from other borhyaenoids, in which the tympanic
   floor was largely membranous (e.g., Borhyaena) and lacked an enlarged
   ectotympanic (e.g., Paraborhyaena). In some respects Thylacosmilus is
   more similar to hathliacynids than to borhyaenoids, in that the former
   also possessed large caudal outgrowths of the squamosal and exoccipital
   that were clearly tympanic processes rather than simply attachment sites
   for muscles. However, hathliacynids also exhibited a large alisphenoid
   tympanic process, a floor component that is absent in Thylacosmilus.
   Habitual head posture was inferred on the basis of inner ear features.
   Large paratympanic spaces invade all of the elements participating in
   bounding the middle ear, another distinctive difference of Thylacosmilus
   compared to other sparassodonts. Arterial and venous vascular
   organization is relatively conservative in this species, although some
   vascular trackways could not have been securely identified without the
   availability of CT scanning. The anatomical correlates of the internal
   carotid in relation to other basicranial structures, the absence of a
   functional arteria diploetica magna, and the network for venous return
   from the endocranium agree with conditions in other sparassodonts.},

Title = {Recent debrachycephalization in Japan},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {126},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This study aimed to show secular changes in the cephalic index (CI) in
   Japan when brachycephalization was reported to have ceased, and examined
   possible causes of the observed changes. Head length and breadth data
   measured on 4034 Japanese adults, born between 1910 and 1996, were used
   to examine the association between birth year and CI using linear and
   quadratic regression analyses. Possible causes of secular changes in CI
   were investigated by examining the secular changes in eight body-size
   variables and 16 environmental indicators, obtained from the government
   statistics records. Results showed that a trend reversal from
   brachycephalization to debrachycephalization occurred among the
   generation born in 1960-1964, followed by trend reversals in birth
   length (BL), energy intake, and birth weight (BW) in that order.
   Previous studies showed that the reverse trend in BW was related to a
   reduction in fetal growth rate, which resulted from worsening fetal
   nutritional status, which was also attributable to decreasing maternal
   energy intake. Since the head measurement at birth is approximately 60\%
   of the adult size, the main cause of debrachycephalization may be
   worsening fetal nutritional status. From the maternal nutritional
   perspective, reverse trends in CI and BL began with rapid recovery from
   the post-war food shortage. However, the body mass index (BMI) of
   20-year-old females decreased due to the very small increase in weight
   despite a rapid increase in height, which was partly achieved by weight
   loss after the age of 17. As speculated, debrachycephalization began
   when the negative effects of decreasing BMI among the young adult
   females outweighed the positive effects of the post-war recovery of the
   food situation. The results of this study may help to understand the
   plasticity of the human body.},

Title = {Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopic reconstruction of human

Abstract = {The reconstruction of everyday diets in villages is important for
   understanding the diversity of diets and commerce networks of food items
   in premodern Japan. However, premodern diets in villages have not been
   well studied compared with those in cities. In this study, stable
   isotope analyses were performed on 23 adult human skeletons excavated
   from Sendaiji, a mountainous woodland village of underground Christians
   in Osaka in premodern Japan. No significant isotopic differences was
   found between individuals identified as Buddhists and those identified
   as Christians or between females and males. The total mean carbon,
   nitrogen, and sulfur isotope ratios were -21.1 +/- 0.4 parts per
   thousand, 11.6 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand, and 8.9 +/- 1.3 parts per
   thousand, respectively. The carbon isotope ratios in Sendaiji were the
   lowest among the studied premodern populations probably because these
   individuals consumed woodland foods that are affected by the canopy
   effect. No significant correlation between sulfur and nitrogen isotope
   ratios was apparent, suggesting that there was little contribution from
   marine foods or marine fertilizers to the diet of individuals in
   premodern Sendaiji. The relatively high nitrogen isotope ratios in
   Sendaiji were possibly because of the denitrification in paddy rice
   fields, ammonium uptake by paddy rice, use of animal fertilizers, and/or
   consumption of freshwater fish. To our knowledge, this is the first
   detailed bioarchaeological study of the premodern diet in a mountainous
   village in western Japan.},

Title = {How did humans acquire erect bipedal walking?},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent fossil records have suggested that human erect bipedal locomotion
   started in Africa probably more than 6 million years ago. However,
   debate continues regarding how locomotion was acquired by our prehuman
   ancestors. Fossils and the genetic traits of recent humans and animals
   cannot answer this question directly. Therefore, the present paper
   reviews acquisition models of human bipedalism and explanations
   regarding how humans acquired bipedalism based on a comparative
   kinesiology of contemporary mammal species. Nonhuman primates are
   adequate models of human bipedal acquisition because of not only the
   phylogenetically close relationship with humans, but also the trend
   toward hindlimb dominance and orthograde positional behavior in daily
   life. Although dissimilar to the erect bipedalism seen in humans,
   nonhuman primates adopt bipedal positional behavior in the wild. All
   nonhuman primates use the arboreal environment, but some groups of
   species utilize the ground predominantly. Compared with relatively
   terrestrial nonhuman primates, relatively arboreal primates show more
   similarities with humans in their bipedal locomotion. Comparisons among
   primate species and between nonhuman primates and nonprimate mammals
   indicate that human-like bipedal characteristics are strongly related to
   arboreal life. Our prehuman ancestors likely started and adapted to
   bipedal locomotion while living in trees; this process is referred to as
   the generalized arboreal activity model. When humans began terrestrial
   locomotion, they likely performed proficient bipedalism from the first
   step. The generalized arboreal activity model presented here does not
   contradict the fossil records.},

Title = {Non-invasive documentation of primate voice production using

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-27},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Electroglottography (EGG) is a low-cost, non-invasive method for
   documenting laryngeal sound production during vocalization. The EGG
   signal represents relative vocal fold contact area and thus delivers
   physiological evidence of vocal fold vibration. While the method has
   received much attention in human voice research over the last five
   decades, it has seen very little application in other mammals. Here, we
   give a concise overview of mammalian vocal production principles. We
   explain how mammalian voice production physiology and the dynamics of
   vocal fold vibration can be documented qualitatively and quantitatively
   with EGG, and we summarize and discuss key issues from research with
   humans. Finally, we review the limited number of studies applying EGG to
   non-human mammals, both in vivo and in vitro. The potential of EGG for
   non-invasive assessment of non-human primate vocalization is
   demonstrated with novel in vivo data of Cebus albifrons and Ateles
   chamek vocalization. These examples illustrate the great potential of
   EGG as a new minimally invasive tool in primate research, which can
   provide important insight into the `black box' that is vocal production.
   A better understanding of vocal fold vibration across a range of taxa
   can provide us with a deeper understanding of several important elements
   of speech evolution, such as the universality of vocal production
   mechanisms, the independence of source and filter, the evolution of
   vocal control, and the relevance of non-linear phenomena.},

Abstract = {We examined fragmentary human skeletal remains from Escalon Cave near
   Surigao City, northeastern Mindanao, the Philippines, with respect to
   the morphology of bones and teeth, radiocarbon dating, and mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. These remains contained parts of the left
   temporal bone, the right humerus, the right femur, the upper right first
   and second premolars, and the first molar. They are presumed to belong
   to an early-middle adult male, whom we named the Escalon Man. Using the
   femur sample, we estimated the C-14 date of the individual at 2692 +/-
   39 years BP (uncalibrated). His stature, estimated from the maximum
   femur length, was about 170 cm this makes him much taller than the Aeta
   and the Mamanwa, who are indigenous negrito hunter-gatherers of the
   Philippines. The femur is sturdy and shows well-developed muscle
   markings. Numerous narrow grooves on the humerus were found in close
   proximity to each other, but we could not prove whether these are
   artificial cut marks made by humans with sharp-edged tools or scratches
   from some non-human entity. The mesiodistal crown diameters of the molar
   and premolars are large and resemble those of native Oceanians. Analysis
   of mtDNA haplogroup was carried out using a DNA sample extracted from a
   molar. A next-generation sequencer was used to determine the nucleotide
   sequences of the mtDNA genome. The results indicated that the Escalon
   Man belongs to the haplogroup Elal a, which is known to be the marker of
   Austronesian-speaking agriculturist populations that originated in
   Taiwan and spread southwards through the Philippines to the Western
   Pacific, since about 4000 BR. Thus, the Escalon Man was likely a member
   of the late Neolithic or early Metal Age agriculturist peoples who
   settled in northeastern Mindanao and who may be the ancestors of the
   territory's present-day occupants, such as the Manobo.},

Abstract = {Recent paleoanthropological surveys conducted in the Lower Awash basin
   (Afar Rift) have led to the discovery of new localities. Here we
   announce and describe the latest addition to the roster of
   hominid-bearing research areas in this basin. Located east of the modern
   Awash River and west of the Megenta mountain ridge, localities in the
   new research area contain extensive clay and silty-sand deposits
   variably capped by a widespread sandstone layer rich in archaeology and
   vertebrate fossils. Some of the localities are associated with volcanic
   tuffs suitable for radioisotopic age determination. A Middle Pleistocene
   antiquity is strongly inferred from the sampled fauna and archaeology;
   precise age estimates await results from ongoing tephra geochronological
   and geochemical analyses. Much of the archaeology falls under the
   conventional category of late Acheulean; assemblages identifiable as
   `Middle' and `Later Stone Age' are documented in a few localities. The
   vertebrate fauna from the closely probed Acheulean and hominid-bearing
   localities indicates a relatively wooded, near-water habitat. The
   cranial and post-cranial fossil hominid (and faunal) remains from the
   new localities promise insights into the patterns of human evolution
   across the Middle Pleistocene, a period currently poorly understood.
   Similarly, the archaeological occurrences provide unique opportunities
   for testing outstanding hypotheses about the origin of nuanced
   technologies and behaviors across the later Middle Pleistocene.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that acquired syphilis evolved in the Old World
   from a non-sexually transmitted treponeme originating in the New World
   during early European expansion and colonization. However, when and via
   which route the bacteria were introduced into Asia remains uncertain.
   This study examined the first paleopathological evidence of syphilitic
   infection in an individual from the 19th century AD in South Korea. The
   individuals from a site identified as the middle and late Joseon period
   were examined for the presence of the skeletal lesions that are
   indicative of an acquired syphilitic infection. Direct macroscopic
   observation of the skeletal remains was conducted alongside radiological
   analysis. One individual displayed extensive pathologies throughout the
   cranial and postcranial skeleton. Treponematosis is the only disease
   that best explains the pattern of lytic cranial lesions and widespread
   bilateral symmetrical periosteal new bone of the postcranial elements.
   To date, paleopathological evidence of treponemal disease in Asia is
   severely limited. In this regard, this study provides meaningful data
   for studying the history of infectious disease in Asia. This study
   represents the only known archaeological case in South Korea.},

Abstract = {Domesticated camelids spread to Peru's Northern Highlands by 500 BC. The
   complexity and development of the society that then developed in the
   region have been explained by social networks enabled by the use of the
   llama as a cargo animal. However, the actual use of domesticated
   camelids in the Formative Period remains unclear. This study analyzed
   camelid skeletal remains excavated from the Pacopampa site (1200-400 BC)
   to provide information on the actual use of these animals. Osteometry
   determined the camelid to be llama; alpaca was not identified in the
   samples. Body part frequency, butchering mark distribution, and
   mortality profile revealed ritual consumption of the meaty part of young
   individuals. Four sacrificed immature llamas were detected. In contrast
   to the great similarity with the consumption process of artiodactyls'
   only llamas were sacrificed, while deer were not targeted. Although them
   were no features in the animal bone material indicating the use of
   secondary products, the increasing number of artifacts related to
   textile production suggest the fiber might be the result of llama
   herding.},

Abstract = {This paper examines periodontal disease as well as other oral health
   indicators of the Jomon population in order to understand variations in
   their lifestyle and their response to dietary diversity. The oral
   conditions of three Jomon populations in Late Jomon period are evaluated
   using two periodontal indicators, namely the distance measured between
   the cement-enamel junction to the alveolar crest (CEJ-AC distance), and
   the degree of inflammation of the alveolar septum. The incidence of
   affected individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease ranges
   from 31.8\% to 38.6\% based on the evaluation of the CEJ-AC distance,
   and from 38.4\% to 66.0 \% based on the interdental septum morphology,
   respectively. Comparisons of the inter-site difference (which includes
   that between coastal and inland populations) and sex differences were
   conducted with a combined dataset of the periodontal and oral health
   indicators (caries, antemortem tooth loss, wear, and chipping). The
   results indicated that inter-site and inter-sex differences are smaller
   in the cases with periodontal disease than in those with caries and
   antemortem tooth loss. In particular, almost no difference was found in
   the periodontal conditions between the coastal and inland sites.
   Although previous studies have indicated the effect of occlusal wear on
   the CEJ-AC distance, the results of the multivariate analysis show that
   the inflammation of the inter dental septum is more relevant than the
   occlusal wear. In addition, the sex difference was significant compared
   to the inter-site difference, and each sex difference within a site
   showed a common trend. Detected inter-site and sex differences are
   discussed and assumed to be associated with bioarchaeological
   background.},

Abstract = {The excavation of the Shomyoji shell midden in 2017 recovered more than
   26 human skeletal remains belonging to the Jomon, Kofun, and Heian
   periods. In this paper, we describe one Heian-period (AD 794-1185)
   individual (SK1), who was dated to 957-900 calBP by radiocarbon dating.
   SKI is well preserved, presumably a male, and aged approximately 20-35
   years. The morphology of the cranium and teeth are not similar to that
   seen in the Kanto Jomon and Kamakura populations; it is closer to that
   of Yayoi immigrants from northern Kyusyu. SK1 has a severe lesion around
   the hip joint, and the left innominate bone and femur are atrophied.
   From this lesion, we can presume that SK1 had suffered from a hip joint
   disease such as tuberculous arthritis of the hip.},

Abstract = {Cranial vault thickness is a widely studied variable in physical
   anthropology. However, direct physical measurements are difficult to
   assess in complete skulls, where the endocranial surface is not easily
   accessible for standard callipers. Computed tomography represents the
   best alternative, but is expensive and not always available for many
   field or museum samples. In this study we present a method for the
   measurement of cranial vault thickness based on magnetism. We measured
   bone thickness at 71 points of the vault in 30 human skulls with the use
   of a portable magnetic calliper, which offers a simple, direct,
   non-invasive, and cost-effective methodology. Magnetic measures were
   compared with physical measures sampled with a traditional spreading
   calliper, and error analysis was assessed. Thickness distribution was
   evaluated and represented in bidimensional maps after spatial
   interpolation. The two types of callipers provide the same results,
   suggesting that the magnetic calliper can be used in those situations in
   which a traditional calliper is not applicable. In accordance with
   previously published data, the most variable and thickest bones in our
   sample were the frontal and the occipital bones, and cranial vault
   thickness distribution follows a pattern of increasing thickness from
   lateral regions of the vault to the sagittal plane. The magnetic
   calliper is a reliable and effective tool to measure cranial thickness
   in those cases in which the endocranial surface is not easily
   accessible, and where expensive technology cannot be employed for
   economic or practical reasons.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that the Jomon people are considerably
   genetically different from any other population, including modern-day
   Japanese. This gives rise to an intriguing question: when after the
   Jomon era did this drastic change of genetic features occur? The
   Shomyoji shell midden site in Kanagawa, Japan can provide some clues to
   address this question. The skeletons buried at this site include some
   that are more recent than the Jomon-era skeletons with whom they are
   almost contiguously buried. We tested the genetic continuity of the
   Shomyoji shell midden people by analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Our
   results show that the mtDNA haplogroups of the Kofun and Heian skeletons
   vastly differ from those of the Jomon skeletons. This finding implies
   that the genetic conversion of the Japanese people may have occurred
   during or before the Kofun era, at least at the Shomyoji site. To
   confirm this hypothesis, nuclear genome analysis of the Shomyoji people
   is considered promising.},

Abstract = {The Japanese medieval period encompassed almost 400 years, between 1185
   and 1573 AD. Previous research of human skeletal remains from medieval
   Kamakura City has shown that medieval people had a poor level of health
   and general living conditions because of malnutrition and interpersonal
   violence. The aims of this study are to apply bioarchaelogical analyses
   to a new series of human skeletal remains from the Nozoji-ato site in
   Kamakura City and to test the hypothesis that the bioarchaeological
   features that characterize medieval Japanese people are commonly seen in
   the new skeletal series. The Nozoji-ato site has been dated to a
   chronological age of between 1500 and 1700 AD based on the known
   sequence of coins and vessels, but most of these artefacts belonged to
   the medieval period. A sample size of 45 individuals was used in this
   study from individual graves. The results of this study indicate that
   the sample from Nozoji-ato is characterized by an old age-at-death
   distribution and high number of caries-lesion and ante-mortem tooth loss
   frequencies. Individuals from the Nozoji-ato site also tend to lack
   evidence for lethal trauma, a phenomenon that is frequently observed in
   other comparative medieval populations. The results presented in this
   study led to the conclusion that the Nozoji-ato exhibit different
   bioarchaeological features compared to the populations from the first
   half of the medieval period and that living conditions at this site were
   less severe than expected.},

Abstract = {The Pacopampa site is one of the largest Formative Period sites in
   Peru's northern highlands. In the 2013 field season, we uncovered human
   remains from the stairs between the second and third platforms and found
   a rare case of a depressed skull fracture on the cranial vault of a
   middle-aged male. This study aims to describe the fracture and explore
   chronological changes in violence in Peru's northern u - highlands. The
   radiocarbon date of this male is 910 +/- 30 C-14 yr BP, which
   corresponds to the Late Cajamarca Period (AD 950-1200). The fracture is
   elliptical in shape, 23.7 mm long and 23.3 mm wide. Depressed debris,
   adhering to part of the vault, entered the cranial cavity and may have
   compressed dura mater and brain substance. A healing reaction formed a
   smooth edge around the fracture, suggesting that it is an antemortem
   fracture and that the individual survived the injury. It is reasonable
   to infer that the presence of trauma on the Pacopampa cranium is
   consistent with the sociopolitical background, typified by high social
   tension and the appearance of organized warfare in Andean societies.},

Title = {Effects of Hunting on a Puma Population in ColoradoEffets de la Chasse

Abstract = {We investigated effects of regulated hunting on a puma (Puma concolor)
   population on the Uncompahgre Plateau (UPSA) in southwestern Colorado,
   USA. We examined the hypothesis that an annual harvest rate averaging
   15\% of the estimated number of independent individuals using the study
   area would result in a stable or increasing abundance of independent
   pumas. We predicted hunting mortality would be compensated by 1) a
   reduction in other causes of mortality, thus overall survival would stay
   the same or increase; 2) increased reproduction rates; or 3) increased
   recruitment of young animals. The study occurred over 10 years
   (2004-2014) and was designed with a reference period (years 1-5; i.e.,
   RY1-RY5) without puma hunting and a treatment period (years 6-10; i.e.,
   TY1-TY5) with hunting. We captured and marked pumas on the UPSA and
   monitored them year-round to examine their demographics, reproduction,
   and movements. We estimated abundance of independent animals using the
   UPSA each winter during the Colorado hunting season from reference year
   2 (RY2) to treatment year 5 (TY5) using the Lincoln-Petersen method. In
   addition, we surveyed hunters to investigate how their behavior
   influenced harvest and the population. We captured and marked 110 and
   116 unique pumas in the reference and treatment periods, respectively,
   during 440 total capture events. Those animals produced known-fate data
   for 75 adults, 75 subadults, and 118 cubs, which we used to estimate
   sex- and life stage-specific survival rates. In the reference period,
   independent pumas more than doubled in abundance and exhibited high
   survival. Natural mortality was the major cause of death to independent
   individuals, followed by other human causes (e.g., vehicle strikes,
   depredation control). In the treatment period, hunters killed 35
   independent pumas and captured and released 30 others on the UPSA.
   Abundance of independent pumas using the UPSA declined 35\% after 4
   years of hunting with harvest rates averaging 15\% annually. Harvest
   rates at the population scale, including marked independent pumas with
   home ranges exclusively on the UPSA, overlapping the UPSA, and on
   adjacent management units were higher, averaging 22\% annually in the
   same 4 years leading to the population decline. Adult females comprised
   21\% of the total harvest. The top-ranked model explaining variation in
   adult survival (S) indicated a period effect interacting with sex.
   Annual adult male survival was higher in the reference period (S = 0.96,
   95\% CI = 0.75-0.99) than in the treatment period (S = 0.40, 95\% CI =
   0.22-0.57). Annual adult female survival was 0.86 (95\% CI = 0.72-0.94)
   in the reference period and 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.63-0.82) in the treatment
   period. The top subadult model showed that female subadult survival was
   constant across the reference and treatment periods (S = 0.68, 95\% CI =
   0.43-0.84), whereas survival of subadult males exhibited the same trend
   as that of adult males: higher in the reference period (S = 0.92, 95\%
   CI = 0.57-0.99) and lower in the treatment period (S = 0.43, 95\% CI =
   0.25-0.60). Cub survival was best explained by fates of mothers when
   cubs were dependent (S-mother alive = 0.51, 95\% CI = 0.35-0.66;
   S-mother died = 0.14, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.34). The age distribution for
   independent pumas skewed younger in the treatment period.
   Adult males were most affected by harvest; their abundance declined by
   59\% after 3 hunting seasons and we did not detect any males >6 years
   old after 2 hunting seasons. Pumas born on the UPSA that survived to
   subadult stage exhibited both philopatry and dispersal. Local
   recruitment and immigration contributed to positive growth in the
   reference period, but recruitment did not compensate for the losses of
   adult males and partially compensated for losses of adult females in the
   treatment period. Average birth intervals were similar in the reference
   and treatment periods (reference period = 18.3 months, 95\% CI =
   15.5-21.1; treatment period = 19.4 months, 95\% CI = 16.2-22.6), but
   litter sizes (reference period = 2.8, 95\% CI = 2.4-3.1; treatment
   period = 2.4, 95\% CI = 2.0-2.8) and parturition rates (reference period
   = 0.63, 95\% CI = 0.49-0.75; treatment period = 0.48, 95\% CI =
   0.37-0.59) declined slightly in the treatment period. Successful hunters
   used dogs, selected primarily males, and harvested pumas in 1-2 days
   (median). We found that an annual harvest rate at the population scale
   averaging 22\% of the independent pumas over 4 years and with >20\%
   adult females in the total harvest greatly reduced abundance. At this
   scale, annual mortality rates of independent animals from hunting
   averaged 6.3 times greater than from all other human causes and 4.6
   times greater than from all natural causes during the population
   decline. Hunting deaths were largely additive and reproduction and
   recruitment did not compensate for this mortality source. Hunters
   generally selected male pumas, resulting in a decline in their survival
   and abundance, and the age structure of the population. We recommend
   that regulated hunting in a source-sink structure be used to conserve
   puma populations, provide sustainable hunting opportunities, and address
   puma-human conflicts. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

Title = {Evaluation of Maternal Penning to Improve Calf Survival in the Chisana
   Caribou Herdevaluation des Enclos de Maternite pour Ameliorer la Survie

Abstract = {Predation is a major limiting factor for most small sedentary caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus) populations, particularly those that are threatened
   or endangered across the southern extent of the species' range. Thus,
   reducing predation impacts is often a management goal for improving the
   status of small caribou populations, and lethal predator removal is the
   primary approach that has been applied. Given that predator control
   programs are often contentious, other management options that can garner
   broader public acceptance need to be considered. Substantial calf losses
   to predation in the few weeks following birth are common for these small
   caribou populations. Therefore, we employed a novel experimental
   approach of maternal penning with the goal of reducing early calf
   mortality in the Chisana Caribou Herd, a declining population in
   southwest Yukon and adjacent Alaska thought to number around 300
   individuals. Maternal penning entailed temporarily holding pregnant
   females on their native range in a large pen secure from predators from
   late March through the initial weeks of calf rearing to mid-June. During
   2003-2006, we conducted 4 annual penning trials with 17-50 pregnant
   females each year (n = 146 total), assessed survival of calves born in
   the pens, and evaluated survival and nutritional effects of penning for
   females that were held. We also investigated the herd's population
   dynamics during 2003-2008 to determine effects of maternal penning on
   calf recruitment and population growth. In addition to information
   gained during maternal penning, we determined natality and survival
   patterns via radiotelemetry, conducted autumn age-sex composition
   surveys each year, and censused the population in mid-October 2003,
   2005, and 2007. Based on our penning trials and demographic
   investigations, we used simulation models to evaluate the effects of
   maternal penning relative to a population's inherent growth rate (finite
   rate of increase {[}lambda] without maternal penning) and penning effort
   (proportion of calves born in penning) to provide perspective on utility
   of this approach for improving the status of small imperiled caribou
   populations. Pregnant females held in maternal penning tolerated
   captivity well in that they exhibited positive nutritional responses to
   ad libitum feed we provided and higher survival than free-ranging
   females (0.993 and 0.951 for penned and free-ranging females,
   respectively). Survival of pen calves from birth to mid-June was
   substantially higher than that of free-ranging calves (x- = 0.950 and
   0.376, respectively). This initial period accounted for 76\% of the
   annual calf mortality in the free-ranging population. Pen-born calves
   maintained their survival advantage over wild-born calves to the end of
   their first year (x over bar = 0.575 and 0.192, respectively) during
   years penning occurred. Females in the Chisana Herd were highly
   productive with 57\% producing their first offspring at 2 years of age,
   and annual natality rates averaging 0.842 calves/female >= 2 years old.
   Age-specific natality rates exceeded 0.900 for 4-9-year-olds, then
   exhibited senescent decline to 0.467 by 19 years old. Annual survival of
   free-ranging adult females and calves averaged 0.892 and 0.184,
   respectively, over all study years; both were reduced during 2004
   because of poor winter survival. We noted reduced nutritional condition
   of caribou late that winter in that females we captured were lighter
   than in other years and produced lighter calves.
   We suspect that the reduced survival during winter 2004 and the observed
   nutritional characteristics resulted from adverse snow conditions in
   combination with effects of the extreme drought experienced the previous
   summer. Age-specific survival of adult females was >= 0.900 through 10
   years of age, then declined with age. The Chisana Herd numbered 720
   caribou in mid-October 2003, or more than twice that estimated prior to
   initiating maternal penning, and increased to 766 caribou by mid-October
   2007. We calculated that penning added 54.2 yearling recruits, or 40\%
   of calves released from penning. Based on the maternal penning results
   and the population's vital rates, we determined that the herd would have
   been stable during 2003-2007 at about 713 caribou without maternal
   penning; thus, the increase in herd size we observed resulted from
   maternal penning and was equivalent to the estimate of additional
   yearling recruits. The improvement in the population trend invoked by
   maternal penning was limited by the larger than expected population size
   and resulting low penning effort (x over bar = 11\% of calves born in
   pen). Our simulations corroborated that maternal penning increased
   population size by the number of additional recruits provided, even at
   low penning effort, for inherently stable populations. As the inherent
   rate of increase dropped below lambda = 1.000, more of the additional
   recruits from penning were needed to offset the downward population
   inertia, thus requiring increased penning effort to reach stability. For
   populations declining at lambda < 0.890, stability could not be achieved
   with 100\% penning effort given the vital rates in our models. Maternal
   penning in its limited application to date has proven to be broadly
   popular as a nonlethal management action aimed at reducing initial calf
   mortality from predation in small caribou populations. However, based on
   the Chisana program and 3 subsequent efforts elsewhere, improvement in
   population trends have been modest at best and come at a high financial
   cost. Given the necessity of maximizing penning effort, maternal penning
   may have a role in addressing conservation challenges for some small
   caribou populations that are stable or slowly declining, but its
   application should be primarily driven by objective assessment of the
   likelihood of improving population trends rather than popularity
   relative to other management options.},

Abstract = {Verteba Cave (VC) in western Ukraine dates to the Eneolithic period (c.
   5500 YBP), and contains the largest collection yet found of human
   skeletal remains associated with the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture. The
   subsistence economy of this people was based on agropastoralism, and
   included some of the largest and densest Middle Neolithic settlement
   sites in all of Europe. To understand further the evolutionary history
   of the Tripolye people, we examined population genetics patterns in
   mitochondrial DNA from ancient human remains excavated from VC chambers.
   From five commingled and secondary burial sites within the cave, we
   obtained 368 bp mtDNA HVR1 sequences from 22 individuals assignable to
   eight haplogroups: H (three haplotypes), HV (two haplotypes), W, K, and
   T. Overall nucleotide diversity is low (pi = 0.00621). The two largest
   samples, from Chamber G3 and Site 7, were significantly differentiated
   with respect to haplotype composition: G3 (n = 8) is dominated by
   haplotype W (pi = 0), whereas Site 7 (n = 15) is dominated by H
   haplotypes (pi = 0.00439). Tajima's D as an indication of population
   expansion was not significantly negative for the complete sample (D =
   -1.37) or for sites G3 (D = -0.973) and 7 (D = -1.35), which were
   analyzed separately. Individuals from the Tripolye culture buried at VC
   c. 5500 YBP had predominantly haplogroup H and related haplotypes. This
   contrasts with predominantly haplogroup U individuals in preEneolithic
   peoples from the same area, which suggests lack of genetic continuity in
   a site that has been dated to the Mesolithic. Peoples of the Tripolye
   culture are more closely related to other early European farmers than to
   Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and/or preEneolithic cultures.},

Abstract = {Using computed tomography, we examined the surface and internal
   morphologies of the upper face of people living on the Ryukyu Islands
   and mainland Japanese, focusing on the nasal root protrusion and eyeball
   position. The results showed that the nasal root protrusion on the
   surface was influenced by a combination of changes in both hard and soft
   tissues, such as skeletal nasal protrusion, eyeball recession, and skin
   thickness. The eyeball position became more posterior as the orbital
   cavity height and depth increased. Compared with people originating from
   mainland Japan, Ryukyu Islanders had a more prominent nasal root at both
   surface and skeletal levels, and a lower orbital rim relative to its
   internal height. However, a significant difference in the eyeball
   position and skin thickness was not detected. Therefore, the skeletal
   nasal root protrusion, not soft tissue configuration, is likely to
   account for the difference in the surface nasal root protrusion between
   the two populations. These findings will contribute to a better
   understanding of the association between hard and soft tissue
   configurations and the diversification of human facial features at the
   individual and population levels.},

Title = {A case study of cut marks on camelid bones from the El Palacio site in
   the northern highlands of Peru: implication of butchering activities},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {151-164},
Abstract = {South American camelids, which were domesticated in the Central Andes,
   have been emphasized for their secondary uses (e.g. llamas as pack
   animals and alpacas for their wool). In modern pastoral societies the
   use of mature animals for meat is not efficient. However, it is
   interesting that cut marks have often been found on archaeological
   animal bones. This study aimed to describe butchering of camelids
   through macroscopic observation of cut marks in the Middle Horizon
   period, during the Wari Empire (600-1000 CE), when the use of camelids
   reached its peak, and to test whether these activities are consistent
   with ethnoarchaeological and ethnographic findings. The materials used
   here are camelid bones with cut marks from El Palacio in the northern
   highlands of Peru. They were assigned to Middle Cajamarca Phases B and
   C, and a part of the Late Cajamarca Phase (800-1000 CE). In this study,
   cut marks on animal bones were observed by macroscopy, and analyses were
   focused on their distribution, frequencies, and direction. Cut marks on
   camelid bones from El Palacio were observed over the entire body,
   suggesting that these marks were caused by dismembering, skinning, and
   extraction of meat, fat, and marrow. The frequencies of cut marks on
   camelid bones at El Palacio was 1.3\%, lower than that in the Formative
   Period. This lower frequency might have been caused by more fragmented
   bones in the former. Furthermore, it is possible that the use of
   secondary products was emphasized at El Palacio. Cut marks were
   concentrated on the ventral side of each bone. This can be attributed to
   the butchering procedure described from ethnoarchaeology and
   ethnography, in which animal was turned on its back for dismemberment
   and removal of its internal organs from the ventral side, being careful
   not to soil the earth for ritual considerations.},

Abstract = {The orbital shape is one of the most ambiguous features for
   morphological study in ancestry estimation. Recent research has used
   digital image analysis to obtain more objective and better results. The
   aim of this study was to create a method and formula to determine
   ancestry using image analysis of orbital shapes from skulls of Thai and
   Japanese individuals. This pilot study applied two-dimensional digital
   image processing techniques to analyze 440 skulls comprising 220 modern
   Thai and 220 modern Japanese samples of known identities. The image
   analysis involved four steps: pre-processing, segmentation, feature
   extraction, and classification. Five shape measurements of both the left
   and right orbital rims were selected and a formula was derived using
   multivariate discriminant analysis. Another set of 68 Thai and Japanese
   skulls was used as a blind test set for accuracy. The formula had a
   predicted and cross-validated accuracy of 80.7\% and a tested accuracy
   of 86.8\%. This methodology potentially increases the utility of orbital
   shapes for ancestry estimation, especially between these two subgroups
   of Asians.},

Abstract = {Paleolithic evidence of the Indian subcontinent is often expressed
   through the wealth of lithic antiquities from the Stone Age. In this
   region, the earliest known lithic remains comprise simple cores and
   flakes recovered from the Siwalik Hills. The Siwalik Hills are the
   foothills of the southern edge of the Himalayas, and area goldmine zone
   for Soanian lithic implements. Although Acheulean remains have also been
   reported, their occurrences are few. Nevertheless. these remains have
   been known date from the Pleistocene, which shows varied patterns of
   land use and intraregional versatility. In the Siwalik Hills, Soanian
   implements are of two kinds: (i) a chopper type of the Lower Paleolithic
   period and (ii) a flake type belonging to the Middle Paleolithic period.
   The present study was undertaken at a newly discovered Stone Age
   locality, Bam, located within the frontal range of the Siwalik Hills in
   the Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh, India. The area under study
   plays an important role in understanding the relationship between people
   and land. The paper explores the Soanian cultural remains of the site to
   obtain an in-depth understanding of its nature against the backdrop of
   raw material availability and exploitation. The study also throws light
   on the local geological and geomorphological settings of the area.},

Abstract = {The relationship between calcaneal size and body mass in extant primates
   and other land mammals is examined using regression analyses to provide
   simple equations for estimating the body mass of extinct primate and
   land mammal species based on the calcaneus. The results imply that among
   the linear calcaneal dimensions, the calcaneal width at the talar
   articular surfaces (CA2) is likely the best body mass estimator for land
   mammals (including primates), and the width of the posterior talar
   articular surface (CA3) appears to be relatively good body mass
   estimator for primates. The equation with a 95\% prediction interval for
   estimating the body mass (BM, in g) using CA2 (in mm) for land mammals
   is: BM = exp(2.928 x In CA2 + 0.981 +/- 0.772) x 1.076; the
   corresponding equation using CA3 (in mm) for primates is: BM = exp(2.555

Abstract = {Previous studies suggested two major migration events during the Jomon
   and Yayoi periods that affected the genetic diversity of modern Japanese
   (Yaponesians). We explored the possibility of a three-wave migration
   model by examining three datasets of modern human DNA: (1) whole
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes of 1642 Yaponesians; (2) mtDNA haplogroup
   frequencies of 59105 Yaponesians from 47 prefectures; and (3)
   genome-wide SNP data of two Yaponesians (Ainu, Okinawa) and whole-genome
   sequence data of Yamato individuals. the Funadomari Jomon F23
   individual, and three East Asian populations (Korean, northern Chinese,
   and southern Chinese). Past population size change was estimated based
   on dataset 1, and we clearly observed a steep population increase after
   the Yayoi period. Principal-component analysis and phylogenetic network
   analysis were applied to dataset 2, and we confirmed the pattern
   consistent with our model. An admixture program was used on dataset 3,
   and we found that the two- and three-layer migration models are both
   compatible with these SNP data. Taken together, these three datasets
   provide support for our three-wave, `inner dual-structure' model.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {128},

Abstract = {Swiss naturalists Paul and Fritz Sarasin visited Sri Lanka on five
   occasions. Their later visits were focused on anthropological research
   on the Indigenous Wannila Atto ('Vedda') people and exploration of
   prehistoric settlements in Sri Lanka. Among the Sarasins'
   anthropological and archaeological collections are skeletal material of
   several ethnic groups of Sri Lanka belonging to the 19th and early 20th
   centuries. This collection is curated at the Natural History Museum of
   Basel, Switzerland. The ethnolinguistic groups represented in the
   Sarasins' collection include the `Vedda,' Tamil, and Sinhala people of
   Sri Lanka, and it constitutes the largest `Vedda' cranial collection
   housed at a single institution. The objective of this paper is to
   compare cranial variation of the Indigenous `Vedda' and other Sri Lankan
   ethnic groups using this important dataset, while publishing the raw
   craniometric data for further studies. Observations on the dentition
   show that the Tamil and Sinhala individuals had high incidences of
   caries and dental abscesses that are typically associated with
   agriculturalists and that cribra orbitalia associated with iron
   deficiency was relatively common among all three ethnic groups. Betel
   quid chewing for recreational and cultural purposes, a practice that is
   widespread even today, had left dark stains on the teeth of many
   individuals of all groups in the sample. Multivariate statistical
   analyses on the craniometric data show that there is significant overlap
   among the three ethnic groups in terms of cranial shape. These findings
   underscore the importance of considering the `Vedda,' Tamil, and Sinhala
   groups from Sri Lanka as closely related, due to gene flow over
   millennia.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {The origins of people in the Japanese archipelago are of long-standing
   interest among anthropologists, archeologists, linguists, and historians
   studying the history of Japan. While the `dualstructure' model proposed
   by Hanihara in 1991 has been considered the primary working hypothesis
   for three decades, recent advances in DNA typing and sequencing
   technologies provide an unprecedented amount of present-day and ancient
   human nuclear gnome data, which enable us to refine or extend the
   dual-structure model. In this review, we summarize recent genome
   sequencing efforts of present-day and ancient people in Asia, mostly
   focusing on East Asia, and we discuss the possible migration routes and
   admixture patterns of Japanese ancestors. We also report on a
   meta-analysis we performed by compiling publicly available datascts to
   clarify the genetic relationships of present-day and ancient Japanese
   populations with surrounding populations. Because the ancient genetic
   data from the Japanese archipelago have not yet been fully analyzed, we
   have to corroborate models of prehistoric human movement using not only
   new genetic data but also linguistic and archeological data to
   reconstruct a more comprehensive history of the Japanese people.},

Abstract = {The intertrochanteric line on the proximal human femur has been the
   focus of paleoanthro-pological study for several decades, as it is
   thought to be a defining characteristic of bipedalism. Expression of
   this trait is highly variable in human fossils. However, the relatively
   narrow range of modern human groups in which its expression has been
   documented limits understanding of its variability and interpretation of
   its meaning. Our study analyzed variation in the expression of the
   intertrochanteric line in a population comprising young, middle and old
   age groups living in the 19th-20th centuries in Kunming city,
   southwestern China. Results showed that this trait was not equally
   present in all age groups. Statistical analyses revealed significant
   differences in frequencies of absence between the age groups, and also
   highlighted strong correlations between age and the degree of expression
   of the intertrochanteric line. It was more frequently absent or subtly
   expressed in young individuals, while individuals in the middle and old
   age groups tended to exhibit a more pronounced expression of this
   feature. The degree of expression of the intertrochanteric line also
   differed significantly between sexes, and it was significantly
   positively correlated with body size. Interestingly, the degree of
   expression of the intertrochanteric line rarely exhibited significant
   correlations with magnitudes of cross-sectional geometric properties of
   the femoral diaphysis, used as proxy measurements for physical activity
   patterns.},

Abstract = {The study of sound production mechanisms is a crucial, yet understudied,
   aspect of vocal communication research in vertebrates. In excised larynx
   experimentation (ELE), phonation is simulated ex vivo by forcing air
   through a larynx specimen mounted on a laboratory bench. The method
   provides unique insights into vocal production and allows inference of
   in vivo conditions. Here, we provide a historical overview of how this
   technique has been implemented, from antiquity to current
   state-of-theart setups. We review the advances made by applying ELE to
   human voice and biophysics research. We then highlight the promising
   research output resulting from ELE in animal bioacoustics, a research
   field that has largely overlooked the use of this method until very
   recently, but is now increasingly relying on this tool. We continue by
   discussing the limitations of ELE, depending on the focus of
   investigation. Finally, we suggest how this approach should be
   implemented and can be applied to various research questions. We
   conclude by underlining the value that ELE contributes to the
   comprehension of human voice as well as mammalian and avian vocal
   communication within an interdisciplinary approach.},

Abstract = {Telomere length has recently gained popularity as a biomarker of
   aging-related diseases. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples are commonly used
   to measure telomere length for human biology research, but studies
   assessing intra- and inter-assay variations are scarce. The objective of
   the present study was to analyze and elucidate the extent of intra- and
   inter-assay variation of DBS telomere length measurement. The DBS
   telomere length of a male subject was determined by quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using four different protocols with two
   different container types (96-well plates and 8-well tubes) and two
   different primer sets (tel1b-tel2b and tel1-tel2). The measurement of
   telomere length with 8-well tubes and the tel1-tel2 primer set
   demonstrated the lowest intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV)
   (6.0\%) and gave an inter-assay CV of 5.0\%. The protocol for 96-well
   plates typically resulted in high intra-assay CVs (>27\%). Assessment of
   intra-assay variation is essential when DBS telomere length is measured
   by qPCR.},

Title = {New forelimb long bone specimens of Nacholapithecus kerioi from the

Abstract = {This article reports eight new humeral, ulnar, and radial fragments of
   Nacholapithecus kerioi collected from Nachola, Kenya during the
   1998/1999 field seasons. The study refines the description of its
   forelimb bones, which was mostly based on a single partial skeleton. The
   most distinctive feature of the distal humerus is a large, globular,
   medially tilted capitulum. The groove between the capitulum and the zona
   conoidea is quite deep. The medial part of the humeral trochlea is also
   diagnostic in showing a less salient medial border. The medial
   epicondyle is moderately long and more posteriorly reflected than was
   previously presumed. The coronoid process of the ulna is quite wide. Its
   medial portion is distinctly concave. The ulnar shaft is
   anteroposteriorly deep in its proximal half, slender, straight in
   frontal view, and weakly anteriorly bowing. The elbow of Nacholapithecus
   exhibits a primitive functional pattern as a hominoid, including lack of
   universal stability of the humeroulnar joint through full extension and
   flexion, restriction of hyperextension of the elbow, and relatively
   anteroposteriorly oriented loading at the proximal ulna. On the other
   hand, it is derived in terms of enhanced rotational mobility and
   stability of the radius, incipiently increased stability at the
   humeroulnar joint, and more frequent maximum extension of the elbow
   compared to proconsulids. This mosaic morphology is different from both
   early Miocene proconsulids and later suspensory or orthograde European
   fossil apes. Although Nacholapithecus was neither suspensory nor
   orthograde, its forelimbs may have played a greater role for body
   support or balance maintenance, more frequently reaching to and
   exploiting overhead supports than in early Miocene proconsulids.},

Title = {Tooth size and its proportional variability in Japanese males with
   agenesis in permanent dentition},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},
Number = {2},
Pages = {75-87},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We studied the relationship of tooth agenesis with tooth size and its
   proportional variability (PV) based on mesiodistal crown diameters of
   276 Japanese males including 49 individuals for reference. Tooth
   agenesis was classified into third molar agenesis, hypodontia, and
   multiple agenesis. In addition, third molar agenesis was classified into
   four types according to the number of congenitally missing third molars.
   PV was measured by standard deviation of log -transformed data. The size
   of remaining teeth was generally larger in the agenesis groups than in
   the reference group, and largest in individuals with hypodontia,
   followed by those with multiple agenesis and those with third molar
   agenesis. The findings suggest the existence of two types of tooth
   agenesis differing in nature, where remaining teeth tend to enlarge in
   the `moderate type' and reduce in the `degenerative type.' The former is
   dominant in (tooth agenesis of) the Japanese, whereas the latter seems
   to be more prevalent in European descendants, which is in accordance
   with recent findings in genetics. The `moderate type' might be
   advantageous for survival in human microevolution because of its
   improved function and reduced risk of dentoskeletal discrepancies. The
   PV of tooth size was greater in the agenesis groups than in the
   reference group except for premolars and second molars. Among those with
   third molar agenesis, the greatest increase in PV was exhibited by those
   with all third molars missing, followed by those with two third molars
   missing. Among remaining teeth, canines and first molars tended to
   exhibit a greater increase of PV in agenesis groups, whereas their
   magnitude of PV did not exceed that of other teeth. These results can be
   explained by the genetic stability of canines and first molars and an
   increased variation due to common factors across remaining teeth
   associated with tooth agenesis.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to provide a stabilized (i.e. less vulnerable to

   mortality for biased skeletal samples. The stabilized equation is
   developed and tested on the United Nations data used to develop the
   original method (McFadden and Oxenham, Current Anthropology, 60(1),
   141-146), and is applied to 16 bioarchaeological samples from mainland
   Southeast Asia. First-order correlations and basic descriptive
   statistics were applied to the data. The stabilized equation was
   comparable in accuracy to the original equation. When applied to
   bioarchaeological samples, it proved to be advantageous where the sex
   ratio differed by more than 0.15 in either direction (i.e. more females
   or more males). The stabilized equation is an improvement over the
   original equation for samples that exhibit sex bias that is randomly
   distributed by age. This method extends the potential applications of
   the maternal mortality estimator.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {126},

Abstract = {Many medieval skulls from Kamakura, Japan were found to be characterized
   by dolichocephaly, although these medieval people are most likely to be
   the ancestors of the modern Japanese. The specificity in the metric
   cranial traits has been repeatedly demonstrated by archaeological
   findings from other medieval sites in Kamakura City. It is not known
   whether these specific features were shared by the descendants of the
   medieval Kamakura people due to a complete lack of the skeletal remains
   belonging to the later half of the medieval period. Fortunately, we
   obtained access to a new series of skeletal remains of the later half of
   the medieval period from the Nozoji-ato site, and examined the variation
   in craiometric traits during the medieval period. The results revealed
   that the Nozoji-ato series were more brachycephalic than the populations
   within medieval Kamakura City and demonstrated the presence of secular
   changes within the Japanese medieval period. New data from the
   Nozoji-ato series thus showed that the medieval people within Kamakura
   City exhibited wider intra-regional variations in cranial measurements
   than previously anticipated. It is concluded that this contrasts with
   the commonly accepted theory that medieval populations were homogeneous
   in terms of dolichocephaly.},

Title = {The Ibaloi fire mummies: the art and science of mummification in the
   Philippines},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {197-202},
Abstract = {The Ibaloi fire mummies are preserved ancient remains of Ibaloi, one of
   the indigenous peoples of the northern Philippines. The locals kept the
   traditional lbaloi mummification through oral traditions, but the
   current generation no longer conducts the actual practice. We
   categorized the mummification steps into preprocessing, smoking, and
   postprocessing. The preprocessing involved a `saltwater purge.' washing,
   positioning the body onto a `death chair,' removing the epidermis, and
   `deworming.' The smoking process, from which the name `fire mummy' was
   derived, involved the smoking of a body under a low-lit woodfire. The
   postprocessing involved sun-drying and application of a plant concoction
   to the body. Notably, the traditional Ibaloi mummification process
   shares similarities with other mummification practices elsewhere. This
   paper provides a systematic review of the traditional Ibaloi
   mummification and highlights the essential physical and chemical
   processes involved in body preservation. We want to encourage more
   interdisciplinary studies on the Ibaloi fire mummies to identify
   potential applications of the traditional process in corpse
   preservation. We also hope to contribute to discourses with people from
   multicultural backgrounds to increase our understanding of the history
   and culture of ancient human settlements in the Philippines and the
   Asia-Pacific.},

Title = {Constant sex difference across populations in liability of nonmetric

Abstract = {Studies have revealed the existence of statistically significant sex
   differences in the frequency of nonmetric traits, but no agreement seems
   to exist about their variability among populations. This problem was
   examined using the multifactorial threshold model. Considering the
   assumption of additive effects of factors on the liability and the
   nature of effect of sex difference on the development of nonmetric
   traits, it would be reasonable to assume that the sex difference in the
   mean of liability is constant across populations. This hypothesis was
   tested and the magnitude of sex difference was examined using the
   world-wide dataset collected by Ossenberg and the dual-liability
   threshold model formulated by the author with a modification to
   accommodate side difference in the probability of trait occurrence. The
   data were divided into 16 samples regarded as randomly sampled from
   regional populations. The data of 31 bilateral traits were analyzed
   using maximum likelihood estimation procedures. After confirming the
   homogeneity of the variance of liability between sexes and across
   populations, the homogeneity and significance of sex difference in the
   mean of liability were tested. The results indicate the homogeneity of
   sex difference across populations. The assumed constant sex difference
   was statistically significant in 17 traits at the 1\% level, and its
   magnitude exceeded half the averaged distance between eight groups of
   populations in 12 traits. Population comparisons without distinguishing
   sex are justifiable if they use the traits with enough weak sex
   difference in comparison with population differences. Since the sex
   difference has proved to be basically constant across populations, the
   estimates of the assumed constant sex difference reported in this study
   would provide references for selecting traits appropriate for each
   comparison. The Breslow-Day test of homogeneity of sex difference
   indicated the inapplicability of the genotype model to the data,
   supporting Ossenberg's proposal for the use of side counts.},

Title = {The descended larynx and the descending larynx},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Our understanding of the evolution of human speech has been expanded by
   an increased knowledge of vocal anatomy and physiology in non-human
   primates. Comparative approaches provide evidence supporting the primate
   origins of many speech faculties. The descent of the larynx enables the
   two-tube configuration of the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) in
   humans; however, this configuration is also found in chimpanzees and
   macaques. The acoustic properties of voices produced in helium gas
   support the view that vocalizations are usually produced through SVT
   resonance, with the sound source generated by vibration of the vocal
   folds in gibbons and marmosets, as seen in human speech. Nonhuman
   primates produce a wider range of vocal repertoire than previously
   thought, reflecting their varied manipulations of the vocal apparatus to
   modify SVT topology. These species often actively descend the hyoid and
   larynx to produce calls. This `active' descent is one of the options for
   SVT modification in non-human primates. However, this is distinct from
   human speech, where a `static' descended larynx moves in a restricted
   range during speech. Instead, humans modify SVT configuration by
   combinations of contraction and relaxation of the tongue muscles, to
   produce their vocal acoustics. The components of the vocal apparatus act
   under the constraint of anatomy, and various associations of anatomy and
   vocal actions are expected to be found in a variety of types of
   vocalization in non -human primates. Increasing knowledge of their
   anatomy and physiology promises better understanding of primate origins
   and of the evolutionary history of physical faculties in human speech.},

Title = {Tetrachoric correlation of bilateral nonmetric traits: a defect in the
   conventional procedure and a proposal for two alternative estimation
   methods},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},

Pages = {39-45},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The individual-count method of bilateral nonmetric traits has been
   widely used despite its apparent defects in both theory and practice.
   Logically, its use means adopting the false concept of `two thresholds'
   based on the single-liability model. This conceptual defect can create
   actual problems, including that of conventional `tetrachoric
   correlation.' The correlation coefficient calculated by formally
   applying the tetrachoric procedure to the individual-count frequencies
   is mathematically meaningless because there exists no true liability and
   threshold that can explain such data. Moreover, it considerably
   underestimates the correlation if it is used as the estimate of the
   correlation between the individual specific components of liability
   because it neglects the contribution of the inter-side component in the
   variance of total liability. Two statistical methods are proposed to
   estimate the correlation coefficient between inter-individual components
   of liability and its confidence interval. Some selected data from the
   database published by Ossenberg on the Internet were used to illustrate
   the utility of the new methods and to examine the problem of the
   conventional method. The method of estimation of the correlation between
   the inter-individual components of liability based on the combination of
   two dual-liability models provided, as a by-product, substantial support
   for the standard threshold model based on data. Because the conventional
   `tetrachoric correlations' proved to seriously underestimate the
   correlations, the results of almost all studies using Mahalanobis
   distances based on nonmetric traits so far published may require
   re-evaluation. It is also argued that a fundamental problem exists in
   the use of the individual-count method itself. Adopting an incorrect
   method for maintaining comparability is a vicious cycle. It is necessary
   to emphasize improving the reliability of future studies based on true
   statistics rather than keeping the comparability between less reliable
   results based on the false concept of threshold.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {Starting 16000 years ago, the Neolithic lifestyle known as the Jomon
   culture spread across the Japanese archipelago. Although extensively
   studied by archaeology and physical anthropology, little is known about
   the genetic characteristics of the Jomon people. Here, we report the
   entire mitogenome and partial nuclear genome of skeletal remains from
   the initial Jomon period that were excavated from the Higashimyo shell
   midden site at Saga City, Kyushu Island, Japan. This is the first genome
   analysis of the initial Jomon people of Kyushu Island. These results
   provide important data for understanding the temporal transition and
   regional differences of the Jomon people. The mitochondrial DNA and
   Y-chromosome haplogroups were similar to those found in the previously
   reported later Jomon people. Moreover, comparison of three nuclear
   genomes from the initial to final Jomon periods indicated genetic
   continuity throughout the Jomon period within the Japanese archipelago
   with no significant evidence of admixture. This indicates that the
   genetic differentiation found among the Jomon people was promoted by the
   progression of regionalization throughout the Jomon period. Further
   accumulation of high-quality Jomon genome data spanning a wide range of
   regions and ages will clarify both intimate regional and temporal
   differences of the Jomon people and details of their admixture history
   with rice fanners, as suggested by Jomon mitochondrial genome data. The
   results obtained from this study provide important information for
   further analysis.},

Title = {The human remains of the funerary complex of Neferhotep (XVIIIth-XXth

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {The Valley of the Nobles is a burial area that is located between the
   Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, together with which it
   constitutes the Theban Necropolis. The Valley of the Nobles houses the
   tombs of ancient aristocratic families, which include the monumental
   complex of the Neferhotep tomb, catalogued as TT49 (XVIIIth Dynasty).
   The funerary monument of Neferhotep also includes tombs TT187, TT347,
   TT348, TT362, and TT363, although tombs TT347, TT348 (Ramessid Period),
   and TT363 (XIXth Dynasty) remain closed. Tombs TT49, TT187, and TT362
   contained numerous human remains in different states of conservation.
   Those in tomb TT187 were attributable to at least 71 individuals, who
   showed evident signs of combustion, and also taphonomic alterations that
   had occurred in recent decades. The context of tomb TT362 was different,
   as it contained animal and human mummified remains that were
   disarticulated and showed few signs of exposure to high temperatures.
   These remains were attributable to 64 individuals. Tomb TT49 contained
   the remains of a single individual inside the burial chamber. The
   taphonomic and anthropological data suggest that the tombs within the
   funerary complex of Neferhotep were frequented not only by modern
   populations, as they also testify to the ancient reuse of tombs in
   different phases from the Ramessid to Ptolemaic periods.},

Title = {Sesamoids of the pollical metacarpophalangeal joint and the evolution of
   hominoid hands},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3},
Pages = {159-164},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sesamoids of the metacarpophalangeal joint are tiny bones located in the
   volar plate and articulated with the metacarpal head. Almost all living
   humans have radial and ulnar sesamoids in their pollical
   metacarpophalangeal joints. These bones protect and guide the tendon of
   the long (= extrinsic) pollical flexor. Whereas this condition is
   considered to be primitive for primates, living great apes have a
   tendency to lose these pollical sesamoids. Susman (Science 1994; 265:
   1570-1573) correlated the loss of the pollical sesamoids in living great
   apes with the remarkable reduction/loss of the tendon of the long
   pollical flexor. However, the prevalence of these pollical sesamoids in
   chimpanzees drastically differs among previous studies. Thus, we
   CT-scanned cadavers of 12 chimpanzees, four gorillas, and two
   orangutans, and investigated the frequency of pollical
   metacarpophalangeal joint sesamoids in these apes. Combining our
   findings with previously reported data gave updated frequencies of 21\%
   in chimpanzees (n = 24) and 0\% in gorillas (n = 7) and orangutans (n =
   6). This result is in accordance with the purported independent
   reduction (or loss) of the tendon of extrinsic flexor of the pollex in
   great apes (Diogo et al., Journal of Human Evolution 2012; 63: 64-78)
   and underscores the view that living great apes independently lost this
   tendon sesamoid complex. Given that a reduction (or loss) of the tendon
   of extrinsic pollical flexor in great apes is a trade-off between
   emphasis on hook grips and pollical reduction, human hands have not
   experienced specialization for hook grips and retain the primitive
   condition in this regard. Orangutans and chimpanzees independently
   specialized for hook grips. The case for gorillas, whose hand proportion
   is similar to that of humans, is equivocal. Gorilla hands may have
   attained their current state secondarily or they may have lost the
   powerful extrinsic flexor of the pollex for reasons other than
   specialized hook grips.},

Title = {Single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses on ABCC11, EDAR, FGFR2, and ABO
   genotypes of mummified people of the Joseon Dynasty, South Korea},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated successful single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of modern samples, the potential
   applicability of this methodology to ancient human specimens has not
   been confirmed. With regard in particular to the SNPs in the ABCC11,
   EDAR, FGFR2, and ABO genes, all of which are commonly analyzed in
   biomedical research, only a relatively limited number of papers on
   ancient specimens are currently available. We thus studied the SNP
   genotypes in the ABCC11, EDAR, FGFR2, and ABO genes of mummies from the
   Joseon Dynasty of Korea. Those SNP genotypes in brain samples (n = 5)
   were determined using multiplex single-base extension (SBE) primers in
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of each gene locus. SNP
   analysis revealed the mummies' ABCC11 genotype was revealed to be 538AA
   (dry-type earwax and low risk for axillary osmidrosis). In the EDAR and
   FGFR2 genes, the variant alleles rs3827760-CC (EDAR) and rs4752566TT
   (FGFR2), indicative of thick and straight hair, were identified. In
   addition, the ABO genotypes B002 (SN1-2), 001002 (Sapgyo), A001
   (Hadong2), BB (Yongin), and 002002 (SN PK) were identified. Our SNP
   genotyping of Korean mummies provided us with specific insight into the
   potential of this methodology for application to the analysis of ancient
   human specimens. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of the use of
   SNP genotyping in forensic medicine by proving that it can help to
   reveal the physical traits of ancient individuals.},

Title = {Late Pleistocene hominin teeth from Laoya Cave, southern China},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {125},
Number = {3},
Pages = {129-140},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent fossil finds have complicated the picture of East Asian Late
   Pleistocene hominin taxonomy and morphology, necessitating analysis of
   more fossils with secure dates and stratigraphic contexts to better
   contextualize human evolution during this epoch. Field excavations at
   the Laoya Cave in Guizhou Province, China in 2013 recovered two isolated
   human teeth (M-3 and dm(2)). The teeth date from similar to 21-24 kya,
   according to AMS radiocarbon dating. The present study provides detailed
   metric and non-metric descriptions of the Laoya teeth, and compares them
   with the dentition of other Late Pleistocene hominins (Neanderthals and
   fossil Homo sapiens from around the world) as well as chronologically
   earlier fossil hominins from the same geographical area (East Asian
   Early/Middle Pleistocene hominins). To achieve this, descriptive
   morphological observations, geometric morphometric analysis, and
   micro-computed tomography were employed. The lower third molar (LYC1) is
   characterized by several derived features, including the absence of a
   hypoconulid, the lack of C6 and C7, and an `X'-type cuspal arrangement.
   The combination of traits expressed by LYC1 is unique, but very similar
   to other recent H. sapiens. However, the LYC1 also displays a suite of
   dental features that are not common in other East Asian Late Pleistocene
   fossil H. sapiens: the absence of a hypoconulid, the presence of a
   middle trigonid crest, and a narrowed talonid relative to trigonid. This
   study of the Laoya teeth expands the known morphological diversity of
   East Asian Late Pleistocene hominin dentitions, and will contribute to a
   better understanding of the history of modern humans in this area.},

Title = {Geographical distribution of certain toponyms in the Samguk Sagi},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {35-44},
Abstract = {Kim Busik's Samguk Sagi History of the Three Kingdoms, dating from 1145
   A.D., is renowned for including Japanese toponyms in the Korean
   peninsula and the north of Yalujiang district (modern Liaoning and Jilin
   Provinces). Kim's work recorded the older, archaic topony ins before
   they were converted into sinicized (i.e. expressed with Chinese words)
   place names with two Chinese characters in 757 A.D. by the order of King
   Kyeongdeok. This paper maps specific words included in the place names
   of 783 locations for which the corresponding present places are evident.
   The following were words examined: (1) `river' and its related words;
   (2) `valley'; (3) `mountain' and `ridge'; and (4) `city' and `burg'.
   Japonic-sourced toponyms are typically distributed in the central and
   northern areas of the Yalu River, primarily in the district of Kogury6;
   however, they go beyond these regions. The use of Chinese loanwords is
   noted in the southern area, where determining which language was spoken
   is difficult. In a town near Seoul, the stem of the toponym belongs to
   the Korean language, whereas the unit word belongs to the Japonic
   language. This usage may be attributed to bilingualism, whereby
   Korean-speaking inhabitants used their own language for the stem of the
   place name. Mongolic and/or Tungusic loanwords are also found. In some
   cases, determining the language origin of the current toponyms is
   difficult. Therefore, the minute geographical distribution of the origin
   languages is displayed word by word. These toponyms reflect the traces
   of indigenous languages and reveal that Japonic-speaking people still
   dwelled in the central area of the peninsula and in the northern area of
   the Yalu River at that period.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},

Pages = {87-98},
Abstract = {A new mediwn-sized hominoid mandibular fossil was discovered at an early
   Late Miocene site, Tebingan area, south of Magway city, central Myanmar.
   The specimen is a left adult mandibular corpus preserving strongly worn
   M-2 and M-3, fragmentary roots of P-4 and M-1 alveoli of canine and P-3,
   and the lower half of the mandibular symphysis. In Southeast Asia, two
   Late Miocene medium-sized hominoids have been discovered so far:
   Lufengpithecus from the Yunnan Province, southern China, and
   Khoratpithecus from northern Thailand and central Myanmar. In
   particular, the mandibular specimen of Khoratpithecus was discovered
   from the neighboring village of Tebingan. However, the new mandible
   shows apparent differences from both genera in the shape of the outline
   of the mandibular symphyseal section. The new Tebingan mandible has a
   well-developed superior transverse torus, a deep intertoral sulcus (=
   genioglossal fossa), and a thin, shelf-like inferior transverse torus.
   In contrast, Lufengpithecus and Khoratpithecus each have very shallow
   intertoral sulcus and a thick, rounded inferior transverse torus. The
   characteristic morphology of the mandibular symphysis in the Tebingan
   specimen suggests a different taxon from Khoratpithecus. In central
   Myanmar at least two kinds of medium-sized hominoids were likely present
   in the early Late Miocene.},

Abstract = {The Pacopampa site is one of the largest Formative Period sites in
   Peru's northern highlands. This study describes newly excavated human
   remains from the site, compares them with previous findings, and
   provides bioarchaeological approaches to assess social stratification in
   Formative Period Andes, leading to an understanding of how social
   stratification emerged in the Andean civilization. The human remains
   studied were two individuals from an elite tomb (the `Serpent-Jaguar
   Priests' tomb) at the ceremonial center of the site. At the bottom of
   the tomb, a middle-aged female was laid over the remains of a young
   male. The central position of the tomb and the rich repertoire of grave
   goods suggest that these individuals had symbolic importance and
   belonged to an elite social group. The possible presence of artificial
   cranial deformation in the female suggests that the buried individuals
   were socially different from the other burial individuals of this site.
   There is no dental caries in these two individuals. The comparison of
   caries frequencies between these two individuals and non-elites showed
   lower caries frequencies in the former than in the latter. Taking into
   consideration existing isotopic data of Formative Period sites, the
   social differences in the caries frequencies can be attributed to the
   elites' dietary patterns-which contained fewer cariogenic foods. Thus,
   this study revealed the emergence of social stratification in Peru's
   northern highlands and its possible pathological impacts.},

Title = {Morphometric analysis of fossil hylobatid molars from the Pleistocene of

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-121},

Abstract = {This study investigates the morphological variation and taxonomic
   affinities of 28 fossil gibbon molars from eight newly discovered
   Pleistocene cave sites in the area of Chongzuo, Guangxi Zhuang
   Autonomous Region, China. A recent descriptive analysis demonstrated
   that these fossil teeth form a uniform group that can be assigned to a
   single species of Nomascus. In this contribution, a two-dimensional
   morphometric approach is employed to examine the Chongzuo specimens in
   comparison with a large sample of extant hylobatids, as well as with
   previously reported hylobatid dental remains from the Pleistocene of
   China. Buccolingual and mesiodistal measurements and crown outline areas
   reveal that the Chongzuo molars correspond most closely with Nomascus
   and, to a lesser extent, Hoolock. Crown shape was investigated using
   elliptical Fourier analysis. Our results show that the Chongzuo
   specimens fall in most cases either within the range of variation of
   extant Nomascus to the exclusion of all other hylobatid genera, or their
   distance from the cluster represented by the Nomascus sample is
   relatively small. Similarly, the Mahalanobis distances for crown shape
   show a trend towards smaller morphological distances between the
   Chongzuo specimens and Nomascus, followed by Hoolock and Hylobates. The
   Chongzuo molars are also morphometrically distinct from Bunopithecus
   sericus, but fall within the range of overlap of other Pleistocene
   hylobatid dental remains from southern China. The balance of evidence
   indicates that the Chongzuo teeth can be attributed to cf. Nomascus. The
   fossil teeth are sufficiently distinct from those of extant Nomascus
   that they may represent an extinct species.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to various environments leads to evolutionary change in size
   and shape in nonhuman primates. In island environments, larger mammals
   tend to be smaller compared with the original mainland population. The
   Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) has two subspecies: Macaca fuscata
   yakui (MFY) on Yakushima Island, and Macaca fuscata fuscata (MFF) on the
   main Japanese archipelago. Since adult shape differences reflect
   spatiotemporal developmental pattern differences, it is interesting to
   examine allometric patterns for groups that show significant size
   variation. The main purpose of the present study is to quantitatively
   examine the craniofacial size and three-dimensional sexual and
   subspecies shape variation, focusing on the effects of size variation on
   shape variation. Computed tomography scans of 55 specimens were used to
   generate a three-dimensional model of each cranium, and 57 landmarks
   were digitized to quantify the craniofacial shape variation in Japanese
   macaques. We subsequently employed regression analyses to deduce vectors
   responsible for allometry, sex, subspecies shape variations, and the
   influence of size on sexual and subspecies shape variations. The results
   showed that four intraspecific groups, consisting of two subspecies and
   the two sexes, significantly differed in both size and shape space. In
   size, the cranium of MFY was smaller than that of MFF in both sexes, and
   female crania were smaller than male crania in both subspecies.
   Allometry as well as sexual dimorphism in shape was related to a
   relatively broad orbit, smaller neurocranium, enlarged snout, and
   broader temporal fossa in males. Subspecies shape differences were a
   relatively narrow and short orbit and sphenoid, smaller neurocranium,
   and postorbital constriction in MFY. Sexual shape variation was largely
   associated with size variation. On the other hand, subspecies shape
   variation was not significantly correlated with size. We discuss these
   intraspecific cranial size and shape variations and the effect of size
   on shape variation from evolutional and developmental perspectives.},

Title = {Sexual selection and the loss of laryngeal air sacs during the evolution
   of speech},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},

Pages = {29-34},

Abstract = {One noteworthy, but unexplained, aspect of the evolution of human speech
   is the loss of laryngeal air sacs during hominin evolution. Very little
   is known about the adaptive significance of this curious trait, or the
   selection pressures that may have driven the evolution of air sacs among
   primates, and their later loss in Homo. Here, I review the literature on
   the loss of laryngeal air sacs during the evolution of speech, and argue
   that sexual selection may have been a key factor. Although air sacs do
   not fossilize, the presence or absence of air sacs appears to be
   correlated with the anatomy of the hyoid bone, and fossil hyoid evidence
   suggests that air sacs were lost in hominins between 3.3 million and
   530000 years ago. Air sacs are hypothesized to have an acoustic
   function, and some authors have argued that hominins may have lost their
   air sacs because they would make speech less clear. In other primates,
   such as gorillas and howler monkeys, air sacs appear to play a role in
   acoustic size exaggeration and may be linked to reproductive
   competition. I explore the hypothesis that changes in social
   organization and mating system towards reduced male male competition may
   have relaxed the selection pressure maintaining loud, low-frequency
   calls in hominins, making air sacs obsolete. While much of the above
   will remain hypothetical until more concrete data are gathered, we can
   speculate by saying that air sacs may not have been necessary for the
   type of quiet vocal interaction that typifies human communication.
   Perhaps more recent Homo species, with lower levels of sexual dimorphism
   and increased social tolerance and complexity, began to communicate in a
   more complex way, eventually leading to spoken language.},

Abstract = {The Andean civilization emerged in South America during the Formative
   Period (3000-50 BCE) and developed through renovation activities of
   ceremonial architecture. A collaborative team of Japanese and Peruvian
   archaeologists has been excavating an archaeological site with
   ceremonial architectures at Pacopampa since 2005. Pacopampa is one of
   the largest Formative Period sites in the Northern Highlands of Peru.
   This paper reviewed the previous studies of Pacopampa and reconstructed
   situations of health and death during an initial stage of the Andean
   civilization from a bioarchaeological perspective. Findings from several
   previous studies were summarized as follows: (1) bioarchaeological
   evidence supported the emergence of social stratification in the
   Formative Period; (2) social stratification promoted the difference in
   the proportion of dental diseases and stress markers between burial
   types; and (3) violence-related trauma was first observed at Pacopampa,
   which was highly likely to be caused by ritual practices. These findings
   will contribute to an elucidation of the impacts of social
   stratification on the inhabitants' health.},

Title = {Integrative experimental and morphological study of the metacarpal and

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Primate hands and feet are versatile and offer an opportunity to examine
   how morphology reflects compromises among different functions in daily
   activities. In this study, we investigated the diaphyseal robusticity of
   metacarpals (MCs) and metatarsals (MTs) and discussed their correlation
   with locomotor and other behaviors in the semiterrestrial Japanese
   macaque (Macaca fuscata). The objectives of this study were to determine
   (1) whether more robust MCs and MTs experience higher forces during
   terrestrial locomotion than less robust bones; and (2) whether MT3,
   which is suggested to be the functional axis of the foot in Japanese
   macaques, is more robust than MT2, MT4, and MT5. Computed tomography of
   MCs1-5 and MTs1-5 was performed in 10 monkeys. As a measure of bone
   robusticity, the buckling strength of each MT and MC was calculated as
   J/L-2 where J is the polar second moment of area and L is the bone
   length. Hand and foot pressure were recorded using plantar pressure
   measurement systems while two monkeys moved on a flat floor over a range
   of speeds (0.72-2.56 m/s). The relationship between the bone robusticity
   and the load applied to the bones during terrestrial locomotion was
   analyzed. Our results did not support the two predictions. There was no
   positive correlation between diaphyseal robusticity and the peak force
   in both male and female Japanese macaques. There was no clear difference
   in bone robusticity among MTs2-5 in both males and females. These
   results suggest that the relation between MC and MT robusticity and
   mechanical loading during locomotion is not as straightforward as might
   be expected, possibly due to the complex multifunctionality of primate
   hands and feet. Additional integrative studies that similarly
   incorporate morphological and experimental approaches are expected to
   provide useful insights into macaque hand and foot morphology.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a thorough description of humeral, ulnar, and radial
   specimens of the Nacholapithecus holotype (KNM-BG 35250). A spool-shaped
   humeral trochlea (and keeled sigmoid notch of the ulna) is a hallmark of
   elbow joint evolution in hominoids. In lacking this feature, the elbow
   of Nacholapithecus is comparatively primitive, resembling that of
   proconsulids. However, the humeroulnar joint in Nacholapithecus is
   specialized for higher stability than that in proconsulids. The
   humeroradial joint (humeral capitulum) resembles that of extant apes and
   Sivapithecus. This condition may represent an intermediate stage leading
   to the fully modem elbow in extant apes. If this is the case,
   specialization of the humeroradial joint preceded that of the
   humeroulnar joint. Nacholapithecus elbow joint morphology suggests more
   enhanced forearm rotation compared to proconsulids. This observation
   accords with the forelimb-dominated positional behavior of
   Nacholapithecus relative to proconsulids, which has been proposed on the
   grounds of limb proportions and the morphology of the phalanges,
   shoulder girdle, and vertebrae.},

Abstract = {Ancient DNA analysis became paleogenomics once high-throughput
   sequencing technology was applied to ancient DNA sequencing.
   Paleogenomics based on whole-genome information from Neanderthals and
   Denisovans showed that small fragments of these genomes remain in the
   modern human genome, and corresponding studies of anatomical modern
   humans clarified the history of migration and expansion among Homo
   sapiens. Due to geographical and environmental conditions, paleogenomic
   studies have fallen behind in Eastern compared with Western Eurasia.
   Recently, however, various capture sequencing techniques, which can
   enrich ancient DNA, have been used in East Eurasia, and the field of
   paleogenomics has been further developed. This review briefly introduces
   the history of ancient DNA analysis leading to paleogenomics, outlines
   three sequencing stages (partial, draft. and complete genome sequencing)
   and capture methods, and discusses the necessity of high-quality
   sequencing for paleogenomes of Eastern Eurasia.},

Title = {The time-dependent evolutionary rate of mitochondrial DNA in small
   mammals inferred from biogeographic calibration points with reference to
   the late Quaternary environmental changes in the Japanese archipelago},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},

Pages = {23-34},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have long been the most popular
   marker for assessing phylogenetic relationships and uncovering
   population dynamics. However. the mechanism of the nucleotide
   substitution rate of mtDNA remains unclear. While the evolutionary rate
   over tens of thousands of years is thought to be time dependent, the
   overall picture is not fully understood. This article presents recent
   achievements related to the time-dependent evolutionary rate of mtDNA in
   small rodents in the Japanese archipelago. The method focuses on rapid
   expansion events during the late Quaternary, during which there was a
   prolonged severe cold period and repeated abrupt warm periods, providing
   multiple calibration points. The global sea level fluctuation and
   migration to islands help to specify the calibration points. For
   calibration points at 11000, 15000, 53000., and 130000 years ago, the
   evolutionary rates were approximately 0.11, 0.11, 0.047, and 0.029
   substitutions/site/million years, respectively, in the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b gene (Cytb). Applying the higher rate to assess the
   evolutionary history of the commensal house mouse (Alus musculus) and
   complete mitochondrial genome sequences (similar to 16000 bp) allowed us
   to trace prehistoric human culture development based on millet and rice
   agriculture. The pattern of time-dependent evolutionary rates presented
   here is likely applicable to other small rodents. The Japanese
   archipelago is ideal for assessing evolutionary rates with biogeographic
   calibration points in the late Quaternary in species with multiple
   genetically distinct local populations.},

Title = {Humeral laterality in modern humans and Neanderthals: a 3D geometric
   morphometric analysis},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {125},
Number = {3},
Pages = {117-128},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Approximately 90\% of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) are
   right-handed. This handedness is related to laterality patterns of the
   upper limb due to habitual activity patterns which are known to leave
   marks on the bone structure. Various studies have shown that
   Neanderthals were also right-handed in very similar proportions to AMHs.
   Here, for the first time, 3D geometric morphometric techniques are used
   to study humeral laterality in a Spanish modern human population and to
   make a comparative study with a Neanderthal sample. Results obtained in
   the modern human population show a larger right humerus and clear
   differences in shape laterality. Shape differences in both epiphyses and
   in the complete humerus could be caused by non-allometric factors. This
   could suggest different activity pattern in both arms during life. Shaft
   shape laterality could be explained by allometric factors, i.e. shape
   variability is related to size variability. Neanderthals show a larger
   right humerus compared to the left and the mean shape comparison with
   the common anatomical regions presents a non-significant result.
   Finally, olecranon fossa width is the only feature that clearly differs
   between modern humans and Neanderthals, with geometric morphometric and
   linear measures being wider on the Neanderthal left side and wider on
   the modern human population right side. This difference may be due to a
   combination of different factors and behaviors that involve complete
   extension of the elbow joint.},

Title = {Isotopic study of maize exploitation during the Formative Period at
   Pacopampa, Peru},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},

Pages = {121-132},
Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) was an important staple and ceremonial food in the
   pre-Columbian Andean world. Previous researchers have studied maize
   agriculture in early ancient Andean society by examining macro- and
   microbotanical remains. However, isotope analyses of human remains have
   shown that maize was not a primary food resource during the Formative
   Period (1800-1 cal BC). Although a few studies have suggested that maize
   was consumed in this period, we know little about how the dietary role
   of maize differed across the Andean society and how it changed over
   time. This study measures carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from human
   and animal bone collagen samples and human tooth enamel samples
   excavated from the Pacopampa archaeological site in the highlands of
   northern Peru in order to better understand maize consumption in this
   period. The site dates to the Middle to Late Formative Periods (1200-700
   cal BC, 700-400 cal BC) and the Early Cajamarca phase (cal AD 200-450).
   The findings indicate an increase in C-4 resource consumption during the
   Late Formative Period-an increase that we attribute directly to maize
   and indirectly to domesticated animals. Although dietary variation
   related to social stratification was insignificant at this site, it has
   been reported at and between some coeval sites. Thus, we conclude that
   when these populations began exploiting C-4 resources, their strategic
   use of these resources varied depending on the site. This study suggests
   that the use of maize during the Formative Period was probably greater
   and earlier than reported in previous isotope studies. In addition,
   maize utilization for domestic animals in this period, which has rarely
   been mentioned, was also important.},

Title = {Prevalence of dental caries and antemortem tooth loss at Pacopampa in an

Abstract = {This study examined the occurrence of carious lesions and antemortem
   tooth loss (AMTL) in skeletal remains from Pacopampa, a Formative period
   site in Peru. We sought to identify variations in carious lesions and
   AMTL within and between groups to uncover insights into social
   stratification and subsistence. Targets were permanent teeth and alveoli
   from skeletal remains from the Pacopampa I (1200-700 BCE) and Pacopampa
   II (700-400 BCE) phases. In this study, rates of carious lesions and
   AMTL, were analyzed in relation to cultural phase, age, sex, and burial
   type. The results revealed that rates varied by age (AMTL rates
   increased with age), sex (females exhibited higher carious and AMTL
   rates than males), and burial type (individuals buried with precious
   goods demonstrated lower carious and AMTL rates than other individuals).
   It is concluded that skeletal remains from the early stages of Andean
   social stratification revealed significant variations in dental caries
   and AMTL across cultural and biological factors. This study identified
   differences in the appearance of carious lesions and AMTL rates during
   the emergence of social stratification in the Central Andes in the
   Fonnative period. Future studies that explore diet using stable isotopic
   data are needed to test the assumption that variations in dental caries
   and AMTL are related to dietary patterns.},

Title = {Complexities of regional and interregional interactions during the
   Formative Period in northern Peru: new perspectives from Ingatambo,
   Huancabamba Valley},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},

Pages = {133-143},
Abstract = {This article describes the changing regional and interregional
   entanglements in northern Peru during the Middle and Late Formative
   Periods from a diachronic perspective. Comparing the available
   archaeological data from major or `core' ceremonial centers such as
   Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa, and the contemporaneous center at Ingatambo,
   located in the northern `frontier,' it seems reasonable to divide the
   diachronic process of interactions in northern Peru into three distinct
   phases to better understand its complexities. From this perspective,
   northern Peru around 1200 BC can be considered as an aggregate of local
   spheres (at the level of a valley or basin), with each of the local
   spheres pertaining to the emerging ceremonial centers. However, a major
   change seems to have occurred around 1000 BC, as regional and
   interregional interaction became more active in the northern highlands,
   and regional spheres seem to have expanded in number and geographic
   scale. Ceremonial centers such as Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa formed
   regional-scale spheres beyond a geographically specific area. Around 800
   BC, radical socioeconomic changes occurred in the Central Andes, and
   northern Peru was integrated into a pan-regional network covering the
   whole of the Central Andes. which overlay the northern interaction
   spheres developed by important centers such as Kuntur Wasi and
   Pacopampa. In this context, it seems important to focus on the site of
   Ingatambo, which is located at a unique geopolitical point where
   multiple spheres overlap and interact with the two core centers of
   Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa simultaneously. Ingatambo formed and
   maintained its own regional sphere independent of these two centers
   through its connection with the far north coast and tropical lowlands.},

Title = {Diachronic changes in linear enamel hypoplasia during the Edo period

Abstract = {Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) is a useful indicator of childhood
   health. This study aimed at investigating whether there was any
   diachronic change in LEH occurrence during the Edo period (1603-1867).
   The Edo period, which experienced no major transition in subsistence and
   had no large-scale contact with foreign population, did undergo various
   social changes that could have affected childhood health status. The
   skeletal remains of 144 adult individuals recovered from seven burial
   sites in Tokyo were examined. Based on historical records and
   archaeological evidence, these individuals were divided into two
   time-period groups, the early Edo period and the late Edo period. Each
   group was then subdivided into the two age-at-death groups of young and
   old. The late Edo period groups were also divided into coffin-type
   groups, which reflect their social status. Comparison of general
   prevalence, frequency distribution, and the mean number of LEHs observed
   per tooth revealed that the individuals of the late Edo period groups of
   any coffin type tend to have fewer LEHs than those of the early Edo
   period groups, and significant differences were found either in the
   frequency distribution or in the mean number of LEHs per tooth.
   Considering the possible factors that could affect the result, such as
   age-at death distribution and social status, the observed difference
   between the time periods can be attributed to diachronic change, which
   is assumed to be due to improvements in childhood health status during
   the Edo period. This assumption is compatible with historical evidence
   suggesting that the living environment in the city of Edo was improving
   in the 17th century and stabilized in the 18th century as a result of
   the establishment of basic infrastructure and improvements in public
   safety. The findings of this study will help us understand childhood
   health status in a changing society.},

Title = {A female human skeleton from the Initial Jomon period found in the Iyai

Abstract = {A new excavation of the Iyai rock-shelter site has uncovered more than a
   dozen human skeletal remains from the Initial Jomon period. We describe
   here an almost complete female skeleton (Iyai 1), and examine this in
   the context of morphological variation in Jomon females, especially
   those of the Initial Jomon period. Two radiocarbon dates based on the
   Iyai 1 skeletal samples show a calibrated date c. 8300-8200 calBP,
   belonging to the later part of the Initial Jomon period. The Iyai 1
   skeleton was found in a burial pit with an unusual body placement.
   Although it was a flexed burial with the both arms and limbs flexed, the
   upper and lower body was disconnected at the waist and the two portions
   placed on top of each other: the upper body was laid on its abdomen with
   the head faced into the pelvis, and the lower body was found under the
   upper trunk in a supine position. The individual is a young female, 146
   cm in height using Sasou-Fujii method, and the age at death is estimated
   as c. 20-40 years. The neurocranium is long (cranial index = 79.9) and
   high (length-height index = 77.1), the face is wide and low
   (upper-facial index = 43.4). The dentition shows nearly horizontal heavy
   wear but no dental caries with an edge-to-edge bite occlusion. The
   postcranial long bones are gracile, although they exhibit clear
   musculature impressions in some attachment areas. No paleopathological
   bone modification was found. The talus exhibits a `squatting' facet at
   the anterior contact of the talocrural joint. The stable isotopic
   signature of Iyai 1 falls among those of the inland Initial Jomon
   people, indicating that her proteins mainly came from C3 plants and
   terrestrial animals.},

Title = {Cranial morphometric analysis of early wet-rice farmers in the Yangtze
   River Delta of China},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {203-222},
Abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta is the best-known homeland of wet-rice
   agriculture. From the Middle Neolithic, rice fanning expanded from the
   Yangtze region to both the north and the south. However, poor
   preservation of ancient human skeletal remains in the region has meant
   that the population history of these expansions has not been fully
   understood. In order to clarify the ancestry of early wet-rice farmers
   in East Asia, we conducted a cranial morphometric analysis and
   comparison of a Middle Neolithic skeletal assemblage excavated from the
   Guangfulin site, Shanghai. The results of bivariate and multivariate
   analyses showed that: (1) Neolithic wet-rice farmers from the lower
   Yangtze retained local morphological characteristics, but were
   nevertheless morphologically more similar to Neolithic and later
   populations in northern China, which was home to early millet farmers,
   than to Neolithic populations in south China; and (2) Neolithic and
   later agricultural populations in East Asia were morphologically
   homogeneous compared to pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer groups even though
   the area occupied by both was equally vast. These results suggest,
   respectively, that: (1) Middle Neolithic wet-rice fanners in the Yangtze
   Delta experienced significant gene flow from regions of northern China
   such as the Central Plains and Shandong even though there is currently
   no evidence that millet cultivation itself had yet reached the delta
   region; and (2) Neolithic populations resulting from interaction between
   the Yangtze Delta and northern China dispersed widely across much of
   East Asia including the Japanese archipelago together with the spread of
   wet-rice agricultural technologies. These two proposals are paralleled
   by recent stable isotope analyses using tooth enamel and bone collagen,
   as well as archaeological evidence from Shandong. Finally, a facial
   approximation was conducted using a cranium (M252) excavated from
   Guangfulin for the purpose of visually expressing the results of this
   study.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {126},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-41},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Animal vocalizations range from tonal sounds to irregular atonal sounds
   and are generated from non-linear oscillations of the vocal folds as
   well as from turbulent noise in the glottis. Comprehensive study on
   bioacoustic signals indicates the existence of a diversity of non-linear
   phenomena, such as limit cycles, subharmonics, biphonation, chaos, and
   bifurcations in animal vocalizations, which may provide keys to
   understanding animal communications. In this paper, we review the
   concept of nonlinear dynamics and its methodology as applicable to
   bioacoustics. Acoustical analysis of recorded sounds, simulation of a
   biomechanical model of the voice production system, and physical
   experiment of the vocal tract and vocal folds are presented to
   demonstrate non-linear features inherent in animal vocalizations. We
   focus on source filter interaction as one of the main regulators of the
   non-linear property that can lead either to efficient vocalization or to

Abstract = {To infer the diet and cultural behaviours of Islamic communities during
   the medieval period in Portugal, 43 adult skeletons (13 females, 27
   males, and 3 individuals of undetermined sex) from the medieval Islamic
   necropolis of Santarem were analysed. A total of 779 teeth were
   macroscopically observed to score dental wear and dental alterations as
   enamel chipping, notching, transversal grooves observed on the
   mesiodistal occlusal surfaces (TGMOS), and lingual surface attrition of
   the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT). Occlusal wear was moderate.
   Chipping was recorded in 13.08\% (98/749) teeth from 28 individuals, and
   notching affected 3.87\% (29/749) belonging to 17 individuals. Five
   subjects have transverse grooves, observed on the mesiodistal occlusal
   surfaces in 3\% (23/750) of the teeth. LSAMAT was observed in 41.25\%
   (66/160) of the anterior upper teeth belonging to 20 individuals.
   Combinations of different alterations were investigated:
   LSAMAT-chipping, LSAMAT-TGMOS, and LSAMAT-chipping-TGMOS. These could be
   related to hard food, extra-masticatory behaviours, chewing unknown
   substances, or trauma.},

Abstract = {The Fimadomari Jomon people were hunter-gatherers living on Rebun
   Island, Hokkaido, Japan c. 3500-3800 years ago. In this study, we
   determined the high-depth and low-depth nuclear genome sequences from a
   Funadomari Jomon female (F23) and male (F5), respectively. We genotyped
   the nuclear DNA of F23 and determined the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
   class-1 genotypes and the phenotypic traits. Moreover, a pathogenic
   mutation in the CPTIA gene was identified in both F23 and F5. The
   mutation provides metabolic advantages for consumption of a high-fat
   diet, and its allele frequency is more than 70\% in Arctic populations,
   but is absent elsewhere. This variant may be related to the lifestyle of
   the Funadomari Jomon people, who fished and hunted land and marine
   animals. We observed high homozygosity by descent (HBD) in F23, but HBD
   tracts longer than 10 cM were very limited, suggesting that the
   population size of Northern Jomon populations were small. Our analysis
   suggested that population size of the Jomon people started to decrease
   c. 50000 years ago. The phylogenetic relationship among F23,
   modem/ancient Eurasians, and Native Americans showed a deep divergence
   of F23 in East Eurasia, probably before the split of the ancestor of
   Native Americans from East Eurasians, but after the split of
   40000-year-old Tianyuan, indicating that the Northern Jomon people were
   genetically isolated from continental East Eurasians for a long period.
   Intriguingly, we found that modern Japanese as well as Ulchi, Korean,
   aboriginal Taiwanese, and Philippine populations were genetically closer
   to F23 than to Han Chinese. Moreover, the Y chromosome of F5 belonged to
   haplogroup D1b2b, which is rare in modern Japanese populations. These
   findings provided insights into the history and reconstructions of the
   ancient human population structures in East Eurasia, and the F23 genome
   data can be considered as the Jomon Reference Genome for future studies.},

Abstract = {The Rakhigarhi site is the location of the ruins of an ancient megacity
   of the Harappan civilization and had not previously been investigated
   thoroughly. We tried to examine the physical and pathological traits of
   human skeletons (n = 37) from the cemetery at the site. In our study, a
   cranial index was calculated from one male skull (dolichocranic; index
   value = 65.78). The mean statures estimated by long bone length were
   175.8 cm (male) and 166.1 cm (female). The indices of femoral diaphyseal
   shape were 79.8 (males) and 90.31 (females) for the platymeric index;
   and 113.78 (males) and 112.74 (female) for the pilasteric index. The
   dental health of the subjects appeared to be good as the overall
   prevalence of oral pathologies (caries and antemortem tooth loss) was
   generally low. Periosteal reactions were found in tibias and possible
   evidence of osteomyelitis was also observed in a femur. Some joint parts
   showed signs of osteoarthritis. Although various pathologies have been
   identified, we could not find any specific lesions suggestive of leprosy
   and tuberculosis in these skeletons. Although our study has added
   invaluable data to the existing information pool on the health and
   disease status of Harappan society, more accurate conjecture on the
   structure of Harrappan society based on bioarchaeological evidence will
   need additional research based on future excavations at Rakhigarhi
   cemetery.},

   Two influencing factors, including composting materials and aeration

   physicochemical properties, i.e. temperature, volatile solid, carbon,
   nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, heavy metals, ammonia
   nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and germination index (GI). The mixture of
   horse manure and leaf can achieve high composting temperature, long
   retention time of high temperature (55 degrees C), fast organic matter
   degradation, and high GI under the same aeration pattern. Under the same
   composting materials, the intermittent aeration pattern during
   composting was superior to the continuous aeration pattern because the
   former promoted the composting process.},

Abstract = {The effect of organic fertilizers was evaluated on the nutritional
   parameters of Moringa oleifera in the field at a year after
   transplantation. The study was conducted in a completely randomized
   block design comprising six treatments each of which was replicated four
   times. Physicochemical properties of leaves and seeds sampled from
   treatments (cow dung compost, goat manure compost, poultry manure
   compost, chemical fertilizer, mixture of fertilizers and control) were
   assessed. Results obtained indicate that dried leaves of M. oleifera
   from poultry manure compost contain a high total protein content
   (41.83\%). Seeds harvested from composted plants were rich in nutrients
   than leaves, with the exception of vitamin C, which was more
   concentrated in leaves than seeds. Vitamin C contents in dry leaves from
   cow dung compost and the mixture of fertilizers were 734 and 964.50
   mg/100g, respectively. Applying plants with compost resulted in
   increasing chlorophyll a and b in leaves, but not carotenoid. On the
   overall, organic fertilizers contributed to the improvement of the
   nutritional quality of M. oleifera leaves and seeds under field

Abstract = {Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the utilization of
   compost derived from grape fruit waste (GFW) as an ingredient in nursery
   substrates for germination and development of cucumber. A randomized
   complete block design was used with thirteen treatments (S1-S13)
   encompassing 100\% composted GFW, 60\% GFW + 40\% poultry manure
   including hardwood sawdust, 80\% GFW + 20\% broad bean straw, 80\% GFW +
   20\% poultry manure including wheat straw, 50\% coco peat + 50\%
   vermiculite (as a control) and different combination of GFW-based
   composts with either coco peat or vermiculite. The resulted illustrated
   that GFW mixed with broad bean straw and poultry manure regardless of
   its source improved the chemical properties of composted GFW. Composts
   of GFW were even richer in nutrients, i.e., N, P, K, organic matter,
   soluble cations and anions and C/N ratio than control (50\% coco peat +
   50\% vermiculite) except pH and electrical conductivity (EC), which was
   lower. Concentration of Cu, Fe, Cd and Pb were significantly lower in
   GFW composts than control substrate; while total phenolic content was
   significantly the highest in single compost of GFW. Mixing GFW composts
   with either vermiculite or coco peat (at 1:1 ratio by volume) was
   optimal for seed germination and seedling growth parameters; those
   combined substrates showed the highest FGP, CGRI, survival rate, and
   growth parameters in most cases. The negative effects of singly GFW
   compost can be removed or improved by mixing it with coco peat or
   vermiculite, so seed germination, seedling growth and survival rate
   significantly enhanced with mixing GFW-compost with coco peat or
   vermiculite substrates at ratio of 1:1. These recycled wastes are low
   cost products that can be usefully used in horticultural nurseries on a
   commercial scale. Abbreviations(GFW) Grape fruit waste (FGP) Final

Abstract = {Vermicomposting is the processing of organic substrates through
   digestion by worms, usually Eisenia foetida. The physico-chemical
   characteristics of the substrates and health of the worms are important
   parameter for effective vermicomposting. This study assessed
   reproduction efficiency and reproductive rate of E. foetida and changes
   in EC, pH, organic C, total Nitrogen and C:N ratio by vermicomposting
   different substrate mixtures. The study was performed as a completely
   randomized design with 10 treatments and 4 replicates. Manures from
   sheep and horse were tested alone and mixed at 50 and 75\% with residues
   of alfalfa and wheat straw. Wheat straw was also tested alone and mixed
   at 75\% with 25\% chicken manure. E. foetida were added to the mixtures
   and allowed to process the substrate mixtures for three months. Final
   EC, pH, organic C and N levels of vermicompost were measured, as well as
   the reproductive efficiency and reproductive rate of the E. foetida. All
   measured characteristics of the finished vermicompost were significantly
   different depending on substrate. Substrates also changed to differing
   degrees during vermicomposting. Total C and EC increased in all
   substrates; and pH, total N, and C:N decreased in all substrates during
   vermicomposting The greatest change of EC was in the 25\% alfalfa + 75\%
   sheep manure mixture, which was 12.8 dS.m-1 initially and 18.6 dS.m-1 in
   finished vermicompost. Overall, pH declined and EC increased during the
   preparing of vermicompost.},

Title = {Transformations of Phosphorus and Other Plant Nutrients in Poultry
   Litter Composted with Sugarcane and Cabbage Wastes},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},

Abstract = {Poultry litter (PL) is a significant source of nutrients, but a suitable
   amount of carbon needs to be added as a bulking agent during its
   composting to a stable nutrient source. Here, we characterized the
   transformation of phosphorus and other plant nutrients during aerobic
   composting of PL with sugarcane (SW) and cabbage waste (CW) for 120d.
   Periodic samples were collected during composting and analyzed for total
   C, P (and its fractions), K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, EC and pH. At the
   initial stage of composting (20d), the P fractions varied in the order:
   water soluble P > NaHCO3-P (readily plant-available) > HCl-P
   (Ca+Mg-bound) > residual-P > NaOH-P (Fe+Al-bound). After 120d, the order
   was HCl-P > residual-P > water-P > NaHCO3-P > NaOH-P. These variations
   suggested a transformation of labile Pi to more recalcitrant forms
   during composting. Water soluble P was the dominant fraction during the
   initial composting period. This declined progressively with time of
   composting, while the HCl-P increased, confirming the transformation of
   the more vulnerable water soluble P to the more recalcitrant
   HCl-extractable P. This indicated that the composting could be a useful
   way of managing manure for P stabilization and reducing its losses in
   runoff water following land application. The total C varied directly
   with the ratio of sugarcane and cabbage wastes in the manure but was
   inversely related to the duration of composting. Extractable K, Ca, Mg,
   and Na increased whereas trace elements concentrations decreased with
   time of composting. The higher availability of basic plant nutrients and
   reduced availability of heavy metals in the mature compost are valuable
   attributes for safe use in sustainable agricultural production.},

Abstract = {Woody peat was used as an additive to compost with pig manure in 1.2
   m(3) composting reactors under aerobic conditions for a 77days period to
   estimate the effect on the compost maturity and gaseous emissions (NH3,
   N2O, and CH4). Pig manure was also composted with cornstalks (the
   traditional method) as a control treatment. The results showed that both
   cornstalks and woody peat composts reached the required maturity
   standard. Composting with woody peat as a bulking agent was found to
   reduced NH3 emissions by 36\% than the cornstalks amended treatment.
   Although CH4 emission increased by adding woody peat, N2O emission was
   considerably reduced, resulting in a slight decrease in total greenhouse
   gas emissions. More importantly, woody peat could reduce the losses of
   total carbon and total nitrogen, improve the compost quality as
   fertilizer.},

Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {27-39},
Abstract = {Feedlots in southern Alberta apply composted (CM) or stockpiled (SM)
   manure with straw (ST) or wood-chip (WD) bedding to cropland, but few
   studies have examined the effect of manure type and bedding material on
   carbon composition of these feedlot amendments prior to land application
   using solid-state C-13 NMR-DPMAS (nuclear magnetic resonance-direct
   polarization, magic angle spinning). The particulate organic matter
   fraction was extracted from four amendment treatments (CM-ST, CMWD,
   SM-ST, SM-WD) to avoid possible paramagnetic interference from
   considerable mineral soil in the manure from the unpaved feedlot. The
   hypothesis was that O-alkyl C of POM should be lower for more decomposed
   manure types (CM than SM) and bedding materials (ST than WD), and that
   alkyl C, aromatic C, carboxyl C, aromaticity, and alkyl:O-alkyl (A:O-A)
   ratio should be greater for the more decomposed amendments. The C
   composition of all feedlot amendments was dominated by aromatic C
   (8\%-14\%) and O-alkyl (7\%-14\%) C and had considerable less
   contribution from carboxyl (2\%-4\%) and alkyl C (1\%-3\%). The manure
   type hypothesis was supported for O-alkyl C (but not for the other three
   C groups), aromaticity, but not the A:O-A ratio. The bedding hypothesis
   was supported for O-alkyl C, aromaticity, and AD-A ratio, but not for
   alkyl C, aromatic C, and carboxyl C. A decrease in O-alkyl C, increase
   in aromaticity, and increase in AO-A ratio (bedding only) with more
   decomposed manure types or bedding materials suggested that these C-13
   NMR parameters may have potential to evaluate the maturity and stability
   of composted feedlot manures.},

Abstract = {Commercial mushroom producers are continually looking for new substrate
   raw material sources and pathways to dispose of mushroom compost
   (formerly called ``spent mushroom substrate{''}) after crop completion.
   A relatively new material used in the mushroom industry is corn stover,
   but supplies are somewhat limited. Corn farmers are often reluctant to
   remove stover from fields because of nutrient loss and possible soil
   erosion due to reduced soil protection, however, mushroom compost may be
   a potential substitute for stover. This field study evaluated the
   potential to improve corn crop yield and soil quality through stover
   removal coupled with the soil surface application of fresh mushroom
   compost. Stover was removed in amounts of 0, 70, and 100\% and replaced
   with fresh mushroom compost at rates of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 tons per
   acre to find an optimal rate for both, and to provide a rationale to
   replace stover with mushroom compost in order to generate additional
   income for corn farmers, and increase substrate component availability
   and mushroom compost disposal alternatives, to the mushroom industry.
   The results showed that corn stover removal did not influence corn
   yield, but an increase in corn yield trend was observed with the
   application of an increasing amounts >= 20 tons fresh mushroom compost
   per acre. Analysis of soil parameters, at 0-2 inch and 2-8 inch rootzone
   depths, at the start of the field study compared to approximately one
   year later were mostly inconclusive. Of note, the addition of >= 5 tons
   fresh mushroom compost per acre resulted in an increase in soil pH at
   0-2 inch depth.},

Abstract = {To meet the challenge of increased sludge generation, shortening of
   biodrying periods are required. This study assesses a shortened sewage
   sludge biodrying period of 15 days. The fundamental physicochemical
   properties of samples from different phases were determined, the
   functional groups were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the
   biodrying associated microbial functions were annotated against gene
   databases. After a 15-day biodrying period, the moisture content,
   readily degradable carbohydrate, lignocellulose and protein levels were
   significantly reduced. The distinct attenuation of peaks identified by
   infrared spectroscopy, indicates that the degradation of most lipids,
   proteins and polysaccharides in the biodrying matrix had reached
   equilibration on Day 15 and following this biosynthesis may result in an
   increased polysaccharide content. However, the biodrying matrix on Day
   20 was only partially matured. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and
   Proteobacteria were the most ecologically dominant phyla. These
   ecologically dominant microorganisms were also functionally dominant in
   biodrying associated metabolic pathways (glycolysis, amino sugar and
   nucleotide sugar metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism), as well as
   containing carbohydrate-active enzyme families. The modified 15-day
   biodrying period reduced the treatment time and achieved a competent
   biodrying result without increasing the operating costs. The 15-day
   treatment would increase the rate of existing systems or decrease the
   capital cost of new systems.},

Abstract = {This research determined whether addition of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD;
   0, 0.15, or 0.25\%) improved the two-stage composting of green waste
   (GW). The following parameters were measured during composting or in the
   final product: moisture content; volume; biochemical and chemical oxygen
   demand; humic substances; C/N-solid and C/N-soluble; microbial numbers
   (culturable bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi); enzyme activities
   (pectinase and xylanase); microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen;
   degradation of organic components; contents of phosphorus (available and
   total), potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium; and toxicity to
   germinating seeds. The two-stage composting of GW was optimal with the
   addition of 0.15\% beta-CD. A mature and stable compost was obtained in
   only 28 days with the optimized two-stage composting rather than in the
   90-270 days typically required for traditional composting.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {104-113},
Abstract = {Sewage sludge management is a major challenge in environmental
   protection. Composting is an organic waste treatment method that is cost
   effective and leads to resource recovery. Composting is considered an
   environmentally and agriculturally friendly method of sewage sludge
   utilisation. The objective of this study was to evaluate maturity of
   three composts prepared on the basis of sewage sludge mixed with
   structure-forming waste materials, such as pine bark, sawdust and wheat
   straw. The germination index (GI) was used to assess the maturity and
   phytotoxicity of composts at particular composting stages (initial,
   mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling, maturation). Cress seeds were used to
   determine the GI. The logistic model, which belongs to a broad class of
   generalized linear models, was used to analyze experimental data. Using
   this model the interesting probabilities (from the point of view of the
   experimenter) for the occurrence of a specific root length were
   determined. In addition, a model was constructed providing a dependence
   of probability on temperature.This work indicates a marked dependence
   between root length produced by cress seeds and the temperature of the
   composting process, which was closely related to the GI values. The
   longest plant roots, similarly as the highest GI values, were found at
   the lower temperature, which took place at the beginning and at the end
   of the composting process. Our findings suggest that the practical
   applicability of GI in the evaluation of compost maturity is limited.
   Additionally, the role of additional wastes being structure-forming
   agents in composted mixtures with sewage sludge was stressed as a
   sorption matrix for harmful substances released from sewage sludge.},

Abstract = {Exceptional Quality (EQ) biosolids may be developed into products that
   can rehabilitate disturbed urban soils for the production of garden
   vegetables. The objectives of this study were to compare newly developed
   EQ biosolids products specially tailored for urban soil use with those
   of established products for the purpose of identifying their capability
   to support germination and plant growth, as well as to quantify their
   plant available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Seven EQ biosolids
   products and an inorganic fertilizer control were compared in greenhouse
   bioassays employing soybean (Glycine max L.) and tall fescue (Festuca
   arundinacea Schreb.) to assess product quality and nutrient
   availability. The EQ biosolids were derived from treatment processes
   such as thermal drying, composting, and blending with complementary
   organic and mineral materials. The EQ biosolids products applied at an
   estimated equivalent agronomic N rate enabled adequate germination and
   plant growth. The N uptake by tall fescue grown with the biosolids
   amendments compared with known rates of inorganic N confirmed organic N
   availability to be approximately 40\%, 20\%, and 15\% for thermally
   dried, blended, and composted EQ biosolids products, respectively. The
   application of these products at agronomic N rates to a soil testing
   adequate in P increased soil P saturation to 20\%-35\%, a normal range
   for soil not excessively enriched with P. The availability of N and P in
   the EQ biosolids products will permit their agronomically beneficial and
   environmentally sound use in urban soils.},

Title = {Study of Total Bacteria and Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria and

   Compost Tea in Agricultural Soil},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {145-155},
Abstract = {Organic amendments have been shown to improve the quality of
   agricultural soils. Thus, the use of sewage sludge compost tea as a
   fertilizer can be considered a worthy and environmentally friendly
   alternative as it also offers the option of recycling sludge at the same
   time. However, an in-depth knowledge of how the addition of this product
   affects soil microbial diversity is still necessary. As such, the main
   objective of this study was to evaluate, at a microcosm level, the
   effects of irrigation with sewage sludge compost tea in an olive grove
   soil, focusing on the changes in the total bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB), and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). For this purpose
   plastic pots were filled with olive grove soil, watered with different
   amounts of water and/or compost tea, and incubated at 21 and 35 degrees
   C for a period of 90days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
   fingerprinting, real-time PCR, and 454-pyrosequencing analysis were
   performed. Our results suggested that the addition of sewage sludge
   compost tea (liquid fertilizer) slightly increased the soil biological
   diversity during the incubation time which suggests that sewage sludge
   compost tea did not have any negative effects in the soil microbiota.
   Accordingly and regardless of the incubation temperature, significant
   changes in the soil community structure were not observed throughout the
   experiment, suggesting that the treated soils maintained their
   microbiological stability.},

   Biological Factors Associated with Plant Growth Promotion in Orchard

Abstract = {Preplant soil incorporation of compost has previously shown potential to
   suppress Pratylenchus penetrans populations and improve replant
   establishment of newly planted fruit trees at old orchard sites. Using a
   greenhouse experiment, we evaluated the effects of preplant
   incorporation of three compost amendments (agricultural waste compost,
   yard trimmings compost, and municipal waste compost) on growth of apple
   seedlings, P. penetrans populations, microbial populations associated
   with soil suppressiveness, and microbial activity using soil collected
   from three orchard sites. We also aimed to identify the biological
   factors that were most strongly associated with enhanced plant growth in
   compost-amended soil. In four out of nine compost typexsoil
   combinations, compost improved apple seedling growth relative to the
   control. In four out of nine compost typexsoil combinations, compost
   reduced P. penetrans root infestation relative to the control, and in
   one compost typexsoil combination, compost amendment increased P.
   penetrans root infestation. Composts stimulated soil microbial activity
   and abundance, resulting in greater populations of Pseudomonas spp. in
   soil in seven of the nine compost typexsoil combinations. In a step-wise
   multiple linear regression, P. penetrans root infestation and the total
   abundance of fungi in soil accounted for the most variance in plant
   biomass, with increases in both variables correlated with reduced
   seedling biomass. Overall, composts show variability in the capacity to
   promote the establishment of fruit trees in orchard soil. Future
   research should be directed toward understanding variability in
   compost-induced plant growth promotion among different orchard soils and
   compost types.},

Abstract = {Human feces from urine diverting dry toilets can serve as valuable soil
   conditioners. For a successful agricultural application, an efficient
   pathogen reduction needs to be ensured, with no negative effects on
   plants. This study assessed the efficiency of lacto-fermentation
   combined with thermophilic composting on pathogen removal from human
   feces and the post-treatment effects on germination and growth of radish
   (Raphanus sativus) and tomatoes (Lycopersicum esculentum) compared to
   lacto-fermentation combined with vermi-composting and the control. The
   NH4+-N/NO3--N ratio of 3.0 and 3.6, respectively, suggested the obtained
   compost and vermi-compost was not yet mature. A complete reduction in
   the concentration of all investigated bacterial indicators (i.e.,
   coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium
   perfringens) from 5-7 log CFU g(-1) to below detection limit (<3 log CFU
   g(-1)) was achieved after lacto-fermentation combined with thermophilic
   composting. Lacto-fermentation combined with vermi-composting also
   contributed to pathogen die-off, but coliform bacteria were reduced to
   only 5 log CFU g(-1). Fertilization of seeds of radish by compost
   obtained after lacto-fermentation combined with thermophilic composting
   led to a higher germination index than by the vermicast obtained by
   lacto-fermentation and vermi-composting (90\% versus 84\%). Moreover,
   significantly bigger average fruit weight and total biomass per tomato
   plant (p < 0.05) were obtained after compost amendment compared to
   vermicast or the control.},

Abstract = {Developing biosolids-based composts or soil blends suitable for use in
   urban areas is increasingly common. End uses for compost vary and can
   include use as a soil conditioner for existing turf, to establish new
   turf, for tree planting, in urban agriculture, and for use along highway
   right-of-ways. The carbon benefits/costs of biosolids compost were
   modeled for King County, Washington. Soil carbon sequestration was
   highest for use on disturbed soils such as new housing developments,
   neglected urban soils, or highway right-of-ways (-1.1 Mg CO2eq per Mg
   compost) and lowest for use in well-tended yards or other highly
   maintained landscapes (-0.036 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost). Compost use for
   tree growth, calculated over a 30-year period, added above-ground
   sequestration benefits ranging from -1.53 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for a
   mature tree grown on a healthy soil to -4.58 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for
   a newly planted tree grown on a disturbed site. Assuming a 20 km haul
   distance, transport costs ranged from 0.005 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for
   delivery in a 5 Mg truck to 0.09 Mg CO2eq per Mg compost for pick up in
   a personal vehicle. Ecosystem services associated with different end
   uses for compost in urban areas also vary. This model suggests that
   while uses for biosolids compost will likely be varied, for a program as
   a whole, significant carbon benefits can be expected.},

Title = {Effects of Different Substrate Ratios on the Growth and Physiology of

Abstract = {Container technology can effectively control soil environment and
   nutrient status to obtain the optimal plant growth condition. Peat,
   green waste compost (GWC), soil and perlite were used as substrate
   materials to study the effects of different substrate ratios on growth
   and physiology of 1.5-year-old Sequoia sempervirens container seedlings.
   The optimal substrate ratio of S. sempervirens container seedlings was
   obtained by L-9 (3(4)) orthogonal design and was finally evaluated by
   principal component analysis. The volume ratio of peat: GWC: soil:
   perlite of 4: 1.5: 1: 2 was the best substrate ratio for S. sempervirens
   across all parameters, whose porosity, bulk density (BD) and gas-water
   ratio (GWR) were within the ideal ranges. The concentrations of total
   nitrogen (TN) of 1.40\% and total phosphorus (TP) of 0.13\% were the
   highest among the nine different substrates. The total potassium (TK)
   and electrical conductivity (EC) were 0.13\% and 0.70 ms cm(-1),
   respectively. In addition, the plant height and ground diameter growing
   in the substrate were increased by 28\% and 39\% compared to their
   respective initial values. The content of peat and GCW had significant
   effects on growth (p < 0.01). The GWR in T2 (peat: GWC: soil: perlite =
   6: 1: 0.5: 2) and T6 (peat: GWC: soil: perlite = 4: 0.5: 0.5: 1) are not
   suitable for S. sempervirens container seedlings. The PCA ranking of the
   9 groups of substrates is: T8 > T1 > T4 > T3 > T2 > T5 > T7 > T9 > T6.
   The combination of peat, GWC, soil and perlite in an appropriate ratio
   could provide a good environment for S. sempervirens container
   seedlings.},

Abstract = {Several composts were tested for their capacity to moderate the effect
   of Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (VCG B4, VD) on eggplant (Solanum
   melongena) under greenhouse conditions. Eggplants plantlets were
   inoculated by immersing their roots in conidial suspension and then
   planted in pots filled with mixtures of compost or peat moss, mixed with
   perlite. Six composts and peat moss mixtures were tested, of which
   tomato waste compost suppressed V. dahliae, and turkey litter compost
   partially suppressed it. Reduced levels of symptoms and lower fungal
   colonization were detected in the xylem of eggplants planted in tomato
   waste compost, and these plants accumulated more dry matter and had
   higher chlorophyll content compared to other media. However, survival of
   conidia in tomato waste compost showed only a moderate decrease compared
   with a sharp decrease in other media, suggesting that conidial
   eradication cannot be proposed as the suppressiveness mechanism.
   irradiation of tomato waste compost and peat at 2.5 Mrad reduced
   microorganism density by four orders of magnitude, but irradiation of
   tomato waste compost did not reduce its suppressiveness of V. dahliae.
   Composts properties affected progress rate of VD in the xylem tissue of
   eggplant seedling. These properties could indicate both biotic and
   abiotic factors affecting the process.},

Abstract = {This study was based on a long-term field trial of three different
   greenhouse vegetable growing systems which were started in March 2002.
   Fertilizer nitrogen and organic carbon inputs in three treatments in the
   spring of 2015 were as follows: (1) conventional system (CON): cow
   manure and dry chicken manure composts (about 146 kg N ha(-1) and 1483
   kg C ha(-1)) and urea (about 525 kg N ha(-1)); (2) low-input system
   (LOW): cow manure and dry chicken manure composts (about 325 kg N ha(-1)
   and 3160 kg C ha(-1)) and urea (about 263 kg N ha(-1)); and (3) organic
   system (ORG): cowmanure and dry chickenmanure composts (about 651 kg N
   ha(-1) and 5456 kg C ha(-1)). N2O and CO2 fluxes were monitored in the
   growing season of 2015 (from March to August) using static chamber and
   gas chromatography techniques. Results showed that: (1) The N2O and CO2
   fluxes in three treatments all reached their peaks within 4 days and 8
   days after irrigation, respectively. N2O emissions were positively
   correlated with soil temperature, soil water-filled pore space (WFPS),
   and NO3--N contents, while strong association between CO2 emissions and
   soil temperature was observed. (2) Lower cumulative N2O emission and
   direct emission factor (p < 0.05) were observed in ORG than that from
   LOW and CON. (3) No significant differences of cumulative CO2 emissions
   were observed in three treatments, but CO2 emissions proportion of
   fertilizer carbon inputs and soil organic carbon stock in ORG was
   significantly lower (p < 0.05).},

Abstract = {Rockwool is an inert growing media popular in the hydroponics industry.
   Eventually the rockwool fills with plant material and must be replaced
   and the residuals are disposed. Composting of this material will
   conserve landfill space. Although the rockwool itself is stable, roots
   and other plant materials remaining after harvest can decompose. We
   studied the effect of composting greenwaste feedstock mixed with spent
   rockwool in the amount of 10\% volume on plant growth. A greenhouse
   experiment was conducted with two types of soils: sandy loam and clay,
   each with and without rockwool, and applied at rates 0, 25, 50, and 100
   t ha(-1) to pots which were then seeded with okra, tomato, or chili
   pepper. Results indicate that plant growth of all three crops was
   unaffected by the presence of (10\% volume) spent rockwool in the
   compost. In all cases, increase in application rate of compost enhanced
   plant growth significantly. While the growth of tomato was unaffected by
   soil type, shoot weights of okra and chili pepper plants were
   significantly lower in sandy soil compared to clay loam soil.},

Abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth major crop worldwide after
   cereals. Some producers use irrigation water with high salinity, which
   consequently decreases the agronomic yield and potato quality. The aim
   of this investigation was to determine the effect of vermicompost and
   vermiwash on plant growth and tuber yield and characteristic traits in
   Solanum tuberosum L. plants and tubers subjected to salinity stress. A
   surface response experimental design with three replicates using a
   central point and 15 treatments was used with vermicompost at 300, 580,
   and 860 g plant(-1); vermiwash at 5, 10, and 15 ml plant(-1); and
   salinity stress with 15, 20, and 25 mM of NaCl levels. Plant
   physiological measurements included plant height (cm), stem diameter
   (mm), and plant fresh and plant dry weight (g). Six months after
   planting, measurements on tuber fresh weight, pH, electric conductivity,
   and degrees Brix were carried out. The addition of vermicompost and
   vermiwash minimized the influence of salinity stress on growth
   parameters and tuber characteristics in potato plants. Vermicompost (580
   g plant(-1)) plus vermiwash (15 ml plant(-1)) induced a greater plant
   height and stem diameter. Plants amended with vermicompost (860 g
   plant(-1)), vermiwash (15 ml plant(-1)), and salinity stress (15 mM) had
   higher pH values, whereas electrical conductivity value in potato tubers
   decreased.},

   Pig Manure Composting},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {S37-S42},
Abstract = {Effects of one commercial microbial inoculant (named VT microbial
   inoculant) on the composting of pig manure were studied. Two treatment
   piles were prepared in this study, in which one pile was inoculated with
   VT and another pile without VT. The results indicated that inoculation
   could accelerate the temperature rising at the start of composting.
   Based on the chemical parameters, the VT treatment showed higher N,
   P2O5, K2O, and macronutrient (NPK) content than the CK treatment. The
   statistical analysis showed that the P2O5, K2O, and NPK content had a
   significant difference (P < 0.05) between VT and CK treatments at the
   end of composting, which showed that VT inoculant accelerated the
   transformation of macronutrient in the end compost product. The changes
   of total organic carbon indicated that VT additive could accelerate the
   decomposition of organic carbon, which had a significant difference (P =
   0.023) compared with CK. At the end of the composting, the germination
   index value of VT treatment (80\%) was higher than the control (60\%).
   These results suggested that the inoculation of VT microbial agent was a
   feasible strategy to convert animal wastes into compost efficiently.},

Abstract = {The possible application of Pulsed Fast/Thermal Neutron Analysis (PFTNA)
   for determining the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) of compost will be
   discussed. This analysis method has several advantages over traditional
   chemical analysis, including that it is a nondestructive in situ method
   that does not require extensive sample collection and it analyzes much
   larger volumes of material (similar to 1 m(3)) than traditional chemical
   analysis (similar to 1 cm(3)). The amount of carbon can be determined by
   irradiating compost with neutrons and measuring the gamma ray peak at an
   energy of 4.44 MeV that appears due to inelastic scattering. Nitrogen
   can be determined by measuring the gamma ray peak at 10.83 MeV that
   appears due to thermal neutron capture. For C/N measurements, a
   calibration line that relates the C/N mass ratio to the carbon/nitrogen
   gamma peak ratio should first be constructed; our calibration line was
   constructed using carbon-ammonium nitrate mixtures. PFTNA measurements
   were then used to determine carbon and nitrogen peak values in order to
   utilize the calibration line for calculating the C/N mass ratio. The
   workability of this methodology has been demonstrated in laboratory
   experiments. The applicability of PFTNA for compost C/N ratio
   determinations was evaluated with Monte Carlo computer simulations of
   neutron propagation in large compost volumes (Geant4 toolkit) and
   experimental measurements of real compost (volume 1.3 m(3)). Data from
   computer simulations and experiments demonstrated that the PFTNA method
   is fully applicable for determining the C/N ratio in compost material up
   to values of 25 and even greater.},

Abstract = {Solid waste management and soil degradation are the two main issues
   faced by the developing countries. The present study is the first effort
   to use bio-municipal solid waste (MSW) for the amelioration of
   saline-sodic soils of Pakistan. A pot experiment was conducted to
   evaluate the effects of MSW, farm yard manure (FM) and gypsum
   application on nitrate leaching, soil physicochemical characteristics
   and crop productivity under rice-wheat cropping system. The MSW was
   aerobically composted alone (MSW compost) or with FM (MSW\_manure
   compost) or buried underground in lined pit for anaerobic decomposition
   (buried MSW) . Maximum nitrate leaching was observed during rice (84.91
   mg L-1) and wheat (46.18 mg L-1) with buried MSW as compared with
   control treatment. Results showed that buried MSW significantly (p <
   0.05) lowered the soil pH(s) (-5.6\%), electrical conductivity
   (-38.8\%), calcium carbonate (-45.8\%)(,) and sodium adsorption ratio
   (-51.4\%) and significantly increased the organic matter (86.3\%) and
   cation exchange capacity (31.50\%) as compared with control treatment.
   Path analysis showed the highest direct path coefficient during rice and
   the lowest one during wheat. Soil amelioration with organic amendments
   was further confirmed with multivariate analysis. This study has proved
   that buried MSW can be used as an effective solution for MSW disposal
   thereby improving soil physicochemical properties and crop productivity
   from saline-sodic soil.},

Title = {A Comparative Study of the Reproductive and the Vermicomposting Ability
   of Three Generations of Epigeic and Anecic Earthworms When Subjected to
   a Toxic Weed (Ipomoea) as the Sole Feed},

Abstract = {Recent studies by these authors have shown that the toxic and
   allalopathic weed ipomoea (Ipomoea carnea), gets transformed into benign
   organic fertilizer when subjected to vermicomposting. To derive benefit
   from this finding, it is necessary that a process should be made
   available for uninterrupted and efficient conversion of ipomoea into
   vermicompost. The present study has been done toward development of such
   a process, based on the concept of high-rate vermicomposting. It
   explores the relative ability to vermicompost ipomoea, and to reproduce
   in ipomoea-fed vermireactors, of successive generations of four species
   of earthworms - born and raised in ipomoea-fed vermireactors - in
   comparison to the first generation which had been raised to adulthood on
   cow-dung. Three epigeic species Eisenia andrei, Peryonix sansibaricus,
   Lumbricus rubillus, and one anecic Drawida willsi were explored for the
   purpose. The results, obtained over 480 days of uninterrupted reactor
   operation, show that the first generation of all four species of
   earthworms was slow to adapt to the ipomoea feed and took about 40 days
   to produce consistent quantities of vermicast. The second and the third
   generations didn't need this adaptation and each generated vermicompost
   at significantly faster rates than it's previous generation. Overall,
   the third generation of E. andrei, P. sansibaricus, L. rubellus and D.
   willsi produced 40, 41, 28, and 26\% more vermicast, respectively, than
   the pioneers of the corresponding species. Similar trend was seen in
   fecundity as well. Each new generation produced more juveniles and
   cocoons than the previous generation, the increase being statistically
   significant at >= 95\% confidence level. The findings reveal that
   earthworms can be made to adapt to ipomoea as their sole feed and the
   earthworm generations born and raised in ipomoea-fed vermireactors
   display significantly greater vermicomposting ability as well on
   fecundity than the earthworms which had been cultured on animal manure.},

Abstract = {Leaf composting is an essential technique in organic farming; it
   improves the physicochemical properties of soil such as texture,
   structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient content. However, the
   use of leaf compost is prohibited in the Fukushima and Ibaraki
   prefectures because large areas of the Fukushima and Ibaraki forests
   were contaminated by radiocesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) after the Fukushima
   Daiichi nuclear power plant (FDNPP) accident. We examined the changes in
   radio Cs concentration and other physicochemical properties in leaf
   compost made from Ibaraki and Fukushima forest leaves. At the beginning
   of the composting process, rice bran-treated compost showed 25\%-32\%
   lower radio Cs concentration than the leaf-only compost; however, 2
   years after composting, the difference in concentration between these
   treatments had increased to 35\%-63\%. Moreover, the incorporation of
   rice bran significantly increased the compost temperature, moisture,
   electrical conductivity, bulk density, and total nitrogen during the
   composting process. Plant uptake of radio Cs was significantly lower in
   rice bran-treated compost than the leaf-only compost at each level of
   application; furthermore, the levels of soil radio Cs showed a similar
   trend. Potassium application combined with leaf compost resulted in a
   significant reduction of radio Cs plant uptake. Our data revealed that
   adding rice bran to leaves positively affects radio Cs reduction in leaf
   compost and also reduces its uptake by plants. Our findings may improve
   the management of leaf composting after the FDNPP accident.},

Abstract = {The potential risk of increased metal concentrations through the
   application of composted wastewater sludge (CWS) is of concern. In
   particular, the high affinity of composted wastewater sludge for metals
   such as Pb, may influence the extent of metal uptake by plants. In this
   study, a sequential extraction protocol was employed to determine the
   fractionation and bioavailability of Pb, Cu, Cr, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Fe in
   CWS. To evaluate the influence of CWS on metal uptake, a fast growing
   plant Raphanus sativus L. (cultivated radish), was grown in CWS amended
   with perlite at four different compositions (0, 25, 50, 75, 100\% w/w)
   treated with Pb and Cu. Plants were harvested after 3weeks and analyzed
   for Pb and Cu concentrations. The extent of metal uptake, and
   intercompetitions between Cu and Pb upon application, at pH 7.3 and 5.8
   was also assessed. Best growth was apparent at 25\% to 50\% (w/w) CWS
   composition, while an increase in the pH lowered Pb and Cu
   concentrations in plant tissues. Higher metal concentrations were found
   in roots vis-a-vis shoot or leaves. In was found that longer incubation
   periods of more than 3weeks are needed for metal salts supplied in the
   inorganic form to be incorporated into the CWS structure and reduce
   their uptake.},

   manure (RM) to crops. An interest in aerobic composting prompted a
   2-year field study with the primary objective of evaluating corn (Zea
   mays L.) yield and soil fertility for RM as compared to composted manure
   (CM). The four treatments (TRT) consisted of low-rate composted manure
   (CM-L), high-rate composted manure (CM-H), RM, and inorganic fertilizer
   (IN). All four TRT received equal plantavailable N by supplementing the
   RM and CM with IN. Yield was measured by both machine-harvesting and
   hand-harvesting methods. Machine-harvested yield was similar among TRT
   for both years. Hand-harvested yield was lower for IN than RM in the
   first year, with similar yields among TRT in the second year. Due to
   drought, yields were considerably lower in the second year for all TRT.
   After 2years, CM-H had higher soil P, K, Zn, and organic carbon
   concentrations than IN, with no differences among TRT for soil NO3-N,
   pH, or electrical conductivity. Both CM and RM provided beneficial
   nutrients for corn production and improving soil fertility. Land
   application of CM and RM provides long-term benefits to soil health and
   sustainability in the Texas High Plains region.},

Title = {Effect of Diverse Compost Products on Soilborne Diseases of Potato},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {156-164},
Abstract = {Soilborne diseases result in major economic losses for potato producers.
   Compost application can reduce soilborne diseases, however the effects
   of compost products on potato disease severity and incidence are still
   unclear. Diverse compost products were compared for their effects on
   soilborne diseases of potato in New Brunswick, Canada using field and
   growth room experiments. In the field, five products were applied at
   45Mg ha(-1) dry weight to field plots in October of 2014 and 2015. In
   the growth room experiment, seven products were mixed to a 5\% w/w ratio
   with naturally infested soil. Tubers were assessed for disease severity
   and incidence and compared with a no compost addition control. Severity
   of symptoms of silver scurf, black scurf (BS), common scab (CS), and
   powdery scab varied among treatments, experiments, and years. In the
   field experiment, BS severity was significantly greater in the control
   than in the poultry manure compost treatment (3.26\% versus 0.90\%) in
   2016. Common scab severity and incidence in the field were positively
   related to soil pH and negatively related to soil particulate organic
   matter C and compost C concentrations. In the growth room experiment, CS
   severity was significantly greater in the control (8.98\%) than in the
   municipal source separated organic compost and sea-waste compost
   treatments (1.72 and 2.47\%, respectively). In this study, compost
   products had a significant, but inconsistent, suppressive effect on
   soilborne potato diseases. The quantity of compost C, rather than
   compost quality, was likely the most important factor in disease
   suppression in this study.},

   Manure with Poplar Leaf Litter},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {242-250},
Abstract = {Safe management of animal and plant waste is one of the world's most
   important environmental challenges. Composting has been proposed as a
   useful technique for beneficially recycling wastes. This study showed
   that significant temporal changes in the nutrient availability occurred
   during the composting of cow manure with poplar leaf litter within 120
   days. In particular, total C in the final compost was directly related
   to the addition of tree litter and inversely related to the time of
   composting, whereas extractable P and NO3 increased with increasing
   amounts of tree litter and ammonium showed the opposite trend. During
   the later stages of the composting process higher concentrations of
   water soluble K, Ca, Mg, and Na were observed. The major benefit
   observed was that heavy metal concentrations initially present in the
   manure were significantly reduced during composting. Heavy metals in the
   final compost decreased in the order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cd. The
   increased availability of plant nutrients following composting coupled
   with the lower extractability of heavy metals indicates that composting
   may be a sustainable option for agricultural waste recycling and
   increased productivity.},

Title = {Effect of Single and Combined Herbicides in Compost on Growth of
   Sensitive Crops: Green Bean, Cucumber, and Tomato},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {S23-S30},
Abstract = {Compost is frequently used in vegetable production in China, however the
   feedstocks used for these composts come from a variety of sources, some
   of which could contain herbicide residues. To evaluate the risk of
   herbicides on compost products used as growth substrates, we chose three
   sensitive vegetable crops: green bean, tomato, and cucumber, and grew
   them in compost without herbicide (CK), with Clopyralid (C1, 0.001 mu
   g/g), Trifluralin (C2, 0.05 mu g/g), Imprelis (C3, 0.01 mu g/g), and
   mixed-herbicides (CM). In the CM treatment, all of the herbicides were
   added at 1/10 the concentration of the single treatments. The media were
   amended with the composts at 0, 5, 10, and 20\%. Emergence rate,
   Seedling Vigor Index (SVI) and various growth indexes (shoot height,
   stem diameter, leaf area, root dry weight, and plant biomass) were
   determined after 45 days. The results indicated that: compost without
   herbicides (CK) had a positive influence on plant emergence (except
   green bean), VSI, and growth. The influence increased with each addition
   up to 20\%. Contaminated composts significantly reduced the emergence
   rate of tomato and cucumber, especially cucumber; the VSI of tomato and
   cucumber, especially for tomato; and some of the grown indexes of the
   three crops. The inhibition was more obvious for tomato and cucumber
   than for green bean. The inhibition of growth index was greater in CM-20
   than the other treatments, even though lower concentrations of each
   herbicide were used. Compost containing Trifluralin had the most
   inhibitory effect among the three single herbicides. However, the
   inhibitory effects varied in the different treatments. In conclusion,
   compost can increase the emergence rate and plant growth index (shoot
   height, stem diameter, leaf area, root dry weight, and plant biomass),
   but composts polluted by herbicides had negative impacts on plant
   growth, especially at higher compost amendment ratios of 20\%.
   Therefore, the utilization of compost made from agricultural wastes,
   especially in vegetable fields, should be closely monitored.},

Title = {The Maturity and CH4, N2O, NH3 Emissions from Vermicomposting with
   Agricultural Waste},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {262-271},
Abstract = {This study investigated the maturity and gaseous emissions from
   vermicomposing with agricultural waste. A vermicomposting treatment
   (inoculated Eisenia fetida) was conducted over a 50-day period, taking
   tomato stems as the processing object and using cow dung as the nutrient
   substrate. A thermophilic composting treatment without earthworm
   inoculation was operated as a control treatment. During the experiment,
   maturity indexes such as temperature, pH, C/N ratio, and germination
   index (GI) were determined and continuous measurements of earthworm
   biomass and CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions were carried out. The results
   showed that the temperature during vermicomposting was suitable for
   earthworm survival, and the earthworm biomass increased from 10.0 to
   63.1 kg m(-3). Vermicomposting took less time on average to reach the
   compost maturity standard (GI 80\%), and reached a higher GI (132\%) in
   the compost product compared with the thermophilic composting treatment.
   Moreover, the decrease of the C/N ratio in vermicompost indicated
   stabilization of the waste. The activities of earthworms played a
   positive role in reducing gaseous emissions in vermicompost, resulting
   in less emissions of NH3 (12.3\% NH3-N of initial nitrogen) and total
   greenhouse gases (8.1 kg CO2-eq/t DM) than those from thermophilic
   compost (24.9\% NH3-N of initial nitrogen, 22.8 kg CO2-eq/t DM).
   Therefore, it can be concluded that vermicomposting can shorten the
   period required to reach compost maturity, can obtain better maturity
   compost, and at the same time reduce gaseous emissions. As an added
   advantage, the earthworms after processing could have commercial uses.},

Abstract = {A farm scale composting drum was used to study exhaust gases from horse
   manure, and from horse manure mixed with tomato plant residues (TPR)
   with a lower C/N ratio. To study whether this addition increased gaseous
   losses of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S), selected gas compounds of carbon
   (C) and N, and sulphur dioxide (SO2), were measured on three dates by
   Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the gas production
   in the drum (g per kg wet substrate), and the content of C, N and S in
   substrates, elemental losses of C, N and S were assessed. Temperatures
   in the substrate inside the drum reached 55-60 degrees C. The production
   of methane (CH4) increased when the mean retention time increased from
   about 2 to 6.3 days. Replacing 50\% of the substrate weight by TPR
   slightly increased the production of NH3, but not of N2O, NO2 or SO2. We
   did not find increased losses of C, N or S after addition of TPR, but
   the production of NH3 and SO2 fluctuated much more. The mean production
   of nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 comprised 15 g CO2 equivalents per kg wet
   substrate, ranging from 8 to 27. Nitrous oxide comprised 80-90\%. Over
   three gas measurements, drum treatment reduced the C content in wet
   substrate by 7-10\%, the N content by about 2\% and the S content by
   0.2-1\%.},

Title = {Microbial Diversity in Compost is Critical in Suppressing Plant Fungal
   Pathogen Survival and Enhancing Cucumber Seedling Growth},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {189-200},
Abstract = {Compost is commonly used in agriculture to improve soil quality and
   enhance plant growth, which is considered to be related to microbial
   communities in compost. However, effects of microbial communities in
   compost on infecting microorganisms have remained underexplored. In this
   study, cucumber seedlings were grown in sterilized potting mix amended
   with sterilized straw composts inoculated with suspensions (4 dilution
   levels including 10(0), 10(-3), 10(-6), and 10(-9)) of the same compost
   that was not sterilized. Cucumber seedlings were challenged by a
   pathogenic F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum. The microbial
   communities were evaluated by using a 16S rRNA multiplex 454
   pyrosequencing approach. In general, in the presence of F. oxysporum sp.
   radicis-cucumerinum, increasing dilution level increased disease
   severity index and decreased plant productivity. The logarithmic numbers
   of F. oxysporum sp. radicis-cucumerinum were significantly negatively
   correlated with the bacterial phylum and OTU (Operational taxonomic
   unit) richness in compost. The promotion of F. oxysporum sp.
   radicis-cucumerinum survival in compost with low microbial diversity,
   might be related to loss of antagonistic activity (as reflected by the
   copy numbers of the genes rhlB and hcnBC), which was caused by loss of
   microbial diversity in compost. In summary, microbial diversity in
   compost is critical in suppressing plant pathogen survival and then
   enhancing cucumber seedling growth.},

Title = {Cow Manure Disposal Using an Earthworm Bio-Bed and the Development of a
   Vermicompost-Based Substrate for Capsicum Seedlings},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {165-176},
Abstract = {Vermicompost is becoming an important substitute for peat in
   horticulture due to the negative consequences of peat depletion. There
   is no aerobic fermentation pretreatment in the process of direct
   digestion of fresh cow manure by earthworms, which resulted in different
   properties of vermicompost compared with traditional treatment methods.
   However, there is limited knowledge on the properties of vermicompost in
   the direct earthworm digestion process. In the present study, a
   large-scale earthworm bio-bed was used to convert fresh cow manure into
   vermicompost, and then the physical, chemical, and microbial properties
   of the vermicompost were determined. To study the influence of mineral
   nutrient additions, vermicompost was mixed with vermiculite at a ratio
   of 4:1 (v/v), and was then used as the growth medium for capsicum
   seedlings. The results showed that nitrate nitrogen (243.39 mg/kg), a
   mmonium nitrogen (50.38 mg/kg), total phosphorus (47.61 g/kg), available
   phosphorus (41.68 g/kg), catalase activity (2.17mL/g.h), bacterial
   biomass (3.60 x 10(7) cfu/g), actinobacterial biomass (2.40 x 10(7)
   cfu/g), and fungal biomass (1.55 x 10(6) cfu/g) measurements were
   significantly higher in vermicompost than in the parent material.
   However, moisture (50.01\%), electrical conductivity (2.07mS/ cm), total
   nitrogen (8.52 g/kg), organic matter (28.47\%), and urease activity
   (0.63mL/g.h) were significantly lower in the vermicompost compared to
   the parent material. The shoot and root morphological indices and the
   capsicum biomass accumulation measurements in the vermicompost
   treatments were superior to those found in the co mmercial peat medium
   (CK). Leaf expansion (14.83 cm), shoot height (24.20 cm), stem diameter
   (4.38 cm), leaf number (16.20 No.), root length (352.83 cm), root
   surface area (60.30 cm(2)), root diameter (0.61 mm), and root volume
   (0.92 cm(3)) significantly higher in vermicompost-vermiculite mixed
   media with added urea (0.5k g/m(3)), superphosphate (10.0 kg/m(3)), and
   potassium chloride (1.0kg/m(3)) than in CK at the late seedling growth
   stage. The addition of mineral nutrients (NPK) had little effect on the
   physical properties of the vermicompost media, but it improved the
   available nutrients. In su mmary, fresh cow manure without pre-treatment
   can be processed into vermicompost using a large-scale earthworm
   bio-bed. Vermicompost could serve as an alternative for co mmercial peat
   media in the cultivation of capsicum plug seedlings, and the beneficial
   effects of adding NPK gradually emerged as the seedling growth time
   increased.},

Title = {Soluble Salts in Compost and Their Effects on Soil and Plants: A Review},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-75},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {The chemical, physical, and biological conditions of soil and growing
   media can be substantively improved by the addition of compost. Compost
   contains many plant essential nutrients (e.g. N, P, and K) and can also
   be a source of organic matter. However, concerns persist over composts
   with a high concentration of soluble salts and their effects on soil
   fertility, plant growth, and yields. Soluble salts refer to soluble ions
   such as Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and Na(+)in compost and are measured indirectly
   and cumulatively through electrical conductivity (EC). Specifically,
   compost salinity is commonly measured using a method referred to as
   EC(5)whereas soils are measured using an ECe. The use of a variety of
   non-standardized methodologies often make interpreting results between
   studies difficult. A compost with an EC5>5 dS m(-1)could be the result
   of high concentrations of Na(+)or other ions, which can be detrimental
   to plants due to their ability to accumulate in plant tissue and
   interfere with root uptake of water. Thus, reducing soluble salts,
   specifically Na(+)and Cl(-)in composts is of high importance. Other
   soluble salts present in compost (e.g. K(+)and Ca2+) are mineral
   nutrients required for plant growth and can aid in reducing soil
   sodicity. In appropriate proportions, quality compost with a high
   EC(5)mixed with soil or media can enhance plant growth and yields.
   Composts with a high EC(5)are adept at aiding in soil remediation by
   facilitating soil particle flocculation, helping leach Na(+)deeper into
   the soil profile and raising soil cation exchange capacity in support of
   increased soil fertility. Labeling composts and developing appropriate
   application methods could allay concerns associated with composts where
   EC5> 5 dS m(-1)and promote compost use and sustainable farming
   practices.},

Title = {Livestock Waste, Potential Manure Production and Its Use in Japan in
   1980 and 2010},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {S43-S52},
Abstract = {The aim of this work is to quantify life cycle of nutrient elements for
   soil and crops, namely nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and
   carbon (C), from feed of livestock to potential of manure production via
   livestock waste, a potentially sustainable application of manure for
   farmland soils in Japan in 1980 and 2010. We also estimated real
   application to farmland from a questionnaire by setting several
   hypotheses to collect real proportion of farm households, because the
   questionnaire was intended for full-time farms, the proportion of which
   is minor within all farms. The questionnaire survey was conducted five
   times, from 1979 to 2003 for 5-year intervals, and one time from 2008 to
   2013. These data were set for the years 1980 and 2010. As a result, the
   livestock feed became lower in P and K input, livestock got better
   nutrient use efficiency for livestock products, and waste production was
   reduced in 2010 than 1980. Potential of manure production was decreased
   in 2010 from what it was in 1980; however, estimated application of
   manure was also reduced from full to half of potential of manure
   production. Application level of manure in 1980 was higher than the
   amount that farmland received sustainably. This might be allowed for
   enhancing soil fertility; as such activity was also needed at that time.
   On the other hand, in 2010, application of manure was estimated to be
   less than half of that in 1980 and had not reached sustainable
   application level. From 1980 to 2010, manure application had been
   decreased, even though trends of manure application for crops per area
   were different in each crop. Although lack or surplus of manure might
   not always explain trend of soil fertility, we need continues survey of
   soil fertilities to check and monitor to grasp the trend of soil
   fertility indicated by total C and N, available N, P, and K, as well as
   estimate application of manure to farmland.},

Abstract = {The behaviors of bioactive compounds treating gaseous pollutants in
   biofilters and in the compost used as soil amendment and in green roof
   buildings are controlled by their thermal properties. There is a lack of
   information on thermal conductivity of olive cake compost (OCC),Kas
   affected by water content and bulk density. Thermal conductivities (K)
   of 40 samples of (OCC) were determined experimentally at bulk densities
   (400-950 kg/m(3)) and moisture contents (10\%-90\%) using a single
   thermal probe method. The results showed that thermal conductivity
   increased linearly as water content, and bulk density increased and with
   a decrease in air filled porosity. Simple linear relationships were
   developed between compost thermal conductivity and dry bulk density and
   the degree of saturation. The experimental values were close to those
   reported recently for leaf compost and green roof soils. The compost at
   water content of 90\% showed the highest thermal conductivity (K) of
   0.60 W/m.k, which indicate that compost, can be used as good cheep
   insulator in geothermal heat storage application and as an additional
   echo-friendly insulation layer in green roof building which might be
   considered as a good means of passive energy saving there.},

Title = {Hot Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) Growth, Fruit Yield, and Quality Using

Abstract = {Many greenhouse-vegetable growers cannot participate in the organic
   market due to the scarcity of organic fertilizers, which are able both
   to (a) satisfy the crop's nutritional needs similarly to when using a
   nutrient solution, and (b) be regarded as biological, ecological, or in
   general terms ``sustainable.{''}Four different fertilization regimes
   using three different hot pepper genotypes were applied under greenhouse
   conditions in arid land of Mexico. The three genotypes were of the
   ``Serrano{''} variety and were obtained from different arid lands in
   northern Mexico. The entire crop management was 100\% organic according
   to United States organic standards. We found that vermicompost-obtained
   from the metabolism of Eisenia fetida feed with cow manure plus maize
   waste-was able to supply the needed nutrients to the cultivars to obtain
   a growth and yield similar to the plants supplied with nutrient
   solution. The most productive genotype (Don Diego) showed the following
   fresh yield values: 1.98, 1.84, 1.24, and 1.11 kg plant(-1) for
   treatments with conventional nutrient solution, vermicompost, solarized
   cow manure, and solarized poultry manure, respectively. The
   fertilization with poultrymanure resulted in lower values in every
   growth and yield variable measured. However, this same treatment showed
   the highest values in ascorbic acid with 328.6 and 327.4 mg 100 mL(-1)
   for genotypes Don Ramon and Don Vicente, respectively. The overall
   results suggest that organic sources of nutrients may be able to supply
   the needs of greenhouse hot peppers as alternative for organic farmers.
   Treatment with vermicompost showed the general best behavior in all of
   the plants.},

Title = {The Compostable Plastic Poly(lactic) Acid Causes a Temporal Shift in
   Fungal Communities in Maturing Compost},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {211-219},
Abstract = {The compostable biopolymer, poly(lactic) acid (PLA), is increasingly
   being used as an alternative to conventional plastics for short
   shelf-life products, disposable bags and packaging, and in agriculture.
   Despite the increase in the amount of PLA entering composting systems,
   few studies have examined the impact of PLA degradation on the compost
   microbial community. Thermophilic fungi play an import role in the
   composting process as they secrete hydrolytic enzymes capable of
   breaking down an array of complex natural polymers. In this study, the
   impact of PLA hydrolysis on the compost fungal community was examined by
   terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 sequencing. At
   25 degrees C, the effect of PLA on the surrounding compost community was
   relatively small and no physical changes were observed to the PLA films.
   However, when incubated at 50 degrees C, where physical disintegration
   of PLA was occurring, a clear divergence between the compost populations
   in the presence and absence of PLA was evident after 2 months but became
   closer to the population in the absence of PLA after 4 months indicating
   that, after causing an initial perturbation after 2 months, the
   population began to return to that seen in the absence of PLA. The only
   exception was in the population containing 50\% (w/w) PLA film, which
   remained divergent after 4 months and was associated with a marked
   acidification of the compost. Thus, 454-pyrosequencing revealed that the
   presence of PLA caused a strong selection for a Thermomyces sp. that was
   present only at low abundance in the absence of PLA.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is the evaluation of the compost quality from
   Kraft mill organic matter by germination Raphanus sativus and Lepidium
   sativum. The evaluation of compost was measured in terms of stability,
   maturity and phytotoxicity. Two compost piles were elaborated, one with
   a ratio of C/N = 23.67 and the other with C/N = 18.67. Each pile was
   divided into 2 sections, pile 1 (compost 1 and 2) and pile 2 (compost 3
   and 4). Wood bark was added to each pile as a structuring material,
   resulting in mixtures conformed by treatment sludge with bark. The
   results obtained show that all the mixtures reached thermophilic
   temperatures (>50 degrees C), resulting in stable and mature compost
   with humic and fulvic acid ratios > 1.9. The gemination index showed no
   presence of toxic substances, with germination percentages over 80\% for
   all the tests of Raphanus sativus and Lepidium sativum, while the N:P:K
   ratio of 0.5 of Compost 4 positively and significantly boosted the
   growth of both species with respect to control. It was concluded that
   Compost 4, with C/N ratio = 23.67 with structuring material presented
   positive and significant results (p > 0.05) with respect to Compost 1, 2
   and 3.},

Title = {Comparing and Modeling the Thermal Inactivation of Bacteriophages as
   Pathogenic Viruses Surrogates in Chicken Litter Compost},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare and model the thermal inactivation
   of bacteriophages as surrogates for pathogenic viruses, such as avian
   influenza virus, in chicken litter compost. Three bacteriophages {[}o6,
   MS2, and Felix O1 (FO)] were inoculated separately into aged chicken
   litter compost with various moisture contents (MCs), and then exposed to
   75 and 85 degrees C for up to 3 h. The bacteriophage o6 was undetectable
   during come-up time at all tested conditions. After 3 h heat treatment
   at 75 degrees C, population reductions of MS2 in the compost with 20,
   30, and 40\% MCs were 5.83, 6.08, and 8.32 log plaque forming units (PFU
   g(-1)), respectively, as compared with 4.87, 5.40, and 5.75 log PFU
   g(-1)for FO, respectively. When exposed to 85 degrees C, population
   reductions of MS2 in the compost with 20, 30, and 40\% MCs were 6.07,
   7.93, and 8.03 log PFU g(-1), respectively, as compared with 6.29, 6.20,
   and 7.59 log PFU g(-1)for FO, respectively. Both bacteriophages MS2 and
   FO had higher recovery rates from compost, and bacteriophage MS2 had a
   comparable thermal resistance with the reported resistance of avian
   influenza virus than bacteriophage FO. Additionally, the proposed
   non-linear three-phase model was developed to describe the survival of
   bacteriophages exposed to the physical-heat treatment into different
   stages. Considering that virus may survive in some cold spots of compost
   piles, this study provides scientific evidence for the fertilizer
   industry to validate the effectiveness of their heating process in order
   to inactivate avian influenza virus in chicken litter compost.},

   Application in a Tropical Acid Soil},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {Tropical acid soils are highly weathered as they exist under tropical
   environment with high rainfall and temperature throughout the year,
   which affects nitrogen availability. Soil organic nitrogen is important
   in estimating soil nitrogen availability. The combined use of urea and
   compost in this study was carried out to decrease sole dependence on
   urea, buffer soil acidification, and reduce nitrogen losses through
   leaching. Thus, soil buffering capacity, incubation, and organic
   nitrogen fractionation studies were conducted to determine soil
   buffering capacity, availability of total nitrogen, organic fractions
   nitrogen, and inorganic nitrogen in soil after 90 days of incubation
   following compost. Soil pH, buffering capacity, total nitrogen, organic
   nitrogen fractions, exchangeable ammonium, and available nitrate were
   higher in all treatments with compost and combined use of urea and
   compost. Total hydrolyzable nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen, (ammonium +
   amino sugar)-nitrogen, amino sugar-nitrogen, and amino acid-nitrogen
   were higher in soils with urea and compost suggesting that decomposition
   of soil organic fractions nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and
   available nitrate was affected by the addition of urea and compost. Urea
   can be amended with compost to regulate availability nitrogen in soil
   for crop use.},

Title = {Compost Cation Exchange Capacity via Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (PXRF)
   Spectrometry},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {271-278},
Abstract = {Compost is a valuable organic amendment which affords substantive
   fertility to soils where applied. A common component of compost
   fertility is cation exchange capacity (CEC), which has traditionally
   been determined via standard wet chemistry laboratory methods. This
   research utilized portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry to
   evaluate 74 compost samples from the USA and Canada. PXRF elemental data
   were used for predicting compost CEC via random forest (RF) regression.
   Comparison between laboratory-determined vs. PXRF predicted CEC produced
   the following relationships: R-2=0.90, RMSE=5.41 meq 100g(-1) (model
   calibration) and R-2=0.60, RMSE=8.07 meq 100g(-1) (model validation). A
   key advantage of this technique is that the same data used for CEC
   prediction can also yield insight into other compost parameters of
   interest such as heavy metal content, plant essential nutrient content,
   salinity, and pH. Taken collectively, the PXRF approach can provide
   rapid, on-site analysis of compost which was previously not feasible
   with conventional methods. Our initial study has established the
   viability of PXRF for compost CEC determination, with further
   development on a wider array of feedstocks suggested for future study.},

Abstract = {As a by-product of municipal sewage treatment, sewage sludge must be
   properly treated to avoid secondary pollution to the environment.
   Aerobic composting is one of the mainstream technologies in sludge
   treatment, but nitrogen loss in composting process usually reaches more
   than 40\%, which seriously reduces the fertilizer efficiency of
   composting products, and at the same time, a large amount of odor will
   cause harm to the environment. In this article, the nitrogen emission
   and nitrogen loss were reduced by adding sawdust of different
   proportions in the sludge composting process, and the nitrogen emission
   and nitrogen loss were reduced by up to 70\% and 30\% respectively. The
   addition of sawdust can significantly increase the sludge composting
   temperature and duration of high temperature period, reduce the sludge
   pH and water content, increase the mineralization rate of organic
   matter, thereby inhibiting the nitrogen loss. The results showed that
   nitrogen loss decreased with the increase of sawdust ratio, and A30 was
   the best ratio. The process has the advantages of simple operation, low
   cost and good nitrogen holding effect.},

Title = {Influence of Degradation of PLA with High Degree of Crystallinity on

Abstract = {Degradation rate of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a compostable plastic, is
   affected by its physical properties and environmental conditions. Since
   PLA with different physical properties enter composting systems,
   investigation of degradation of PLA with strong physical properties in
   compost at different temperatures and its influence on compost fungal
   community structure are the main concerns of this study. To determine
   the effect of slow PLA degradation on fungal communities, PLA granules
   with high degree of crystallinity, 60\%, were incubated in compost at 25
   degrees C and 50 degrees C for 4 months at 0, 10, 25 and 50\% (w/w)
   concentrations; their degradation rates were compared and impact of PLA
   degradation on compost fungal communities was examined by terminal
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). PLA granules in
   compost at 25 degrees C showed no physical changes but at 50 degrees C
   physical disintegration occurred after 4 months. TRFLP revealed that
   fungal community profiles in compost were affected by PLA, particularly
   at 50 degrees C where PLA degraded. Compost fungal communities in the
   presence of PLA at 50 degrees C had more variation, 63\%, than at 25
   degrees C (52\%). Incubation time affected fungal community structure as
   during 2nd month, community structure changed specifically at 50 degrees
   C and at 50\% (w/w) PLA, however, became similar to that in the absence
   of PLA at the end of 4th month at both temperatures indicating PLA with
   a high degree of crystallinity causes a temporal perturbation in compost
   fungal communities. In compost containing PLA at 50 degrees C, abundance
   of certain TRFs representing fungal populations increased to 30\% which
   may involve in PLA utilization.},

Abstract = {Bacterial species of the genus Acidithiobacillus have been proved to
   reduce soil salinity, but their chemical impact on a saline compost has
   not been reported. This work is aimed to evaluate the effects of A.
   thiooxidans on the chemical properties of a saline compost formulation.
   When added to a microcosm under nonsterile conditions, a
   sulfur-supplemented A. thiooxidans inoculum lowered pH to 7.16, reduced
   exchangeable sodium levels to 97 cmol kg(-1), and increased electrical
   conductivity to 7.93 dS m(-1) after 720 h. No differences in bacterial
   fingerprint were observed after adding A. thiooxidans, either
   supplemented with sulfur or not. These results suggest that inoculating
   saline composts with sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strains of the genus
   Acidithiobacillus could help to decrease salinity-associated parameters,
   and it has the potential of reducing the impact of prolonged application
   of organic fertilizers on the soil. Additionally, it could be a valuable
   tool to remediate high-salinity soils.},

Abstract = {In order to evaluate the effect of different fertilizers' sources on
   micronutrients' content and sugar quality of sugar beet, three
   fertilizers' sources include spent mushroom compost (SMC) (29 t/ha),
   sheep manure (23 t/ha), chemical fertilizer including zinc sulfate (10
   kg/ha), copper sulfate (10 kg/ha), iron sulfate (30 kg/ha), manganese
   sulfate (15 kg/ha) and no fertilizer (control) were conducted in a
   randomized complete block design with three replications at Research
   Farm of Shahrekord University in 2013. The results showed that
   micronutrients' content in the root, alpha-amino-N sucrose percentage
   and sucrose yield were significantly affected by fertilizer treatments.
   The highest elements' content of Fe (90.39 mg/kg), Zn (39.15 mg/kg), and
   Cu (18.1 mg/kg) in sugar beet root belonged to SMC treatment. Besides,
   SMC caused less alpha-amino-N accumulation in sugar beet compared with
   sheep manure (1.05 MEq/g). Sucrose percentage was higher in SMC
   treatment than the sheep manure. Likewise, sucrose percentage revealed a
   significant positive correlation with micronutrients of zinc, copper,
   and manganese in sugar beet root. Therefore, it could be concluded that
   using SMC increases micronutrients' content in the root and at the same
   time, plays an important role in sugar quality improvement of sugar
   beet.},

Title = {Impact of Composting Food Waste with Green Waste on Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions from Compost Windrows},

Abstract = {Windrow composting of green waste as an alternative to green waste
   disposal in landfills requires an understanding of the impacts on
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the development of effective and
   efficient management strategies to reduce these emissions. The addition
   of food waste to green waste compost operations is becoming more common,
   but its effect on GHG emissions is less understood. As more food waste
   diversion occurs as a result of recent implementation of climate smart
   policies in California, more information is needed to address the
   sustainability of composting different combinations of waste types. We
   monitored GHG emissions from compost windrows comprised of green waste
   alone and a green/food waste mixture (green waste : food waste = 9:1, by
   wet weight) at the University of California, Davis Student Farm in 2016
   using a modified, open, flow-through chamber technique. When comparing
   total emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), the green/food
   waste mixture produced 110 kg CO2 eq./ton DM (dry matter, std error =
   12.2), which were slightly lower than emissions produced by the green
   waste alone (152 kg CO2 eq./ton DM, std error = 15.9). Methane was a
   large contributor to global warming potential (GWP) of both composting
   treatments, suggesting that management practices that optimize porosity
   and air flow in compost piles are promising in reducing emissions from
   both green waste and green/food waste mixtures.},

Abstract = {For 22years, plots were amended annually with oak (Quercus velutina
   Lam.) or sugar maple leaves (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in Mt. Carmel, CT on
   a loamy upland soil. Leaves were incorporated into the soil immediately

   (lettuce, peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, edamame, delicata squash,
   spaghetti squash, onions, leeks, rutabaga, carrots, and beans) from
   these plots were compared to yields from unamended controls. All plots
   received equal amounts of fertilizer. There were no significant
   differences in vegetable yields with any of the crops between any of the
   treatments indicating there are no deleterious effects of annual
   applications of uncomposted leaves. Some soil characteristics such as
   organic matter and pH improved on the leaf amended plots. Study shows
   that annual applications of leaves to cropland (sheet composting) is a
   viable alternative for the disposal of leaves.},

Abstract = {It has long been recognized that composting yields a large quantity of
   thermal energy, which is normally lost to the surrounding environment as
   heat. Efforts to recover this heat using compost heat recovery systems
   (CHRSs) have been sporadic. Literature on the subject is also
   disjointed. To summarize the research that has been conducted, the
   authors performed an extensive literature review, covering publications
   in scientific journals, trade magazines, books, theses, and published
   reports. A focus on CHRS design and heat recovery rates is presented.
   The review covers 45 CHRSs in 16 different countries, ranging from
   simple hotbeds used in China 2000 years ago, to advanced super-thermal
   conductor heat pipe systems in 2016. Heat recovery rates varied
   significantly, with no predictable trend among the 45 systems. Recovery
   rates averaged 1895 kJ/hr (1159 kJ/kg DM) for lab-scale systems, 20,035
   kJ/hr (4302 kJ/kg DM) for pilot-scale systems, and 204,907 kJ/hr (7084

Abstract = {This study aimed at measuring the effect of vermicompost on soil
   physical and chemical properties and runoff quality and quantity in
   agro-ecosystems in Northern Iran. Thus, runoff measurement plots of 1 x
   5 m were set up in sloping lands under natural rainfall during 5 months.
   Runoff quality and quantity, soil properties, and plant growth were
   measured. This study shows that the amount of runoff water and its
   quality (sediment yields, nitrate content, pH, and conductivity) were
   not influenced by the fertilization treatments (vermicompost alone,
   chemical fertilization alone, or their mixture), except for the first
   month of the experiment where a lower runoff amount was measured when
   vermicompost was applied alone. Although no difference in plant growth
   was found, our results showed a significant improvement of soil
   properties when vermicompost was used as a fertilizer. Consequently,
   this study shows that vermicompost can be considered as an alternative
   application for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and improving
   soil properties but its impact on plant growth and runoff is limited to
   the short term.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of irrigation regime
   and potting media on morpho-physiological and biochemical
   characteristics of pot marigold. The experiment was arranged factorially
   based on a completely randomized design. The first factor was irrigation
   regime in three levels of 80, 60 and 40\% available water content and
   the second factor was potting media in five levels of 20\% vermicompost,
   30\% vermicompost, 20\% manure compost, 30\% manure compost and control
   (sand and soil in equal proportions). Morpho-physiological traits (plant
   height, stem diameter, number of flowering stem, root diameter, root
   length, root dry weight, aerial dry weight, total dry weight, relative
   water content, ionic stability and water use efficiency) and biochemical
   traits (malondialdehyde content, catalase and peroxidase activity,
   chlorophyll and carotenoid contents) were measured. Morpho-physiological
   parameters, chlorophyll and carotenoid decreased under water deficit,
   while increased with application of vermicompost and manure compost.
   Also, lipid peroxidation, catalase and peroxidase activity enhanced
   under water deficit, while decreased with application of vermicompost
   and manure compost. In other words, the application of vermicompost and
   manure compost in potting media reduced the harmful effects of water
   deficit. Total dry mass and water use efficiency were about 3-fold
   higher in plants grown in 30\% vermicompost or 30\% manure compost
   substrate compared to those in control plants. The results suggest that
   the application of 30\% manure compost could be recommended as suitable
   potting media due to reducing the negative effects of water shortages,
   helping to nourish the plant, cheapness and accessibility compared with
   30\% vermicompost.},

Title = {Feedstock Carbon Influence on Compost Biochemical Stability and Maturity},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-70},
Abstract = {Quantity and quality of readily degradable carbon influences the
   composting process especially for compost mixture high in
   lignocellulotic material. Effects of carbon source on stability and
   maturity of compost from in-vessel systems are poorly understood.
   Research was conducted to investigate the effects of carbon composition
   of feedstock on the evolution of stability indices and reliability of
   maturity tests for accelerated vessel composting systems. Rice straw,
   sugarcane bagasse, and coffee hulls were composted in a modified rotary
   in-vessel composter amended with either cattle or sheep manure. Distinct
   evolution patterns were observed across carbon sources for temperature,
   with the sugarcane compost never attaining thermophilic temperatures.
   Time to peak temperature and return to ambient were significantly
   different between the rice and coffee compost. Comparatively, organic
   matter degradation followed a similar pattern for all carbon sources,
   although rice straw showed the faster degradative rate and coffee hulls
   the greatest overall loss. Both pH and electrical conductivity were
   inappropriate stability indices across carbon sources, while the
   NH4+/NO3 ratio was lower than the threshold from week 1. The Solvite (R)
   maturity test was the best suited quality indicator and was related to
   compost respiration. The rice compost at week 12 was the only mature
   compost with an index value of 7. However, the coffee compost was in the
   curing stage with a value of 6. In vitro phytotoxicity assays on hot
   pepper contrasted the Sovita (R) interpretation for rice compost, which
   showed the lowest germination index. All compost had a stimulatory
   effect on cucumber seeds. In vivo seeding assays corroborated in vitro
   results with rice compost showing the greatest negative effect,
   augmented at 100\% compost inclusion. Carbon source significantly
   influenced compost stability and maturity indices, which suggests that
   greater attention should be directed to quality indices in relation to
   feedstock composition.},

Title = {Evolution of Organic Matter Within Sixty Days of Composting of
   Lignocellulosic Food Industry Waste in Malaysia},

Abstract = {Empty fruit bunches (EFB), coffee grounds (CG), and palm oil mill sludge
   (POMS) were composted in the laboratory for 60 days in order to study
   the composting process of lignocellulosic food industry wastes. In the
   first part of the experiment, EFB, CG, and POMS were composted alone
   (composting of single lignocellulosic material), and in the second part,
   EFB was composted with CG (1EFB:1CG ratio) and POMS (1EFB:1POMS ratio).
   The effects of different turning frequencies on the physical and
   chemical properties of composting were observed and its relation with
   the degradation process was highlighted. Results showed that oil and
   grease were first degraded, followed by recalcitrant compounds like
   alpha-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose
   were degraded mainly during the 60 days of composting, and the
   progressive reduction of the cellulose/lignin ratio proved that the main
   evolution of these wastes took place. It was observed that 3, 6, and 9
   days of turning frequency did not affect the physicochemical properties
   of the compost. Composting EFB alone failed to achieve the required
   quality of maturity compost within 60 days, while CG and POMS recorded
   low in biological activity. Better results were shown in composting of
   EFB mixed with coffee grounds and POMS, the C/N ratio dropped to less
   than 20 by the 8th week of the composting period. Composting of mixed
   lignocellulosic materials showed larger changes compared to composting
   of single lignocellulosic material, reaching a C/N ratio below 20 within
   8 weeks.},

Title = {Use of Organic Compost for the Fertilization of Piata and Paiaguas
   Grasses: Effects of Dose on Morphogenetic, Structural, Nutritional, and
   Productive Characteristics},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},

Abstract = {The use of organic compost in pasture fertilization is a form of
   recycling nutrients contained in waste and reducing chemical fertilizer
   use. To perform pasture fertilization, however, grass responses to doses
   of organic composts must be known. Thus, the objective of this study was
   to find the best dose of laying hen organic compost to maximize the
   productive, morphogenetic, structural, and nutritional responses of
   Paiaguas and PiatA grasses. A completely randomized factorial (4x 2)
   design was used, composed of organic compost doses (0, 400, 800, and
   1,200kg equivalent N.ha(-1)) and two cultivars (PiatA and Paiaguas) of
   Urochloa brizantha grass with three replicates per treatment, assessed
   during four successive cuts. The parameters evaluated were dry matter
   yield (DM) of shoots and roots, leaf appearance rate (LAR), leaf
   elongation rate (LER), phyllochron, pseudoculm elongation rate (PER),
   final leaf length (FLL), number of green leaves (NGL), and senescence
   rate (SR). The nutritional value of the grasses was also assessed
   through contents of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein (CP),
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber, cellulose,
   hemicellulose, lignin, and in vitro organic matter digestibility
   (IVOMD). DM yields of both shoot and root increased due to nitrogen
   increase and Paiaguas grass had the highest yields (P < 0.01). The best
   organic compost doses ranged from 640 to 950kg of equivalent N.ha(-1)
   for most morphogenic and structural grass characteristics. The chemical
   composition of grasses was not influenced (P > 0.05) by doses of organic
   compost. Levels of 8.05\% CP, 67.10\% NDF, and 65.14\% IVOMD were
   observed for cultivar Paiaguas, while for cultivar PiatA these values
   were 7.58\% CP, 70.32\% NDF, and 63.38\% IVOMD. It is concluded that
   high doses of an organic compost are required (in equivalent N) for
   cultivars to reach the highest growth rates and that Paiaguas grass has
   higher dry matter yield, higher growth rates, and better chemical
   composition when compared to PiatA grass in similar organic
   fertilization conditions.},

Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Cornell University Farm Services collects recyclable organics from
   various locations around the University including the dining halls and
   other food service establishments, the veterinary hospital, satellite
   dairy cattle, horse and chicken farms, cropping operations, and
   greenhouses. In 2013, they diverted approximately 6714 metric tons of
   organic residuals to the compost facility. A questionnaire was developed
   to get information from the facility in order to calculate greenhouse
   gas emissions for each step in this process including savings from
   carbon sequestration through compost use. It was found that in 2013,
   Cornell's compost facility emitted 104.6 metric tons carbon equivalent
   (MTCE) and saved 201.4 MTCE through compost use for a total carbon
   footprint savings of 96.7 MTCE/year (carbon negative). This equates to
   0.0154 MTCE/tonne feedstock emitted and 0.03 MTCE saved through compost
   use for a total carbon footprint savings of 0.0146 MTCE/tonne fresh
   matter. These values are specific to this facility, but the
   questionnaire and calculations can be used by compost facilities to
   calculate the carbon footprint of composting.},

   Measuring Physical Properties, Plant Development, and Runoff Water
   Quality},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {231-241},
Abstract = {Six green roof substrate blends were created by using composts sourced
   from local suppliers and the Michigan State University Student Organic
   Farm. Bulk density, field capacity, total porosity, and saturated
   hydraulic conductivity were determined for each substrate and compared
   to an unamended expanded shale aggregate. Significant differences were
   detected in all measured physical properties. A plant growth study was
   conducted in a greenhouse. Ocimum basilicum (basil), Sedum floriforum
   (sedum), and Carex eburnea (bristleleaf sedge) were grown in a depth of
   10 cm of all six substrates for 6 months. The greatest dry shoot masses
   in bristleleaf sedge and sedum were twice those of the smallest masses.
   The largest wet harvest of basil was four times greater than the
   smallest harvest. Runoff water was collected after simulated
   precipitation events on regular intervals during the plant growth study
   and analyzed for nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Ion
   concentrations were greatest on the first measurement date and decreased
   rapidly with time. Compost selection had a strong impact on initial
   nitrate and phosphate concentrations, but the influence of compost on
   concentrations diminished with time. Overall, compost selection was
   found to have measureable and meaningful impacts on green roof substrate
   performance.},

Abstract = {Detergent fiber analysis was used to fractionate carbon (C) into
   hemicellulose (degradable carbon) and cellulose and lignin (recalcitrant
   carbon) for cattle manure (CM), neem leaves (NL), corn stover (CS), and
   lawn clipping (LC) to investigate the effects of C quality on
   vermicomposting. A factorial design having five C sources (CM, CM + NL,
   CS, CS + NL, and LC) and two earthworm species (Eudrilus eugeniae (EE)
   and Omodeoscolex divergens (OD)) was studied under pure and mixed
   culture vermicomposting. Earthworm fecundity, biomass, and vermicompost
   quality were measured. The combination of culture and C source was
   significant (p < 0.05) for all fecundity and biomass variables. CM and
   CM + NL were mainly associated with increased responses. Change in
   population was > tenfold for EE and OD reared on CM. Percentage change
   in biomass increased up to 200\% for OD and EE when fed CM and CM + NL.
   Contrastingly, decreases or no changes in fecundity and biomass
   parameters were associated with CS and CS + NL. The NL combinations
   resulted in lower responses in fecundity and biomass; however,
   earthworms favored CM + NL over CS + NL. OD was highest (p < 0.05)
   amongst cultures for LC. The mixed culture response was generally low
   for parameters measured. Vermicompost C/N ratio decreased from initial
   carbon source values except for LC. O. divergens vermi-converted carbon
   sources of varying C quality, producing distinct vermicompost in the

Abstract = {Boxwood blight, caused by Calonectria pseudonaviculata, is a devastating
   fungal disease of Buxus spp., first observed in the United States in
   2011. Due to the persistent nature of the produced microsclerotia,
   concern arose over the potential for compost to serve as a disease
   vector. Previous work demonstrated that C. pseudonaviculata is very
   stable at mesophilic temperatures, however, no previous work has
   evaluated C. pseudonaviculata during composting. Our objective was to
   evaluate the survival of C. pseudonaviculata microsclerotia after being
   composted for 24, 48, and 72h at temperatures of 40, 50, and 60 degrees
   C. Composting was performed using a newly created bioreactor system,
   allowing for precise control of the composting process. In conjunction
   with the composting evaluations, the same temperature/time combinations
   were evaluated in incubators. While the pathogen survived 40 degrees C
   through 72h in an incubator, compost survival was minimal, with only
   some survival observed at 24h at the same temperature. We were able to
   determine that exposure to temperatures 50 degrees C for 24h or longer,
   and that exposure in a composting system for 48h or longer at 40 degrees
   C would kill the microsclerotia.},

   Dependency},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The most frequent way to survey green waste composts is to monitor the
   temperature during the composting process. However, if the temperature
   is a good index for global biological processes, it is not for the
   chemical stability. In order to identify a reliable index, this work
   investigates water extraction coupled to spectroscopic indexes such as
   E-2/E-3, E-4/E-6, and SUVA(254) ratios, and fluorescence indexes such as
   Kalbitz, Milori, CP/PARAFAC, and Fluorescence Region Integration. The
   measurements of these indexes are carried out with six samples from
   different sites with different green waste material composition. The
   results show that most indexes depend on the green waste origin more
   than the composting time; some depend mostly on the material origin
   while others on compost age. A comparison of these results indicates
   that the biochemical process occurs more rapidly than expected by the
   compost producers. The combination of these indicators gives useful
   information on the processes that take place during composting.},

Abstract = {Composts especially spent mushroom composts (SMC) have been used for
   their ability to degrade toxic organic pollutants. Due to extreme
   toxicity, endosulfan (C9H6Cl6O3S) is categorized as a Category 1
   pollutant by the U.S. EPA because of its well-reported carcinogenicity.
   This study was done to monitor the biodegradation potential of SMC
   against this pesticide. For this purpose, bioreactors (BRs) system was
   designed to mimic the field conditions. Soil within all four BRs
   contaminated with endosulfan was amended with four different treatments
   of SMC. Quantitative reduction in amount of endosulfan isomers was
   calculated using Gas Chromatography-Electron Capture Detector. For the
   monitoring of metabolites formed as a result of biodegradation, Gas
   Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry was used. Maximum attenuation was
   observed in BR1 (fresh SMC and soil). In BR2 when fresh SMC was added in
   sterilized soil, rate of removal was declined as compared to BR1. In
   another bioreactor BR3, where unsterilized soil was used with sterilized
   SMC, total reduction in quantity of endosulfan was less than BR1 and
   BR2. BR4 (abiotic control) showed the least reduction suggesting the
   role of SMC and soil microbes. Degradation was well described using
   simple first-order kinetics which revealed that the active microcosm of
   BR1 manifested least DT50. Denaturation of either SMC(BR3) or soil(BR2)
   or both (BR4) resulted in less biodegradation than BR1.},

Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of
   vermicompost (V) and phosphate rock (PR) on blackberry (Rubus fruticosus
   L. agg.) plants inoculated with Glomus mosseae (Nicol. \& Gerd.)
   Gerdemann \& Trappe (AMF). Plant growth parameters, total phenol
   compounds and total flavonoids were evaluated on leaves. Anthocyanin
   contents, soluble solids (SS), pH, titratable acidity (TA) and SS/TA
   ratio was evaluated in blackberries fruits. Blackberry plants were
   obtained from cuttings from field plants, which were distributed in soil
   according to a randomized complete block design with three repetitions.
   Treatments were vermicompost (10 g plant(-1)), phosphate rock (1 g
   plant(-1)), Glomus mosseae (AMF), (1g plant(-1)), PR + AMF, V + PR, V
   +AMF, V + PR+ AMF and control without any amended. Plant height and stem
   diameter were measured five months after treatments, while total phenols
   and total flavonoids in leaves were evaluated eight months later.
   Anthocyanins, SS, pH, and TA were determined in blackberry fruits ten
   months after. Plant height was not statistically affected (p0.05),
   although total phenol compounds were higher (21.1 mg g(-1) dry plant) in
   the V+PR+AMF treatment, whereas the V + AMF treatment produced more dry
   plant total flavonoids (1.4 mg g(-1)), compared with control plants.
   Blackberries produced with the vermicompost treatment had more
   anthocyanins (9.54 mg g(-1)) than control plants. Soluble solids, pH and
   titratable acidity were not statistically (p0.05) affected by any
   treatment.},

Title = {Effect of Vermicompost Tea on Faba Bean Growth and Yield},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-285},
Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of vermicompost tea (VCT) as a
   natural foliar fertilizer in faba bean. To determine the effect of VCT
   at different doses on the growth and reproduction of faba bean, VCT was
   produced and three different concentrations (0, 10, and 20\% VCT) were
   applied as a foliar fertilizer to faba bean plants. Plant height, number
   of flowers, and pods per plant as well as soluble sugars were measured
   weekly after treatment for a period of 11weeks. Treated plants were
   larger and had more flowers per clump, as well as more clumps and pods
   per plant than the control. Moreover, treated plants reached the
   flowering stage at least 3weeks earlier than the control. This could be
   explained by the presence of nutrients, humic acid, and probably
   hormones in VCT, which may positively affect growth, reproduction, and
   yield. Treatment at 10\% VCT presented better values than 20\% VCT. The
   latter contained more humic acid, which probably limited growth and
   flowering. The soluble sugar and protein contents were higher in treated
   plants, and the highest values coincided with the flowering and
   reproductive stages. Similarly, seeds produced by treated plants were
   richer in protein that control seeds. These results indicate that 10\%
   VCT is a useful fertilizer to improve growth in faba bean. This study
   highlights the possibility of using VCT as a foliar fertilizer to
   increase growth in faba bean.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {256-270},
Abstract = {Compost tea has been used throughout the world to control diseases and
   promote the growth of plants. The microbial community is the main factor
   involved both in the antagonistic effect against relevant phytopathogens
   and as a stimulator of plant growth. The objective of this research is
   to determine the bacterial diversity present in four types of compost as
   well as some of the mechanisms that may be involved in the positive
   effects of compost tea on crops. Aerated (ACT) and non-aerated (NCT)
   compost teas were obtained from four different composts: spent mushroom
   substrate compost (SMC), grape marc compost (GMC), greenhouse
   horticultural crop residues compost (CRC), and vermicompost (CRV). 16S
   rDNA-based DGGE profiles were obtained for each compost tea and their
   respective bacterial communities were analyzed. Of the 100 clones
   obtained, those typical for being dominant for all profiles were chosen.
   In total, 20 different clones were sequenced. The results showed that
   the bacterial communities of most compost teas had high richness,
   diversity, and evenness values, with relative abundance of species
   belonging to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. The NCTs obtained from
   all the composts, especially CRC and CRV, showed high levels of
   siderophore production, while teas from GMC manifested high and
   consistent cellulase activity. The ACTs from all the composts,
   especially SMC, had high protease activity.},

Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The different organic matter fractions of residues significantly impact
   the degradability of organic material in composting windrows. Based on
   that, this study aimed to find out the organic matter fractions that
   most impact the breakdown rate during composting, besides proposing
   models to estimate the solids reductions in sheep bedding composting
   windrows. To that end, 24 sheep beddings from different locations and
   varied composition were composted so as to ensure the representativeness
   of the sample. The models found for reduction in total (TS) and volatile
   (VS) solids as a function of compostable organic matter (COM) and
   organic matter resistant to composting (OMRC) were not significant.
   Lignin had correlation coefficients of -0.6, -0.89, and -0.84 in
   relation to temperature, TS reduction, and VS reduction, respectively.
   The hemicellulose:lignin ratio was the parameter most correlated with
   temperature (0.69), TS reduction (0.91), VS reduction (0.92), and
   nitrogen (0.5), which led to more significant predictive models. It can
   be concluded that the hemicellulose:lignin ratio is the parameter that
   most impacts the breakdown of organic matter and nitrogen losses in
   sheep bedding composting windrows.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of application of
   different organic fertilizers (general organic fertilizer, GOF; biogas
   residue, BR; refined organic fertilizer, ROF) as compared to no
   fertilizer on the composition of the soil organic matter. Different
   scales of experiment (sand filtration tube, pot, and field plot
   experiment) were conducted to study the effect of organic fertilizers.
   The results showed that application of organic fertilizer can
   significantly increase soil organic matter and improve its quality. The
   content of soil organic carbon and humus increased with the growing of
   fertilization within a certain range (0 similar to 38 t ha(-1)). In sand
   filtration tube experiment, ROF can significantly increase the quality
   of humic acid (HA)/fulvic acid (FA), while it had little effect on the
   quality of HA/FA in the pot and plot experiment. In the field plot
   experiment, application with mid-dosage (38 t ha(-1)) of ROF can improve
   total organic carbon (TOC), HA and FA (by 70\%, 89\%, and 74\%,
   respectively) compared with the control, and it had the best effect of
   all. BR for its incomplete fermented, had the worst effect of all.
   Therefore, ROF with 38 t.ha(-1) could be used as the optimal
   fertilization scheme for the purpose of improving soil organic carbon.},

Title = {Fingerprint of Exhaust Gases and Database of Microbial Diversity During
   Silkworm Excrement Composting},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},

Abstract = {Composting can convert silkworm excrement (SE) into good fertilizer, but
   the popularization of this practice is greatly hampered due to the
   strong odor produced. Determining the gas pollutants, the potential
   native aerogenic microorganisms and deodorant microorganism communities
   will lay foundations for developing good strategies to deal with malodor
   pollution from SE composting. This study qualitatively and
   quantitatively analyzed the exhaust gas and the microbial diversity.
   With a combination of solid-phase micro-extraction-gas chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry technology and other methods of Chinese
   national standards, 43 odor pollutants from SE composting were
   identified and quantified. Ammonia, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
   were the three major pollutants among the volatile inorganic compounds,
   with concentrations far exceeding the permissible standards for
   workplaces in China. 5-Ethyl-2,2,3-trimethyl-heptane,
   2,2,4,6,6-5-methyl-heptane and 5-isobutyl-nonane accounted for 46.58\%
   of volatile organic compounds. Using analysis of ribosome DNA sequences
   with Illumina Miseq PE 2{*} 250, a next generation high-throughput
   sequencing technology, more than 694 bacteria (and actinomycetes) and
   more than 136 fungi were annotated, including groups of native aerogenic
   microorganisms and deodorant microorganisms. This study indicated a
   serious malodor problem and abundant microorganisms from SE composting
   and provided basic data not only for odor pollution control but also for
   future functional microorganism studies.},

Abstract = {Pathogen inactivation due to temperature exposure was studied in
   full-scale covered aerated static piles (CASP) treating municipal
   biosolids. The objectives of the study were to assess the impact of the
   temperature contact time on pathogen inactivation and to analyze whether
   the gradual increase in temperature, as occurs in compost piles, trigger
   a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. Twenty-two temperature probes
   imitating random particle behavior were seeded with Escherichia coli and
   Salmonella and introduced into the CASP. It was found that 92\% of the
   compost pile experienced temperatures >= 55 degrees C for at least three
   consecutive days during the first stage of composting (36 days). This
   number rose to 93\% after the pile was turned and composted for a
   further 20 days. At the end of active composting, the fecal coliforms
   level in the compost matrix, determined by culturing methods, was <10(3)
   MPN center dot g(-1) total solids, while Salmonella was below its
   detection limit of <3 MPN center dot 4 g(-1) total solids. The molecular
   method indicated that there were live cells which had apparently entered
   a VBNC state. Nonetheless, it was concluded further study is needed to
   assess overall risk, since other factors such as pH, toxic compounds,
   and microbial competition and antagonism were excluded from this
   particular study. In future, as the techniques presented herein are
   refined, they may be useful for validating different types of composting
   technologies for sanitation effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are produced during the composting process, but
   few studies have measured emissions from a full-scale windrow of
   composting green-waste. This is important for evaluating composting as a
   waste management option and for understanding how changes to current
   composting management practices could help reduce emissions. This study
   uses micrometeorological mass balance (MMB) and open flow-through
   chamber techniques to measure emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
   (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a windrow of composting green-waste
   in Northern California. The MMB technique yielded mean upwind-downwind
   concentration differences over the study period that showed sourcing of
   all three GHGs. CO2 showed a stronger signal than CH4 and N2O. A strong
   diel pattern was found in the concentration differences at lower levels
   and fluxes of CO2, with substantial noise likely obscuring any possible
   daily patterns for CH4 and N2O. Fluxes normalized by the time since the
   previous turn event revealed an initial rapid rise in CO2 concentration
   differences (at lower levels) and fluxes, peaking close to 13 h after
   the turn event followed by a gradual decline. The same pattern was not
   as clear for the other two gases but overall declines in concentration
   differences and fluxes were apparent with increasing time since the
   previous turn event. Substantial differences between MMB and chamber
   calculated fluxes were found, due to both differences in the techniques
   as well as sampling frequency.},

Abstract = {In Tunisia, on-site co-composting of oil mill waste would overcome

   was to determine the physic-chemical and microbiological properties and
   nutrient supply characteristics of mixed oil mill waste and green waste
   compost. Two piles of the same raw materials (2/3 oil mill waste-1/3
   green waste, w/w) were moistened with two kinds of water: treated urban
   wastewater (A(1)) and tap water (A(2)). Results showed the following:
   (i) produced compost decreased in C/N from 32 to 12.30 +/- 0.89 (A(1))
   and 11 +/- 0.89 (A(2)); (ii) major elements (P and K) were within
   acceptable limits; (iii) A(1) and A(2) had potentially lower heavy metal
   contents than the limits established by the second draft of the
   Biological Treatment of Biowaste of the European Commission and
   microbial load values below the limit N FU 44-051 values; (iv) A(1) and
   A(2) had, respectively, 93 and 89.67\% as germination index Gl values,
   which confirmed the composts' maturity and safety; (v) for both
   composts, A(1) and A(2), culture potting made up of half compost and
   half soil revealed the highest bean leaves' number; and (vi) the less
   richness in minerals and organic compounds of A(2) compared to A(1) gave
   better germination results for white wheat and bean leaves' number for
   A(2). Even moistened with treated urban waste water, oil mill wastes
   proved to be very interesting for co-composting with green waste.},

Title = {Ecoenzymes as Indicators of Compost to Suppress Rhizoctonia Solani},
Journal = {COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {251-261},
Abstract = {Reports of disease suppression by compost are inconsistent likely
   because there are no established standards for feedstock material,
   maturity age for application, and application rate. The overall goal of
   the study was to evaluate a suite of biological indicators for their
   ability to predict disease suppression. Indicators included both
   commercial available methods for compost stability (Solvita (TM),
   respiration) and metrics of soil ecology not yet adopted by the compost
   industry (e.g., ecoenzymes, nematode community index). Damping-off by
   Rhizoctonia solani on radish was chosen as a model system given its
   global importance, competitiveness affected by carbon quality, and lack
   of disease management options for organic production. Biological
   indicators were evaluated for their ability to consistently
   differentiate among curing process, maturity, and feedstock material as
   a function of disease severity of a seedling bioassay and a compost
   extract assay to test competition with R. solani growth. Compost
   processed as vermicompost and anaerobic digestate were more suppressive
   against R. solani than windrow or aerated static pile. Mature composts
   were more suppressive than immature components. Feedstocks containing
   dairy manure and/or hardwood bark tended to have suppressive qualities.
   In contrast, poultry manure-based components were conducive to disease.
   Microbial ecoenzymes active on chitin and cellulose and nematode
   community indices were better predictors of disease suppressiveness than
   microbial respiration. These indicators are quicker than plant bioassays
   and could be adopted as tools to certify commercial products.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the influence of vermicompost
   (VC) as a soil conditioner in alleviating adverse effects of sodium in
   Na salt-effected soils. Therefore, the role of VC for reducing the
   adverse effects of Na salt on physicochemical properties of soil was
   investigated. Experiments were conducted with different doses of VC (0,
   2.5 and 5\% VC (w/w) and three different Na salt levels (0, 4 and 8 dS
   m(-1)NaCl). Vermicompost treatments under different salinity stress
   levels had significant positive effects on soil physicochemical
   properties. Vermicompost also decreased exchangeable Na of salt-affected
   soils. Vermicompost treatments under different Na salt regimes enhanced
   soil organic matter, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, available K
   and cation exchange capacity of the soils. VC treatments under the low
   and medium Na salt levels (0 and 4 dS m(-1)NaCl concentration,
   respectively) increased soil EC values. However, vermicompost treatments
   under high Na salt stress (8 dS m(-1)NaCl concentration) decreased EC
   values, thus soil salinity. Vermicompost treatments under different Na
   salt regimes increased field capacity, available water capacity,
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, total porosity, aggregate stability
   and decreased bulk density of the soils. Present findings revealed that
   vermicompost treatments, especially 5\% VC treatments were quite
   effecient in alleviating adverse effects of salinity and enhancing soil
   quality. It was concluded based on present findings that vermicompost
   treatments could be considered as an efficient amelioration material for
   reclamation of Na salt-effected soils.},

Abstract = {Organic wastes can be usefully recovered to produce organic amendments,
   for example, compost, to be used for crop production, thus reducing
   impacts through efficient waste management. The aim of this work was to
   study the effects of compost obtained from municipal waste in
   combination with poultry manure on plant growth, nitrate reductase (NR)
   activity and absorption and distribution of heavy metals (HM) in plant
   tissues of tomatoes, grown in pots in greenhouses. Two compost types
   obtained from municipal waste mixed with poultry manure (C1=3:2 and
   C2=2:3) were used at two different ages (105 d and 173 d) and at two mix
   rates with soil (32.5g pot(-1) and 65g pot(-1)); soil with no compost
   amendment was used as control. The experiment was conducted using tomato
   plants in pots and plant growth and nutrient plant uptake was determined
   after 65days from plant transplanting. Results obtained indicated that
   compost type and compost rate affected biomass production. However,
   compost age did not influence the development of plants. Nutrient status
   of tomato plants was also investigated with reference to the N cycle.
   Nitrite accumulation in the leaves increased with the increase in
   compost doses. The accumulation of NO2- was associated with a
   significant increase in NR activity. HM content in leaves decreased with
   compost use. HM accumulated preferentially in roots and leaves and the
   soil to root metals transfer was in this order: Fe (1.08-2.14)> Co
   (0.53-4.10)>Cu (0.28-2.28) >Mn (0.3-1.34) >Zn (0.87-1.21)>Cr
   (0.12-1.64). The highest and lowest dynamic bioaccumulation factors
   (BAF(dyn)) were observed in roots and stems, respectively. The root
   system acted as a barrier for Cd and Pb. It was concluded that compost
   use is beneficial for tomato plants, with particular reference to the
   compost obtained by using a higher amount of poultry manure (C2) in the
   mix.},

Abstract = {Effects of VC application on tomato production and media properties can
   last for the third successive season, which was verified in this study
   to evaluate effects of VC application on growth, productivity and fruit
   quality of cherry tomato for the third season. Six treatments were
   designed similarly in the first and second seasons (unchanged design
   compared to the previous season), including: VC with rice husk ash (RHS)
   and coconut fiber (CF) 0\% VC+ 50\% RHS + 50\% CF (T1- control),
   respectively. 20\% VC + 40\% RHS+ 40\% CF(T2), 40\% VC + 30\% RHS + 30\%
   CF(T3 ), 60\% VC + 20\% RHS+20\% CF(T4), 80\% VC +10\% RHS + 10\%
   CF(T5), and 100\% VC(T6). The results showed that the pH, EC, N, P, K,
   Ca, and Mg available in media were increased with the addition of VC.
   This finding revealed that the addition of VC significantly improved the
   physic-chemical media properties, increasing the EC and also increasing
   the macronutrients in the media resulting in substantial increased the
   yield and quality of tomato fruits. It is concluded that EC of VC was
   the key factor for the positive increase of the productivity and quality
   of tomato and the salinity (EC at 3.52 dS/m) causing restriction of
   water to fruits that resulted in the increase of the total soluble
   solids in tomato fruit and without affecting yield reduction.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate changes in P-fractions,
   bio-available P (CAL-P), citric acid extractable P, acid phosphatase
   activity and microbial biomass C and N during incubation of mature
   biogenic compost (MBC), immature biogenic compost (IBC) or immature
   sheep manure compost (ISC) not amended with P or amended with rock
   phosphate (RP, 7.6\% P) or triple-superphosphate (TSP, 19.5\% P).
   Incubation was performed at 20 degrees C in darkness under aerobic
   conditions. Samples were collected for laboratory analysis at the start
   of incubation (D-0) and after one, six and 26 days during incubation
   (D-1, D-6, D-26). Addition of soluble P fertilizer (TSP) led to a
   threefold increase in all P fractions in comparison to compost without
   TSP; even a ``priming effect{''} could be observed, promoting conversion
   of non-labile to labile P. Moreover, addition of TSP lowered biological
   activity, especially acid phosphatase activity (P-ase), due to already
   high concentrations of readily available P. In general, P fractions
   (bicarbonate extractable P-i (NaHCO3-P-i) and bicarbonate extractable
   P-o (NaHCO3-P-o) and sodium hydroxide extractable P-o (NaOH-P-o))
   increased during incubation until day 6 at the expense of NaOH-P-i
   fraction, which decreased. Generally, RP-derived P showed little or no
   effect on P fractions during the entire incubation period and only led
   to slightly increased CAL-P and Citric-acid-P levels. Fertilizer effects
   on labile P fractions were most enhanced with ISC. IBC enhanced
   microbial growth and P-ase, thereby enhancing conversion of labile into
   moderate labile NaOH-P-o.},

Title = {Impact of Ammonia During Composting on Calonectria pseudonaviculata and

Volume = {27},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Boxwood (Buxus spp.) blight is a devastating disease caused by the
   Ascomycete fungus Calonectria pseudonaviculata in the U.S. and Europe. A
   second Calonectria species, C. henricotiae, is also pathogenic on
   boxwood in Europe, but is not present in the U.S. where it is classified
   as a quarantine pathogen. Composting can eradicate various plant
   pathogens and high temperature is likely the most important factor
   influencing pathogen eradication. We previously reported that C.
   pseudonaviculata microsclerotia survived exposure to 40 degrees C in an
   incubator without compost, whereas exposure to the same temperature and
   time, but with compost added, greatly decreased survival. That is, the
   decrease in Calonectria growth and survival in compost was greater than
   could be accounted for by high temperature alone. We hypothesized that
   the enhanced decrease in Calonectria growth and survival might be due to
   ammonia, a fungitoxic gas produced during composting. In this laboratory
   study, we determined that ammonia within agar in Petri plates reduced
   radial growth of both C. pseudonaviculata and C. henricotiae. In studies
   with C. pseudonaviculata, gaseous ammonia reduced microsclerotia
   survival. Our findings suggest that composting dead or dying blighted
   boxwoods in the presence of ammonia could reduce dissemination of both
   Calonectria species from blighted to healthy boxwoods.},

Abstract = {The composting of food waste coupled with urban agriculture presents an
   opportunity to increase nutrient recycling in urban ecosystems. One
   potential constraint limiting the expansion of aerobic food waste
   composting is the availability of carbon-rich recalcitrant materials,
   such as wood chips. We measured the differences in nutrient retention
   throughout the compost life cycle for different mixtures of barley mash
   to wood chips, to assess whether composting using proportionally less
   wood chips would lead to higher nutrient recycling rates. Nine compost
   piles (1 m(3)) were constructed at varying ratios barley mash to wood
   chips, ranging from 10:90 to 90:10. During the composting process, the
   50:50 mixture maintained internal temperatures above 55 degrees C for 30
   days, with drop-offs as mixtures diverged in either direction. Food
   waste content was positively related to internal moisture and CO2, and
   negatively related to internal O-2, throughout the ensuing 3 months. The
   finished compost was used in raised-bed garden plots during the
   following summer. Yields of arugula and tomatoes increased with compost
   barley mash content, saturating at high levels. Across all treatments,
   <5\% of N and <2\% of P were recycled from barley mash into new
   vegetable production. Although the maximum amount of nutrients was
   recycled using high barley mash compost, these treatments also had lower
   nutrient recycling efficiency compared to intermediate mixtures. These
   results indicate that the use of wood chips in composting increases the
   efficiency nutrient retention from food waste and in turn enhances
   nutrient recycling in urban environments.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal is key to the persistence and spread of plant
   populations. Because the majority of plant species rely on animals to
   disperse their seeds, global change drivers that directly affect animals
   can cause cascading impacts on plant communities. In this review, we
   synthesize studies assessing how disperser loss alters plant
   populations, community patterns, multitrophic interactions, and
   ecosystem functioning. We argue that the magnitude of risk to plants
   from disperser loss is shaped by the combination of a plant species'
   inherent dependence on seed dispersal and the severity of the hazards
   faced by their dispersers. Because the factors determining a plant
   species' risk of decline due to disperser loss can be related to traits
   of the plants and dispersers, our framework enables a trait-based
   understanding of change in plant community composition and ecosystem
   functioning. We discuss how interactions among plants, among dispersers,
   and across other trophic levels also mediate plant community responses,
   and we identify areas for future research to understand and mitigate the
   consequences of disperser loss on plants globally.},

Abstract = {Studies of speciation typically investigate the evolution of
   reproductive isolation between populations, but several other processes
   can serve as key steps limiting the formation of species. In particular,
   the probability of successful speciation can be influenced by factors
   that affect the frequency with which population isolates form as well as
   their persistence through time. We suggest that population isolation and
   persistence have an inherently spatial dimension that can be profitably
   studied using a conceptual framework drawn from metapopulation ecology.
   We discuss models of speciation that incorporate demographic processes
   and highlight the need for a broader application of phylogenetic
   comparative approaches to evaluate the general importance of population
   isolation, persistence, and reproductive isolation in speciation. We
   review diverse and nontraditional data sources that can be leveraged to
   study isolation and persistence in a comparative framework. This
   incorporation of spatial demographic information facilitates the
   integration of perspectives on speciation across disciplines and
   timescales.},

   Hierarchy levels correspond to, but do not always exactly correlate
   with, geographic extent of invasion success. The ecological impacts of
   lower-level impacts can be negligible or result in temporary community
   accommodation. Invasion events at moderate to high levels of the
   hierarchy permanently alter ecological communities, regional faunas, and
   global ecosystems. The prevalence of invasive species results in
   evolutionary changes by fostering niche evolution, differential survival
   of ecologically generalized taxa, faunal homogenization, and suppressing
   speciation. These impacts can contribute to mass extinctions and
   biodiversity crises that alter the trajectory of ecological and
   evolutionary patterns of life. The fossil record provides a long-term
   record of how invasion impacts may scale up through time, which can
   augment ecological studies of modern species invasions.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that evolved behaviors play a determining role in
   facilitating and impeding the evolution of other traits has been
   discussed for more than 100 years with little consensus beyond an
   agreement that the ideas are theoretically plausible in accord with the
   Modern Synthesis. Many recent reviews of the genomic, epigenetic, and
   developmental mechanisms underpinning major behavioral transitions show
   how facultative expression of novel behaviors can lead to the evolution
   of obligate behaviors and structures that enhance behavioral function.
   Phylogenetic and genomic studies indicate that behavioral traits are
   generally evolutionarily more labile than other traits and that they
   help shape selective environments on the latter traits. Adaptive
   decision-making to encounter resources and avoid stress sources requires
   specific sensory inputs, which behaviorally shape selective environments
   by determining those features of the external world that are
   biologically relevant. These recent findings support the hypothesis of a
   dual role for behavior in evolution and are consistent with current
   evolutionary theory.},

Abstract = {Neotropical freshwater fishes (NFFs) constitute the most diverse
   continental vertebrate fauna on Earth, with more than 6,200 named
   species compressed into an aquatic footprint <0.5\% of the total
   regional land-surface area and representing the greatest phenotypic
   disparity and functional diversity of any continental ichthyofauna. Data
   from the fossil record and time-calibrated molecular phylogenies
   indicate thatmost higher taxa (e.g., genera, families) diversified
   relatively continuously through the Cenozoic, across broad geographic
   ranges of the South American platform. Biodiversity data for most NFF
   clades support a model of continental radiation rather than adaptive
   radiation, in which speciation occurs mainly in allopatry, and
   speciation and adaptation are largely decoupled. These radiations
   occurred under the perennial influence of river capture and sea-level
   oscillations, which episodically fragmented and merged portions of
   adjacent river networks. The future of the NFF fauna into the
   Anthropocene is uncertain, facing numerous threats at local, regional,
   and continental scales.},

Abstract = {We review the state of the art of alien plant research with emphasis on
   conceptual advances and knowledge gains on general patterns and drivers,
   biotic interactions, and evolution. Major advances include the
   identification of different invasion stages and invasiveness dimensions
   (geographic range, habitat specificity, local abundance) and the
   identification of appropriate comparators while accounting for propagule
   pressure and year of introduction. Developments in phylogenetic and
   functional trait research bear great promise for better understanding of
   the underlying mechanisms. Global patterns are emerging with propagule
   pressure, disturbance, increased resource availability, and climate
   matching as major invasion drivers, but species characteristics also
   play a role. Biotic interactions with resident communities shape
   invasion outcomes, with major roles for species diversity, enemies,
   novel weapons, and mutualists. Mounting evidence has been found for
   rapid evolution of invasive aliens and evolutionary responses of
   natives, but a mechanistic understanding requires tighter integration of
   molecular and phenotypic approaches. We hope the open questions
   identified in this review will stimulate further research on the ecology
   and evolution of alien plants.},

Abstract = {The extensive postglacial mammal losses in the West Indies provide an

   hindered our ability to test hypotheses. Here, we analyze the tempo and

   dates and human first-appearance dates, demonstrating widespread overlap
   between humans and now-extinct native mammals. Humans arrived in four
   waves (Lithic, Archaic, Ceramic, and European), each associated with
   increased environmental impact. Large-bodied mammals and several bats
   were extinct by the Archaic, following protracted extinction dynamics
   perhaps reflecting habitat loss. Most small-bodied rodents and
   lipotyphlan insectivores survived the Ceramic, but extensive landscape
   transformation and the introduction of invasive mammals following
   European colonization caused further extinctions, leaving a threatened
   remnant fauna. Both large- and small-bodied nonvolant mammals
   disappeared, reflecting complex relationships between body size,
   ecology, and anthropogenic change. Extinct bats were generally larger
   species, paralleling declines from natural catastrophes.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary biology is multivariate, and advances in phylogenetic
   comparative methods for multivariate phenotypes have surged to
   accommodate this fact. Evolutionary trends in multivariate phenotypes
   are derived from distances and directions between species in a
   multivariate phenotype space. For these patterns to be interpretable,
   phenotypes should be characterized by traits in commensurate units and
   scale. Visualizing such trends, as is achieved with phylomorphospaces,
   should continue to play a prominent role in macroevolutionary analyses.
   Evaluating phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models (e.g.,
   phylogenetic analysis of variance and regression) is valuable, but using
   parametric procedures is limited to only a few phenotypic variables. In
   contrast, nonparametric, permutation-based PGLS methods provide a
   flexible alternative and are thus preferred for high-dimensional
   multivariate phenotypes. Permutation-based methods for evaluating
   covariation within multivariate phenotypes are also well established and
   can test evolutionary trends in phenotypic integration. However,
   comparing evolutionary rates and modes in multivariate phenotypes
   remains an important area of future development.},

Abstract = {Past biological invasions have contributed to shaping our present day
   biodiversity. For many island ecosystems, they are the only source of
   terrestrial life. At the same time, biological invasions, in particular
   when caused by human activity, are a major concern for the conservation
   of native species. It is therefore essential to understand the drivers
   of biological invasions as well as the role invasions have played in
   different ecosystems. Molecular tools have provided valuable data to
   reconstruct biological invasions, their drivers, and their impacts.
   Recent technological developments have further increased the potential
   of molecular tools to track past shifts in biodiversity. Here, we
   provide a perspective on how such molecular tools have influenced our
   understanding of past biological invasions and discuss how they may
   further help to shape our understanding and management of biological
   invasions.},

Abstract = {We see stunning morphological diversity across the animal world. Less

   adaptations that determine animals' interactions with their environments
   and each other. We discuss the development of the fields of sensory and
   cognitive ecology and the importance of integrating these fields to
   understand the evolution of adaptive behaviors. Bats, with their
   extraordinarily high ecological diversity, are ideal animals for this
   purpose. An explosion in recent research allows for better understanding
   of the molecular, genetic, neural, and behavioral bases for sensory
   ecology and cognition in bats. We give examples of studies that
   illuminate connections between sensory and cognitive features of
   information filtering, evolutionary trade-offs in sensory and cognitive
   processing, and multimodal sensing and integration. By investigating the
   selective pressures underlying information acquisition, processing, and
   use in bats, we aim to illuminate patterns and processes driving sensory
   and cognitive evolution.},

Abstract = {Flowering plants exhibit two principal life-history strategies:
   annuality (living and reproducing in one year) and perenniality (living
   more than one year). The advantages of either strategy depend on the
   relative benefits of immediate reproduction balanced against
   survivorship and future reproduction. This trade-off means that
   life-history strategies are associated with particular environments,
   with annuals being found more often in unpredictable habitats. Annuality
   and perenniality are the outcome of developmental genetic programs
   responding to their environment, with perennials being distinguished by
   their delayed competence to flower and reversion to growth after
   flowering. Evolutionary transitions between these strategies are
   frequent and have consequences for mating systems and genome evolution,
   with perennials being more likely to outcross with higher inbreeding
   depression and lower rates of molecular evolution. Integrating
   expectations from life-history theory with knowledge of the
   developmental genetics of flowering and seasonality is required to
   understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution of annual and
   perennial life histories.},

Abstract = {The origin of turtles and their uniquely shelled body plan is one of the
   longest standing problems in vertebrate biology. The unfulfilled need
   for a hypothesis that both explains the derived nature of turtle anatomy
   and resolves their unclear phylogenetic position among reptiles largely
   reflects the absence of a transitional fossil record. Recent discoveries
   have dramatically improved this situation, providing an integrated,
   time-calibrated model of the morphological, developmental, and
   ecological transformations responsible for the modern turtle body plan.
   This evolutionary trajectory was initiated in the Permian (>260 million
   years ago) when a turtle ancestor with a diapsid skull evolved a novel
   mechanism for lung ventilation. This key innovation permitted the torso
   to become apomorphically stiff, most likely as an adaption for digging
   and a fossorial ecology. The construction of the modern turtle body plan
   then proceeded over the next 100 million years following a largely
   stepwise model of osteological innovation.},

Abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment
   experienced by a parent influences the development of their offspring.
   In this article, we develop a framework for understanding the mechanisms
   and multigenerational consequences of TGP. First, we conceptualize the
   mechanisms of TGP in the context of communication between parents
   (senders) and offspring (receivers) by dissecting the steps between an
   environmental cue received by a parent and its resulting effects on the
   phenotype of one or more future generations. Breaking down the problem
   in this way highlights the diversity of mechanisms likely to be involved
   in the process. Second, we review the literature on multigenerational
   effects and find that the documented patterns across generations are
   diverse. We categorize different multigenerational patterns and explore
   the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that can generate them.
   Throughout, we highlight opportunities for future work in this dynamic
   and integrative area of study.},

   discuss the prevalence of polyploidy across the tree of life, followed
   by an overview of studies investigating genome evolution and gene
   expression. We then provide an overview of methods in network biology,
   phylogenomics, and population genomics that are critical for advancing
   our understanding of evolution post-WGD, highlighting the need for
   models that can accommodate polyploids. Finally, we close with a brief
   note on the importance of random processes in the evolution of
   polyploids with respect to neutral versus selective forces, ancestral
   polymorphisms, and the formation of autopolyploids versus
   allopolyploids.},

Abstract = {Patterns of variation and evolution at a given site in a genome can be
   strongly influenced by the effects of selection at genetically linked
   sites. In particular, the recombination rates of genomic regions
   correlate with their amount of within-population genetic variability,
   the degree to which the frequency distributions of DNA sequence variants
   differ from their neutral expectations, and the levels of adaptation of
   their functional components. We review the major population genetic
   processes that are thought to lead to these patterns, focusing on their
   effects on patterns of variability: selective sweeps, background
   selection, associative overdominance, and Hill-Robertson interference
   among deleterious mutations. We emphasize the difficulties in
   distinguishing among the footprints of these processes and disentangling
   them from the effects of purely demographic factors such as population
   size changes. We also discuss how interactions between selective and
   demographic processes can significantly affect patterns of variability
   within genomes.},

Abstract = {Integrating knowledge and principles of animal behavior into wildlife
   conservation and management has led to some concrete successes but has
   failed to improve conservation outcomes in other cases. Many
   conservation interventions involve attempts to either attract or repel
   animals, which we refer to as approach/avoidance issues. These attempts
   can be reframed as issues of manipulating the decisions animals make,
   which are driven by their perceptual abilities and attentional biases,
   as well as the value animals attribute to current stimuli and past
   learned experiences. These processes all fall under the umbrella of
   animal cognition. Here, we highlight rules that emerge when considering
   approach/avoidance conservation issues through the lens of
   cognitive-based management. For each rule, we review relevant
   conservation successes and failures to better predict the conditions in
   which behavior can be manipulated, and we suggest how to avoid future
   failures.},

Abstract = {The emergence of a new phylogeny of ray-finned fishes at the turn of the
   twenty-first century marked a paradigm shift in understanding the
   evolutionary history of half of living vertebrates. We review how the
   new ray-finned fish phylogeny radically departs from classical
   expectations based on morphology. We focus on evolutionary relationships
   that span the backbone of ray-finned fish phylogeny, from the earliest
   divergences among teleosts and nonteleosts to the resolution of major
   lineages of Percomorpha. Throughout, we feature advances gained by the
   new phylogeny toward a broader understanding of ray-finned fish
   evolutionary history and the implications for topics that span from the
   genetics of human health to reconsidering the concept of living fossils.
   Additionally, we discuss conceptual challenges that involve reconciling
   taxonomic classification with phylogenetic relationships and propose an
   alternate higher-level classification for Percomorpha. Our review
   highlights remaining areas of phylogenetic uncertainty and opportunities
   for comparative investigations empowered by this new phylogenetic
   perspective on ray-finned fishes.},

Abstract = {Glaciers are retreating globally, and the resulting ice-free areas
   provide an experimental system for understanding species colonization
   patterns, community formation, and dynamics. The last several years have
   seen crucial advances in our understanding of biotic colonization after
   glacier retreats, resulting from the integration of methodological
   innovations and ecological theories. Recent empirical studies have
   demonstrated how multiple factors can speed up or slow down the velocity
   of colonization and have helped scientists develop theoretical models
   that describe spatiotemporal changes in community structure. There is a
   growing awareness of how different processes (e.g., time since glacier
   retreat, onset or interruption of surface processes, abiotic factors,
   dispersal, biotic interactions) interact to shape community formation
   and, ultimately, their functional structure through succession. Here, we
   examine how these studies address key theoretical questions about
   community dynamics and show how classical approaches are increasingly
   being combined with environmental DNA metabarcoding and functional trait
   analysis to document the formation of multitrophic communities,
   revolutionizing our understanding of the biotic processes that occur
   following glacier retreat.},

   and phosphorus, a remaining 20 or so elements are essential for life and
   have distinct geographical distributions, making them of keen interest
   to ecologists. Here, I provide a framework for understanding how
   shortfalls in micronutrients like iodine, copper, and zinc can regulate
   individual fitness, abundance, and ecosystem function. With a special
   focus on sodium, I show how simple experiments manipulating
   biogeochemistry can reveal why many of the variables that ecologists
   study vary so dramatically from place to place. I conclude with a
   discussion of how the Anthropocene's changing temperature,
   precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 levels are contributing to nutrient
   dilution (decreases in the nutrient quality at the base of food webs).},

Abstract = {Our understanding of ungulate migration is advancing rapidly due to
   innovations in modern animal tracking. Herein, we review and synthesize
   nearly seven decades of work on migration and other long-distance
   movements of wild ungulates. Although it has long been appreciated that
   ungulates migrate to enhance access to forage, recent contributions
   demonstrate that their movements are fine tuned to dynamic landscapes
   where forage, snow, and drought change seasonally. Researchers are
   beginning to understand how ungulates navigate migrations, with the
   emerging view that animals blend gradient tracking with spatial memory,
   some of which is socially learned. Although migration often promotes
   abundant populations-with broad effects on ecosystems-many migrations
   around the world have been lost or are currently threatened by habitat
   fragmentation, climate change, and barriers to movement. Fortunately,
   new efforts that use empirical tracking data to map migrations in detail
   are facilitating effective conservation measures to maintain ungulate
   migration.},

Abstract = {Dinosaurs were large-bodied land animals of the Mesozoic that gave rise
   to birds. They played a fundamental role in structuring
   Jurassic-Cretaceous ecosystems and had physiology, growth, and
   reproductive biology unlike those of extant animals. These features have
   has made them targets of theoretical macroecology. Dinosaurs achieved
   substantial structural diversity, and their fossil record documents the
   evolutionary assembly of the avian body plan. Phylogeny-based research
   has allowed new insights into dinosaur macroevolution, including the
   adaptive landscape of their body size evolution, patterns of species
   diversification, and the origins of birds and bird-like traits.
   Nevertheless, much remains unknown due to incompleteness of the fossil
   record at both local and global scales. This presents major challenges
   at the frontier of paleobiological research regarding tests of
   macroecological hypotheses and the effects of dinosaur biology, ecology,
   and life history on their macroevolution.},

Abstract = {The origin, distribution, and function of biological diversity are
   fundamental themes of ecology and evolutionary biology. Research on
   birds has played a major role in the history and development of these
   ideas, yet progress was for many decades limited by a focus on patterns
   of current diversity, often restricted to particular clades or regions.
   Deeper insight is now emerging from a recent wave of integrative studies
   combining comprehensive phylogenetic, environmental, and functional
   trait data at unprecedented scales. We review these empirical advances
   and describe how they are reshaping our understanding of global patterns
   of bird diversity and the processes by which it arises, with
   implications for avian biogeography and functional ecology. Further
   expansion and integration of data sets may help to resolve long-standing
   debates about the evolutionary origins of biodiversity and offer a
   framework for understanding and predicting the response of ecosystems to
   environmental change.},

Abstract = {To cope with the reduced availability of O-2 at high altitude,
   air-breathing vertebrates have evolved myriad adjustments in the
   cardiorespiratory system to match tissue O-2 delivery with metabolic O-2
   demand. We explain how changes at interacting steps of the O-2 transport
   pathway contribute to plastic and evolved changes in whole-animal
   aerobic performance under hypoxia. In vertebrates native to high
   altitude, enhancements of aerobic performance under hypoxia are
   attributable to a combination of environmentally induced and evolved
   changes in multiple steps of the pathway. Additionally, evidence
   suggests that many high-altitude natives have evolved mechanisms for
   attenuating maladaptive acclimatization responses to hypoxia, resulting
   in counter-gradient patterns of altitudinal variation for key
   physiological phenotypes. For traits that exhibit counteracting
   environmental and genetic effects, evolved changes in phenotype may be
   cryptic under field conditions and can only be revealed by rearing
   representatives of high- and low-altitude populations under standardized
   environmental conditions to control for plasticity.},

Abstract = {This review of metapopulation biology has a special focus on Professor
   Ilkka Hanski's (1953-2016) research. Hanski made seminal contributions
   to both empirical and theoretical metapopulation biology throughout his
   scientific career. Hanski's early research focused on ecological aspects
   of metapopulation biology, in particular how the spatial structure of a
   landscape influences extinction thresholds and how habitat loss and
   fragmentation can result in extinction debt. Hanski then used the
   Glanville fritillary system as a natural laboratory within which he
   studied genetic and evolutionary processes, such as the influence of
   inbreeding on extinction risk and variation in selection for dispersal
   traits generated by landscape variation. During the last years of his
   career, Hanski's work was in the forefront of the rapidly developing
   field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Hanski was a pioneer in showing how
   molecular-level underpinnings of trait variation can explain why
   evolutionary change can occur rapidly in natural populations and how
   these changes can subsequently influence ecological dynamics.},

Abstract = {Ever since the first plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) were isolated
   and identified, questions about their ecological functions and diversity
   have been raised. Recent advances in analytical chemistry and complex
   data computation, as well as progress in chemical ecology from
   mechanistic to functional and evolutionary questions, open a new box of
   hypotheses. Addressing these hypotheses includes the measurement of
   complex traits, such as chemodiversity, in a context-dependent manner
   and allows for a deeper understanding of the multifunctionality and
   functional redundancy of PSMs. Here we review a hypothesis framework
   that addresses PSM diversity on multiple ecological levels (alpha, beta,
   and gamma chemodiversity), its variation in space and time, and the
   potential agents of natural selection. We use the concept of chemical
   information transfer as mediator of antagonistic and mutualistic
   interaction to interpret functional and microevolutionary studies and
   create a hypothesis framework for understanding chemodiversity as a
   factor driving ecological processes.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary conflict occurs when two parties can each affect a joint
   phenotype, but they gain from pushing it in opposite directions.
   Conflicts occur across many biological levels and domains but share many
   features. They are a major source of biological maladaptation. They
   affect biological diversity, often increasing it, at almost every level.
   Because opponents create selection that can be strong, persistent, and
   malevolent, conflict often leads to accelerated evolution and arms
   races. Conflicts might even drive the majority of adaptation, with
   pathogens leading the way as selective forces. The evolution of
   conflicts is complex, with outcomes determined partly by the relative
   evolvability of each party and partly by the kinds of power that each
   evolves. Power is a central issue in biology. In addition to physical
   strength and weapons, it includes strength from numbers and complexity;
   abilities to bind and block; advantageous timing; and abilities to
   acquire, use, and distort information.},

Abstract = {Interactions connect the units of ecological systems, forming networks.
   Individual-based networks characterize variation in niches among
   individuals within populations. These individual-based networks merge
   with each other, forming species-based networks and food webs that
   describe the architecture of ecological communities. Networks at broader
   spatiotemporal scales portray the structure of ecological interactions
   across landscapes and over macroevolutionary time. Here, I review the
   patterns observed in ecological networks across multiple levels of
   biological organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand the
   amount of interdependence as we move from individual-based networks to
   species-based networks and beyond. Despite the uneven distribution of
   studies, regularities in network structure emerge across scales due to
   the fundamental architectural patterns shared by complex networks and
   the interplay between traits and numerical effects. I illustrate the
   integration of these organizational scales by exploring the consequences
   of the emergence of highly connected species for network structures
   across scales.},

Abstract = {Animals are distinguished by having guts-organs that must extract
   nutrients from food yet also bar invasion by pathogens. Most guts are
   colonized by nonpathogenic microorganisms, but the functions of these
   microbes, or even the reasons why they occur in the gut, vary widely
   among animals. Sometimes these microorganisms have codiversified with
   hosts; sometimes they live mostly elsewhere in the environment. Either
   way, gut microorganisms often benefit hosts. Benefits may reflect
   evolutionary addiction, whereby hosts incorporate gut microorganisms
   into normal developmental processes. But benefits often include novel
   ecological capabilities; for example, many metazoan clades exist by
   virtue of gut communities enabling new dietary niches. Animals vary
   immensely in their dependence on gut microorganisms, from lacking them
   entirely to using them as food or to obligate dependence for
   development, nutrition, or protection. Many consequences of gut
   microorganisms for hosts can be ascribed to microbial community
   processes and the host's ability to shape these processes.},

Abstract = {Guppies in Trinidad range across aquatic environments with fish
   communities that vary in risk of predation. These communities are often
   discrete, separated by waterfalls, with high-predation communities
   downstream and low-predation communities upstream. This gradient is
   repeated in many rivers; in each one, we see the same divergence between
   guppy populations in life history, behavior, morphology, and physiology.
   We have shown that the agent of selection on the life history, behavior,
   and physiology in low-predation communities is high population density
   and the cascade of ecological effects that stems from it. In effect,
   guppy populations modify their ecosystem and, in so doing, impose
   selection on themselves and shape their own evolution, which further
   changes the ecosystem. Evolution unfolds rapidly in this system, which
   has enabled us to study the dynamics of the process, not just its end
   points. Those studies enable us to answer some very general questions in
   ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection has the potential to decrease mean fitness in a
   population through an array of costs to nonsexual fitness. These costs
   may be offset when sexual selection favors individuals with high
   nonsexual fitness, causing the alignment of sexual and natural
   selection. We review the many laboratory experiments that have
   manipulated mating systems aimed at quantifying the net effects of
   sexual selection on mean fitness. These must be interpreted in light of
   population history and the diversity of ways manipulations have altered
   sexual interactions, sexual conflict, and sexual and natural selection.
   Theory and data suggest a net benefit is more likely when sexually
   concordant genetic variation is enhanced and that ecological context can
   mediate the relative importance of these different effects. Comparative
   studies have independently examined the consequences of sexual selection
   for population/species persistence. These provide little indication of a
   benefit, and interpreting these higher-level responses is challenging.},

Abstract = {Half a million species of herbivorous insects have been described. Most
   of them are diet specialists, using only a few plant species as hosts.
   Biologists suspect that their specificity is key to their diversity. But
   why do herbivorous insects tend to be diet specialists? In this review,
   we catalog a broad range of explanations. We review the evidence for
   each and suggest lines of research to obtain the evidence we lack. We
   then draw attention to a second major question, namely how changes in
   diet breadth affect the rest of a species' biology. In particular, we
   know little about how changes in diet breadth feed back on genetic
   architecture, the population genetic environment, and other aspects of a
   species' ecology. Knowing more about how generalists and specialists
   differ should go a long way toward sorting out potential explanations of
   specificity, and yield a deeper understanding of herbivorous insect
   diversity.},

Abstract = {Climate change is affecting every ecosystem on Earth. Though climate
   change is global in scope, literature reviews on the biotic impacts of
   climate change have focused on temperate and polar regions. Tropical
   species have distinct life histories and physiologies, and ecological
   communities are assembled differently across latitude. Thus, tropical
   species and communities may exhibit different responses to climate
   change compared with those in temperate and polar regions. What are the
   fingerprints of climate change in the tropics? This review summarizes
   the current state of knowledge on impacts of climate change in tropical
   regions and discusses research priorities to better understand the ways
   in which species and ecological communities are responding to climate
   change in the most biodiverse places on Earth.},

Abstract = {Throughout Earth's history, drought has been a common crisis in
   terrestrial ecosystems; in human societies, it can cause famine, one of
   the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse. As the global hydrological cycle
   intensifies with global warming, deeper droughts and rewetting will
   alter, and possibly transform, ecosystems. Soil communities, however,
   seem more tolerant than plants or animals are to water stress-the main
   effects, in fact, on soil processes appear to be limited diffusion and
   the limited supply of resources to soil organisms. Thus, the rains that
   end a drought not only release soil microbes from stress but also create
   a resource pulse that fuels soil microbial activity. It remains unclear
   whether the effects of drought on soil processes result from drying or
   rewetting. It is also unclear whether the flush of activity on rewetting
   is driven by microbial growth or by the physical/chemical processes that
   mobilize organic matter. In this review, I discuss how soil water, and
   the lack of it, regulates microbial life and biogeochemical processes. I
   first focus on organismal-level responses and then consider how these
   influence whole-soil organic matter dynamics. A final focus is on how to
   incorporate these effects into Earth System models that can effectively
   capture dry-wet cycling.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary rates play a central role in connecting micro- and
   macroevolution. All evolutionary rate estimates, including rates of
   molecular evolution, trait evolution, and lineage diversification, share
   a similar scaling pattern with time: The highest rates are those
   measured over the shortest time interval. This creates a disconnect
   between micro- and macroevolution, although the pattern is the opposite
   of what some might expect: Patterns of change over short timescales
   predict that evolution has tremendous potential to create variation and
   that potential is barely tapped by macroevolution. In this review, we
   discuss this shared scaling pattern across evolutionary rates. We break
   down possible explanations for scaling into two categories, estimation
   error and model misspecification, and discuss how both apply to each
   type of rate. We also discuss the consequences of this ubiquitous
   pattern, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing rates over
   different timescales. Finally, after addressing purely statistical
   concerns, we explore a few possibilities for a shared unifying
   explanation across the three types of rates that results from a failure
   to fully understand and account for how biological processes scale over
   time.},

Abstract = {Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and
   slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are
   emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components.
   Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating,
   cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include
   food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production,
   pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement,
   mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration,
   landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to
   biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate
   and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health
   and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water
   conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known
   about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity.
   Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting
   of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon
   sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating
   biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize,
   notwithstanding regional character.},

Abstract = {Although research performed in cities will not uncover new evolutionary
   mechanisms, it could provide unprecedented opportunities to examine the
   interplay of evolutionary forces in new ways and new avenues to address
   classic questions. However, while the variation within and among cities
   affords many opportunities to advance evolutionary biology research,
   careful alignment between how cities are used and the research questions
   being asked is necessary to maximize the insights that can be gained. In
   this review, we develop a framework to help guide alignment between
   urban evolution research approaches and questions. Using this framework,
   we highlight what has been accomplished to date in the field of urban
   evolution and identify several up-and-coming research directions for
   further expansion. We conclude that urban environments can be used as
   evolutionary test beds to tackle both new and long-standing questions in
   evolutionary biology.},

Abstract = {The spread of synthetic gene drives is often discussed in the context of
   pan-mictic populations connected by gene flow and described with simple
   deterministic models. Under such assumptions, an entire species could be
   altered by releasing a single individual carrying an invasive gene
   drive, such as a standard homing drive. While this remains a theoretical
   possibility, gene drive spread in natural populations is more complex
   and merits a more realistic assessment. The fate of any gene drive
   released in a population would be inextricably linked to the
   population's ecology. Given the uncertainty often involved in ecological
   assessment of natural populations, understanding the sensitivity of gene
   drive spread to important ecological factors is critical. Here we review
   how different forms of density dependence, spatial heterogeneity, and
   mating behaviors can impact the spread of self-sustaining gene drives.
   We highlight specific aspects of gene drive dynamics and the target
   populations that need further research.},

Abstract = {Food webs are a major focus and organizing theme of ecology, but the
   data used to assemble them are deficient. Early debates over food-web
   data focused on taxonomic resolution and completeness, lack of which had
   produced spurious inferences. Recent data are widely believed to be much
   better and are used extensively in theoretical and meta-analytic
   research on network ecology. Confidence in these data rests on the
   assumptions (a) that empiricists correctly identified consumers and
   their foods and (b) that sampling methods were adequate to detect a
   near-comprehensive fraction of the trophic interactions between species.
   Abundant evidence indicates that these assumptions are often invalid,
   suggesting that most topological food-web data may remain unreliable for
   inferences about network structure and underlying ecological and
   evolutionary processes. Morphologically cryptic species are ubiquitous
   across taxa and regions, and many trophic interactions routinely evade
   detection by conventional methods. Molecular methods have diagnosed the
   severity of these problems and are a necessary part of the cure.},

Abstract = {The concept of evolvability emerged in the early 1990s and soon became
   fashionable as a label for different streams of research in evolutionary
   biology. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, evolvability is defined
   as the ability of a population to respond to directional selection. This
   differs from other fields by treating evolvability as a property of
   populations rather than organisms or lineages and in being focused on
   quantification and short-term prediction rather than on macroevolution.
   While the term evolvability is new to quantitative genetics, many of the
   associated ideas and research questions have been with the field from
   its inception as biometry. Recent research on evolvability is more than
   a relabeling of old questions, however. New operational measures of
   evolvability have opened possibilities for understanding adaptation to
   rapid environmental change, assessing genetic constraints, and linking
   micro- and macroevolution.},

Abstract = {Communication occurs when a sender emits a cue perceived by a receiver
   that changes the receiver's behavior. Plants perceive information
   regarding light, water, other nutrients, touch, herbivores, pathogens,
   mycorrhizae, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants also emit cues
   perceived by other plants, beneficial microbes, herbivores, enemies of
   herbivores, pollinators, and seed dispersers. Individuals responding to
   light cues experienced increased fitness. Evidence for benefits of
   responding to cues involving herbivores and pathogens is more limited.
   The benefits of emitting cues are also less clear, particularly for
   plant-plant communication. Reliance onmultiple or dosage-dependent cues
   can reduce inappropriate responses, and plants often remember past cues.
   Plants have multiple needs and prioritize conflicting cues such that the
   risk of abiotic stress is treated as greater than that of shading, which
   is in turn treated as greater than that of consumption. Plants can
   distinguish self from nonself and kin from strangers. They can identify
   the species of competitor or consumer and respond appropriately. Cues
   involving mutualists often contain highly specific information.},

Abstract = {Environmental disasters offer the unique opportunity for landscape-scale
   ecological and evolutionary studies that are not possible in the
   laboratory or small experimental plots. The nuclear accident at
   Chernobyl (1986) allows for rigorous analyses of radiation effects on
   individuals and populations at an ecosystem scale. Here, the current
   state of knowledge related to populations within the Chernobyl region of
   Ukraine and Belarus following the largest civil nuclear accident in
   history is reviewed. There is now a significant literature that provides
   contrasting and occasionally conflicting views of the state of animals
   and how they are affected by this mutagenic stressor. Studies of genetic
   and physiological effects have largely suggested significant injuries to
   individuals inhabiting the more radioactive areas of the Chernobyl
   region. Most population censuses for most species suggest that
   abundances are reduced in the more radioactive areas.},

   of birds on plant evolution. Experiments show the process in
   action-birds select among floral phenotypes in a population-and
   comparative studies find the resulting pattern-bird-pollinated species
   have long-tubed, red flowers with large nectar volumes. Speciation is
   accomplished in one ``magical{''} step when adaptation for bird
   pollination brings about divergent morphology and reproductive
   isolation. In contrast, evidence that plants drive bird evolution is
   fragmentary. Studies of selection on population-level variation are
   lacking, but the resulting pattern is clear-nectarivorous birds have
   evolved a remarkable number of times and often have long bills and
   brush-tipped or tubular tongues. At the level of the ecological guild,
   birds select among plant species via an effect on seed set and thus
   determine plant community composition. Plants simultaneously influence
   the relative fitness of bird species and thus determine the composition
   of the bird guild. Interaction partners may give one guild member a
   constant fitness advantage, resulting in competitive exclusion and
   community change, or may act as limiting resources that depress the
   fitness of frequent species, thus stabilizing community composition and
   allowing the coexistence of diversity within bird and plant guilds.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary biologists often predict the outcome of natural selection
   on an allele by measuring its effects on lifetime survival and
   reproduction of individual carriers. However, alleles affecting traits
   like sex, evolvability, and cooperation can cause fitness effects that
   depend heavily on differences in the environmental, social, and genetic
   context of individuals carrying the allele. This variability makes it
   difficult to summarize the evolutionary fate of an allele solely on the
   basis of its effects on any one individual. Attempts to average over
   this variability can sometimes salvage the concept of fitness. In other
   cases, evolutionary outcomes can be predicted only by considering the
   entire genealogy of an allele, thus limiting the utility of individual
   fitness altogether. We describe a number of intriguing new evolutionary
   phenomena that have emerged in studies that explicitly model long-term
   lineage dynamics and discuss implications for the evolution of
   infectious diseases.},

Abstract = {Understanding what regulates population sizes of organisms with complex
   life cycles is challenging because limits on population sizes can occur
   at any stage or transition. We extend a conceptual framework to explore
   whether numbers of successfully laid eggs determine densities of later
   stages in insects, fish, amphibians, and snails inhabiting marine,
   freshwater, or terrestrial habitats. Our review suggests novel
   hypotheses, which propose characteristics of species or environments
   that create spatial variation in egg densities and predict when such
   patterns are maintained throughout subsequent life-cycle stages.
   Existing data, although limited, suggest that persistent, strong
   associations between egg and subsequent juvenile densities are likely
   for species where suitable egg-laying habitat is in short supply. Those
   associations are weakened in some environments and for some species by
   density-dependent losses of eggs or hatchlings. Such cross-ecosystem
   comparisons are fundamental to generality in ecology but demand
   place-based understandings of species' biology and natural history.},

Abstract = {Allelopathy (i.e., chemical interaction among species) was originally
   conceived as inclusive of positive and negative effects of plants on
   other plants, and we adopt this view. Most studies of allelopathy have
   been phenomenological, but we focus on studies that have explored the
   ecological significance of this interaction. The literature suggests
   that studies of allelopathy have been particularly important for three
   foci in ecology: species distribution, conditionality of interactions,
   and maintenance of species diversity. There is evidence that allelopathy
   influences local distributions of plant species around the world.
   Allelopathic conditionality appears to arise through coevolution, and
   this is a mechanism for plant invasions. Finally, allelopathy promotes
   species coexistence via intransitive competition, modifications of
   direct interactions, and (co)evolution. Recent advances additionally
   suggest that coexistence might be favored through biochemical
   recognition. The preponderance of phenomenological studies
   notwithstanding, allelopathy has broad ecological consequences.},

Abstract = {Recent theory and empirical evidence have provided new insights
   regarding how evolutionary forces interact to shape adaptation at stable
   and transient range margins. Predictions regarding trait divergence at
   leading edges are frequently supported. However, declines in fitness at
   and beyond edges show that trait divergence has sometimes been
   insufficient to maintain high fitness, so identifying constraints to
   adaptation at range edges remains a key challenge. Indirect evidence
   suggests that range expansion may be limited by adaptive genetic
   variation, but direct estimates of genetic constraints at and beyond
   range edges are still scarce. Sequence data suggest increased genetic
   load in edge populations in several systems, but its causes and fitness
   consequences are usually poorly understood. The balance between
   maladaptive and positive effects of gene flow on fitness at range edges
   deserves further study. It is becoming increasingly clear that
   characterizations about degree of adaptation based solely on
   geographical peripherality are unsupported.},

   much of the history of the series' subject areas, revealing both lasting
   themes and great changes in emphasis, theory, evidence, and
   understanding. Much of the progress has resulted from conceptual
   innovation and from momentous advances in computation, data analysis,
   and molecular methodology, some of which have been reviewed in these
   volumes. Some of the most significant changes entail intercourse between
   formerly separate realms of study. If the remarkably long citation life
   of many reviews is any indication, contributions to this series have
   helped to shape research questions and conceptual development in
   ecology, evolution, and systematics and their applications to social
   concerns that range from antibiotic resistance to the ecological

Abstract = {Evolutionary rates and strength of selection differ markedly between
   haploid and diploid genomes. Any genes expressed in a haploid state will
   be directly exposed to selection, whereas alleles in a diploid state may
   be partially or fully masked by a homologous allele. This difference may
   shape key evolutionary processes, including rates of adaptation and
   inbreeding depression, but also the evolution of sex chromosomes,
   heterochiasmy, and stable sex ratio biases. All diploid organisms carry
   haploid genomes, most notably the haploid genomes in gametes produced by
   every sexually reproducing eukaryote. Furthermore, haploid expression
   occurs in genes with monoallelic expression, in sex chromosomes, and in
   organelles, such as mitochondria and plastids. A comparison of
   evolutionary rates among these haploid genomes reveals striking
   parallels. Evidence suggests that haploid selection has the potential to
   shape evolution in predominantly diploid organisms, and taking advantage
   of the rapidly developing technologies, we are now in the position to
   quantify the importance of such selection on haploid genomes.},

Abstract = {In this review, we highlight the main insights that have been gathered
   from recent developments using large-scale genomics of fungal
   saprotrophs and symbiotrophs (including ectomycorrhizal and orchid and
   ericoid mycorrhizal fungi) inhabiting forest ecosystems. After assessing
   the goals and motivations underlying our approach, we explore our
   current understanding of the limits and future potential of using
   genomics to understand the ecological roles of these forest fungi.
   Comparative genomics unraveled the molecular machineries involved in
   lignocellulose decomposition in wood decayers, soil and litter
   saprotrophs, and mycorrhizal symbionts. They also showed that
   transitions from saprotrophy to mutualism entailed widespread losses of
   lignocellulose-degrading enzymes; diversification of novel,
   lineage-specific symbiosis-induced genes; and convergent evolution of
   genetic innovations that facilitate the accommodation of mutualistic
   symbionts within their plant hosts. We also identify the major questions
   that remain unanswered and propose new avenues of genome-based research
   to understand the role of soil fungi in sustainable forest ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We examine the evidence linking species' traits to contemporary range
   shifts and find they are poor predictors of range shifts that have
   occurred over decades to a century. We then discuss reasons for the poor
   performance of traits for describing interspecific variation in range
   shifts from two perspectives: (a) factors associated with species'
   traits that degrade range-shift signals stemming from the measures used
   for species' traits, traits that are typically not analyzed, and the
   influence of phylogeny on range-shift potential and (b) issues in
   quantifying range shifts and relating them to species' traits due to
   imperfect detection of species, differences in the responses of
   altitudinal and latitudinal ranges, and emphasis on testing linear
   relationships between traits and range shifts instead of nonlinear
   responses. Improving trait-based approaches requires a recognition that
   traits within individuals interact in unexpected ways and that different
   combinations of traits may be functionally equivalent.},

Abstract = {Evolution has been viewed as occurring primarily through selection among
   individuals. We present a framework based on multilevel selection for
   evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with
   supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role
   that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community
   organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in
   creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and
   those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple
   levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with
   mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the
   Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary
   processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has
   the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.},

Abstract = {Rapid adaptive radiation poses two distinct questions apart from
   speciation and adaptation: What happens after one speciation event and
   how do some lineages continue speciating through a rapid burst? We
   review major features of rapid radiations and their mismatch with
   theoretical models and speciation mechanisms. The paradox is that the
   hallmark rapid burst pattern of adaptive radiation is contradicted by
   most speciation models, which predict continuously decelerating
   diversification and niche subdivision. Furthermore, it is unclear if and
   how speciation-promoting mechanisms such as magic traits, phenotype
   matching, and physical linkage of coadapted alleles promote rapid bursts
   of speciation. We review additional mechanisms beyond ecological
   opportunity to explain rapid radiations: (a) ancient adaptive alleles
   and the transporter hypothesis, (b) sexual signal complexity, (c)
   fitness landscape connectivity, (d) diversity begets diversity, and (e)
   plasticity first. We propose new questions and predictions connecting
   microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary patterns through the
   study of rapid radiations.},

Abstract = {Understanding how pollen moves between species is critical to
   understanding speciation, diversification, and evolution of flowering
   plants. For coflowering species that share pollinators, competition
   through interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) can profoundly impact floral
   evolution, decreasing female fitness via heterospecific pollen
   deposition on stigmas and male fitness via pollen misplacement during
   visits to heterospecific flowers. The pollination literature
   demonstrates that such reproductive interference frequently selects for
   reproductive character displacement in floral traits linked to
   pollinator attraction, pollen placement, and mating systems and has also
   revealed that IPT between given pairs of species is typically
   asymmetric. More recent work is starting to elucidate its importance to
   the speciation process, clarifying the link between IPT and current and
   historical patterns of hybridization, the evolution of phenotypic
   novelty through adaptive introgression, and the rise of reproductive
   isolation. Our review aims to stimulate further research on IPT as a
   ubiquitous mechanism that plays a central role in angiosperm
   diversification.},

Abstract = {The twenty-first century has witnessed an explosion in research on
   animal migration, in large part due to a technological revolution in
   tracking and remote-sensing technologies, along with advances in
   genomics and integrative biology. We now have access to unprecedented
   amounts of data on when, where, and how animals migrate across various
   continents and oceans. Among the important advancements, recent studies
   have uncovered a surprising level of variation in migratory trajectories
   at the species and population levels with implications for both
   speciation and the conservation of migratory populations. At the
   organismal level, studies linking molecular and physiological mechanisms
   to traits that support migration have revealed a remarkable amount of
   seasonal flexibility in many migratory animals. Advancements in the
   theory for why animals migrate have resulted in promising new directions
   for empirical studies. We provide an overview of the current state of
   knowledge and promising future avenues of study.},

Abstract = {Pathogens and insect pests are important drivers of tree mortality and
   forest dynamics, but global change has rapidly altered or intensified
   their impacts. Predictive understanding of changing disease and outbreak
   occurrence has been limited by two factors: (a) tree mortality and
   morbidity are emergent phenomena determined by interactions between
   plant hosts, biotic agents (insects or pathogens), and the environment;
   and (b) disparate global change drivers co-occur, obscuring net impacts
   on each of these components. To expand our understanding of changing
   forest diseases, declines, and outbreaks, we adopt a framework that
   identifies and organizes observed impacts of diverse global change
   drivers on the primary mechanisms underlying agent virulence and host
   susceptibility. We then discuss insights from ecological theory that may
   advance prediction of forest epidemics and outbreaks. This approach
   highlights key drivers of changing pest and pathogen dynamics, whichmay
   inform forest management aimed atmitigating accelerating rates of tree
   mortality globally.},

Abstract = {When a phenological shift affects a demographic vital rate such as
   survival or reproduction, the altered vital rate may or may not have
   population-level consequences. We review the evidence that climate
   change affects populations by shifting species' phenologies, emphasizing
   the importance of demographic life-history theory. We find many examples
   of phenological shifts having both positive and negative consequences
   for vital rates. Yet, few studies link phenological shifts to changes in
   vital rates known to drive population dynamics, especially in plants.
   When this link ismade, results are largely consistent with life-history
   theory: Phenological shifts have populationlevel consequences when they
   affect survival in longer-lived organisms and reproduction in
   shorter-lived organisms. However, there are just as many cases in which
   demographic mechanisms buffer population growth from phenologically
   induced changes in vital rates. We provide recommendations for future
   research aiming to understand the complex relationships among climate,
   phenology, and demography, which will help to elucidate the extent to
   which phenological shifts actually alter population persistence.},

Abstract = {Linking interspecific interactions (e.g., mutualism, competition,
   predation, parasitism) to macroevolution (evolutionary change on deep
   timescales) is a key goal in biology. The role of species interactions
   in shaping macroevolutionary trajectories has been studied for centuries
   and remains a cutting-edge topic of current research. However, despite
   its deep historical roots, classic and current approaches to this topic
   are highly diverse. Here, we combine historical and contemporary
   perspectives on the study of ecological interactions in macroevolution,
   synthesizing ideas across eras to build a zoomed-out picture of the big
   questions at the nexus of ecology and macroevolution. We discuss the
   trajectory of this important and challenging field, dividing research
   into work done before the 1970s, research between 1970 and 2005, and
   work done since 2005. We argue that in response to long-standing
   questions in paleobiology, evidence accumulated to date has demonstrated
   that biotic interactions (including mutualism) can influence lineage
   diversification and trait evolution over macroevolutionary timescales,
   and we outline major open questions for future research in the field.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {119-143},
Abstract = {Unraveling the origins of Malesia's once vast, hyperdiverse rainforests
   is a perennial challenge. Major contributions to rainforest assembly
   came from floristic elements carried on the Indian Plate and montane
   elements from the Australian Plate (Sahul). The Sahul component is now
   understood to include substantial two-way exchanges with Sunda inclusive
   of lowland taxa. Evidence for the relative contributions of the great
   Asiatic floristic interchanges (GAFIs) with India and Sahul,
   respectively, to the flora of Malesia comes from contemporary lineage
   distributions, the fossil record, time-calibrated phylogenies,
   functional traits, and the spatial structure of genetic diversity.
   Functional trait and biome conservatism are noted features of montane
   austral lineages from Sahul (e.g., diverse Podocarpaceae), whereas the
   abundance and diversity of lowland lineages, including Syzygium
   (Myrtaceae) and the Asian dipterocarps (Dipterocarpoideae), reflect a
   less well understood combination of dispersal, ecology, and adaptive
   radiations. Thus, Malesian rainforest assembly has been shaped by
   sharply contrasting evolutionary origins and biogeographic histories.},

Abstract = {The rate of evolution of population mean fitness informs how selection
   acting in contemporary populations can counteract environmental change
   and genetic degradation (mutation, gene flow, drift, recombination).
   This rate influences population increases (e.g., range expansion),
   population stability (e.g., cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics), and
   population recovery (i.e., evolutionary rescue). We review approaches
   for estimating such rates, especially in wild populations. We then
   review empirical estimates derived from two approaches: mutation
   accumulation (MA) and additive genetic variance in fitness (I-Aw). MA
   studies inform how selection counters genetic degradation arising from
   deleterious mutations, typically generating estimates of <1\% per
   generation. IAw studies provide an integrated prediction of proportional
   change per generation, nearly always generating estimates of <20\% and,
   more typically, <10\%. Overall, considerable, but not unlimited,
   evolutionary potential exists in populations facing detrimental
   environmental or genetic change. However, further studies with diverse
   methods and species are required for more robust and general insights.},

Abstract = {Interactions between plants and microbes have important influences on
   evolutionary processes, population dynamics, community structure, and
   ecosystem function. We review the literature to document how climate
   change may disrupt these ecological interactions and develop a
   conceptual framework to integrate the pathways of plant-microbe
   responses to climate over different scales in space and time. We then
   create a blueprint to aid generalization that categorizes climate
   effects into changes in the context dependency of plant-microbe pairs,
   temporal mismatches and altered feedbacks over time, or spatial
   mismatches that accompany species range shifts. We pair a new graphical
   model of how plant-microbe interactions influence resistance to climate
   change with a statistical approach to predict the consequences of
   increasing variability in climate. Finally, we suggest pathways through
   which plant-microbe interactions can affect resilience during recovery
   from climate disruption. Throughout, we take a forward-looking
   perspective, highlighting knowledge gaps and directions for future
   research.},

Abstract = {All species within ecosystems contribute to regulating carbon cycling
   because of their functional integration into food webs. Yet carbon
   modeling and accounting still assumes that only plants, microbes, and
   invertebrate decomposer species are relevant to the carbon cycle. Our
   multifaceted review develops a case for considering a wider range of
   species, especially herbivorous and carnivorous wild animals. Animal
   control over carbon cycling is shaped by the animals' stoichiometric
   needs and functional traits in relation to the stoichiometry and
   functional traits of their resources. Quantitative synthesis reveals
   that failing to consider these mechanisms can lead to serious
   inaccuracies in the carbon budget. Newer carbon-cycle models that
   consider food-web structure based on organismal functional traits and
   stoichiometry can offer mechanistically informed predictions about the
   magnitudes of animal effects that will help guide new empirical research
   aimed at developing a coherent understanding of the interactions and
   importance of all species within food webs.},

Abstract = {The rate of non-native species introductions continues to increase, with
   directionality from continents to islands. It is no longer single
   species but entire networks of coevolved and newly interacting
   continental species that are establishing on islands. The consequences
   of multispecies introductions on the population dynamics and
   interactions of native and introduced species will depend on the form of
   trophic limitation on island ecosystems. Freed from biotic constraints
   in their native range, species introduced to islands no longer
   experience top-down limitation, instead becoming limited by and
   disrupting bottom-up processes that dominate on resource-limited
   islands. This framing of the ecological and evolutionary relationships
   among introduced species with one another and their ecosystem has
   important consequences for conservation. Whereas on continents the focus
   of conservation is on restoring native apex species and top-down
   limitation, on islands the focus must instead be on removing introduced
   animal and plant species to restore bottom-up limitation.},

Abstract = {Somatic mutations are common in plants, and they may accumulate and be
   passed on to gametes. The determinants of somatic mutation accumulation
   include the intraorganismal selective effect of mutations, the number of
   cell divisions that separate the zygote from the formation of gametes,
   and shoot apical meristem structure and branching. Somatic mutations can
   promote the evolution of diploidy, polyploidy, sexual recombination,
   outcrossing, clonality, and separate sexes, and they may contribute
   genetic variability in many other traits. The amplification of
   beneficial mutations via intraorganismal selection may relax selection
   to reduce the genomic mutation rate or to protect the germline in
   plants. The total rate of somatic mutation, the distribution of
   selective effects and fates in the plant body, and the degree to which
   the germline is sheltered from somatic mutations are still poorly
   understood. Our knowledge can be improved through empirical estimates of
   mutation rates and effects on cell lineages and whole organisms, such as
   estimates of the reduction in fitness of progeny produced by
   within-versus between-flower crosses on the same plant, mutation
   coalescent studies within the canopy, and incorporation of somatic
   mutation into theoretical models of plant evolutionary genetics.},

Abstract = {Mesophotic coral reefs, currently defined as deep reefs between 30 and
   150 m, are linked physically and biologically to their shallow water
   counterparts, have the potential to be refuges for shallow coral reef
   taxa such as coral and sponges, and might be a source of larvae that
   could contribute to the resiliency of shallow water reefs. Mesophotic
   coral reefs are found worldwide, but most are undescribed and
   understudied. Here, we review our current knowledge of mesophotic coral
   reefs and their functional ecology as it relates to their geomorphology,
   changes in the abiotic environment along depth gradients, trophic
   ecology, their reproduction, and their connectivity to shallow depths.
   Understanding the ecology of mesophotic coral reefs, and the
   connectivity between them and their shallow water counterparts, is now a
   primary focus for many reef studies as the worldwide degradation of
   shallow coral reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide, continues
   unabated.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Behavioral changes, such as those involved in mating, foraging, and
   migration, can generate reproductive barriers between populations.
   Birds, in particular, are known for their great diversity in these
   behaviors, and so behavioral isolation is often proposed to be the major
   driver of speciation. Here, we review empirical evidence to evaluate the
   importance of behavioral isolation in the early stages of avian
   speciation. Experimentally measured mating preferences indicate that
   changes in mating behavior can result in premating barriers, with their
   strength depending on the extent of divergence in mating signals.
   Differences in migratory and foraging behavior also can play important
   roles in generating reproductive barriers in the early stages of
   speciation. However, because premating behavioral isolation is
   imperfect, extrinsic postzygotic barriers, in the form of selection
   against hybrids having intermediate phenotypes, also play an important
   role in avian diversification, especially in completing the speciation
   process.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary adaptation to temperature and climate depends on both the
   extent to which organisms experience spatial and temporal environmental
   variation (exposure) and how responsive they are to the environmental
   variation (sensitivity). Theoretical models and experiments suggesting
   substantial potential for thermal adaptation have largely omitted
   realistic environmental variation. Environmental variation can drive
   fluctuations in selection that slow adaptive evolution. We review how
   carefully filtering environmental conditions based on how organisms
   experience their environment and further considering organismal
   sensitivity can improve predictions of thermal adaptation. We contrast
   taxa differing in exposure and sensitivity. Plasticity can increase the
   rate of evolutionary adaptation in taxa exposed to pronounced
   environmental variation. However, forms of plasticity that severely
   limit exposure, such as behavioral thermoregulation and phenological
   shifts, can hinder thermal adaptation. Despite examples of rapid thermal
   adaptation, experimental studies often reveal evolutionary constraints.
   Further investigating these constraints and issues of timescale and
   thermal history are needed to predict evolutionary adaptation and,
   consequently, population persistence in changing and variable
   environments.},

Abstract = {Signals of local adaptation have been found in many plants and animals,
   highlighting the heterogeneity in the distribution of adaptive genetic
   variation throughout species ranges. In the coming decades, global
   climate change is expected to induce shifts in the selective pressures
   that shape this adaptive variation. These changes in selective pressures
   will likely result in varying degrees of local climate maladaptation and
   spatial reshuffling of the underlying distributions of adaptive alleles.
   There is a growing interest in using population genomic data to help
   predict future disruptions to locally adaptive gene-environment
   associations. One motivation behind such work is to better understand
   how the effects of changing climate on populations' short-term fitness
   could vary spatially across species ranges. Here we review the current
   use of genomic data to predict the disruption of local adaptation across
   current and future climates. After assessing goals and motivations
   underlying the approach, we review the main steps and associated
   statistical methods currently in use and explore our current

Abstract = {Plant defense theory explores how plants invest in defenses against
   natural enemies but has focused primarily on the traits expressed by
   juvenile and mature plants. Here we describe the diverse ways in which
   seeds are chemically and physically defended. We suggest that through
   associations with other traits, seeds are likely to exhibit defense
   syndromes that reflect constraints or trade-offs imposed by selection to
   attract dispersers, enable effective dispersal, ensure appropriate
   timing of seed germination, and enhance seedling performance. We draw
   attention to seed and reproductive traits that are analogous to defense
   traits in mature plants and describe how the effectiveness of defenses
   is likely to differ at pre- and postdispersal stages. We also highlight
   recent insights into the mutualistic and antagonistic interactions
   between seeds and microbial communities, including fungi and endohyphal
   bacteria, that can influence seed survival in the soil and subsequent
   seedling vigor.},

Abstract = {Phylogenomics underpins a stable and mostly well-resolved hypothesis for
   the interrelationships of extant arthropods. Exceptionally preserved
   fossils are integrated into this framework by coding their morphological
   characters, as exemplified by total-evidence dating approaches that
   treat fossils as dated tips in analyses numerically dominated by
   molecular data. Cambrian fossils inform on the sequence of character
   acquisition in the arthropod stem group and in the stems of its main
   extant clades. The arthropod head problem incorporates unique appendage
   combinations and remains of the nervous system in fossils into a scheme
   mostly based on neuroanatomy and Hox expression domains for extant
   forms. Molecular estimates of arthropod origins in the Cryogenian or
   Ediacaran predate a coherent picture from the arthropod fossil record,
   which commences as trace fossils in the earliest Cambrian. Probabilistic
   morphological clock analysis of trilobites, which exemplify the earliest
   arthropod body fossils, supports a Cambrian origin, without the need to
   posit an unfossilized Ediacaran history.},

Abstract = {Flower evolution is characterized by widespread repetition, with
   adaptations to pollinator environment evolving in parallel. Recent
   studies have expanded our understanding of the developmental basis of
   adaptive floral novelties-petal fusion, bilateral symmetry, heterostyly,
   and floral dimensions. In this article, we describe patterns of trait
   evolution and review developmental genetic mechanisms underlying floral
   novelties. We discuss the diversity of mechanisms for parallel
   adaptation, the evidence for constraints on these mechanisms, and how
   constraints help explain observed macroevolutionary patterns. We
   describe parallel evolution resulting from similarities at multiple
   hierarchical levels-genetic, developmental, morphological,
   functional-which indicate general principles in floral evolution,
   including the central role of hormone signaling. An emerging pattern is
   mutational bias that may contribute to rapid patterns of parallel
   evolution, especially if the derived trait can result from simple
   degenerative mutations. We argue that such mutational bias may be less
   likely to govern the evolution of novelties patterned by complex
   developmental pathways.},

Abstract = {The ecology of fear concerns the population-, community-, and
   ecosystem-level consequences of the behavioral interactions between
   predators and prey, i.e., the aggregate impacts of individual responses
   to life-threatening events. We review new experiments demonstrating that
   fear itself is powerful enough to affect the population growth rate in
   free-living wild birds and mammals, and fear of large carnivores-or the
   human super predator-can cause trophic cascades affecting plant and
   invertebrate abundance. Life-threatening events like escaping a predator
   can have enduring, even lifelong, effects on the brain, and new
   interdisciplinary research on the neurobiology of fear in wild animals
   is both providing insights into post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and
   reinforcing the likely commonality of population- and community-level
   effects of fear in nature. Failing to consider fear thus risks
   dramatically underestimating the total impact predators can have on prey
   populations and the critical role predator-prey interactions can play in
   shaping ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Early botanical explorers invoked biogeographic history to explain the
   remarkable tree diversity of Neotropical forests. In this context, we
   review the history ofNeotropical tree diversity over the past 100
   million years, focusing on biomes with significant tree diversity. We
   evaluate hypotheses for rain forest origins, intercontinental
   disjunctions, and models of Neotropical tree diversification. To assess
   the impact of biotic interchange on the Amazon tree flora, we examined
   biogeographic histories of trees in Ecuador's Yasuni Forest, which
   suggest that nearly 50\% of its species descend from immigrant lineages
   that colonized South America during the Cenozoic. Long-distance and
   intercontinental dispersal, combined with trait filtering and niche
   evolution, are important factors in the community assembly of
   Neotropical forests. We evaluate the role of pre-Columbian people on
   Neotropical tree diversity and discuss the future of Neotropical forests
   in the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {The Arctic may seem remote, but the unprecedented environmental changes
   occurring there have important consequences for global society. Of all
   Arctic system components, changes in permafrost (perennially frozen
   ground) are one of the least documented. Permafrost is degrading as a
   result of climate warming, and evidence is mounting that changing
   permafrost will have significant impacts within and outside the region.
   This review asks: What are key structural and functional properties of
   ecosystems that interact with changing permafrost, and how do these
   ecosystem changes affect local and global society? Here, we look beyond
   the classic definition of permafrost to include a broadened focus on the
   composition of frozen ground, including the ice and the soil organic
   carbon content, and how it is changing. This ecological perspective of
   permafrost serves to identify areas of both vulnerability and resilience
   as climate, ecological disturbance regimes, and the human footprint all
   continue to change in this sensitive and critical region of Earth.},

Abstract = {Flowers at times host abundant and specialized communities of bacteria
   and fungi that influence floral phenotypes and interactions with
   pollinators. Ecological processes drive variation in microbial abundance
   and composition at multiple scales, including among plant species, among
   flower tissues, and among flowers on the same plant. Variation in
   microbial effects on floral phenotype suggests that microbial
   metabolites could cue the presence or quality of rewards for
   pollinators, but most plants are unlikely to rely on microbes for
   pollinator attraction or reproduction. From a microbial perspective,
   flowers offer opportunities to disperse between habitats, but microbial
   species differ in requirements for and benefits received from such
   dispersal. The extent to which floral microbes shape the evolution of
   floral traits, influence fitness of floral visitors, and respond to
   anthropogenic change is unclear. A deeper understanding of these
   phenomena could illuminate the ecological and evolutionary importance of
   floral microbiomes and their role in the conservation of
   plant-pollinator interactions.},

Abstract = {The Anthropocene biosphere constitutes an unprecedented phase in the
   evolution of life on Earth with one species, humans, exerting extensive
   control. The increasing intensity of anthropogenic forces in the
   twenty-first century has widespread implications for attempts to govern
   both human-dominated ecosystems and the last remaining wild ecosystems.
   Here, we review how evolutionary biology can inform governance and
   policies in the Anthropocene, focusing on five governance challenges
   that span biodiversity, environmental management, food and other biomass
   production, and human health. The five challenges are: (a) evolutionary
   feedbacks, (b) maintaining resilience, (c) alleviating constraints, (d)
   coevolutionary disruption, and (e) biotechnology. Strategies for
   governing these dynamics will themselves have to be coevolutionary, as
   eco-evolutionary and social dynamics change in response to each other.},

Abstract = {Many important questions about the history and dynamics of organisms
   have a geographical component: How many are there, and where do they
   live? How do they move and interbreed across the landscape? How were
   they moving a thousand years ago, and where were the ancestors of a
   particular individual alive today? Answers to these questions can have
   profound consequences for our understanding of history, ecology, and the
   evolutionary process. In this review, we discuss how geographic aspects
   of the distribution, movement, and reproduction of organisms are
   reflected in their pedigree across space and time. Because the structure
   of the pedigree is what determines patterns of relatedness in modern
   genetic variation, our aim is to thus provide intuition for how these
   processes leave an imprint in genetic data. We also highlight some
   current methods and gaps in the statistical toolbox of spatial
   population genetics.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, a burgeoning literature has documented the cultural
   transmission of behavior through social learning in numerous vertebrate
   and invertebrate species. One meaning of ``cultural evolution in
   animals{''} refers to these discoveries, and I present an overview of
   key findings. I then address the other meaning of the term focused on
   cultural changes within a lineage. Such changes in humans, described as
   ``cumulative cultural evolution,{''} have been spectacular, but
   relatively little attention has yet been paid to the topic in nonhuman
   animals, other than asserting that the process is unique to humans. A
   variety of evidence including both controlled experiments and field
   observations has begun to challenge this view, and in some behavioral
   domains, notably birdsong, cultural evolution has been studied for many
   years. In this review, I dissect concepts of cultural evolution and
   cumulative culture and appraise the accumulating evidence bearing on
   their nature and significance for evolutionary biology at large.},

Abstract = {Resolving the genealogy of life-the phylogenetic relationships that
   describe the evolutionary history of species-remains one of the great
   challenges of systematic biology. The recent proliferation of DNA
   sequencing technologies has sparked a rapid increase in the volume of
   genetic data being applied to phylogenetic studies. Single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) data, ubiquitous genetic markers once considered
   reserved for population genetic studies, are now being applied in
   phylogenetics research at deep evolutionary timescales. The potential
   for SNPs to resolve contentious phylogenetic problems while researchers
   also investigate population demographics is promising, yet serious
   challenges remain with respect to data collection, assembly, modeling,
   and analysis. The low cost and ease of collecting SNPs suggest that they
   will remain an important source of genetic information for inferring
   phylogenies across time periods ranging from the Anthropocene to the
   Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {During the past 541 million years, marine animals underwent three
   intervals of diversification (early Cambrian, Ordovician,
   Cretaceous-Cenozoic) separated by nondirectional fluctuation, suggesting
   diversity-dependent dynamics with the equilibrium diversity shifting
   through time. Changes in factors such as shallow-marine habitat area and
   climate appear to have modulated the nondirectional fluctuations.
   Directional increases in diversity are best explained by evolutionary
   innovations in marine animals and primary producers coupled with
   stepwise increases in the availability of food and oxygen. Increasing
   intensity of biotic interactions such as predation and disturbance may
   have led to positive feedbacks on diversification as ecosystems became
   more complex. Important areas for further research include improving the
   geographic coverage and temporal resolution of paleontological data
   sets, as well as deepening our understanding of Earth system evolution
   and the physiological and ecological traits that modulated organismal
   responses to environmental change.},

Abstract = {Many fields of evolutionary biology now depend on stochastic
   mathematical models. These models are valuable for their ability to
   formalize predictions in the face of uncertainty and provide a
   quantitative framework for testing hypotheses. However, no mathematical
   model will fully capture biological complexity. Instead, these models
   attempt to capture the important features of biological systems using
   relatively simple mathematical principles. These simplifications can
   allow us to focus on differences that are meaningful, while ignoring
   those that are not. However, simplification also requires assumptions,
   and to the extent that these are wrong, so is our ability to predict or
   compare. Here, we discuss approaches for evaluating the performance of
   evolutionary models in light of their assumptions by comparing them
   against reality. We highlight general approaches, how they are applied,
   and remaining opportunities. Absolute tests of fit, even when not
   explicitly framed as such, are fundamental to progress in understanding
   evolution.},

Abstract = {Species tree estimation is a basic part of many biological research
   projects, ranging from answering basic evolutionary questions (e.g., how
   did a group of species adapt to their environments?) to addressing
   questions in functional biology. Yet, species tree estimation is very
   challenging, due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene
   duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer, and hybridization, which
   can make gene trees differ from each other and from the overall
   evolutionary history of the species. Over the last 10-20 years, there
   has been tremendous growth in methods and mathematical theory for
   estimating species trees and phylogenetic networks, and some of these
   methods are now in wide use. In this survey, we provide an overview of
   the current state of the art, identify the limitations of existing
   methods and theory, and propose additional research problems and
   directions.},

Abstract = {Mutually beneficial interspecific interactions are abundant throughout
   the natural world, including between microbes. Mutualisms between
   microbes are critical for everything from human health to global
   nutrient cycling. Studying model microbial mutualisms in the laboratory
   enables highly controlled experiments for developing and testing
   evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. In this review, we begin by
   describing the tools available for studying model microbial mutualisms.
   We then outline recent insights that laboratory systems have shed on the
   evolutionary origins, evolutionary dynamics, and ecological features of
   microbial mutualism. We touch on gaps in our current understanding of
   microbial mutualisms, note connections to mutualism in nonmicrobial
   systems, and call attention to open questions ripe for future study.},

Abstract = {Most biological invasion literature-including syntheses and
   meta-analyses and the resulting theory-is reported from temperate
   regions, drawing only minimally from the tropics except for some island
   systems. The lack of attention to invasions in the tropics results from
   and reinforces the assumption that tropical ecosystems, and especially
   the continental tropics, are more resistant to invasions. We have
   critically assessed biological invasions in the tropics and compared
   them with temperate regions, finding relatively weak evidence that
   tropical and temperate regions differ in their invasibility and in the
   traits that determine invader success and impacts. Propagule pressure
   and the traits that promote adaptation to disturbances (e.g., high
   fecundity or fast growth rates) are generally favorable to invasions in
   both tropical and temperate regions. We emphasize the urgent need for
   greater investment and regional cooperation in the study, prevention,
   and management of biological invasions in the tropics.},

Abstract = {Microorganisms drive several processes needed for robust plant growth
   and health. Harnessing microbial functions is thus key to productive and
   sustainable food production. Molecular methods have led to a greater
   understanding of the soil microbiome composition. However, translating
   species or gene composition into microbiome functionality remains a
   challenge. Community ecology concepts such as the biodiversity-ecosystem
   functioning framework may help predict the assembly and function of
   plant-associated soil microbiomes. Higher diversity can increase the
   number and resilience of plant-beneficial functions that can be
   coexpressed and unlock the expression of plant-beneficial traits that
   are hard to obtain from any species in isolation. We combine
   well-established community ecology concepts with molecular microbiology
   into a workable framework that may enable us to predict and enhance soil
   microbiome functionality to promote robust plant growth in a global
   change context.},

Abstract = {The study of environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to revolutionize
   biodiversity science and conservation action by enabling the census of
   species on a global scale in near real time. To achieve this promise,
   technical challenges must be resolved. In this review, we explore the
   main uses of eDNA as well as the complexities introduced by its misuse.
   Current eDNA methods require refinement and improved calibration and
   validation along the entire workflow to lessen false
   positives/negatives. Moreover, there is great need for a better
   understanding of the ``natural history{''} of eDNA-its origins, state,
   lifetime, and transportation-and for more detailed insights concerning
   the physical and ecological limitations of eDNA use. Although eDNA
   analysis can provide powerful information, particularly in freshwater
   and marine environments, its impact is likely to be less significant in
   terrestrial settings. The broad adoption of eDNA tools in conservation
   will largely depend on addressing current uncertainties in data
   interpretation.},

Abstract = {Plants are the foundation of the food web and therefore interact
   directly and indirectly with myriad organisms at higher trophic levels.
   They directly provide nourishment to mutualistic and antagonistic
   primary consumers (e.g., pollinators and herbivores), which in turn are
   consumed by predators. These interactions produce cascading indirect
   effects on plants (either trait-mediated or density-mediated). We review
   how predators affect plant-pollinator interactions and thus how
   predators indirectly affect plant reproduction, fitness, mating systems,
   and trait evolution. Predators can influence pollinator abundance and
   foraging behavior. In many cases, predators cause pollinators to visit
   plants less frequently and for shorter durations. This decline in
   visitation can lead to pollen limitation and decreased seed set.
   However, alternative outcomes can result due to differences in predator,
   pollinator, and plant functional traits as well as due to altered
   interaction networks with plant enemies. Furthermore, predators may
   indirectly affect the evolution of plant traits and mating systems.},

Abstract = {Commensalisms, interactions between two species in which one species
   benefits and the other experiences no net effect, are frequently
   mentioned in the ecological literature but are surprisingly little
   studied. Here we review and synthesize our limited understanding of
   commensalism. We then argue that commensalism is not a single type of
   interaction; rather, it is a suite of phenomena associated with distinct
   ecological processes and evolutionary consequences. For each form of
   commensalism we define, we present evidence for how, where, and why it
   occurs, including when it is evolutionarily persistent and when it is an
   occasional outcome of interactions that are usually mutualistic or
   antagonistic. We argue that commensalism should be of great interest in
   the study of species interactions due to its location at the center of
   the continuum between positive and negative outcomes. Finally, we offer
   a roadmap for future research.},

Abstract = {As terrestrial leaf litter decomposes in rivers, its constituent
   elements follow multiple pathways. Carbon leached as dissolved organic
   matter can be quickly taken up by microbes, then respired before it can
   be transferred to the macroscopic food web. Alternatively, this detrital
   carbon can be ingested and assimilated by aquatic invertebrates, so it
   is retained longer in the stream and transferred to higher trophic
   levels. Microbial growth on litter can affect invertebrates through
   three pathways, which are not mutually exclusive. First, microbes can
   facilitate invertebrate feeding, improving food quality by conditioning
   leaves and making them more palatable for invertebrates. Second,
   microbes can be prey for invertebrates. Third, microbes can compete with
   invertebrates for resources bound within litter and may produce
   compounds that retard carbon and nitrogen fluxes to invertebrates. As
   litter is broken down into smaller particles, there are many
   opportunities for its elements to reenter the stream food web. Here, I
   describe a conceptual framework for evaluating how traits of leaf litter
   will affect its fate in food webs and ecosystems that is useful for
   predicting how global change will alter carbon fluxes into and out of
   streams.},

Abstract = {Mimicry rings are communities of mimetic organisms that are excellent
   models for ecological and evolutionary studies because the community
   composition, the nature of the species interactions, the phenotypes
   under selection, and the selective agents are well characterized. Here,
   we review how regional and ecological filtering, density- and
   frequency-dependent selection, toxicity of prey, and age of mimicry
   rings shape their assembly. We synthesize findings from theoretical and
   empirical studies to generate the following hypotheses: (a) the degree
   of unpalatability and age of mimicry rings increase mimicry ring size
   and (b) the degree of unpalatability, generalization of the aposematic
   signal, and availability of alternative prey are positively related to
   the breadth of the protection umbrella for an aposematic signal and
   negatively related to the degree of mimetic resemblance. We also provide
   a phylogenetic framework in which key aspects of mimicry ring
   diversification may be studied.},

Abstract = {While the importance of mutualisms across the tree of life is
   recognized, it is not understood why some organisms evolve high levels
   of dependence on mutualistic partnerships, while other species remain
   autonomous or retain or regain minimal dependence on partners. We
   identify four main pathways leading to the evolution of mutualistic
   dependence. Then, we evaluate current evidence for three predictions:
   (a) Mutualisms with different levels of dependence have distinct
   stabilizing mechanisms against exploitation and cheating, (b) less
   dependent mutualists will return to autonomy more often than those that
   are highly dependent, and (c) obligate mutualisms should be less context
   dependent than facultative ones. Although we find evidence supporting
   all three predictions, we stress that mutualistic partners follow
   diverse paths toward-and away from-dependence. We also highlight the
   need to better examine asymmetry in partner dependence. Recognizing how
   variation in dependence influences the stability, breakdown, and context
   dependence of mutualisms generates new hypotheses regarding how and why
   the benefits of mutualistic partnerships differ over time and space.},

Abstract = {Inhabiting the interface between plant roots and soil, mycorrhizal fungi
   play a unique but underappreciated role in soil organic matter (SOM)
   dynamics. Their hyphae provide an efficient mechanism for distributing
   plant carbon throughout the soil, facilitating its deposition into soil
   pores and onto mineral surfaces, where it can be protected from
   microbial attack. Mycorrhizal exudates and dead tissues contribute to
   the microbial necromass pool now known to play a dominant role in SOM
   formation and stabilization. While mycorrhizal fungi lack the genetic
   capacity to act as saprotrophs, they use several strategies to access
   nutrients locked in SOM and thereby promote its decay, including direct
   enzymatic breakdown, oxidation via Fenton chemistry, and stimulation of
   heterotrophic microorganisms through carbon provision to the
   rhizosphere. An additional mechanism, competition with freeliving
   saprotrophs, potentially suppresses SOM decomposition, leading to its
   accumulation. How these various nutrient acquisition strategies
   differentially influence SOM formation, stabilization, and loss is an
   area of critical research need.},

Abstract = {Long-term studies have been crucial to the advancement of population
   biology, especially our understanding of population dynamics. We argue
   that this progress arises from three key characteristics of long-term
   research. First, long-term data are necessary to observe the
   heterogeneity that drives most population processes. Second, long-term
   studies often inherently lead to novel insights. Finally, long-term
   field studies can serve as model systems for population biology,
   allowing for theory and methods to be tested under well-characterized
   conditions. We illustrate these ideas in three long-term field systems
   that have made outsized contributions to our understanding of population
   ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. We then highlight three
   emerging areas to which long-term field studies are well positioned to
   contribute in the future: ecological forecasting, genomics, and
   macrosystems ecology. Overcoming the obstacles associated with
   maintaining long-term studies requires continued emphasis on recognizing
   the benefits of such studies to ensure that long-term research continues
   to have a substantial impact on elucidating population biology.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is enormous, cold, remote, and particularly sensitive to
   climate change. Most biological research below 60 degrees S has focused
   on the isolated nature of the biota and how organisms have adapted to
   the cold and ice. However, biogeographic patterns in Antarctica and the
   Southern Ocean, and the processes explaining how those patterns came
   about, still await adequate explanation. Both terrestrial and marine
   organisms have been influenced by climatic change (e.g., glaciation),
   physical phenomena (e.g., oceanic currents), and/or potential barriers
   to gene flow (e.g., steep thermal gradients). Whereas the Antarctic
   region contains diverse and complex marine communities, terrestrial
   systems tend to be comparatively simple with limited diversity. Here, we
   challenge the current dogma used to explain the diversity and
   biogeographic patterns present in the Antarctic. We assert that
   relatively modern processes within the last few million years, rather
   than geological events that occurred in the Eocene and Miocene, account
   for present patterns of biodiversity in the region. Additionally,
   reproductive life history stages appear to have little influence in
   structuring genetic patterns in the Antarctic, as currents and glacial
   patterns are noted to be more important drivers of organismal patterns
   of distribution. Finally, we highlight the need for additional sampling,
   high-throughput genomic approaches, and broad, multinational cooperation
   for addressing outstanding questions of Antarctic biogeography and
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Mechanisms of Plastic Rescue in Novel Environments},

Abstract = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity provides a mechanism of developmental
   rescue in novel and rapidly changing environments. Understanding the
   underlying mechanism of plasticity is important for predicting both the
   likelihood that a developmental response is adaptive and associated
   life-history trade-offs that could influence patterns of subsequent
   evolutionary rescue. Although evolved developmental switches may move
   organisms toward a new adaptive peak in a novel environment, such
   mechanisms often result in maladaptive responses. The induction of
   generalized physiological mechanisms in new environments is relatively
   more likely to result in adaptive responses to factors such as novel
   toxins, heat stress, or pathogens. Developmental selection forms of
   plasticity, which rely on within-individual selective processes, such as
   shaping of tissue architecture, trial-and-error learning, or acquired
   immunity, are particularly likely to result in adaptive plasticity in a
   novel environment. However, both the induction of plastic responses and
   the ability to be plastic through developmental selection come with
   significant costs, resulting in delays in reproduction, increased
   individual investment, and reduced fecundity. Thus, we might expect
   complex interactions between plastic responses that allow survival in
   novel environments and subsequent evolutionary responses at the
   population level.},
