Abstract = {Colony composition and behavioral characteristics of the myrmicine ant,
   Aphaenogaster rugulosa, a species endemic to Yonagunijima Island, were
   investigated. Colonies nested in rotten woods fallen on the forest
   floor. All queenright colonies (N = 42) were monogynous with one dealate
   queen. The average colony size in worker number was 140.5 +/- SD 94.9.
   Under laboratory conditions, workers and larvae fed on both fresh and
   dried insect preys. The workers used a kind of tool to transport diluted
   sugar water to the nest chamber. They dropped pine needles and trashes
   into the diluted sugar water and then transported the food-soaked
   materials back into the nest chamber, where nest members then sucked on
   the materials inside the nest chamber. Trophic eggs were laid by the
   workers, the majority of which were given to the larvae. The queens also
   fed on trophic eggs as well as insect preys. The workers under an orphan
   condition laid reproductive eggs that grew up to be males.},

Title = {Local perceptions of forest rules and interactions between rules,
   ecotourism, and human-wildlife conflicts: Evidence from Chitwan National
   Park, Nepal},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {25-39},
Abstract = {There is always a conflict of interest between conservation efforts and
   communities living near conservation areas. Buffer zones and
   opportunities for ecotourism are sometimes created to lessen the
   negative impact of the stringent rules involved in conservation which
   directly impacts the livelihoods of neighbouring communities. This paper
   examines a Nepalese community's perceptions of the Buffer Zone Community
   Forest (BZCF) rules, and investigates the interplay of rules,
   ecotourism, and human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Data were obtained from
   face-to-face household surveys and key informant interviews carried out
   in two Buffer Zone Villages in Chitwan National Park, Nepal. It was
   found that access to forest resources has become more restricted since
   ecotourism was introduced in the BZCF. Furthermore, contrary to
   expectations, settlements both closer to and farther from the forest are
   largely affected to the same extent by these restrictions. This study
   recommends better livelihood opportunities for disadvantaged groups in
   and around the BZCF, along with the development of forest policies based
   in reality to improve compliance with forest rules and to gain local
   support for conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {To clarify the effects of thinning on the growth and wood quality of
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees grown in Thailand, the growth
   characteristics, anatomical characteristics, and wood properties of T5
   clones, which are used on plantations to produce pulpwood, were
   investigated. Core samples were collected from trees grown on both
   thinned and unthinned (i.e., control) plots. The effects of thinning on
   the trees anatomical characteristics and wood properties were evaluated
   at bark side (2 cm from the bark) of the tree. We identified significant
   differences between the two plots in terms of stem diameter, wood
   volume, wall thickness of wood fiber, moisture content, and basic
   density. However, trends in the radial variation of the measured
   characteristics were almost the same between the thinned and control
   plots. These results suggest that prolonged rotation age and subsequent
   thinning do not negatively affect the quality of solid wood produced by
   E. camaldulensis.},

Title = {Stable isotope study on nitrogen and sulfur impact to coral ecosystem of
   Yoron, Japan},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-21},
Abstract = {In Yoron Island, cultivation of Sugarcane makes up 52 \% of the
   agriculture on the island, and it comes with extensive use of chemical
   fertilizers with ammonium sulfate. Moreover, as the main island is
   geographically formed from karst by the raised coral reef, precipitation
   smoothly flows to the sea through the underground. In this process,
   sulfate is brought to the sea as well. It is believed that potential
   hazards are then caused to the coral reef ecosystem. Considering this
   background, we aimed to evaluate the influence of sulfate on coral reef
   by analyzing the stable isotopes ratio of nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   sulfur (delta S-34). Since the delta S-34 of sulfate is 0 \%, the same
   value would also be shown in coral skeleton if there were significant
   effect of inflows. Our result reveals that delta N-15 value in coral
   skeleton is similar to that of the chemical fertilizer. A contrary,
   delta S-34 value obtained did not show similarity with that of the
   sulfate. However, from the analysis of the delta S-34 in growth ring, we
   witness a decrease of 2 \% to 5 \% from 1979 to 2013 and from 1990 to
   2013. The conclusive result is that the delta S-34 value in coral
   skeleton is not significantly affected by that of the value of sulfate
   fertilizer. Nonetheless, the consistent decrease of delta S-34 from 1979
   to 2013 may possibly be related to the increase of inflow of
   land-substance with low delta S-34 value to the sea.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Salak palms (Salacca spp.) are important fruit species in Southeast
   Asia, but the morphogenesis of their reproductive organs is unknown. To
   observe female gametogenesis, pistil morphogenesis of S. wallichiana and
   subsequent fertilization were observed. The ovary contained three ovule
   primordia three months before flowering (BF). The ovule contained one
   mono-nucleate megaspore at the center and three degenerated megaspores
   on the chalazal side at two months BF, and a mononucleate embryo sac
   (ES) at one month BF. The nucellus enlarged, and protruded beak-like
   from the integuments, forming a micropylar structure. The ovule was
   anatropous, unitegmic, and crassinucellate. Three weeks BF, the ES was
   at the 8-nucleate stage. Two weeks BF, an egg apparatus comprising one
   egg-cell nucleus and two synergid nuclei were developing on the
   micropylar side. The central cell contained one polar nucleus (PN). One
   week BF, the synergids and central cell became multinucleate and
   multiple-PN dispersed in the ES. Several days BF, one PN was again
   observed, and the remaining PN appeared to develop cell groups along the
   ES wall. Anripodals existed on the chalazal side. One day BF, ES
   contained two PN, and one day after pollination (DAP), the zygote and
   primary endosperm nucleus occurred on the micropylar side. One synergid
   remained functional and enlarged even after fertilization. Four DAP and
   thereafter, suspensor cells and an early embryo existed on the
   micropylar side, and the ES contained multiple free endosperm nuclei. In
   S. wallichiana, the ES likely indicates intermediate morphogenesis
   between Polygonum and Oenothera types, suggesting a unique development
   pattern among palms.},

Abstract = {We studied biomass changes in a lowland tropical rain forest in the
   Pasoh Forest Reserve of Peninsular Malaysia after selective logging in
   1958. A tree census was undertaken every 2 years from 1998 to 2012 in a
   6-ha logged forest plot. Total aboveground biomass (AGB) was 72\% of
   that in a primary forest plot within the same reserve in 1998, but
   reached 87 \% in 2012. AGB regrowth was spatially variable within the
   logged forest plot and was much less in swampy areas than in upland
   areas. The overall annual growth rate of AGB in the logged forest
   throughout the study period was 1.5\% and slowed (to 0.6 \%) in a dry
   period (2004-2006). The biomass of large trees (DBH >= 50 cm) increased
   by 56 \% during the study period, but amounted to only 5890 of the
   biomass of the corresponding size class in the primary forest,
   suggesting that stand structure is still recovering from logging.
   Spatiotemporal variation in AGB recovery after logging needs to be taken
   into account for logging and subsequent management of the tropical
   lowland forest biome.},

Title = {Coexistence of multiple ethnic groups practicing different

Abstract = {This study is focused on farmers' maintenance of slash-and-burn
   cultivation in northwestern Zambia's miombo woodlands and elucidates
   their ecological knowledge and process of clearing slash-and-burn
   fields. It also examines farmers' coexistence in a multi-ethnic
   community in the context of the locations and ecological classification
   of fields cultivated by firstcomers and immigrants. The study area was S
   Ward in northwestern Zambia. It is written as S ward not to be specified
   the location. Northwestern Zambia is home to five ethnic groups: the
   Kaonde, who are considered the region's firstcomers, and the Lunda,
   Luvale. Chokwe. and Luchazi, who are relative newcomers to S Ward. The
   number of villages in S Ward increased from 11 Kaonde villages in 1960
   to 23 villages in 2000, of which nine were built by non-Kaonde
   immigrants. The population of S Ward increased with the influx of
   immigrants. Accordingly. the total area of cultivated land in S Ward in
   2014 was 12-times higher than in 1968. Farmers in these five ethnic
   groups categorized the surrounding ecological environment according to
   landforms, soils, and vegetation, and classified the ecology as marsh or
   woodland. Woodland was identified as one of two types based on the
   accumulated soil: the outer edge of the marsh has gray soil, whereas the
   upland region is characterized by red soil. According to the farmers,
   the gray soil was soft and rich in nutrients, whereas red soil contained
   little sand and hardened when dried. Farmers in S Ward recognized that
   the gray soil in the woodland was more suitable for cultivation. The
   Kaonde's cultivated fields were located at the outer edge of the marsh,
   as the Kaonde have lived in the area for several generations. so
   newcomers were forced to clear the uplands, which had remained
   unoccupied by the Kaonde farmers. The Kaonde and immigrants coexist in S
   Ward by cultivating different ecological areas and practicing different
   slash-and-burn cultivation systems.},

Title = {Variations of leaf and stem traits in relation to altitudinal
   distributions of 12 Fagaceae species of Mount Kinabalu, Borneo},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {57-66},
Abstract = {Fagaceae in Southeast Asia shows diverse distributions along altitude,
   but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Since species traits
   (morphological and physiological characteristics) can dictate their
   resource use strategies (e.g., the way of resource acquisition and
   allocation), they potentially influence their distributions along
   altitude. Here, to examine the linkage between species' traits and
   altitude, we quantified the variation of 10 leaf and stem traits of 12
   Fagaceae species growing in Mount Kinabalu, Borneo and related traits to
   species' lowest and highest limits and altitudinal range. Species with
   high leaf dry mass per area (LMA) and lamina thickness showed higher
   upper limits of altitudinal distribution whereas no traits were
   correlated with the lower limits. LMA, lamina thickness, leaf carbon
   concentration, and nitrogen content positively covaried with species'
   altitudinal range. These results demonstrate that species with
   conservative resource use had higher altitudinal limits and wider
   altitudinal range, highlighting the role of leaf traits in the
   diversification of altitudinal distributions among closely-related
   species. We further suggest that diversifications in leaf traits
   potentially lead to the coexistence of Fagaceae species in tropical
   montane forests.},

Title = {Productivity of sago palms on smallholder plantations after rewetting in

Journal = {TROPICS},

Abstract = {Sustainable land use through rewetting is becoming increasingly
   important in drained peatlands. We assessed the recovery of productivity
   of smallholder paludiculture using sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) in a
   rewetted peatland on Tebing Tinggi Island, Riau Province, Indonesia,
   which had been drained and burned in 2014. Stand structure and
   productivity of sago palms in smallholder plantations were measured in
   December 2016, November 2017, and March 2020. The sago stands were
   divided into three stands structure groups (pre-harvest stands, mid- to
   post-harvest stands, and growing period stands) according to gaps in the
   harvesting cycle, which were distributed in a mosaic pattern. Only those
   sago palms that had reached their maximum size were harvested, and as a
   result the mosaic pattern varied over time (spatial variation). The
   estimated harvest trunk height after rewetting was 8.9 +/- 1.5 m (mean
   +/- SD), which was not significantly different from that before drainage
   (9.7 +/- 0.4 m). The average annual yield of sago was 26.8 trunks
   ha(-1), and there was large annual variation. Annual yield of
   paludiculture conducted after rewetting recovered to the same yield as
   that before drainage (26.0 trunks ha(-1)). Such size distribution
   patterns and large fluctuations in yield are characteristic of
   semi-traditional smallholder sago cultivation. Despite fluctuations in
   annual yield, harvesting only suitable individuals allows sago palms to
   be supplied every year. The findings obtained in this study will
   contribute to national and regional efforts to initiate paludiculture
   using sago palms.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to obtain the basic wood properties of planted
   Borneo ironwood (Eusideroxylon zwageri) from a plantation established
   about 80 years ago. Stem diameter at 1.3 m above the ground, tree
   height, and stress-wave velocity (SWV) of stem were measured on 36
   planted E. zwageri trees. Later, core samples were collected from four
   trees whose measurements represented the average stem diameter of all
   the measured trees. Using the core samples, the moisture content (MC),
   basic density (BD), and compressive strength parallel to grain (CS) were
   measured. Dynamic Young's modulus for longitudinal direction at green
   condition (E) was also calculated from SWV. There was no significant
   relationship between growth characteristics and SWV. Mean values of MC,
   BD, CS, and E were 37.2 \%, 0.86 g/cm(3), 64.3 MPa, and 18.47 GPa,
   respectively. Significant differences among individual trees were found
   in MC, BD, and CS. In addition, radial variations were almost constant
   from bark side to pith side. The results indicate that longitudinal E is
   independent from growth characteristics, and that the E. zwageri wood
   tested in this study has uniform BD and CS in the radial direction.},

Title = {Effects of host tree size on the species richness and abundance of
   epiphyte assemblages in a Bornean lowland tropical forest},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {This study clarified the effects of host tree size on the numbers of
   epiphyte species and individuals on a tree, based on observation of 122
   species and 2,162 individuals of epiphytes on 430 target trees in a
   Bornean primary lowland dipterocarp forest. We analyzed relationships of
   the diameter at breast height (DBH) of target host trees with the
   probability of epiphyte presence, number of epiphyte species on each
   target tree (species richness), number of epiphyte individuals on each
   target host tree (abundance), and cumulative number of epiphyte species.
   The probability of epiphyte presence was estimated by a generalized
   linear model (GLM) with a logistic distribution to be higher than 50\%
   on trees with DBH >40 cm. A GLM with a quasi-Poisson distribution showed
   that both species richness and epiphyte abundance increased
   exponentially with DBH. The most rapid increase was found for trees with
   DBH >40 cm. Also, about half of all epiphyte species recorded in this
   study were only found on trees with DBH >60 cm. These results suggest
   that in lowland tropical rainforests in the Southeast Asian tropics,
   large trees play an important role in maintaining the species diversity
   of epiphyte assemblages by providing them with habitats. Meanwhile,
   several epiphyte species were found only trees with DBH <= 40 cm,
   suggesting that the small trees also provide essential habitats with
   such epiphyte species. Primary forests with various sizes of trees are
   necessary for conservation of the epiphyte assemblages.},

Title = {Elucidating the phenology of the Sundarbans mangrove forest using
   18-year time series of MODIS vegetation indices},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {41-55},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world
   however, baseline information on its phenology is poor. Information on
   seasonal changes in canopy greenness, which reflects the level of
   photosynthetic activity, is helpful for understanding seasonal patterns
   of carbon uptake by mangrove forests. To elucidate the periodicity,
   timing, and length of the active photosynthetic season, we examined
   temporal patterns in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 18-year (2001-2018)
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images for four major
   forest types in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. We identified a dominant
   cycle for the time-series of EVI and NDVI after Fourier transformation.
   We also estimated four phenological dates among the forest types: the
   start of the season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (MaxGreen), end of
   the season (EOS), and length of the season (LOS). Fourier analysis
   revealed that both the NDVI and EVI exhibited distinct cycles per year
   for all forest types, suggesting that there are annual cycles of canopy
   greenness. The SOS as estimated using the EVI and NDVI was consistently
   from late May to mid-June across forest types. However, the MaxGreen,
   EOS and LOS estimated varied between the two indices. Because EVI-based
   phenological dates match better with phenological information at the
   ground level than do NDVI-based dates, the EVI would be better than the
   NDVI for depicting changes in canopy greenness. The results of this
   study provide baseline information for future phenological changes in

Abstract = {There is a high expectation for forest ecosystems to provide several
   ecosystem services simultaneously. In this study, positive relationships
   between the amount of carbon stock in coarse woody debris (CWD) and the
   diversity of polypore fungi were examined in six primary stands and 19
   secondary stands with different stand ages (12-81 years) of tropical
   rain forests in Malaysia. We recorded the size and number of each of the
   CWD pieces in which at least one fruiting body of 21 target polypore
   species appeared in each plot. The average amount of carbon stock in the
   CWD pieces was estimated to be 48.8 Mg ha(-1 )in primary forests and
   12.3 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forests. The diversity of polypore species
   increased with the amount of carbon stock in CWD when data from primary
   and secondary forest were combined. Among secondary forests, the carbon
   stock of CWD increased with stand age, but diversity of polypore species
   varied greatly among stands of similar ages and the carbon stock of CWD,
   and hence did not significantly increase with stand age or the carbon
   stock of CWD. According to our findings, primary forests are critically
   important for the conservation of biodiversity and carbon stock, and old
   secondary forests with higher carbon stock in CWD have a potential to
   sustain a high level of diversity of polypore fungi.},

Journal = {TROPICS},

Abstract = {Tropical forests are considered as phosphorus (P)-poor ecosystems, where
   microorganisms are suggested to allocate more resources to P acquisition
   compared to carbon (C) and/or nitrogen (N) acquisition. Therefore,
   ratios of activities of acid/alkaline phosphomonoesterase (AP) to
   C-acquiring enzymes such as beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and C and/or
   N-acquiring enzymes such as beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) and
   leucine amino peptidase (LAP) are generally larger in tropical forest
   soils (i.e., BG: AP and (NAG+LAP): AP are smaller). However, those
   ratios were never reported for enzymes in throughfall. In this short
   note, we reported that both BG: AP and (NAG I LAP): AP of throughfall
   samples were smaller in five tropical forests than those in a temperate
   forest, which was consistent with generally-observed patterns in soils.
   This implies that phyllosphere microorganisms may allocate more
   resources to obtain P in P-poor tropical forest canopy, which should be
   considered in future P cycling quantifications in forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Spatial variations of litterfall silicon flux and plant-available
   silicon in highly weathered soil in a lowland mixed dipterocarp forest
   of Lambir Hills National Park in Borneo},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {Tropical forest trees take up silicon (Si) and return it to the forest
   floor via leaf litterfall. Our objective was to explore to what extent
   litter Si flux and Si availability from the soil are spatially coupled.
   We examined these relationships within a 4-ha area of lowland mixed
   dipterocarp forest of Lambir Hills National Park in Borneo. Using leaf
   litter samples collected with litter traps, we found that Si
   concentration and flux of leaf litter ranged 2-23 mg Si g(-1) and
   0.8-13.1 g Si m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, whereas water-extractable Si
   from 0-10 cm deep soil ranged from 5.9 to 24.5 mg kg(-1) (0.7 to 3.0 g
   Si m(-2)) at 80 litter trap locations. There was no significant
   correlation among these three aspects of Si cycling via trees.
   Water-extractable soil Si from three 95 cm deep cores showed no
   significant change with depth, whereas in-situ measurements with six
   tension lysimeters showed higher soil-water Si concentration in the
   upper soil layer (0-5 cm depth). These results suggest that spatial
   variations of Si concentration and flux in leaf litter do not reflect
   those of soil Si availability, but are modulated by distribution of tree
   species that differ in Si uptake. Si returned to the soil via leaf
   litter did not show strong spatial signals probably because solubility
   of Si from dead leaves differs among species. At the stand level, our
   results are consistent with the perspective that litter Si input
   enriches plant-available Si pool in the upper soil horizons in tropical
   forests.},

Title = {Relationship between leaf flushing phenology and defensive traits of
   canopy trees of five dipterocarp species in a tropical rain forest},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {67-79},
Abstract = {While the canopy layer shows the highest productivity in forests, it
   also has the highest herbivore population density. How do canopy trees
   cope with attack from herbivores under such conditions? We investigated
   the relationship between leaf flushing phenology, defensive and
   photosynthetic traits, such as leaf flushing frequency, the number of
   emerging leaves per flushing term, the leaf life span, total phenolic
   and condensed tannin contents, leaf toughness, leaf nitrogen content,
   the photosynthetic rate at light saturation (P-max) and leaf mass per
   area (LMA), in canopy trees of five dipterocarp species in a Malaysian
   tropical rain forest. Interspecific variations were clearly observed in
   leaf flushing frequency, ranging from occasional to continuous patterns.
   The total phenolic content significantly increased with leaf flushing
   frequency. Leaf toughness showed no correlation with leaf flushing
   phenology, but species with occasional leaf flushing had greater leaf
   toughness than those with continuous leaf production. There was a
   negative correlation between leaf toughness and tannin content, and a
   positive correlation between the former and P-max.In-  addition, the
   leaf herbivory rate significantly increased with a larger number of
   emerging leaves per term and a higher comprehensive index (PC1) from PCA
   analysis using leaf flushing frequency and the number of leaves.
   Therefore, our results suggest that tropical canopy species have various
   defensive strategies against herbivore attack by regulating the
   intensity of chemical, physical and phenological defenses; species with
   high leaf flushing frequency have more chemically defended leaves, while
   those with low leaf flushing frequency have tougher leaves with higher
   photosynthetic abilities.},

Abstract = {In the tropics, the area covered by degraded and fragmented secondary
   forests has expanded following forest fires and intensive land-use. We
   studied a fragmented secondary forest in South Kalimantan Province,
   Indonesia, to gain ecological information and to quantify the effect of
   human activities on accumulated biomass and tree composition. A
   fragmented secondary forest of about 0.5 ha was divided into 27 edge and
   18 inside plots with size of 10 mx10 m and the stand biomass, tree
   composition and human activities were analyzed. Mean aboveground biomass
   (AGB) in edge and inside plots were 63.2 and 71.2 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively and the difference was insignificant (t-test: p 0.1), while
   the Shannon-Wiener index (H') value of the later tended larger than
   former (t-test: p<0.1). Native trees tended to be more in inside plots
   comparing with edge plots, and human planted trees were identified in
   mainly edge plots. There were also large differences in biomass (wood)
   removal by rural people (1.350 and 0.248 Mg ha(-1) year(-1),
   respectively). The characteristics of each type of fragmented secondary
   forest were influenced by the human activity of wood collection:
   small-diameter trees, which should have been successors to the existing
   canopy, were frequently removed.},

   small-toothed palm civets Arctogalidia trivirgata, and masked palm
   civets Paguma larvata, respectively during the study period. The food
   plant species used by these species studied showed a large degree of
   overlap, especially among common palm civets, binturongs, and
   small-toothed palm civets. Based on the results of this study,
   differences among them in their degree of use of pioneer plant fruits
   and Ficus, and the acceptance of immature and unripe fruits, could
   enable these civets to coexist, even in a small area. However, there is
   no clear evidence for how they are able to coexist. This eight-year
   record is not enough to fully determine dietary similarities and
   dissimilarities or the coexistence mechanism of the four sympatric
   Paradoxurinae species on Borneo. More field observations with mechanical
   and chemical techniques are needed, not only to elucidate this mechanism
   but also to consider conservation of these animals and their habitats in
   a changing environment on Borneo.},

Abstract = {A bark beetle Coccotrypes gedeanus Eggers (Coleoptera: Curculionidae:
   Scolytinae) is a dominant insect seed predator of dipterocarp fruits in
   the lowland tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. In this study, the
   host preference and host range of C. gedeanus was determined by sampling
   22.216 fruits from 137 species of 59 genera belonging to 24 families in
   a primary lowland mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo. Coccotrypes
   gedeanus adults were found in the fruits of 51 species from 19 genera
   belonging to 13 families, and were observed to settle in the fruits of
   34 species of 11 genera belonging to 6 families to initiate breeding.
   Except one plant species, the rest of the 34 plant species were
   confirmed to bear ``nut{''} or ``drupe{''} type fruit. These results
   suggested that a population of C. gedeanus utilize seeds of various
   plant species simultaneously. The polyphagy of the bark beetle might be
   adaptive for survival in the Bornean tropical rain forests where the
   density of each plant species is low, and most plants produce fruits at
   unpredictably long intervals. Our results also suggested that the
   characteristics of fruit might affect the host plant preference of C.
   gedeanus adults and or the growth performance of C. gedeanus larvae.},

Abstract = {Monospecific Rhizophora spp. trees have been planted for several decades
   in the Philippines to offset heavy mangrove deforestation resulting
   mainly from aquaculture pond construction. The reforested mangrove
   studies are required for evaluating their ecological roles. We surveyed
   the forest structure, biomass, and net primary production (NPP) at an
   18-year-old R. mucronata plantation site (PL) and a secondary natural
   mangrove site (NM) at Batan Bay Estuary, Philippines. The survey showed
   that PL had a>8,000 ha(-1) tree density, 351.6 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and
   73.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP, exceeding the values at NM (670 ha(-1 )tree
   density, 130.7 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and 22.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP). The
   low biomass quantity in NM was due to the residual effects of a typhoon
   in November 2013; however, the NPP showed a quick recovery which implies
   the disturbance-adapted characteristics of pioneer species such as
   Avicennia marina and Sonneratia alba. At PL, the biomass and NPP were
   large, though it has been known that monospecific Rhizophora spp.
   plantation has been vulnerable to the risk of stand destruction due to
   strong typhoons. We concluded that the A. marina and S. alba, which
   dominated as natural mangrove stand, are suitable for mangrove
   reforestation because it quick recovered even after the typhoon impacts.},

Title = {Drainage effects on leaf traits of trees in tropical peat swamp forests

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Large areas of the tropical peat swamp forests in Central Kalimantan
   were drained to be converted into rice fields and then abandoned. A
   change in the soil water level due to drainage in the forests must have
   had a big impact on the ecology and ecophysiology of the trees in the
   drained remnant forests. The leaf traits of these trees in particular
   may have been directly or indirectly affected by drainage because of
   their high sensitivity to environmental change. To understand the
   influence of drainage on leaf traits, we investigated leaf morphological
   and physiological differences between intact and drained peat swamp
   forests in Palangka Raya, Indonesia, using 14 species distributed over
   both types of forests. We compared the leaf mass per unit area (LMA),
   leaf toughness, leaf area- and mass-based nitrogen content (N-area and
   N-mass), carbon/nitrogen ratio, total phenolics, condensed tannin and
   lignin content and carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) of both types of
   forest trees. In the drained forest, trees had higher values in LMA,
   N-area, and delta C-13 than in the intact forest, suggesting that such
   trees adjust themselves to dry conditions to increase photosynthetic
   ability with high water use efficiency compared with those in intact
   forests. We also found an increase in condensed tannin content in
   drained forest trees, which may offset the drainage-induced acceleration
   of leaf decomposition to some extent.},

Title = {Spatial variations in the decay coefficients of forest ecosystems in
   East and Southeast Asia},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {49-66},
Abstract = {We assessed spatial variation in the decay coefficients of fine wood
   litter on the forest floor in four forest formations in East and
   Southeast Asia. We used a novel approach to incorporate fragmentation
   loss in the decomposition process within four plots, each several
   hectares in area. The spatial patterns showed significant correlations
   with some biotic, edaphic, topographic, and climatic factors. Variation
   in the lowland tropical rainforest was driven largely by the feeding
   behaviors of termites. Variation in the hill dipterocarp forest
   exhibited no clear correlations with topographic parameters due to
   complementarity of decay activities by fungi and termites through
   segregation of their habitat between concave and convex sites,
   respectively. The subtropical rainforest showed variations associated
   with habitats distinguished by understory communities, reflecting
   edaphic conditions. Variation in the warm-temperate lucidophyll forest
   showed a clear negative correlation with slope convexity. The maximum
   area of spatial autocorrelation for the decay coefficient was used as
   the unit area for identification of significant relationships between
   decay coefficients and net primary productivity for aboveground coarse
   woody organs in terms of spatial variations, except in the subtropical
   forest plot. The ecological features of the four research plots were
   assessed based on spatial variation in structural and functional
   parameters over the unit areas or among the understory communities. Our
   results imply that 1) the positive correlations between decay
   coefficients and net primary productivity in two plots in a tropical
   zone were realized by spatial properties of the death rates of trees
   being higher or even at sites with higher decay coefficients and 2) the
   negative correlations in two plots in subtropical and warm-temperate
   zones were maintained by increasing the death rates on convex sites
   through frequent disturbance by typhoons. Inter- and intrasite
   variations in decay coefficients were evaluated using a probability
   density function of two-dimensional standard normal distributions
   regressed from data collected in the study area.},

Abstract = {In the southeast Asian lowland dipterocarp forest of Peninsular Malaysia
   (Pasoh Forest Reserve), upper canopy tree species with heterobaric
   leaves show severe midday depression of net assimilation rate (A)
   accelerated by patchy stomatal closure, although it is still unclear
   whether it always happens or not. We added the in situ observations at
   various meteorological conditions over the last decade to evaluate the
   frequency and environmental conditions of patchy stomatal closure in
   Dipterocarpus sublamellatus Foxw., an emergent tree with heterobaric
   leaves through leaf-gas exchange measurements combined with numerical
   simulations and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Our observation
   revealed that on days with moderate leaf temperature (<35 celcius) and
   vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which consist four of nine measurement
   days during 2003-2015, uniform stomatal behavior could explain observed
   A during the day. The patterns of stomatal behavior shifted from
   `uniform' to `patchy' even within a day depending on increases in leaf
   temperature and VPD according to irradiation of sunlight. However, it
   did not return from `patchy' to `uniform' once patchy stomatal closure
   happened in a day.},

Title = {Further food for thought: higher tropical mountains revisited once again},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {43-57},
Abstract = {D.H. Janzen argued that tropical mountains, for their heights, pose
   greater migration barriers than temperate mountains owing to lower
   temperature seasonality, and consequent greater niche and ecosystem
   specialization. These result in distinct altitudinal zonation under
   hardly varying temperature lapse rates. The Asian Far East alone
   provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis owing to latitudinal
   continuity of evergreen forests from equator to warm temperate zone.
   With data from four mountains, we find Janzen's hypothesis broadly
   correct. The primary and most consistent mediator of forest zonation and
   therefore species' habitat specificity is soil, itself indirectly
   mediated by climate. But declining habitat niche specificity does not
   proceed north along a continuum, instead in a series of latitudinal
   steps initiated by quite sudden habitat changes. Tropical montane
   forests are altitudinally floristically and structurally zoned by
   factors only indirectly mediated by temperature. Equatorial forests
   experience continuously wet climates and a frost line at c.4100 m. North
   of 8 degrees N, temperature and rainfall seasonality increases and
   winter air frosts descend to c.2000 m. Upper montane forest becomes
   truncated, while lower montane forest continues to the frost line which
   remains constant in moist climates. The margin of the wet tropics is
   pushed north to 27 degrees N by the Himalaya. Annual frost at c.2000 m
   here marks a narrow ecotone between tropical lower montane forest and
   warm temperate evergreen lucidophyll forest, a formation unique to east
   Asia. In equably moist South China, the lowland tropical-warm temperate
   ('subtropical') margin returns to the Tropic of Cancer and appears to be
   narrow at all altitudes. The temperate forests exhibit less distinct and
   inconsistent altitudinal zonation, instead manifesting an altitudinal
   floristic and structural continuum mediated by winter frost frequency
   and intensity.},

Title = {Socio economical evaluation of Uncaria gambir cultivation systems in
   West Sumatra, Indonesia},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {77-87},
Abstract = {Uncaria gambir (Ug) is the main ingredient for producing Gambir which is
   an international trading commodity that Indonesia has shared its
   production of 80\% in the world. This paper investigates the type of Ug
   cultivation system in West Sumatra and its contribution to farmers'
   income security. Rapid rural appraisal was used for collecting data.
   Economic analysis is carried out consisting of Benefit and Cost ratio
   (B/C Ratio), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR),
   sensitivity test on the discount rate and Gambir production. Six Ug
   cultivation systems were found, namely Ug-Mono, Ug-Rubber, and Ug-Areca
   nut in Lima Puluh Kota regency (LPKR) and in Pesisir Selatan regency
   (PSR) Ug-Durian, Ug-Durian-Jengkol and Ug-Durian-Petai. In general, The
   Ug cultivation systems combined with Durian and Jengkol or Petai, that
   were found valuable additional crops, were more stable in income
   generation against to the fluctuation of Ug production and Gambir price.
   Among the six, the highest B/C Ratio was found in Ug-Durian-Jengkol
   (2.8) while the lowest was in Ug-Mono and Ug-Rubber (1.9). Moreover,
   Ug-Durian-Jengkol show better NPV and IRR in the most conditions of
   Gambir price from 10,000 to 100,000 Rp kg(-1) as well as Gambir
   production from 2,400 to 4,800 kg y(-1). On the other hand, NPV and IRR
   of Ug-Mono, -Rubber or -Areca nut systems sharply decreased with the
   decrease of Gambir price. These systems relied more on Ug production and
   Gambir price in the income generation. It exhibited the vulnerability of
   income structure of these systems. From the results, to secure farmers'
   income from volatility of Ug production and Gambir price, this research
   suggested Ug cultivation systems combining with durian or other
   profitable cash crops in West Sumatra.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {81-97},
Abstract = {Twenty years of long-term maize monoculture that began in the 1990s have
   resulted in the heavily maize-dependent economy of the northwestern
   mountainous region of Vietnam, especially in Yen Chau, the core
   production area. Before 2014, maize accounted for over 70\% of the
   agricultural area. The continuous decrease in maize production value has
   strongly affected the Tai Dam community in Yen Chau and led to the
   replacement of various livelihood activities. This contributed to a
   major shrinkage of the maize area by 28.2\% by the end of 2017. This
   study aims to investigate the determinants of the rapid development of
   different livelihood trends in Lac Ken, Suoi Bun, and Luong Me villages.
   A detailed social and statistical investigation was conducted of 198
   households in 2016 and 220 households in 2017. The findings of this
   study indicate that small differences in cultivated land areas and
   infrastructure facilities have fostered the formation of and changes in
   livelihood structures. The areal withdrawal of maize occurred
   concurrently with the increasing trend of fruit tree and sugarcane
   cultivation. Never-before-seen migrant work unexpectedly became a
   promising livelihood activity for local farmers. Differences in internal
   and external forces are believed to be the driving factors behind the
   new forms of livelihood activities.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal and geographic variations in the green moisture content and

   models for three bamboo species (Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C.,
   Bambusa maculata Widjaja, and Gigantochloa atter (Hassk) Kurz ex Munro)
   naturally grown in four locations in Lombok Island, Indonesia. The mean
   green moisture contents and basic densities were 74.2\% and 0.69 g
   cm(-3) for B. vulgaris. 78.5 \% and 0.65 g cm(-3) for B. maculata, and
   80.3 \% and 0.65 g cm(-3) for G. atter, respectively. No significant
   differences in green moisture content and basic density were found among
   the species. A significant negative correlation between basic density
   and green moisture content was found in all three species. Based on the
   results of model selections for longitudinal variations, the green
   moisture content decreased with an increase in the culm height in all
   three species, and basic density tended to increase from the base to the
   top of the culm. Relatively large geographical variation was found in
   the green moisture content and basic density of G. atter. although the
   main reasons for variation of these properties were individual culm in
   three species.},

   National Park, Peninsular Malaysia},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {23-37},
Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are crucial for conserving biodiversity, but there
   is controversy over whether they effectively reduce deforestation
   because, for many of the PAs evaluated to date, pressure from
   deforestation occurred both inside the PAs and in the areas surroundings
   them. This is especially the case for tropical PAs in Southeast Asia. We
   examined the impact of a protected area on tropical rainforests inside
   and surrounding Endau-Rompin National Park (ERNP) in southern Peninsular
   Malaysia by mapping and analyzing forest cover changes and fragmentation
   between 1992 and 2016. The results showed that the forests inside ERNP
   were well protected, but greater forest loss and fragmentation were
   found surrounding ERNP, especially beyond the 10-km buffer zone of the
   park, due to large-scale agricultural land conversion, particularly for
   oil palm plantation. The deforestation rate in areas surrounding PAs in
   the region increased from 250 ha yr(-1) during 1992-2007 to 1,700 ha
   yr(-1) during 2012-2016. In the buffer zone (BZ), the deforestation rate
   was extremely high during 2007-2012 at 1,800 ha yr(-1), but decreased to
   440 ha yr(-1)' during 2012 2016. This suggests that in this region, PAs
   might be ineffective against deforestation in their surrounding areas.
   Continual deforestation and fragmentation are expected to occur
   surrounding ERNP, threatening its protected boundary. These activities
   may reduce the effectiveness of ERNP for wildlife habitat conservation.},

Title = {Immigration and adaptation of the Iban from rural to urban outskirts in
   Sarawak, Malaysia},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {39-48},
Abstract = {This paper aims at clarifying how immigrants from rural areas use the
   outskirts of Bintulu City in Sarawak, Malaysia and form places of
   residence there. The area under tropical rain forest climate conditions
   in Southeast Asia generally has a sparse population. In recent decades,
   urban areas have started to grow rapidly. In the state of Sarawak, urban
   areas have developed, and the formation of squatter areas by immigrants
   from rural areas has been reported. Until a few decades ago, after
   leaving urban areas, the landscape immediately changed from an urban
   landscape into a rural one consisting mainly of forests, dotted with
   swidden farms and longhouses. Recently, however, in areas such as those
   after leaving the urban area (urban outskirts) of Bintulu City, in
   addition to shops and off ices managed by the Chinese, longhouse
   communities (LHCs) formed by immigrants from rural areas are densely
   dotted. In such LHCs, dwellings and ways of living are observed to have
   different characteristics from those in rural LHCs and squatter areas in
   urban areas. Characteristics of LHCs in urban outskirts are shown below.
   Regarding land acquisition, the land was in most cases purchased from
   former occupants. Regarding members of the LHCs, in LHCs formed before
   the 1960s, many males married in and households moved in around the
   1970s and 1980s. On the other hand, in newly formed LHCs, in many cases
   no kinship links or very weak kinship links between households are
   observed. Regarding livelihoods, many members of LHCs work in the urban
   area, while some who own land cultivate cash crops such as oil palm.
   Suburban formation has begun as a mix of such LHCs, Chinese shops and
   offices, and forests in the study area.},

Abstract = {Community forests in Indonesia are important suppliers of wood resources
   for the wood industry. In the present study, stress-wave velocity of
   stems, log characteristics (taper, green density, and dynamic Young's
   modulus), and wood properties (basic density, compressive strength
   parallel to grain, modulus of elasticity {[}MOE], and modulus of rupture
   {[}MOE] were investigated for three fast-growing tree species grown in
   community forests in Indonesia: Acacia mangium Willd., Maesopsis eminii
   Engl., and Melia azedarach L. Based on the bending properties, the MOE
   values of laminae (30 x 150 mm in cross-section) and glulam (six layers,
   90 x 150 mm in cross-section) were simulated. The mean values of
   simulated MOE in the laminae were 8.93, 6.82. and 8.63 GPa for A.
   mangium, M. en:ink and M. azedarach. respectively. When the laminae from
   a species were randomly laminated, the simulated MOE values of glulam
   were 8.94, 6.82, and 8.66 GPa for A. mangium, M. eminii, and M.
   azedarach, respectively. When laminae with a high, medium, and low MOE
   were laminated at outer, middle, and inner layers of glulam,
   respectively, the simulated MOE values of glulam increased by about 5 \%
   to 15 \% compared to the values of a randomly laminated one. It is
   concluded that glulam with a high MOE can be produced from fast-growing
   tree species grown in community forests in Indonesia.},

Title = {Artificial shade shelters mitigate harsh microclimate conditions and
   enhance growth in tropical tree seedlings planted in degraded land},
Journal = {TROPICS},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {We evaluate the efficacy of artificial shade shelters in promoting
   seedling growth and ecophysiological traits in degraded tropical forest
   land. Seedlings of Dyera costulata were planted in an open control plot
   and two open-top shade shelters (2 and 3 m in height). Leaf traits,
   including nitrogen content, the ratio of variable to maximum
   fluorescence (Fv/Fm), and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were assessed
   in the nursery prior to planting, and again at 2, 7, 12, and 16 months
   after planting. Seedling height, diameter, biomass, and leaf number were
   also assessed. Shade shelters reduced light intensity to approximately
   70 \% and maximum temperature by up to 3.1 degrees C. Minimum daily air
   humidity was up to 12 \% higher in the shelters relative to the open
   control. Seedling growth was better under both shelters relative to the
   open control, but particularly for the 2 m shelter. Seedlings planted in
   the open lost roughly half their leaves immediately after planting due
   to environmental stress, whereas leaves were retained by seedlings under
   the shelters. A decrease in the Fv/Fm ratio was observed in the open
   control both 2 and 7 months after planting, indicating photoinhibition.
   The maximum photosynthetic rate decreased in all conditions immediately
   after planting, but seedlings under the shelters recovered faster,
   especially in the 2 m shelter. Decreases in leaf number and
   photosynthetic capability in the initial stages following planting may
   limit seedling growth in open conditions. The improved growth and
   ecophysiological parameters under the shelters persisted for up to 16
   months after planting, indicating that shelters may be valuable tools
   for reforestation and rehabilitation in degraded tropical forests.},

Title = {Smallholder's labor allocation for livelihood diversification: A case
   study in an upland village in northern Laos},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {9-24},
Abstract = {Livelihood diversification involves the well-characterized strategies of
   smallholder farmers to combine risk aversion under a market economy.
   Since livelihood diversification studies have focused on diversifying
   income sources to include non-farm and off-farm income, the benefit of
   adding subsistence-oriented farming to the livelihood portfolio has been
   underestimated. This form of livelihood diversification is broadly
   observable in Southeast Asia, and could be another risk aversion
   strategy to cope with unpredictable market conditions. This study
   examined the role of swidden farming in livelihood diversification
   through the analysis of individuals' labor allocation in livelihood
   portfolio, annual working hours, and seasonal changes in working hours
   in a village in northern Laos. Information was obtained through direct
   interviews with 133 individuals. Interviews were conducted in 2017 and
   gathered information on demographic features, economic activities, and
   monthly working hours for individual in 2016. The results indicated: 1)
   Individual's livelihood portfolio was determined by the assets that the
   ethnic group and each household held to a large extent; 2) Livelihood
   diversification took place at the individual level rather than at
   household level, through an increase in annual working hours, as well as
   monthly working hours during the peak period of labor demand; and 3)
   Labor demand for swidden farming was moderate, so villagers can
   incorporate it into their livelihood portfolio. The study highlighted
   that flexibility would be another facet of livelihood diversification.
   Swidden farming was likely to play a pivotal role in its flexibility,
   but it was not important as an income source.},

Title = {Microbial nutrient limitation in tropical forest soils determined using
   the V-T model contradicts the traditional view that C is the major
   limiting element},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {59-63},
Abstract = {Traditionally, microbial activity in tropical forest soils has been
   thought to be limited predominantly by carbon (C) availability,
   prompting investigations of whether phosphorus (P) is a stronger
   limiting factor (next to C) than other nutrients. However, a recently
   developed enzyme vector model has sometimes shown that P or nitrogen
   (N), but not C, is the predominant limiting factor, likely due to biased
   C vs. N vs. P limitation thresholds. In the latest update of this
   approach (the V-T model) this problem was addressed by revising the
   threshold, or balance point, that represents the enzymatic ratio at
   which microbial metabolism is not limited by nutrients. However, it
   remains unclear whether results obtained using the V-T model are
   consistent with the traditional view that C is the predominant limiting
   element for soil microbial activity. In this short note, I analyzed the
   microbial resource limitations of tropical forest soils using the V-T
   model approach based on previously published global data, and discussed
   the consistency of the results with the traditional view. The V-T model
   results showed that up to 78 \% of the data indicated that P, and not C,
   was the limiting element, contradicting the traditional view. This
   finding may have been the result of a bias in the balance point toward C
   limitation (i.e., the balance point, or threshold, used for determining
   microbial nutrient limitation is under C-limited condition, rather than
   under no nutrient limitation), resulting in underestimation of C
   limitation. The present study suggest that the V-T model requires
   further improvement; however, the traditional view of C limitation of
   soil microbial activity is also poorly supported, and further direct
   observation is needed.},

Abstract = {A new Rafflesia population was found in Naha Jaley, Sarawak. in 2012.
   This study aimed to identify this Rafflesia species and investigate its
   bud growth. First, we described the flower characteristics and compared
   them with Rafflesia keithii and R. tucm-mudae, which are candidate
   species for the flower. Also, we investigated the phylogenetic position
   of this Refflesia within Rafflesiaceae using DNA analysis. To estimate
   bud growth curve, we observed bud development from April 2013 to
   November 2013 in the field. Based on morphological comparisons and
   phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed the newly discovered population of
   the Rafflesia at Naha Jaley was R. turn-mudae, which is the new locality
   of the species at the most Eastern side of the known distribution for
   this species. The results indicated that absolute growth rate was
   greater in larger buds. We also estimated that it took a year to bloom
   from the initial bud stage. The mortality in one of our sites was very
   high, with more than 80 \% of buds dead prior to flower opening. This
   flower would be vulnerable to extinction due to their extraordinary
   characteristics and anthropogenetic effects. Finally. we discussed how
   Rafflesia populations in Naha Jaley can be conserved both in-situ and
   ex-situ.},

Abstract = {In the mountainous areas of northern Thailand, a tea agroforestry system
   referred to as the ``miang tea garden{''} has been maintained by
   smallholders for more than a hundred years. To discuss the ecological
   advantages of the miang tea garden system, we determined the spatial
   distribution patterns of these gardens and the relationship between
   shade trees and tea trees, emphasizing their aboveground biomass. We
   developed an allometric model for estimating the aboveground biomass of
   the stool-shaped tea trees. The area utilized for tea tree cultivation
   was approximately 72 \% of the total study area, and the remaining 28 \%
   was classified as forest patches or abandoned gardens. In miang tea
   gardens, trees other than tea trees were used by farmers to moderate the
   amount of sunlight reaching the tea leaves. Additionally, these trees
   ensured an alternative source of income for the farmers. However, we
   suggest that the canopy openness should be maintained at more than 25 \%
   to prevent tea leaf growth inhibition. The carbon content in the miang
   tea garden system was 45.51 +/- 21.68 Mg C ha(-1), considerably higher
   than that in other types of upland agriculture. The miang tea garden
   could represent an efficient land-use system supporting sustainable
   economic activities in areas with geographical limitations for the
   cultivation of other crops.},

   elution from mangrove ecosystems},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Iron solubilization in mangrove soils associated with polyphenols
   leached out from leaf-litter can improve iron bioavailability. In this
   context, the leaf-removing process by mangrove crabs would increase
   reacting frequency of the polyphenols in mangrove leaves with iron in
   the soils. In this study, we investigated ecological roles of a
   leaf-removing crab, Neosarmatium smithi, on the iron solubilization
   process. After the fallen leaves carried by the crabs to their burrows
   and eaten by them, polyphenols may be remained in their feces. If so,
   contact of polyphenols in the feces with mangrove soils could promote
   elution of dissolved iron from the soils. In order to demonstrate this
   hypothesis, we firstly surveyed the appearance ratio of the black part
   in crab burrows and measured total phenolic content in feces of N.
   smithi as well as in the black part soil. Then, we examined influences
   of the crab feces on dissolved iron elution from mangrove soils. As the
   results, the appearance ratio of the black part in the burrow was 67\%
   and the phenolic content in the feces, the black part, and the yellow

   was 0.65 mu g g(-1) and this content was 4.5 times higher than the

   iron reduction and chelating properties.},

Abstract = {Biological control of pests aims at lowering population levels of pest
   species by favouring natural enemies, in order to reduce the use of
   pesticides. The movement behaviour of natural enemies is decisive in the
   success of biological control: when low habitat quality hinders the
   diffusion of natural enemies from the border, the density of natural
   enemies may frequently be heterogeneous inside agricultural plots.
   We hypothesise that the specific relationship between habitat quality
   and movement behaviour may allow the improvement of biological control
   by means of a careful allocation of habitat qualities inside and around
   the plot.
   We used three tested individual-based movement models, with different
   levels of complexity ranging from simple cell-to-cell movements to
   complex strategies including the sinuosity of the path, boundary
   crossings, perceptual range, and directional persistence. We used the
   models to explore how the manipulation of habitat quality may allow
   significant improvements to the residence time of natural enemies inside
   the field. We suggest that existing field designs are generally
   inadequate to retain natural enemies. Mechanistic explanations leading
   to the highest and lowest residence times are used to draw specific
   management recommendations.},

Title = {Ecological niche and potential geographic distributions of Dermacentor

Abstract = {Dermacentor marginatus is a vector disease of both humans and animals
   and transmits the causative agents of Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) and
   the spotted fever group (Rickettsia raoultii and R. slovaca), as well as
   of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Dermacentor reticulatus can transmit
   various pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Babesia spp., tick
   encephalitis virus, Coxiella burnetii, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, and
   Rickettsia spp. and can cause serious skin lesions. Herein, ecological
   niche modeling (ENM) is used to characterize the niches of these two
   ticks and describe their potential distributional patterns under both
   current and future climate conditions, as a means of highlighting
   geographic distributional shifts that may be of public health
   importance. We assessed distributional implications of five general
   circulation models (GCMs), under two shared socioeconomic pathways
   (SSP245 and SSP585) for the period 2041-2060. Predictions for D.
   marginatus showed broad suitable areas across western, central, and
   southern Europe, with potential for expansion in northern and eastern
   Europe. Dermacentor reticulatus has suitable areas across western,
   central, and northern Europe. Under future scenarios, new expansions
   were observed in parts of northern and eastern Europe and highland areas
   in central Europe. Despite broad overlap between the niches of the
   ticks, D. marginatus has a broader niche, which allows it to show
   greater stability in the face of the changing climate conditions. Areas
   of potential geographic distributional expansion for these species
   should be monitored for actual distributional shifts, which may have
   implications for public health in those regions.},

Abstract = {Traditionally managed mountain grasslands are biodiversity hotspots in
   central Europe. However, socio-economic trends in agriculture during the
   last decades have changed farming practices, leaving steep and remote
   sites abandoned. Especially the abandonment of meadows is well known to
   directly affect plant and insect diversity. However, not much is known
   about the effects on soil processes and soil biota. To assess this, we
   studied four extensively managed (mown once a year, no fertilization)
   and four abandoned (no mowing, no fertilization) semi-dry meadows in a
   mountain region in Austria. Plant species richness, plant cover, plant
   traits, plant biomass, litter decomposition (tea bag index), and
   earthworm species richness and density were assessed. Additionally, soil
   temperature, moisture and electrical conductivity were measured. Results
   showed that managed meadows contained more plant species than abandoned
   meadows (118 vs. 93 species, respectively). We also observed different
   plant species assemblages between the two management types. In managed
   meadows, hemirosette and ruderal plant species were more abundant, while
   more plant species without rosettes and a higher plant necromass were
   found in abandoned meadows. Additionally, decomposition rate was higher
   in abandoned meadows. There was a trend towards higher earthworm
   densities in managed meadows, but there was no difference in earthworm
   species richness. We conclude that meadow management has effects on both
   aboveground vegetation and belowground biota and processes. Both
   abandoned and extensively managed meadows were important to sustain
   overall biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the study region.},

Abstract = {The induction of biocrusts through inoculation-based techniques has
   gained increasing scientific attention in the last 2 decades due to its
   potential to address issues related to soil degradation and
   desertification. The technology has shown the most rapid advances in the
   use of biocrust organisms, particularly cyanobacteria and mosses, as
   inoculants and biocrust initiators. Cyanobacteria and mosses are
   poikilohydric organisms - i.e., desiccation-tolerant organisms capable
   of reactivating their metabolism upon rehydration - that can settle on
   bare soils in abiotically stressing habitats, provided that selected
   species are used and an appropriate and customized protocol is applied.
   The success of inoculation of cyanobacteria and mosses depends on the
   inoculant's physiology, but also on the ability of the practitioner to
   identify and control, with appropriate technical approaches in each case
   study, those environmental factors that most influence the inoculant
   settlement and its ability to develop biocrusts.
   This review illustrates the current knowledge and results of biocrust
   induction biotechnologies that use cyanobacteria or mosses as
   inoculants. At the same time, this review's purpose is to highlight the
   current technological gaps that hinder an efficient application of the
   technology in the field.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crust (BSC) is an essential part of arid and semiarid
   regions; however information concerning the spatial heterogeneity of the
   interactions between crust, plants and soil microbes is limited.
   Sampling was confined to an area either covered with Erica spp. shrubs
   interspaced by crust cover (Cladonia rangiformis) or uncovered by crust.
   Along a straight line of 100 cm from the base of the shrubs towards
   their periphery and at successive distances of 20 cm, soil samples were
   collected once. The biomass, the composition and the network of
   interactions among the members of the soil microbial communities as well
   as the activity of soil enzymes involved in the C, N and P cycle were
   estimated. Crust coverage exerted a significant allelopathic negative
   effect on soil microbial biomasses due to the leaching of lichen's
   antimicrobial substances. In contrast, the crust effect on enzyme
   activity was positive, probably due to the amelioration of soil abiotic
   conditions. The distance from the base of Erica spp. affected the total
   microbial and bacterial biomass, with lower values at the base of the
   shrubs. The composition of microbial communities between the different
   sampling points exhibited significant dissimilarities. Network analysis
   revealed that in uncrusted soils the most connected microbial network
   was at samples collected from a distance of > 60 cm (bare soils), while
   in crusted soils this was at samples collected at the base of shrubs. We
   concluded that microbial biomass showed limited response to spatial
   heterogeneity, while the composition and the topology of interactions
   among the microbial members reflected a heterogeneous soil environment
   existing on a small spatial scale in Mediterranean areas. The microbial
   community in bare soil appeared to be the most robust against future
   disturbances.},

Title = {Ecological correlates of crop yield growth and interannual yield

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-43},

Abstract = {Artificial selection and genetic engineering plus an expanding
   repertoire and use of agrochemical inputs have allowed a rapid and
   continuous increase in crop yield (i.e., volume production per unit
   area) over the last century, which is needed to fulfill food demands
   from a growing human population. However, the first signs of yield
   deceleration and stagnation have already been reported for some globally
   important crops. Therefore, the study of the drivers of yield growth and
   its variation is essential for directing research and policies aiming at
   ensuring food security in the forthcoming years. We used data on mean
   and variability in annual yield growth for 107 globally important crops
   to assess the role of environmental (i.e., climatic region) and plant
   intrinsic traits (i.e., type of harvested organ, pollinator dependence,
   and life form) as drivers of change in yield growth and its stability.
   We applied a comparative approach to control for biases associated with
   phylogenetic non-independence among crops, an approach rarely used in
   agronomic studies. Average yield growth and its variation were not
   phylogenetically structured. Yield growth decreased with increasing
   pollinator dependence in tree crops but not in herbaceous and shrubby
   crops. Interannual yield variation tended to increase with increasing
   pollinator dependence, and it was higher in crops from temperate
   regions, in those cultivated for their reproductive organs, and in tree
   and shrubby crops as compared with herbaceous ones. Information on
   ecological correlates of crop yield growth and interannual yield
   variation can be used in the design of more sustainable and diversified
   agriculture schemes.},

Title = {Scientists' warning on endangered food webs},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {All organisms are ultimately dependent on a large diversity of
   consumptive and non-consumptive interactions established with other
   organisms, forming an intricate web of interdependencies. In 1992, when
   1700 concerned scientists issued the first ``World Scientists' Warning
   to Humanity{''}, our understanding of such interaction networks was
   still in its infancy. By simultaneously considering the species (nodes)
   and the links that glue them together into functional communities, the
   study of modern food webs - or more generally ecological networks - has
   brought us closer to a predictive community ecology. Scientists have now
   observed, manipulated, and modelled the assembly and the collapse of
   food webs under various global change stressors and identified common
   patterns. Most stressors, such as increasing temperature, biological
   invasions, biodiversity loss, habitat fragmentation, over-exploitation,
   have been shown to simplify food webs by concentrating energy flow along
   fewer pathways, threatening long-term community persistence. More
   worryingly, it has been shown that communities can abruptly change from
   highly diverse to simplified stable states with little or no warning.
   Altogether, evidence shows that apart from the challenge of tackling
   climate change and hampering the extinction of threatened species, we
   need urgent action to tackle large-scale biological change and
   specifically to protect food webs, as we are under the risk of pushing
   entire ecosystems outside their safe zones. At the same time, we need to
   gain a better understanding of the global-scale synergies and trade-offs
   between climate change and biological change. Here we highlight the most
   pressing challenges for the conservation of natural food webs and recent
   advances that might help us addressing such challenges.},

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of urban environments invariably presents a novel
   series of pressures on wildlife due to changes in external environmental
   factors. In reptiles, any such changes in temperature are critical since
   thermoregulation is the key driver in the function of many physiological
   processes. How reptiles adapt to such changes may vary from those
   species that are impacted negatively to others that have the behavioural
   flexibility to exploit new conditions. In this paper we describe retreat
   site selection, movements and aspects of the thermal ecology of the
   African lizard Agama agama in urban environments of West Africa. In
   early evening lizards began movement from late-afternoon core activity
   areas and ascended the walls of houses for overnight retreats. A high
   proportion retreated to locations in groups under or on top of warm
   electrical panels. The thermal potential these panels offered was the
   attainment of body temperatures equal to or higher than the minimum
   preferred body temperature (PBT approximate to 36 degrees C in A. agama)
   and hence increased physiological performance. The lizards that took
   advantage of the heat sources travelled further each day to and from
   diurnal activity areas than individuals that spent the night high on
   walls but not next to heat panels. There were both potential costs
   (enhanced predation pressures) and benefits (impacts on thermal ecology,
   retreat site selection) of this behaviour for lizards living in urban
   environments.},

Abstract = {Lunar phases remarkably influence the circadian cycle of living beings.
   Early amphibian studies date back to the 1960s, but only recently has
   more research been conducted in this field. Much still needs to be
   understood to establish the behavioral pattern of this group according
   to the synodic cycle. In the present study, we sought to determine (i)
   whether the vocalization activity was influenced by the lunar phases and
   (ii) whether the influence was species-specific or affects the community
   with equal intensity. We expected a great diversity of behaviors and
   adaptations. Rayleigh's test was used to verify whether the sample
   differs significantly from the null hypothesis; Rao's test was used to
   check sample size sufficiency; and the Kiviat diagram was used to
   evaluate the activity of the species in relation to the complete synodic
   cycle. We have observed 1691 individuals of 37 species over 882 d. The
   lunar cycle influenced 78 \% of the species, with 32 \% preferring the
   lower-albedo phases. The activity pattern of each species was
   established. These results suggest that the lunar phases influence the
   vocalization activity of most species. Therefore, there is a general
   pattern of activity related to the synodic cycles; however, the
   specificities still need to be better understood.},

Abstract = {Forest-steppe habitats in central Hungary have contrasting canopy
   structure with strong influence on the spatiotemporal variability of
   ecosystem functions. Canopy differences also co-vary with terrain
   feature effects, hampering the detection of key drivers of carbon
   cycling in this threatened habitat. We carried out seasonal measurements
   of ecosystem functions (soil respiration and leaf area index),
   microclimate and soil variables as well as terrain features along
   transects for 3 years in poplar groves and the surrounding grasslands.
   We found that the terrain features and the canopy differences
   co-varyingly affected the abiotic and biotic factors of this habitat.
   Topography had an effect on the spatial distribution of soil organic
   carbon content. Canopy structure had a strong modifying effect through
   allocation patterns and microclimatic conditions, both affecting soil
   respiration rates. Due to the vegetation structure difference between
   the groves and grasslands, spatial functional diversity was observed. We
   found notably different conditions under the groves with high soil
   respiration, soil water content and leaf area index; in contrast, on the
   grasslands (especially in E-SE-S directions from the trees) soil
   temperature and vapor pressure deficit showed high values. Processes of
   aridification due to climate change threaten these habitats and may
   cause reduction in the amount and extent of forest patches and decrease
   in landscape diversity. Owing to habitat loss, reduction in carbon stock
   may occur, which in turn has a significant impact on the local and
   global carbon cycles.},

Abstract = {Close-to-nature management (CTNM) has been proposed as a promising
   forestry management approach to improve the structure and quality of
   forests, which integrates wood production and ecological service
   functions. Research on the effect of CTNM on the univariate and
   bivariate distribution of the spatial structure of forest stands
   provides a scientific basis for the evaluation of CTNM implemented in
   forestry. Here, we analyzed and compared the spatial-structure
   characteristics of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) plantations (young,
   middle-age, and near-mature stages) under CTNM 8 years after selective
   cutting and unmanaged control. We used univariate and bivariate
   distribution of three spatial-structure parameters: mingling (M),
   dominance (U), and uniform-angle index (W). Results showed that the
   effect of CTNM on spatial structure was more remarkable in middle-aged
   and near-mature Masson pine forests compared with the young forest. CTNM
   significantly improved mingling degree and promoted the horizontal
   distribution, thereby changing from a cluster to a random distribution.
   Moreover, CTNM improved the proportion of trees with a high mixing
   degree and random distribution and the proportion of trees having a
   micro-structure of random distribution with a high degree of mixture and
   dominance with a high degree of mixture in middle-aged and near-mature
   Masson pine forest. Overall, the implementation of CTNM 8 years ago
   showed a positive effect on the improvement of the spatial structure of
   Masson pine forest, but the present spatial structure is suboptimal.
   Further implementation of CTNM to adjust the mingling and uniform-angle
   index is necessary, and CTNM according to this method of frequency
   distribution of stand structure parameters can improve the success of
   forest management.},

Title = {Carbon cycle in tropical upland ecosystems: a global review},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-136},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Along with habitat transformation, climate change has profound impacts
   on biodiversity and may alter ecosystem services on which human welfare
   depends. Many studies of the carbon cycle have focused on lowland
   tropical forests; however, upland forests have been less explored
   despite their pivotal role in carbon sequestration. Here, I synthesized
   the state of knowledge on the allocation of carbon in its different
   stocks (aboveground, belowground, and soil) as well as in its main
   fluxes (plant decomposition, respiration, and litterfall) in tropical
   upland ecosystems of the planet. In November 2020, a systematic review
   was carried out to identify references published from 2000 to 2020
   through a combination of key terms in Google Scholar and Scopus
   databases, thus analysing bibliographic, geographical, methodological,
   and carbon cycling information of the global upland tropics (between
   23.5 degrees N-23.5 degrees S). After analysing a total of 1967
   references according to inclusion-exclusion criteria, 135 references
   published in the last 20 years were selected. Most of the studies were
   conducted in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest of
   South America. The main factors studied were elevation and forest type.
   Forest structure and soil variables were largely associated when
   studying carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Estimations of carbon
   stocks comprised three-fourths of the total studies, while the remaining
   fraction focused on carbon fluxes. Aboveground biomass and carbon in
   soils were highly investigated, while plant decomposition and
   respiration were the components that received the least attention. Even
   though in the last 20 years there was a slight increase in the number of
   studies on carbon cycle in tropical upland forests, I found bias
   associated with the biomes and ecoregions studied (especially in the
   Andes). Elevation was the main factor examined but other essential
   aspects such as the successional gradient, landscape management,
   diversity- productivity relationship, faunal and microbial effect,
   trophic cascades, and Gadgil effect require more attention. The
   inclusion of different litter species and origins (i.e. roots and stems)
   and theoretical frameworks including home-field advantage,
   substrate-matrix interaction, and phenology-substrate match may provide
   explanatory mechanisms to better understand litter decomposition over
   these forests. Despite respiration being a paramount link that is
   closely tied to above- and belowground compartment, this flux
   constitutes one of the important gaps to fulfil in future research. For
   a comprehensive understanding of the carbon cycle in upland forests, it
   is necessary to obtain information on its main fluxes and integrate them
   into climate change mitigation plans.},

Abstract = {We used a large dataset of greater flamingo chicks banded and measured
   at Camargue, France, to verify the applicability of discriminant
   function analysis to sex this species. Males and females sexed
   genetically differed significantly in all of the morphological
   characters measured (body mass, tarsus and wing length), with males
   being significantly larger than females. Although the discriminant rate
   varied substantially from one year to another, we found that it
   increased with the sample size of genetically sexed individuals. Our
   results suggest that discriminant function analysis (DFA) does not
   provide an efficient tool to sex greater flamingo chicks as these
   relationship are highly variable across years, requiring the genetic
   determination of sex on a large number of individuals every year for
   calibrating the DFA and still providing an overall low accuracy in sex
   determination. Indeed, conditions at breeding seasons can vary between
   years and can be considered proximate causes affecting the correct
   discriminant rate. Like previous studies, we recommend caution in
   dealing with discriminant equations computed from small datasets, and
   our simulation suggests that 325 genetically sexed individuals are
   needed to obtain 80 \% correctly classified greater flamingo chicks.},

Abstract = {In an era of environmental crises, conservation and management
   strategies need a new generation of applied ecologists. Here, we
   stimulate the next-generation applied ecologists to acquire a pragmatic
   mentality of problems solvers in real contexts, using the wide arsenal
   of concepts, approaches and techniques available in the project
   management (PM) arena using a road map based on the main steps of
   conservation project cycle. The acquisition of the conceptual and
   operational framework of PM can allow the next-generation applied
   ecologists to take on a more important role in nature conservation
   strategies: from data samplers, analyzers and interpreters to suppliers
   of solutions and decisions driving changes in species' targets
   inhabiting real contexts. Since the high number of applied ecologists,
   this change in approach (from analytical to operational) could make the
   difference in conservation science. We also provided, as a conceptual
   framework, a set of suggestions and approaches useful to facilitate this
   change.},

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {In the quest to understand how biotic interactions respond to climate
   change, one area that remains poorly explored is how interactions
   involving organisms other than vascular plants will respond. However the
   interactions between plants and biological soil crusts (BSCs) are
   relevant in many ecosystems and they will likely respond uniquely to
   climate change. Simultaneous considerations of both plant-plant and
   plant-BSC interactions may substantially improve our understanding of
   this topic. The aim of this study is to assess whether water
   availability differentially affects the biotic effects of BSCs and
   pioneer shrubs on the early life-history stage of tree seedling growth.
   We conducted a greenhouse factorial experiment with soil surface cover
   (bare soil, soil covered by a creeping shrub and BSC covered soil) and
   water regime (control and drought) as factors. We monitored Nothofagus
   pumilio (a native tree species of ecological and economic relevance)
   seedling water status and growth as well as changes in soil water
   content and soil properties. The shrub cover had a positive effect on
   soil water conservation and on the water balance of seedlings under
   water stress. However, its effect was negative for seedling growth under
   both water conditions. The BSC also contributed to soil water
   conservation and apparently added nutrients to the soil. The net effect
   of the BSC on seedling growth was negative under full-watering
   conditions but positive under water stress conditions. This result
   highlights how the studied biotic interactions, and especially
   interactions involving BSCs, depend on changes in water availability.},

Abstract = {Neutral landscape models based on fractal algorithms are used widely by
   landscape ecologists. Perlin noise is a spectral synthesis algorithm
   that has not been widely adopted by landscape ecologists, even though
   the hierarchical properties of Perlin noise are particularly relevant to
   landscape ecology. To encourage the use of Perlin noise, I provide an
   explanation of the algorithm in the context of neutral landscape models
   to demonstrate that the hierarchical nature of the algorithm not only
   allows for a wide range of possible spatial patterns to be produced, but
   also usefully parallels theories about the hierarchical structure of
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Studies on ecological successions have a long tradition and have
   strongly contributed to the understanding of community assembly, niche
   theory, and ecosystem structure and functionality. Reports on ecological
   successions are however mostly restricted to one or two taxonomic
   groups, neglecting the mutual influences and dependencies between
   multiple taxonomic groups that are the building blocks of diverse
   communities. We introduce the Alpine research platform Odenwinkel to
   promote observational and experimental research on the emergence of
   multidiversity and ecosystem complexity. We established n = 140
   permanent plots along the successional gradient of the forefield of the
   Odenwinkelkees glacier at the end of the Stubachtal valley in the Hohe
   Tauern range (Hohe Tauern National Park, Land Salzburg, Austria). In
   summer 2019 we completed a first full inventory of biotic and abiotic
   characteristics of these plots covering the diversity and composition of
   vascular plants, bryophytes, arthropods, and other animals, bacteria and
   fungi as well as some geomorphologic properties. In this paper we
   introduce the design of the research platform and show first results.
   While focusing on the diversity and composition of vascular plants along
   the successional gradient, we also provide data on the diversity of
   animals, bacteria, and fungi. The Odenwinkel platform will be available
   as a long-term ecological research site where researchers from various
   disciplines can contribute to the accumulation of knowledge on
   ecological successions and on how interactions between various taxonomic
   groups structure ecological complexity in this Alpine environment.},

Abstract = {Overexploitation, habitat destruction and a changing climate threaten
   populations of the Roman snail (Helix pomatia Linnaeus, 1758), which has
   led to a high protection status in Germany. Vertebrate and invertebrate
   predators, including parasites and facultative parasitoids, further
   cause pressure on populations. Given the conservation concern for H.
   pomatia and its rarity in the study region (Cottbus, Germany), we
   studied how predators and facultative parasitoids utilize H. pomatia
   shells with a focus on non-invasive field methods. As previous studies
   indicated that shell size may affect prey selection by predators,
   morphometric traits were measured in eight subpopulations. We identified
   the total number and percentage of H. pomatia shells that showed
   external attack marks by predators and internal utilization marks by
   Diptera pupae and related those utilization patterns to the morphometric
   traits of shells. A large proportion of the shells in local
   subpopulations showed signs of external attack and internal utilization,
   and both utilization forms were positively correlated. External attacks
   by predators were more frequent in larger shells and internal
   utilization by Diptera was more common in shells with higher body
   density. These results suggest a considerable pressure by predators and
   potential facultative parasitoids on H. pomatia populations in the study
   area. Future research should focus on the relationship between snails
   from the family Helicidae and flies from the genus Discomyza.
   Conservation programmes should consider abiotic habitat conditions
   together with potential trophic interactions to maximize the success of
   conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {The study of the morphology of living organisms is essential to
   understand their evolution and diversity. This study aims to determine
   the importance of climatic gradients in the diversity of pollen
   morphotypes using Atriplex halimus L. (Amaranthaceae) as a model
   species. Atriplex halimus is a perennial shrubby plant, polymorphic and
   very resistant to severe environmental conditions. In seven bioclimatic
   zones, ranging from mesic conditions in the north to hot-hyperarid in
   the south, pollen samples were collected from 49 sites, with seven
   accessions per bioclimate. Under a light microscope, pollen grains were
   selected and analyzed from three anthers of different flowers. Besides
   the usual pollen grain types, some previously unknown morphotypes, such
   as sulcate, triangular, and ovoid, were observed and described at the
   different climatic zones. A total of 10 pollen grain shapes were
   quantified and discussed following their specific occurrences within
   different climatic zones. Occurrence frequencies of different pollen
   shapes ranged between 0\% and 85.7 \%, where the pantoporate spheroidal
   was the most widespread in all climatic zones, especially in the desert
   climate (85.7 \%). Five pollen types occurred exclusively once per
   climate zone. The pantoporate prolate spheroidal in mesomediterranean
   climate with a long dry season (28.6 \%), sulcate in the
   xerothermomediterranean climate (14.3\%), pantoporate subtriangular in
   the subdesert climate with a short dry season (14.3 \%), and pantoporate
   subprolate and boat-shaped in a subdesert climate with a long dry season
   with 14.3\% for each. Our findings help to understand the evolutionary
   effects of climate gradients on pollen morphology and variability in
   arid and desert areas and point towards a high degree of specialization
   in order to maximize trade-offs between pollination efficiency and
   protection of pollen grains from dehydration.},

Abstract = {On the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the growth of trees is strongly affected
   by climate change. Previous researchers have found that climate warming
   changes thermal and hydraulic conditions, lengthening the growing season
   and promoting tree growth. Some studies have analyzed the effects of
   drought, precipitation, and temperature on tree growth. However,
   previous studies have mainly focused on natural forests, with few
   studies on the response of plantations to climate change. Therefore, we
   studied the relationship between dendrochronology (basal area increment,
   BAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and climate factors
   to explore the response of Picea likiangensis var. rubescens plantations
   to climate change. The results showed that from 1990 to 2018, the
   temperature in the study area increased significantly; the rate of
   increase was 0.39 degrees per decade. Among the climate factors,
   self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) had the most
   significant impact on BAI. From P\_May (P\_represents the month of the
   previous year) to December, BAI was always negatively correlated with
   the scPDSI, with 9 months being significantly negatively correlated. BAI
   was significantly positively correlated with the minimum 2m temperature
   (TMN) in P\_July, P\_September, July, and September. BAI was
   significantly positively correlated with the maximum 2 m temperature
   (TMX) in P\_October, P\_December, and July. BAI was significantly
   positively correlated with the mean 2 m temperature (TMP) in P\_July,
   P\_December, and July. There is a significant positive correlation
   between BAI and annual NDVI (NDVIa), which means that NDVI can be used
   to study the response of plantations to climate change. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of the response of plantation
   growth in high-altitude areas to climate change, which is needed by
   forest managers.},

Title = {Models of poisoning effects on vulture populations show that small but

Abstract = {Vultures are among the most threatened avian taxa in the world. When
   vultures aggregate in large numbers to feed, poisoned carcasses can
   extirpate entire populations at once. In the light of shrinking numbers
   worldwide, restocking and reintroduction projects, where wild or
   captive-bred vultures are released back into nature, constitute a
   crucial management tool, successfully implemented in many countries.
   However, reestablishment of sustainable vulture populations to their
   historical ranges remains a serious challenge, especially if the threat
   of poisoning persists, which is usually the case. In this study, we
   model the outcome of a restocking project where an initial colony is
   subject to repeated poisoning events. We use as an example the isolated
   population of the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) in Cyprus. Mathematical
   considerations and model simulations show that the probability of colony
   persistence depends on the initial population size and the intensity and
   frequency of the poisoning incidents. This type of scenario creates an
   Allee effect that requires a colony to exceed a minimum size in order to
   survive. Also in this scenario, a sequence of small but frequent
   poisoning episodes is worse on average than a few large and rare ones of
   the same cumulative mortality. Future population reinforcement efforts
   for vultures should focus on the release of adult birds in adequate
   numbers for the successful establishment of sustainable colonies and
   should involve a reduction in small but persistent sources of mortality
   such as the poison baiting of small canids that until now has been
   neglected by conservation scientists.},

Abstract = {Globally, most bare-looking areas in dryland regions are covered by
   biocrusts which play a crucial role in modifying several soil surface
   properties and driving key ecosystem processes. These keystone
   communities face important threats (e.g. climate change) that place
   their conservation at risk and in turn the sustainability of the
   ecosystems they inhabit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop
   ecosystem management strategies to ensure their protection. However, to
   provide a solid path towards biocrust conservation, the understanding by
   stakeholders and governance structures of the ecological functions of
   these communities, their role as benefit providers, and the pressures
   threatening their important effects are indispensable. Whereas the
   ecological scope of biocrust has been widely studied in the last
   decades, the social dimension of their role remained unexplored. By
   reviewing literature in biocrusts from a social-ecological approach,
   here we identified knowledge gaps and new research areas that need to be
   addressed in order to produce scientific knowledge that better guides
   dryland conservation policies and actions. This research agenda is a
   prerequisite to advance biocrust conservation.},

Title = {Unassisted establishment of biological soil crusts on dryland road
   slopes},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-51},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Understanding patterns of habitat natural recovery after human-made
   disturbances is critical for the conservation of ecosystems under high
   environmental stress, such as drylands. In particular, the unassisted
   establishment of nonvascular plants such as biological soil crusts or
   biocrust communities (e.g., soil lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria) in
   newly formed habitats is not yet fully understood. However, the
   potential of biocrusts to improve soil structure and function at the
   early stages of succession and promote ecosystem recovery is enormous.
   In this study, we evaluated the capacity of lichen biocrusts to
   spontaneously establish and develop on road slopes in a Mediterranean
   shrubland. We also compared taxonomic and functional diversity of
   biocrusts between road slopes and natural habitats in the surroundings.
   Biocrust richness and cover, species composition, and functional
   structure were measured in 17 road slopes (nine roadcuts and eight
   embankments) along a 13 km highway stretch. Topography, soil properties
   and vascular plant communities of road slopes were also characterized.
   We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and applied redundancy analysis (RDA) to
   test the effect of environmental scenario (road slopes vs. natural
   habitat) and other local factors on biocrust features. We found that
   biocrusts were common in road slopes after similar to 20 years of
   construction with no human assistance needed. However, species richness
   and cover were still lower than in natural remnants. Also, functional
   structure was quite similar between roadcuts (i.e., after soil
   excavation) and natural remnants, and topography and soil properties
   influenced species composition while environmental scenario type and
   vascular plant cover did not. These findings further support the idea of
   biocrusts as promising restoration tools in drylands and confirm the
   critical role of edaphic factors in biocrust establishment and
   development in land-use change scenarios.},

Abstract = {In this work, populations of adult and immature honeybees and their
   honey production are studied through mathematical and statistical
   modeling approaches. Those models are complementary and are presented in
   disjunct form. They were used to show different modeling methods for
   honey bee population dynamics. The statistical approach consisted of a
   generalized linear model using data from the Department of Agriculture
   of the United States of America (USDA), which showed that the
   relationship between the number of colonies and the rate of honey
   production is not constant in time but decrease over the years. These
   models showed that when a bee population is subjected to a stress factor
   (i.e., habitat destruction, Varroa mite, climate variability, season,
   neonicotinoids, among others), the abundance of individuals decreases
   over time as well as the honey produced by the colonies. Finally, the
   mathematical approach consisted of two models: (1) a smooth model, in
   which conditions of existence and stability of the equilibrium solutions
   are determined by an ecological threshold value, and (2) a non-smooth
   model where the mortality rate of bees is included as a function of the
   number of adult bees in the population.},

Title = {When nature meets the divine: effect of prohibition regimes on the

   Greece},

Abstract = {Sacred forests are an integral component of the mountainous cultural
   landscape of northern Greece, hypothesized to be the result of both
   ecological processes and site-specific forest management regimes through
   strict religious prohibition. These practices acted as constraints on
   natural forest development by suppressing understory growth, while
   prohibition of woodcutting has preserved large trees. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the relative effects of physical site
   environment and management regimes on the structure and composition of
   woody plant groups in six such forests. Species rank-abundance curves,
   dissimilarity indices and cluster analyses were used to assess variation
   within and amongst the woody plant groups of the sites. Species
   abundance was found to be highly variable amongst the sites, with
   notable variation between canopy and understory layers indicating
   dynamic change in floristics and structure. Cluster analysis revealed
   four main woody plant groups statistically associated with environmental
   variables (aspect) and forest management (different forest prohibition
   regimes, and presence or absence of infrastructure). Our results
   indicate that tree composition is significantly associated with
   different prohibition regimes linked to the forests' sacred status, as
   well as the inherent environmental variation amongst sites. Exploring
   further the role of traditional management systems in shaping sacred
   forest structure is a relevant research path for designing effective
   conservation practices tailored to sacred natural sites facing cultural
   abandonment.},

Abstract = {One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in
   degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas
   without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to
   attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance
   seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of
   artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and
   composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien
   invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the
   bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used
   artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment
   (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at
   each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these
   and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside
   the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of
   focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total
   of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a
   significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial
   perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition
   increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An
   ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed
   communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive
   exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the
   third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from
   12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most
   represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures
   for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed
   species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly
   due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore,
   artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow
   area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of
   alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about
   overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the
   arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of
   birds in this process.},

Title = {Effects of management cessation on hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae)

Abstract = {Extensively managed grasslands, particularly in mountain regions, are
   considered to be one of the most diverse agroecosystems worldwide. Their
   decline due to land use abandonment affects the diversity of both plants
   and associated pollinators. Extensive grasslands constitute an important
   habitat type and food resource for hoverflies (syrphids); however, not
   much is known about the effects of abandonment on this important
   pollinator group. In the present study, we investigated how abandonment
   affects species richness and the composition of syrphids in mountainous
   meadows. We recorded the richness of vascular plants, vegetation cover,
   flower cover and the surrounding landscape to examine whether and how
   syrphids are affected by plant and landscape parameters. We investigated
   the species richness, abundance and species composition of syrphids by
   sweep netting and by using observation plots in 18 semidry meadows
   across two Austrian regions and one Swiss region. For each region, we
   selected three meadows abandoned for more than 20 years and three
   annually mown non-fertilized meadows. Abandonment or mowing had no
   significant effect on the total number of syrphid species or individuals
   or on the number of aphidophagous and non-aphidophagous species and
   individuals. However, the total number of species and the number of
   non-aphidophagous species significantly increased with the increasing
   number of plant species. The surrounding landscape and other plant
   parameters showed no association with the assessed syrphid parameters.
   Although syrphids were unaffected by abandonment, higher syrphid species
   numbers in response to a higher plant richness in annual mown meadows
   suggest that the management of mountain meadows is beneficial in
   preserving syrphid richness.},

Abstract = {Differences in food intake and morphological attributes may facilitate

   the possible differences in the feeding strategies of four species of
   curimatids that inhabit the floodplain of the central Amazon. For this,
   we determined the diet, daily food cycle, and whether characteristics of
   the intestine were related to the length of the fish and the amount of
   detritus consumed. The detritivory was confirmed, and we observed a
   difference in the foraging time between species. We found differences in
   the length and weight of the intestine and the relationship of these
   variables with the length of the fish and the amount of detritus
   consumed. Our study suggests that despite belonging to the same family
   and food group, curimatids have characteristics that allow them to
   consume the detritus in different ways.},

Title = {Invasiveness, ecological impacts and control of acacias in southwestern
   Europe - a review},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {33-51},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {The most prolific acacias in southern Europe (Acacia dealbata, A.
   melanoxylon and A. longifolia) are rapidly spreading in its westernmost
   area: Portugal and NW Spain, where congeners with invasion potential are
   already established. We performed a bibliographic search of acacia
   invasions in southern Europe and used spatial data on acacia
   distribution and abiotic parameters in Iberia to check the influence of
   abiotic factors on acacia invasion. According to our results, in Iberia
   A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon seem limited by high soil pH (pH(cacl2) >
   5.5), frequent frosts (> 21 to 40 d yr(-1)) and low annual precipitation
   (< 500 to 1000 mm); data were inconclusive for A. longifolia, while A.
   saligna prefers neutral soils in the driest and warmest areas. The
   percentage of area occupied by A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon increases
   significantly with the percentage of burnt surface. In the literature,
   acacias' invasiveness is usually attributed to their high resprouting
   and seeding capacity and to native exclusion through their allelopathic
   potential; symbiotic promiscuity with rhizobia; high environmental
   plasticity; and adaptation to burnt, cleared and resource-poor land.
   However, it is unknown how acacias became so invasive in western Iberia,
   where native Fabaceae shrubs with similar ecological traits (and
   invaders outside their natural range) are abundant. Invasive acacias can
   modify fire and water regimes, above-ground biodiversity, and topsoil
   characteristics (microbial communities, pH, organic matter and
   macronutrients levels); nevertheless, sound comparisons with mature
   stands of Iberian legumes for these and other soil properties (N fluxes,
   micronutrients) are lacking. As several acacias outcompete Iberian
   Fabaceae shrubs partly thanks to enemy release, the introduction of
   biocontrol agents (as for A. longifolia in Portugal) can be useful for
   invasion control.},

Title = {Components of standard metabolic rate variability in three species of
   gammarids},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Standard metabolic rate is a major functional trait with large
   inter-individual variability in many groups of aquatic species. Here we
   present results of an experimental study to address variation in
   standard metabolic rates, over different scales of organisation and
   environments, within a specific group of aquatic macro-invertebrates
   (i.e. gammarid amphipods) that represent the primary consumers in
   detritus food webs. The study was carried out using flow-through
   microrespirometric techniques on male specimens of three gammarid
   species from freshwater, transitional water and marine ecosystems. We
   examined individual metabolic rate variations at three scales: (1) at
   the individual level, during an 8 h period of daylight; (2) at the
   within-population level, along body-size and body-condition gradients;
   (3) at the interspecific level, across species occurring in the field in
   the three different categories of aquatic ecosystems, from freshwater to
   marine.
   We show that standard metabolic rates vary significantly at all three
   scales examined, with the highest variation observed at the
   within-population level. Variation in individual standard metabolic
   rates during the daylight hours was generally low (coefficient of
   variation, CV < 10\%) and unrelated to time. The average
   within-population CV ranged between 30.0 \% and 35.0 \%, with body size
   representing a significant source of overall inter-individual variation
   in the three species and individual body condition exerting only a
   marginal influence. In all species, the allometric equations were not as
   steep as would be expected from the 3/4 power law, with significant
   variation in mass-specific metabolic rates among populations. The
   population from the transitional water ecosystem had the highest
   mass-specific metabolic rates and the lowest within-population
   variation.
   In the gammarid species studied here, body-size-independent variations
   in standard individual metabolic rates were higher than those explained

Title = {Changes in the Cerrado vegetation structure: insights from more than

Abstract = {Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time.
   However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially
   woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to
   examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo
   Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32
   years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature
   surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the
   absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e.,
   grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby
   grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods
   (from 30.0\% to 0.0\% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from
   7.0\% in 1987 to 11.0\% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred
   within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse
   cerrado (from 34.2\% to 7.7 \%) and an increase in dense cerrado (from
   6.9\% to 39.8 \%). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied
   for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time
   (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/-
   0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss
   of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was
   the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such
   patterns are important to support plant management plans for the
   threatened Cerrado open plant formations.},

Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is both the main land use across drylands
   worldwide and a major desertification and global change driver. The
   ecological consequences of this key human activity have been studied for
   decades, and there is a wealth of information on its impacts on
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, most field assessments of
   the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have
   been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single
   ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa
   (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT
   survey, the first systematic field survey devoted to evaluating the
   joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the
   structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This
   collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and
   has involved the collection of field data and plant, biocrust, and soil
   samples from a total of 326 45 m x 45 m plots from 98 sites located in
   25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major
   characteristics and the field protocols used in this survey. We also
   introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful
   to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of
   researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the
   current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of
   grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of
   the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our
   planet using much-needed field data.},

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Climate change influences the global and regional distribution of many
   species. For thermophilic insects, range expansions towards the north
   and to higher elevations are expected in the course of climatic warming
   across the Northern Hemisphere. The distribution of the European mantis
   (Mantis religiosa) has recently expanded from Mediterranean regions in
   France to Hesse in central Germany. This is interpreted as a response to
   rising mean temperatures, and further northward expansion is expected to
   occur with increasing climate warming. In this study, potential changes
   in the regional distribution across Hesse were modeled for Mantis
   religiosa using the present distribution and climate across Europe as
   the baseline. We estimated potential changes in the regional
   distribution for two time periods until 2080 based on two climate change
   scenarios. The results showed that the current range of M. religiosa in
   Hesse is smaller than expected based on its climatic niche, i.e., the
   distribution is not in equilibrium with the present climate. With
   climate warming the model predicts an expansion of the potential
   distribution for the period 2041-2060. For the period 2061-2080, our
   model predicts, however, a range contraction in spite of continued
   warming. This unexpected result warrants further investigation in order
   to elucidate whether the ongoing climate change may have negative
   consequences for thermophilic species such as M. religiosa.},

Title = {Therophytic halophilous vegetation classification in South-Eastern Italy},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-209},
Abstract = {Aims: Halophilous, sub-halophilous, and halo-nitrophilous annual plant
   communities belonging to the Thero-Salicornietea and Saginetea maritimae
   classes have been analyzed in South-Eastern Italy. Even if numerous
   contributions have been provided on these vegetation types, at diverse
   scales of observation, the different and sometimes contrasting
   syntaxonomic treatments adopted by different authors, as well as the
   phytogeographical interpretations, have led to uncertainty about their
   proper classification and nomenclature. Methods: In the present
   contribution a data-set of 391 releves (230 from literature and 161
   original data) was first subjected to some basic statistics and then
   analyzed through flexible beta clustering. CH index was used to
   determine the best partition, and the phi coefficient for the
   identification of diagnostic species. Indirect gradient analysis was
   performed by DCA ordination. Results: Results were interpreted from a
   syntaxonomic point of view. As regards Thero-Salicornietea, halophilous
   communities are well separated from the halo-nitrophilous ones in the
   two orders Thero-Salicornietalia and Thero-Suaedetalia splendentis.
   Within Thero-Salicornietalia, a new alliance, Salicornion venetae,
   including the tetraploid Salicornia vegetation typically growing in long
   flooded sites of the Adriatic region, is here proposed. As for Saginetea
   maritimae, two main groups well separate: rocky coasts, sandy soils
   (Saginetalia maritimae, with the E-Mediterranean alliance Sileno
   sedoidis-Catapodion balearici) and salt marshes, clayey-silty soils
   (Frankenietalia pulverulentae, here with the two alliances Frankenion
   pulverulentae and Limonion avei).},

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Bombus terrestris is a European bumblebee extensively commercialized
   worldwide for crop pollination. In Chile, this species was introduced in
   1997 and after confinement escape, it has spread and established in
   several localities of central-southern Chile and in the Argentine
   Patagonia. The South American carpenter bee Xylocopa augusti, in turn,
   has been recently reported in central Chile, and as B. terrestris, this
   species has become increasingly common, often found in sympatry with B.
   terrestris in some localities. While intestinal parasites such as the
   flagellate trypanosome Crithidia bombi, the microsporidium Nosema bombi,
   and the neogregarine protozoan Apicystis bombi, show high levels of
   specialization on the Bombus genus, parasites often increase their host
   range, especially after invading novel habitats, hence creating new
   infection disease scenarios. In this work, we used molecular techniques
   to detect the presence of the intestinal pathogens of B. terrestris in
   coexisting X. augusti from different localities in the Metropolitan
   Region of Chile. Our results revealed the presence of the three
   pathogens in B. terrestris only, with population prevalence broadly
   similar to that reported in other studies. The carpenter bee X. augusti
   did not show evidence of any of the three parasites examined, indicating
   that this invader species is not recipient of any of the parasite
   species present in B. terrestris.},

Abstract = {Background Endophytic fungi are diverse and ubiquitous in nature, yet
   studies simultaneously comparing endophyte communities in above- and
   below-ground plant tissues are relatively scarce. The main goal of our
   study was to compare the diversity and community composition of
   endophytic fungi associated with above- and below-ground tissues of the
   plant Aristolochia chilensis in an arid ecosystem. Endophytic fungi were
   isolated from healthy leaves and roots of A. chilensis, and the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region was sequenced for phylogenetic and
   taxonomic analysis. Results A combined total of 457 fungal isolates were
   cultured from leaf and root tissues, belonging to 54 operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). The genera Fusarium, Penicillium, Phialemonium
   and Trichoderma were the most representative endophyte taxa identified
   in A. chilensis tissues; nevertheless, Fusarium was significantly more
   dominant in the below-ground community, while foliar endophyte community
   was dominated by Penicillium. Whereas OTU richness and diversity were
   not different between below-ground and above-ground tissues, endophyte
   abundance was on average twice as high in below-ground tissue than in
   above-ground tissue. Fungal endophyte communities in the two tissue
   types were significantly dissimilar. Conclusions Results from this study
   indicate that A. chilensis harbors a similar diversity of endophytic
   fungi in above- and below-ground tissues. Dominant endophytic fungi were
   found to be dependent on tissue type, which potentially resulted in
   marked differences in community structure between above- and
   below-ground tissues. Ecological processes potentially affecting this
   pattern are discussed.},

Abstract = {Galaxias maculatus is an abundant freshwater fish species in Chilean
   continental waters where it plays important ecological functions, yet
   few parasitological records of this species exist in Chile and all of
   them cover a very limited geographic range. The objective of this study
   was to assess large scale geographic variation in composition of
   parasite infracommunities of Galaxias maculatus. Specifically, parasite
   infracommunities of this species were compared among 11 locations across
   9 degrees of latitude and 3 ecosystem types (lake, river and estuary).
   Most taxa found had been previously reported in Chile and Argentina.
   However, this is the first report for Tylodelphys sp. in this host in
   Chile. Furthermore, the cranial parasite Tylodelphys sp. had the highest
   overall prevalence and abundance compared to other parasite species.
   Despite the fact that the abundance of Tylodelphys sp. was not
   significantly correlated with Fulton's condition factor of fish,
   infected fish seem to have a better body condition compared to
   uninfected ones. The most important source of variation in composition
   of infracommunities was the sampling location. Furthermore, fish from
   lakes have a different composition of parasite infracommunities mainly
   due to higher abundances of Tylodelphys sp.},

Abstract = {BackgroundBehavior and activity patterns largely determine animal's
   fitness and their ecological roles. Those patterns depend on many
   factors, being body mass, sex and age the most relevant in mammals.
   Particularly, those factors altogether with environmental conditions
   could influence movement behavior of mammals that hibernate, such as the
   Monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides).MethodsTo evaluate its movement
   behavior and activity we radio-tracked D. gliroides 12 individuals (8
   females and 4 males, corresponding to 5 adults and 7 sub-adults) during
   the austral summer. With the estimated locations we estimated home
   ranges, core areas and their relationship with body mass. We also
   assessed movement speed during early (19:00 to 01:00h), peak (01:00 to
   03:00h) and late (03:00 to 07:00h) activity periods. This study was
   conducted at the San Martin experimental forest (Valdivia, southern
   Chile).ResultsEstimated home range areas were 1.040.20ha, and core areas
   were 0.27 +/- 0.06ha; we found no significant differences between males
   and females, nor between adults and sub-adults. Home range and core
   areas were independent of body mass in females but showed positive
   relationships in males. Core area overlap was larger between sub-adult
   and adult individuals (35\%) than between adult males and females
   (13\%). Average movement D. gliroides speed was 1.45m/min, reaching its
   lowest value during the peak activity period (01:00 to 03:00h), but
   being faster during early and late activity periods. Those speed
   differences may be related to travelling and foraging
   activities.ConclusionHome range and core areas estimated here showed a
   large variability, which can be related to environmental factors. Home
   range size was positively correlated with body mass on males but not on
   females. Also, lower movement speeds at the peak activity period suggest
   that D. gliroides concentrates feeding activities at this time. As D.
   gliroides disperses the seeds of at least 16 native plant species, its
   movement behavior also has important consequences at the community
   level.},

Title = {Rivers as a potential dispersing agent of the invasive tree Acacia
   dealbata},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Background The silver wattle Acacia dealbata is a fast-growing tree from
   Australia that has become naturalised in different regions of the world,
   attaining invasive status in most of them. In Chile, A. dealbata reaches
   large abundances along banks and floodplains of invaded fluvial systems,
   suggesting that rivers may act as a vector for seed dispersal. As
   hydrochory has not been documented previously in this species, the aim
   of this study is to evaluate the potential for water dispersal of seeds
   of this invasive tree along rivers. Methods Seed samples from rivers
   were collected at three sites along two A. dealbata-invaded rivers
   within the Cachapoal basin, central Chile. Number of seeds collected was
   contrasted versus hydraulic and local conditions with RDA. Seed buoyancy
   and sedimentation velocity were determined and compared between sites
   with an ANCOVA. Finally, the probability of seed germination after long
   periods of immersion in water was assessed, simulating transport
   conditions in the flow. Germination results were tested with a GLM.
   Results Results indicate that increasing abundance of A. dealbata seeds
   in the flow is related to the level of turbulence of the flow. Seeds
   display high floatability but their sedimentation velocity is high when
   they do sink. Finally, silver wattle seeds can germinate after long
   periods (many weeks) of immersion in water; however, their probability
   of germination depends to a large extent on whether seeds are scarified
   or not. Conclusions Based on the evidence collected, we suggest that the
   seeds of A. dealbata have the necessary traits to be dispersed by
   rivers, this being the first research testing this hypothesis. The
   success of hydrochory of A. dealbata would depend on river flow
   turbulence, and whether there are natural mechanisms for scarifying the
   seeds either before or during transport. The proposed methodology can be
   used to assess river hydrochory for any tree species.},

Title = {Breeding strategies of open-cup-nesting birds in sub-Antarctic forests
   of Navarino Island, Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Background: There is limited knowledge about the breeding strategies of
   birds inhabiting in South American temperate forests. This is
   particularly true for open-cup forest passerines breeding at high
   latitudes (> 42 degrees). To better understand the ecology of these
   species, in this study we described and compared the breeding strategies
   (i.e., nest dimensions, nest height from the ground, egg laying rhythm,
   clutch size, length of the developmental periods, breeding phenology,
   and diversity of nesting substrate) of five passerine birds that inhabit
   sub-Antarctic ecosystems.
   Methods: During three breeding seasons (2014-2017), we monitored 103
   nests of the five most abundant open-cup forest-dwelling passerines
   (Phrygilus patagonicus, Anairetes parulus, Turdus falcklandii, Elaenia
   albiceps, and Zonotrichia capensis) on Navarino Island (55 degrees S),
   Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, southern Chile. Additionally, we compared
   the breeding strategies of T. falcklandii to another population breeding
   at lower latitude (39 degrees S).
   Results: Most of the species started laying eggs the last week of
   September; only E. albiceps started 2 months later. During the breeding
   season of 2016-2017 both E. albiceps and Z. capensis started laying eggs
   earlier than the previous year. Anairetes parulus and Z. capensis were
   the most specialized in terms of nesting substrate. Turdus falcklandii
   had larger clutch sizes and nested closer to the ground on Navarino
   Island compared to the northern population, which might put this and
   other ground nesting species of this island at a higher risk of
   predation by the recently introduced American mink (Neovison vison).
   Conclusions; Our five study species breed exclusively in open-cups (not
   in cavities) in sub-Antarctic forests, and some of them built their
   nests closer to the ground compared to populations breeding at lower
   latitudes. This may be associated with the lack of terrestrial predators
   on Navarino Island. Our study opens further questions about the
   mechanisms driving differences in breeding strategies among populations.},

Abstract = {Background For the genus Thylamys, the rivers have been reported as
   barriers to dispersal, limiting current and historical distribution of
   its lineages. We hypothesized that the Maipo river has affected the
   genetic structure of northern and southern lineages of Thylamys elegans,
   recovering a phylogenetic relationships with reciprocally monophyletic
   sister groups on opposite river banks. We evaluated the role of other
   rivers in the Mediterranean zone of Chile as historical and recent
   modulators of the biogeographic processes of this species. Methods We
   applied a phylogeographic approach, using the cytochrome-b mitochondrial
   gene for 93 individuals of T. elegans, from 37 localities in a
   latitudinal gradient between 21 degrees 25' and 3556'S, encompassing a
   geographic area between the Atacama Desert and most of the Mediterranean
   Chilean zone. Results The phylogenetics results recovered six lineages
   within T. elegans: Thylamys elegans elegans, Thylamys elegans
   coquimbensis, the Loa lineage and three other lineages not described
   previously (Aconcagua, South 1 and South 2). We suggest that following
   rivers play a role like primary barrier: the Maipo river in the genetic
   differentiation of northern and southern ancestral lineages, and the
   Mataquito river and its tributary Teno river for the South 1 and South 2
   lineages. On the other hand, the Quilimari river preserve the genetic
   divergence in T. e. coquimbensis and Aconcagua lineage and the Aconcagua
   river in Aconcagua lineage and T. e. elegans acting like secondary
   barriers. Conclusions We concluded that the genetic diversity and
   biogeographic history of T. elegans was shaped by mountain glaciers,
   changes in river water levels during the Pleistocene glaciations and
   hyperaridity, promoting the differentiation and persistance of the T.

Title = {The impact of protected areas on poverty: evidence from Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the causal relationship between protected
   areas and poverty in Chile from 1982 to 2002. Chile is part of the
   coalition of countries committed to protecting 30\% of the planet by
   2030; a decision that implies increasing the number of protected areas
   in the country. As a result of this decision, grows the national debate
   about the potential impacts of protected areas on the economy and
   society. By estimating the causal effect of protected areas on poverty,
   we aim to contribute to this debate in Chile. We use panel data and a
   quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect. We find that
   establishing a protected area covering at least 17\% of a unit's
   terrestrial area causes a reduction of 0.216 standard deviations in the
   poverty index. This result is not sensitive to arbitrary implementation
   choices. Additionally, we show that the effect is driven by the
   Patagonia region, the part of Chile with the largest amount of new
   protected areas during the time frame of this study. Besides showing the
   benefits of protected areas to society, we hope the findings presented
   here might also be used to attract new investments and financial support
   to protected areas currently underfunded in Chile.},

Title = {Few self-citations among Chilean ecologists},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Background: We determine the occurrence of self-citations among 36
   Chilean ecologists with the highest h index values recorded in Web of
   Science. Because the practice of self-citation is perceived as negative
   by inflating a given researcher's impact factor, we evaluate if those
   ecologists (five of them having been awarded the National Prize in
   Natural Sciences) tend unduly to self-citation, or alternately, receive
   citations from others ostensibly because their peers recognize their
   theoretical and empirical output.
   Methods and findings: We use a recently proposed self-citation estimate
   easily calculated from h index values recorded in the restricted-access
   Web of Science (Wos) database and the open-access Google Scholar's (GS)
   Researcher Profiles and compare these metrics.
   Conclusions: The Chilean ecologists showed low self-citation values,
   independently of their status as National Prize awardees. Their
   publications were highly cited by unrelated peers, likely on account of
   their novelty or quality. Among middle-aged (50-60 year) and young (< 50
   year) Chilean ecologists open-access GS h index values are significantly
   correlated with those from WoS, thus rendering expeditious this method
   of citation assessment.},

Title = {Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a
   Patagonian channel used intensely by aquaculture: the influence of a
   geomorphological constriction},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food
   production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms
   through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly
   understood. A better understanding of the relationship between
   zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in
   Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability
   of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the
   Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of
   two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a
   geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture
   farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12
   h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background
   of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial
   dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities
   and in water column variables were identified between the two sections
   of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we
   found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species
   richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between
   sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward
   asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified
   in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time
   periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition
   were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time
   scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the
   asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier
   favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic
   variables between the two sections of the channel.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-139},
Abstract = {Question: This study represents the first contribution to the
   description and ecological characterization of fringe communities of
   Sardinia (Italy), and aimed: 1) to describe Sardinian fringe communities
   from a floristic vegetational point ; 2) to provide a syntaxonomic
   scheme, confirming or not the applicability of the most recent
   framework, proposed at the European scale, also in a Mediterranean
   insular context (Sardinia); 3) to verify if there is a correspondence
   among fringe communities and potential natural vegetation in the study
   area. Study area: Sardinia, the second largest island of the
   Mediterranean basin (Italy). Methods: 65 phytosociological plots
   realized using the Braun-Blanquet approach; for each of them,
   bioclimatic indices were derived from the available Bioclimatic map of
   Sardinia; Raunki??r life-forms were considered as species functional
   traits. Furthermore, by using Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) we
   calculated for each relev?? an abundance-weighted mean indicator value.
   Main vegetation types were identified through a Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis (HCA) and NMDS ordination. A permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance was used to test the overall significance in EIVs
   distribution differences among the clusters obtained from HCA. Results:
   we found a total amount of 139 vascular plant species. Hierarchical
   clustering detected the presence of seven interpretable clusters, well
   differentiated in terms of floristic composition, geographic
   distribution, bioclimatic characters and EIVs, and in terms of their
   inclusion in different vegetation series. Conclusions: we describe 5 new
   associations, four of them included in the new alliance Digitalido
   purpureae-Pteridion aquilini (Melampyro-Holcetalia mollis order,
   Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class), clearly differentiated with
   respect to other alliances described from both the eastern and the
   western side of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another new association was referred
   to the Epilobietea angustifolii class (Galio-Alliarietalia order).},

Title = {Community signals of the effect of Didymosphenia geminata (Lingbye) M.
   Schmidt on benthic diatom communities in Chilean rivers},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background: Didymosphenia geminata (Lingbye) M. Schmidt is a freshwater
   invasive benthic diatom native to oligotrophic systems of the Northern
   Hemisphere. Since 2010, freshwater systems of south-austral Chile, have
   experienced a progressive invasion of this species between 37 degrees
   18' S and 54 degrees 30' S. This invaded area is characterized by
   biogeographic heterogeneity, anthropic pressure and lack of knowledge.
   The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of D. geminata on
   the community structure of benthic diatoms and the variability of this
   effect in Chilean rivers.
   Methods: The data were collected between 2010 and 2017 and pre-treated
   using fourth-root transformation to construct a Bray-Curtis similarity
   matrix and a Principal Coordinate Analysis to identify groups of sites.
   The a diversity and beta diversity were estimated and compared using
   univariate indexes and the Mann-Whitney test, respectively. We used
   Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) and PERMDISP
   to estimate the spatial variation of communities, and an Analysis of
   Percentage Similarity (SIMPER) was performed to identify the species
   which contributed to the similarity between the groups of sites.
   Results: The results suggest significant differences between invaded and
   noninvaded rivers (54\% of the total variation); the univariate indexes
   showed greater richness (S), greater diversity (H'), and less species
   turnover in invaded rivers. The PERMANOVA indicated significant
   interaction between D. geminata and the basins; there was also a
   significant effect on the internal dispersion in the basins. The SIMPER
   analysis showed that the groups composed exclusively of invaded sites
   had high mean similarity in all basins and small pedunculated benthic
   diatoms showed a significant response to the presence of D. geminata.
   Conclusion: We found high variability in the community structures, that
   determine a strong segregation between noninvaded and invaded sites by
   D. geminata, and that the main effect of D. geminata on diatoms benthic
   was the homogenization of the communities. This is reflected in the
   increase in density of small stalked diatoms and the reduction of
   species turnover among rivers in the same basin, leading to the loss of
   community heterogeneity that overcomes the spatial heterogeneity in the
   area invaded in Chile.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe invasive diatom Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) M.
   Schmidthas received considerable attention in recent years due to its
   rapid geographic expansion and massive proliferation, which have altered
   habitat availability for benthic species and triggered negative effects
   on stream ecosystems. We evaluated the changes in the community
   structure of phytobenthos caused by the temporal variation in D.
   geminata coverage, in addition to the environmental variables correlated
   with the temporal variation of this invasive microalga in the Andean
   sector of the Biobio River basin, Chile.MethodsEnvironmental parameters
   were measured during the austral summer of 2014-2015, when phytobenthos
   samples were collected and used to develop a relative abundance matrix
   of taxa by calculating species richness and Shannon diversity.
   Multivariate techniques were used to establish the relationships among
   environmental variables, including D. geminata coverage, and the
   phytobenthic community.ResultsMassive proliferation of D. geminata
   occurs during summer (December-January). According to multiple
   regression analysis, electrical conductivity, temperature and total
   phosphorus were the variables that best explained the variation in D.
   geminata coverage. When D. geminata coverage was over 50\%, phytobenthic
   species richness was significantly higher than at the uninvaded site,
   without a significant change in Shannon diversity. In addition, the \%
   coverage of this invasive microalga and total phosphorus concentration
   were variables that differentiated phytobenthic communities among the
   study sites.ConclusionsEnvironmental factors such as conductivity,
   temperature and total phosphorus concentration influenced the temporal
   variability of D. geminata mats. In addition, the massive growth of this
   invasive diatom caused a higher species richness without altering
   Shannon diversity. Our results suggest that the spatio-temporal
   variability of D. geminata correlated with environmental variables will
   help predict the habitat suitability of this alga in other Andean rivers
   and allow a better understanding of ecological habitat alterations.},

Title = {The social system of the lava lizard, Microlophus atacamensis: the
   interplay between social structure and social organization},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background Animal social systems can be described through four main
   components: social structure, social organization, mating system, and
   care system. Social structure describes the relationships between
   individuals in a population, while social organization describes the
   group composition, size, and spatiotemporal variation of a population.
   We use the frameworks of social structure and social organization to
   study the social system of Microlophus atacamensis, a lizard found in
   the rocky intertidal zone along the Chilean coast. The area M.
   atacamensis inhabits poses specific challenges stemming from their use
   of two distinct habitat types in the intertidal zone: they forage in the
   cool areas near the water's edge and use large rocks in more inland
   areas for basking and refuge. Methods Our assessment of their social
   system focused on two separate populations: one to characterize social
   structure by means of focal observations and social network analysis,
   and a second to assess social organization via home range and core area
   analyses. Further, we examined the social system in two habitat types
   that comprise the intertidal zone: cobble fields and interspersed large
   rocks. Results Social network analysis revealed an interconnected
   network with a few highly central individuals. Body size influenced the
   outcomes of aggressive interactions, with interactions being more common
   in cobble fields where males had more associates and more repeated
   interactions than females. Spatial analyses revealed that the social
   organization of M. atacamensis is characterized by (1) high home range
   overlap, specifically in the cobble fields and (2) relatively exclusive
   core areas dispersed across both habitat types. Conclusion A social
   system is composed of both cooperative and competitive behaviors. While
   our study focused on competitive interactions, the extent and influence
   of cooperative behaviors is still unclear and merits future research. We
   suggest that M. atacamensis has a variable social system in which
   territoriality on large rocks affects access to stationary resources in
   that habitat (e.g., basking sites and refuges), while competition in the
   cobble fields could lay the foundation for a system of dominance
   relationships controlling access to variable food resources in cobble
   field areas of the intertidal zone.},

Title = {Morphological variation in two sigmodontine rodents along the mainland
   and the Fuegian archipelago in Chilean southern Patagonia},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Background Analysis of morphological variation in archipelagos has been
   essential to understand the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. In
   particular, these natural scenarios allow to assess morphological
   changes experienced by insular fauna compared to their mainland
   counterparts. In mammals, morphological changes of insular forms have
   been observed in size and shape of body and cranial traits. The southern
   Patagonia of Chile represents a unique scenario to analyze morphological
   variation in two of the most widely distributed small rodents along
   western southern South America:Abrothrix olivaceaandOligoryzomys
   longicaudatus. Methods We applied linear and three-dimensional geometric
   morphometric tools to analyze the variation in cranial morphology ofA.
   olivacea(N = 80) andO. longicaudatus(N = 49).Sampled localities were
   distributed in the mainland and islands of the Fuegian archipelago in
   Chilean Patagonia. Standard multivariate methods, as Principal
   Components Analysis, and Logistic Regression models were carried out to
   evaluate differences in size and shape of crania. Results We detected
   higher levels of morphological variation in the crania ofA. olivaceaif
   compared toO. longicaudatus. The variation was associated to cranial
   size instead of shape. We observed significant differences between
   insular and mainland individuals inA. olivacea, being the cranium size
   of this species significantly bigger on islands. Indeed, specimens ofA.
   olivaceafrom ``Isla Wellington{''}, exhibited the higher increment in
   cranium size compared to any other mainland and insular site sampled for
   this species.In contrast, insular and mainland forms ofO.
   longicaudatusdid not show significant differences in cranial morphology.
   Conclusions We suggest that the patterns of morphological variation
   observed in these two small rodents along Patagonia, could be explained
   in terms of the historical biogeography of the region, and the different
   ecological features of the studied species.},

Title = {Six new variants of the Terminalia cloud forest in the Dhofar Mountains
   of Oman},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {313-327},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The Terminalia cloud forest is endemic to a 200 km
   stretch of coastal mountains in southern Arabia. This research aims to
   describe patterns of variation in the species composition of the
   Terminalia forest in Dhofar, Oman and examine causal environmental
   factors. Study area: The Jabal Qamar mountain range, Dhofar, Oman.
   Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis
   were used to identify and describe variants of the Terminalia forest.
   Topoclimatic factors, vegetation characteristics and disturbance factors
   were compared between the variants using ordination and ANOVA or
   Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Six new variants of the Terminalia forest
   are described. These are the Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia
   shrubland variant, Cadia purpurea-Olea europaea forest variant, Euclea
   racemosa-Jasminum grandiflorum shrubland variant, Gymnosporia
   dhofarensis-Ficus sycomorus woodland variant, Jatropha
   dhofarica-Zygocarpum dhofarense sparse woodland variant and the Premna
   resinosa-Hybanthus durus forest variant. A seventh variant was
   identified, which was previously described by Kurschner et al. (2004);
   the broad-leaved Blepharispermum hirtum shrubland. The species
   composition and environmental conditions indicate that two variants are
   the result of anthropogenic disturbance, whilst the other variants are
   well separated along fog density and topographic position gradients.
   Conclusions: Distinct variants of the Terminalia forest in Jabal Qamar
   result from spatial variability in environmental conditions associated
   with the complex topography, monsoon fog distributions, and
   anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study could assist
   practitioners to rapidly identify and prioritise these variants for
   conservation.},

Title = {Ecology and syntaxonomy of Colchic forests in south-western Georgia
   (Caucasus region)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-248},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of the paper is to describe species composition, ecology
   and syntaxonomy of unique mesophilous forests in Georgian Colchis in the
   context of the Euxinian forests. Location: SW Georgia, western part of
   the Caucasus Region, slopes of the Lesser Caucasus (80-990 m). Methods:
   Forest vegetation was sampled following the Braun-Blanquet approach and
   basic environmental characteristics were recorded for each releve (n =
   53). The dataset was clustered using modified TWINSPAN and diagnostic
   species for each cluster were defined by phi fidelity index. Links
   between the species composition of vegetation and environmental factors
   were analysed by detrended correspondence analysis. Numerical comparison
   of the distinguished clusters with previously published associations
   from northern Turkey was carried out (expanded dataset, n = 173).
   Results: Among the new releves, we distinguished three vegetation types
   subsequently described as new associations: (i) Digitali
   schischkinii-Carpinetum betuli, chestnut-hornbeam forests of slightly
   dry sites, with low cover of evergreen shrubs, (ii) Rusco
   colchici-Castaneetum sativae, chestnut-hornbeam forests with a dense
   evergreen shrub layer, and (iii) Polysticho woronowii-Ulmetum glabrae,
   ravine forests with noble hardwood trees and ravine forest specialists.
   These associations were classified to the alliances of Euxinian forests,
   the first two to Castaneo-Carpinion and the third to Alnion barbatae.
   Major turnover in species composition within the dataset followed
   gradients of rockiness, slope inclination, altitude and mean annual
   temperature. The analysis of the expanded dataset revealed a decreasing
   occurrence of Mediterranean species and an increasing number of fern
   species along an easterly gradient. This change in species composition
   is likely to be driven by macroclimatic gradients. Conclusions: This
   paper presents the first numerical comparison of chestnut-hornbeam and
   ravine forests across central and eastern parts of the Euxinian
   Province. Our results have highlighted the uniqueness of Georgian
   Colchic forests, described as new associations, in the context of
   Euxinian forest vegetation.},

   area: Swaziland. Methods: The data set for analyses was obtained using
   both multi-stage systematic and random sampling of 117 small scale
   farmers' fields. The affinities of 40 weed species identified in the
   study to different zones were determined using phi coefficient of
   association, a statistically defined measure of fidelity. Agglomerative
   hierarchical cluster analysis was based on standardized species ranks
   from a consensus of phi, indicator value index, and relative abundance
   index. The Euclidean distance measure and Ward's method for group
   linkage were used to yield cluster solutions for each region. Species
   diversity was expressed as the proportional contribution to diversity at
   three scale levels, i.e. plot, field, and region, using the hierarchical
   additive partitioning approach. Results: Eighteen species were
   diagnostic to particular regions amongst which only two species appeared
   in two contiguous regions to which they were characteristic. The weed
   vegetation was characterised by three to four clusters with a group of
   taxa co-occurring in the same cluster across the five regions. A major
   part of weed diversity was mainly explained by beta-diversity at
   regional scale (35.0-67.8\%) than between fields (12.0-15.0\%) or
   sampling plots (0.1-2.8\%). Diversity within fields (alpha-diversity)
   was between 5.0 and 8.2\% in the five regions. Conclusion: The nested
   approach adopted where weed species were described and enumerated
   individually, in clusters, and, at different spatial scales could inform
   subsequent work towards diversification and scale of weed management
   approaches or tools in small scale agriculture.},

Abstract = {The associated species to Senecio glaucus in the newly reclaimed desert
   near to Wadi El-Assiuty of the Eastern Desert at Assiut Governorate,
   Egypt were investigated over two years (2018 and 2019). The allelopathic
   potential of S. glaucus against two crop plants (Triticum aestivum and
   Eruca sativa) was also evaluated. Floristically, 65 species within 59
   genera and 22 families were recorded (21 perennials and 44 annuals).
   Four families Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae captured
   about 54\% of this flora. Therophytes are the predominant life form
   followed by phanerophytes. Chorological analysis revealed that
   cosmopolitan and Saharo-Arabian elements constitute the main bulk of the
   total flora of the studied area. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct
   groups. Stands of group A characterized by the absence of S. glaucus and
   highest species diversity. Stands of group B, C and D included the
   associated species of S. glaucus and characterized by the dominance of
   cosmopolitans, grasses and salt tolerant species. The ordination
   techniques revealed the significant difference between group A and the
   others and showed the strong correlation between its flora with organic
   matter. The other three groups were highly correlated with coarse soil
   texture and total salts. Thirteen species were absent from stands of
   groups B, C and D in which S. glaucus was dominant. Phytochemical
   analysis of S. glaucus showed the prevalence of total phenolics and
   flavonoids in its shoots, while terpenoids were the highest in its
   flowers. All fractions of the plant components completely prevented
   germination of E. sativa seeds but exerted different magnitude of
   inhibition on germination of T. aestivum caryopses (especially with
   MeOH, capitula and shoot extracts). Estimation of phytotoxicity revealed
   that aqueous, ethyl acetate and capitula extracts significantly
   inhibited the germination of wheat caryopses and reduced the elongation
   rates of hypocotyl and epicotyl, and hence the whole length of
   seedlings.},

Title = {Vegetation diversity in East African wetlands: Cocktail algorithms
   supported by a vegetation-plot database},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-219},
Abstract = {Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems for biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem service provisioning, yet threatened by
   degradation and conversion into croplands. Conservation and land use
   management require data on vegetation structure and dynamics. The
   presented work is a response to a lacking consistent classification of
   East African wetland vegetation. Location: Namulonge valley in Uganda
   and Kilombero floodplain in Tanzania. Methods: We sampled 431 4
   m(2)-plots along land use intensity and flooding duration gradients. A
   floristic classification using the cocktail method was performed in a
   two-step approach. We developed definitions for vegetation units, using
   plot observations from the study sites in a first step and revised them
   in a second step by adding data from a vegetation-plot database and
   complied the definitions to an expert system for classification.
   Resulting vegetation units were analyzed regarding their life form
   composition, for which we implemented a classification based on life
   span and growth form. Following a literature review, the identified
   vegetation units were assigned either to existing phytosociological
   associations or proposals. Results: We recognize eight units of marsh
   and reed vegetation (class Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea) and five units of
   weed and pioneer vegetation under semi-aquatic conditions (class
   Oryzetea sativae). Five of these associations were previously described
   in the bibliographic references. The remaining eight are newly described
   in this work. The associations contrast in their life form composition
   with the five Oryzetea sativae associations dominated by obligate
   annuals and the Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea associations dominated by
   either reed plants or lacking a dominating life form. Conclusions: The
   developed expert system enables a comparison of wetland vegetation in
   the East African region and will support vegetation science and informed
   decision making about land use management and conservation. The two-step
   approach of revising a classification developed for single wetlands with
   a database is promising for data-scarce regions.},

Title = {Influence of altitude and longitude on vegetation in the Dzungarian Gobi
   and the south-western Mongolian Altai},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {339-369},
Abstract = {Central Asia hosts grassland and desert regions that are globally
   important to nature conservation and local livelihoods. Several major
   vegetation surveys have been published on the region, with the majority
   focussing on areas within central Mongolia and north-eastern China. Much
   less information is available on plant community composition on the
   Dzungarian Basin, which forms a transitional zone between Central and
   Middle Asia in terms of flora. The Altai Mountains extend along the
   northern and eastern boundaries of the basin and introduce further
   environmental heterogeneity.
   For the present study, we assess horizontal and vertical gradients in
   plant community composition in both the Chinese and Mongolian parts of
   the Dzungarian Basin and the adjacent Altai Mountains. We show that
   steep environmental gradients trigger notable differences in plant
   community composition over relatively short distances. The study is
   based on data collected over three different sampling periods in the
   Mongolian part: In 2003, we sampled 208 plots; in 2010, 152 plots; and
   during the vegetation periods of 2012-2014, 280 plots. On the Chinese
   side, 58 samples were taken in 2013. Sample sites were deliberately
   chosen to represent relevant vegetation types, ranging from those of the
   high mountains to the lower oases. We collected biomass and mixed
   topsoil samples for soil analysis and compiled additional environmental
   data. A vegetation map was then prepared based on the supervised
   classification of remote sensing imagery.
   Our results reveal that four different main vegetation types
   (forest-steppe, steppe, desert and oasis) encompass twenty-one plant
   communities, with each type showing a clear altitudinal distribution,
   except for that at oases. Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed the
   expected close correlation between altitude and species composition and
   productivity, but it also highlighted significant differences between
   the vegetation of neighbouring mountain ranges in the Chinese and
   Mongolian Altai.},

Abstract = {Aims: This study covers the investigation of the forest, maquis, and
   coastal vegetation of Karpaz Peninsula (Northern Cyprus Island). Study
   area: The study area falls under the influence of low-rainy temperate
   and low-rainy-warm Mediterranean climates. Methods: The vegetation data
   were sampled according to the Braun-Blanquet approach, and classified by
   means of the TWINSPAN numerical method. For the visualization of
   similarity between the associations, Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) was used, and species composition of each phytosociological unit
   was provided in synoptic tables. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was utilized
   in order to show ecological and structural differences between
   vegetation types. Results and Conclusions: Six associations, six
   sub-associations, and one plant group have been delineated for the study
   area. The new association Cupresso sempervirentis-Pinetum brutiae has
   been defined in the forest vegetation. Four new subassociations for the
   Ephedro campylopodae-Juniperetum lyciae characterizing maquis vegetation
   have been defined; teucrietosum canescentis, micromerietosum nervosae,
   piptatheretosum thomasii, and convolvuletosum oleifolii. The coniferous
   forests and maquis vegetation types are included in the alliance
   Ceratonio-Pistacion lentisci, order Pistacio lentisci-Rhamnetalia
   alaterni, and class Quercetea ilicis. The analyzed coastal dune
   communities are represented by the perennial psammophilous coastal dunes
   vegetation (Ammophiletea), phrygana vegetation in semi stable dunes
   (Ononido-Rosmarinetea), coastal cliff vegetation (Crithmo-Staticetea),
   and coastal maquis vegetation (Ceratonio-Pistacion lentisci)
   characterizing stabilized shrubs in back dunes. Monitoring and
   conservancy measures are recommended for Karpas Peninsula for the
   preserving of these different communities that also host many endemic
   species against especially agriculture, tourism and urban expansion.},

Title = {Scree vegetation in the northern Apennines (N-Italy)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-94},
Abstract = {Aims: This paper presents the results of phytosociological research on
   scree vegetation in the northern Apennines with the aim of comparing
   vegetation types classified in different syntaxa. The specific
   objectives were: 1) to identify, classify and describe the vegetation
   units of scree communities; 2) to pinpoint the main ecological gradients
   underlying different vegetation units; and 3) to identify a possible
   hierarchy of predictor variables explaining floristic differences
   between vegetation types. Study area: The study area lies on the
   northern border of the Italian Peninsula, between 44 degrees and 44
   degrees 45' N and 9 degrees 20' and 10 degrees 45' E, characterized by a
   large variety of scree habitats and representing both a centre of
   endemism and a phytogeographic transition zone between the Alps and
   Apennines. Methods: The study was based on a dataset including 364
   releves taken according to the Braun-Blanquet method, which were then
   classified following an unsupervised numerical procedure. Species
   fidelity was used to define the diagnostic species of the associations.
   PCA and RDA ordinations were employed to perform ecological analyses
   using both Ellenberg Indicator Values as indirect variables and directly
   measured or calculated variables. Results: A total of 15 plant
   associations were identified, belonging to 6 alliances and 4 different
   orders (Thlaspietalia rotundifolii, Arabido alpinae-Petasitetalia
   paradoxi, Achnatheretalia calamagrostis and Androsacetalia alpinae)
   within the class Thlaspietea rotundifolii. All associations were
   described according to their floristic composition, structure,
   syntaxonomy, habitat and distribution. Conclusions: Nine scree
   associations and two alliances - endemic to the study area - are
   described here for the first time. The syntaxonomic scheme followed is
   in accordance with that proposed in the EuroVegChecklist, with a few
   important exceptions. The largest variation in vegetation types was
   found along complex environmental gradients and the most important
   factors driving the difference between the four orders were gravel size,
   elevation and the geological substrate.},

Title = {The rock-face vegetation in the northern Apennines and neighbouring
   mountain areas, from the coast line to the highest summits},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-70},
Abstract = {Aims: The study aims at putting together and comparing different types
   of rock vegetation classified to different syntaxa and usually studied
   separately. The particular objectives of the study were: 1) to identify
   and classify the vegetation units of rock communities; 2) to explain
   floristic differences between phytosociological units with different
   habitat conditions. Study area: The study area lies at the northern
   border of the Italian Peninsula, between 43 degrees 40' and 44 degrees
   40' N and between 9 degrees and 11 degrees E. It is characterized by a
   great variety of rocky habitats and represents a centre of endemism and
   a zone of phytogeographic transition between the Alps and the Apennines.
   Methods: The study was based on a dataset including 693
   phytosociological releves that were classified according to the recent
   updatings of the Braun-Blanquet method. During the classification,
   releves were assigned to phytosociological classes based on the
   cover-abundance prevalence of diagnostic species, taking into account
   the current literature. The definitive classification into associations
   was carried out through cluster analysis. The analysis of floristic
   variation within the rock vegetation was performed through Principal
   Component Analysis, adopting Ellenberg indicator values as indirect
   environmental factors. Results: We identified 36 basic vegetation units
   (35 of them evaluated as associations) belonging to four
   phytosociological classes (Crithmo-Staticetea, Adiantetea, Asplenietea
   trichomanis and Polypodietea). All these vegetation units were
   characterized by their floristic composition, structure, syntaxonomy,
   habitat and distribution. Conclusions: More than half of the identified
   associations and a new suballiance Primulenion apenninae (within the
   alliance Androsacion vandellii) were newly described. Two alliances
   (Moehringion muscosae and Hymenopbyllion tunbrigensis) were first
   documented as part of the Italian vegetation. Indirect gradient analysis
   indicated that, within the four classes, the floristic composition
   varied along different environmental gradients and that temperature can
   be identified as the factor most strongly correlated with the variation
   of rock-face vegetation.},

Title = {Plant community assemblages and environmental drivers in the mountainous
   grassland ecosystem of South Africa},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {263-274},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is
   influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate,
   topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire
   and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant
   communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and
   determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial
   distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was
   firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and
   refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE
   programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the
   most important environmental variables influencing the spatial
   distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data
   were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid
   databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the
   remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020
   was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in
   nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis
   showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be
   significant at a 95\% confidence level and positively correlated with
   the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but
   negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710,
   p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly
   positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r <
   0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well
   as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance
   in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies
   for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and
   also to monitor vegetation change over time.},

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {369-391},
Abstract = {Aims: To complete the syntaxonomical scheme for the steppe vegetation of
   the montane and alpine zones in the Pamir Alai and southwestern
   Tian-Shan Mountains in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan with some remarks on
   its environmental predictors. Location: Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
   Methods: A total of 274 releves were sampled in 2016-2017 using the
   seven-degree cover-abundance scale of Braun-Blanquet. They were
   classified with modified TWINSPAN with cut-off levels of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%
   and 25\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster heterogeneity.
   Diagnostic species were identified using the phi coefficient as a
   fidelity measure. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to explore the relationships
   between groups in the dataset and to determine the environmental
   gradients that predict the species composition and distributional
   patterns of particular communities. Results: A total of 11 steppe
   communities were distinguished for the study area, grouped in five
   alliances and three orders. Seven of them are defined as new
   associations: Astragalo chomutowii-Stipetum subsessiliflorae, Stipetum
   bungeanae, Convolvuletum spiniferi, Stipo magnificae-Otostegietum olgae,
   Littledaleo alaicae-Stipetum trichoidis, Helictotricho
   fedtschenkoi-Stipeturn kirghisori and Astragalo lithophili-Sdpetum
   zalesskii. The communities belong to the Piptathero gradlis-Artemision
   brevifoliae (high-altitude, cold arid plateaus) and
   Ajanio-Cleistogenenion songoricae (alpine arid mountainous areas; both
   Ajanio-Cleistogenetea songoricae), the Poo bulbosae-Artemision persicae
   related to warm montane-subalpine belts of the southern part of Middle
   Asia (Astragalo microcephali-Brometea tomentelli, Carici
   stenophylloidis-Stipetalia arabicae) and the Stipion krylovii, typical
   steppes in semi-arid subalpine and alpine belts (Stipetalia krylovii,
   Cleistogeneta squarrosae). Within the Stipetalia krylovii, the TWINSPAN
   revealed a second unit at alliance level next to the Stipion krylovii,
   with currently only one association, but due to the limited amount of
   data we refrained from making a formal description. The main factors
   responsible for the species composition of the researched vegetation
   were altitude, content of organic top soil, and longitudinal position.
   Conclusions: We have completed the vegetation survey of the steppes in
   the middle and western part of Central Asia and have fostered the
   progress in finding the borderland between the steppes of the western
   Asiatic and central Asiatic subregions. This geographic transition
   corresponds to a syntaxanomic division between the classes of Astragalo
   microcephali-Brometea tomentelli Quezel 1973 and Cleistogenetea
   squarrosae Mirkin et al. ex Korotkov et al. 1991.},

Title = {Syntaxonomy and ecology of mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan
   (Middle Asia)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Aims: In this paper we propose the first syntaxonomic classification for
   the mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan with some remarks on
   their environmental variability. Methods: Altogether 120 relev??s were
   sam-pled using the standard, seven-degree cover-abundance scale of
   Braun-Blanquet, in 2015???2021. They were clas-sified by the modified
   TWINSPAN method using the four step interval scale with cutoff levels of
   0\%, 2\%, 5\% and 10\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster
   heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi
   coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) was used to determine the rela-tionship between the sampled plots,
   vegetation units and major gradients in species composition. Results:
   Plant communities known so far as ??hiblyak and including xeric and
   mesophilic shrublands seral or marginal to broad-leaved forests in the
   nemoral zone of the Irano-Turanian region are described herein.
   Numerical analyses of vegetation data allowed distinguishing five
   associations representing the Ranunculo tenuilobi-Cotoneasteri-on
   hissarici alliance. The new associations include: Eremuro
   comosi-Rhuidetum coriariae, Calophacetum gran-diflorae, Fraxinetum
   raibocarpae, Pruno sogdianae-Crataegetum turkestanicae, Aflatunio
   ulmifoliae-Caraga-netum turkestanicae. For the latter association, two
   habitat variants (with Ferula clematidifolia and Malus sieversii) are
   proposed. The main factors determining the species composition of the
   studied vegetation include: elevation, mean annual temperature and sum
   of annual precipitation. Conclusions: The research results herein
   presented fill the gap in knowledge about the shrubland vegetation of
   Tajikistan. Studies in neighbouring coun-tries and a focus on subalpine
   scrubs in dry habitats are needed to complete the classification of
   shrubland vegetation of Middle Asia.},

   the top 100,000 scientists (1.45\% across all disciplinary fields) or
   the top 2\% of each subfield discipline, thus publishing the ranking of
   ca. 150,000 researchers worldwide.
   Methods and findings: We filtered that information for the disciplinary
   and sub-disciplinary areas corresponding to Ecology and identified a
   total of 14 ecologists with residence in Chile that appear in either of
   those two worldwide rankings. We report their measured productivity as
   both whole trajectory (career-long) and as annual impact at year 2019.
   We attribute their high registered productivity to their training at the
   doctoral level in prestigious foreign universities, their academic
   positions in internationally recognized Chilean universities, and their
   participation in state-funded research centers of scientific excellence.
   Exceptions to the rule are presented.
   Conclusions: The 14 ecologists identified with the scientometric
   algorithm proposed by Ioannidis and coworkers include, but are not
   restricted, to the most cited ecologists in Chile. We put forth possible
   reasons for some puzzling omissions from these rankings.},

Title = {A study of composition and diversity variation of avifauna along with
   different types of agroforestry system in Kibet town, Southern Ethiopia},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},

Abstract = {Background Agroforestry is an integrated land-use system that plays a
   great role in the conservation of landscape biodiversity. The study
   aimed to assess the composition and diversity of avian species along
   with different habitat types of agroforestry in Kibet Town, Southern
   Ethiopia. Methods Four habitat types of agroforestry system which are
   home gardens, live fences, parkland, and eucalyptus woodlot were
   identified. Line transects were used for bird surveys. The Shannon
   diversity index (H `) and species evenness index (E) were used to
   compare diversity among habitat types. A similarity percentages (SIMPER)
   test was carried out to identify the main species and feeding guild that
   typified each habitat type. The overall significance was assessed with
   the ANOSIM test using PAST (version 4.03). Results A total of 50 bird
   species belonging to 28 families and 10 orders were recorded. Order
   Passeriformes (67.3\%) had the highest number of species. Bird community
   composition differed among habitat types. The dissimilarity was mainly
   due to White-browed robin-chat (Cossypha heuglini), Streaky seed-eater
   (Serinus striolatus), Village Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), African
   Paradise-Flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis), and Black-Headed Paradise
   Flycatcher (T. rufiventer). The finding also revealed that insectivore
   was the dominant feeding guild. Conclusions The present study shows
   evidence that more insectivore bird species use different types of
   agroforestry as habitat and foraging sites. So, any concerned bodies who
   have engaged in avian conservation should give special consideration to
   this modified landscape.},

Title = {Notes on the arthropod fauna of Salas y Gomez island, Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Background Salas y Gomez is a small, volcanic island largely untouched
   by humans due to its diminutive size and remoteness. Since the waters
   surrounding Salas y Gomez were established as Motu Motiro Hiva Marine
   Park in 2010, marine investigations have been the primary research
   focus. Secondarily, nesting seabird communities have been censused since
   2011. Methods and findings In 2016, terrestrial arthropods were sampled
   on the island. Two observers sampled two locations for 30 min per site.
   Fifteen morphospecies were identified including at least one likely
   undescribed species. Conclusions Our work represents the most
   comprehensive terrestrial arthropod inventory of Salas y Gomez island to
   date. We are hopeful the recommendations provided will spur additional
   research to both characterize the island's arthropod community, as well
   as identify species of management concern.},

Title = {Comparison of organic matter in intermittent and perennial rivers of

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundAlthough intermittent rivers account for over half of the
   global fluvial network and could increase in length and quantity in
   Mediterranean climates (in response to climate changes), there is little
   documentation of organic matter input to them. This study was made
   possible by the cooperation of the Concepcion Chiguayante School
   community and the Explora project (Chile), with the support of citizen
   science. The aim was to compare coarse particulate organic matter
   quantities and types in the Lonquen basin.MethodsSamplings were
   performed in two perennial rivers and two intermittent rivers. First,
   the riparian vegetation of the streams was characterized through
   photointerpretation and subsequently the organic matter accumulated in
   the selected river beds was quantified and typified. Spearman's
   correlation was used.ResultsThe riparian vegetation was similar in both
   types of rivers, though significantly greater (p<0.05) plant material
   accumulation was found in intermittent rivers compared to perennial
   rivers (1029 and 337gm(-2), respectively). Likewise, there was a
   significant relationship among leaves, smaller organic matter, seeds,
   herbs and shrubs in intermittent rivers.ConclusionsThe results reveal
   the importance of the intermittent rivers that were sampled as
   transitory reservoirs of organic matter with high productive potential,
   especially in the first flood pulses, when this material is transported
   downstream.},

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},

Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {The source of Darwin's illness has been a contentious issue in the
   literature for almost 70 years. Different causal factors have been
   invoked to account for his symptoms, including Chagas disease. The
   Chagas hypothesis is based upon Darwin's diary, in which he narrates his
   experience with kissing bugs, the main vector of the protozoan
   Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. In this
   contribution, we examine the consistency of the ``Chagas disease
   hypothesis{''} in the light of current ecological and epidemiological
   knowledge of the disease in Chile. According to his diary and letters,
   during his overland trips, Darwin slept in rural houses and outdoors for
   128 days in a ``hyperendemic{''} area for Chagas disease, more than
   exposing him to kissing bugs. This observation conveys a likely
   additional source of infection than previously considered, which might
   reinforce the idea that Chagas disease contributed to Darwin's manifest
   physical deterioration.},

Abstract = {Background Human activities are permanently threatening wildlife.
   Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centers (WRRC) have served for the
   rescue, rehabilitation and reinsertion of affected and recovered
   animals. Methods We reviewed the casuistry of five wildlife rescue and
   rehabilitation centers in Chile over 5 years, and described the main
   causes of admission, most affected taxonomic groups and final outcomes
   of the admitted individuals, shedding light into general patterns and
   relevant factors currently affecting wildlife in Chile. To understand
   the current work and status of WRRC system in Chile, we also conducted a
   qualitative survey to WRRC personnel and Agricultural and Livestock
   Service (SAG) regional offices regarding their operation. Results A
   total of 3418 cases of animals admitted to WRRC were obtained; 95.3\%
   corresponded to native species. Of native animal cases, 86.0\%
   corresponded to birds, 12.3\% were mammals and 1.7\% reptiles. Trauma
   was the most frequently observed cause of admission in all three native
   fauna groups (35.8\% in birds, 23.2\% in mammals, 27.8\% in reptiles).
   Conclusions WRRC are a tool for conservation and education of wild
   animal species in Chile, however WRRC and SAG regional office personnel
   highlighted several deficiencies in the current system and suggested
   opportunities for improvement. The current WRRC system needs
   modernization and financial support from the Chilean state to fulfil
   their relevant mission.},

Title = {Historical account and current ecological knowledge of the southernmost
   lizard in the world, Liolaemus magellanicus (Squamata: Liolaemidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Background The systematics of Liolaemus magellanicus has been relatively
   well researched, but despite its recognition as the southernmost lizard
   in the world, scant attention has been paid to the discovery,
   distribution, biogeography, and ecology of this lizard at the southern
   tip of South America. I hereby research such aspects and collate the
   most relevant information reported in the primary literature. Methods
   and Results I conducted a selective review of the history of discovery,
   distributional records, biogeography, and ecological features of L.
   magellanicus, as recorded in mainstream journals and landmark monographs
   and books. I specifically omitted the work on the systematics of the
   species and genus because its complexity warrants separate treatment. I
   found scattered references to this lizard starting with the chronicles
   of several overseas expeditions (British, French, and Swedish), with
   Darwin, Jacquinot and Guichenot, and Anderson and Ohlin acting as
   informers; and culminating with Skottsberg, a traveler, and Bridges, an
   early settler in Tierra del Fuego Island. Modern treatment of this
   species started with Hellmich in the 1930s and Donoso-Barros in the
   1960s in Chile, and with Cei in Argentina in the 1960s and has continued
   chiefly in the latter country until today. Discussion I propose this
   species as a model ectothermic vertebrate that may serve to test
   hypotheses about: (a) Resource allocation strategies to deal with a
   harsh environment that affords limited opportunities for foraging and
   reproductive activities of a lizard. (b) Behavioral strategies for
   dealing with thermoregulation, food, and mate acquisition, and care -if
   any-of offspring. (c) Its place within the rather impoverished food web
   of which this species forms part of. This relatively new species, which
   persisted in glacial refuges before being cut off into two
   subpopulations-one mainlander, another islander-also offers fertile
   ground for testing population genetic, evolutionary, and phylogeographic
   hypotheses. I think that biogeographers, systematists, evolutionists,
   physiologists, and ecologists should take advantage of this uniquely
   positioned species in the southernmost margin of the world.},

Title = {Effects of landscape configuration on the occurrence and abundance of an
   arboreal marsupial from the Valdivian rainforest},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background Habitat fragmentation and degradation processes affect
   biodiversity by reducing habitat quantity and quality, with differential
   effects on the resident species. However, their consequences are not
   always noticeable as some ecological processes affected involve
   idiosyncratic responses among different animal groups. The Valdivian
   temperate rainforests of southern Chile are experiencing a rapid
   fragmentation and degradation process despite being a biodiversity
   hotspot. Deforestation is one of the main threats to these forests.
   There inhabits the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, an iconic
   species from the Valdivian rainforest, it is the only extant
   representative of the ancient Microbiotheria order, and it is currently
   threatened by habitat loss. Here we tested the effects of habitat
   configuration on D. gliroides occurrence and abundance along 12
   landscapes of southern Chile with different disturbance levels. Methods
   We estimated D. gliroides occurrence and abundance using camera traps
   and related those metrics with landscape configuration indices obtained
   from FRAGSTATS (i.e., forest \%, connectivity, patch number, contiguity,
   and distance to the nearest patch) using Bayesian linear mixed models.
   Results We found that D. gliroides occurrence was not influenced by
   landscape configuration, while its abundance was positively influenced
   by forest contiguity. Conclusions Although this arboreal marsupial is
   present in disturbed forests, its restricted movement capabilities and
   high dependency on the forest three-dimensional structure may affect its
   long-term persistence. We urge to rethink native forest conservation and
   management policies to improve habitat connectivity with possible
   positive consequences for native fauna.},

Title = {Altitude and aspect filter the herb layer functional structure of
   sub-Mediterranean forests},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-198},
Abstract = {Question: Do topographic factors that determine the distribution pattern
   of sub-Mediterranean coppiced woods influence the functional structure
   of their herb layer? Study area: Umbria-Marche Apennines (Italy).
   Methods: In 156 plots we collected topographic data and species cover.
   We identified the main forest communities using a Multivariate
   Regression Tree (MRT) analysis on the releves by species matrix
   constrained by altitude, aspect and slope angle. For the herb layer of
   each plot, we calculated the community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs)
   and functional diversity (FD) indices. We compared CWM and FD values
   between MRT groups at each partition of the tree graph and checked
   linear trends of CWMs and FD indices along gradients illustrated by
   topographic variables and mean Ellenberg's Indicator Values. Results:
   Altitude and aspect segregated the main forest types and filtered the
   herb layer functional structure, depending on the considered traits. We
   observed a shift from strategies related to cold stress and the
   shortness and unpredictability of growing season at the highest
   altitudes and on north-facing slopes, to those related to dryness at
   lower elevations and on south-facing slopes. Environmental filtering
   changed the relative abundance of traits between mountain and hilly
   woods, as well as functional richness of life form, vegetative
   propagation, pollen/spore vector, and functional evenness, divergence,
   and Rao's quadratic entropy of storage organs types. Within hilly
   forests, functional divergence increased toward north-facing slopes,
   while evenness increased toward south-facing slopes. Conclusions:
   Altitude and aspect, besides shaping the distribution patterns of
   sub-Mediterranean coppiced woods, influence the functional structure of
   their herb layer in a different manner. In mountain woods, higher
   altitude fosters convergence of the storage organs more suitable to
   tolerate cold stress. In hilly woods, drought and the heterogeneous
   distribution of resources on south-facing slopes increase functional
   evenness, whereas the higher availability of resources on north-facing
   slopes promotes divergence.},

Title = {Modeled lichen metacommunities in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: do
   geopolitical regions and the Southern Tropic division reflect natural
   entities?},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-233},
Abstract = {Aims: The objective of this paper was to test the hypothesis that
   epiphytic lichen metacommunities in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest are
   hierarchically structured and not only correspond to forest formations
   and their floristic subdivisions, but also reflect the main geopolitical
   regions in the study area (Northeast, Southeast, South) and particularly
   the division of the Atlantic Forest, along a latitudinal gradient, into
   a tropical and a subtropical-temperate zone north and south of the
   Tropic of Capricorn. Study area: Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Methods: We
   employed niche distribution modeling for 245 species of four large and
   representative families of epiphytic lichens in the study area, using a
   stacked species approach to model metacommunity structure via
   quantitative methods of community analysis (clustering and ordination
   techniques). To account for sampling bias, we performed background
   manipulation via a bias layer. Results: We detected a hierarchical
   structure with three main clusters (A, B, C) subdivided into ten
   subclusters. Both the main clusters and each of the subclusters
   correlated strongly with environmental variables and latitude and
   featured statistically significant, characteristic indicator species,
   and the subclusters matched floristic subdivisions of the main forest
   formations recognized in the study area. There was a significant
   correlation of the three main clusters with the three geopolitical
   regions in the study area which after all also reflect ecogeographical
   features. The main separation between the two northern (A, B) and the
   southern cluster (C) almost precisely followed the division of the
   Atlantic Forest by the Tropic of Capricorn, supports the notion that the
   latter is an important delineator in biome formation, reflected by
   epiphytic lichen metacommunities. Conclusion: We conclude that modeling
   metacommunities via a stacked species approach is a powerful tool, also
   to elaborate baseline data for future monitoring of metacommunities in
   relation to climate change.},

Title = {Optimizing the classification of species composition data by combining

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Aims: Classification is an appropriate tool for the summarizing of
   species data in community ecology. Researchers need to select the
   effective classification method(s) and the optimum number of clusters to
   perform a reasonable classification. The aims of the present research
   are to assess the efficacy of various classification algorithms and to
   select the optimum number of clusters. Study area: We used a dataset of
   197 400 m(2) releves recorded from Tarbiat Modares University research
   forest located in the north of Iran. Methods: For each releve, a species
   list and the canopy cover were recorded by using Braun-Blanquet
   cover-abundance scale modified by van der Maarel. We considered seven
   classification methods: flexible-beta linkage (beta = -0.25), Ward's
   linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, Modified TWINSPAN, k-means,
   and PAM. Using each of these algorithms, data were classified into 2-21
   cluster levels. Then, values of eight internal evaluators viz. ASW,
   1-C.index, PARTANA, PBC, 1-ISA.pval, ISA.sig.inds, ISAMIC, 1-Morisita as
   well as mean lambda index were calculated for each classification level
   resulted from algorithms. These values were applied in three methods to
   select the appropriate classification algorithm(s). Also, we used those
   values to choose the optimum number of clusters in the selected
   algorithm(s). A discriminate analysis opted for the verification of the
   selected optimums. Results: Our results revealed that, for our data,
   flexible-beta linkage was the proper classification algorithm with 12
   the optimum number of clusters. Despite the vast number of available
   classification algorithms, there is no ultimate best one for all
   vegetation datasets. Therefore scientists need using multiple criteria
   to choose their specific appropriate method. With respect to this, our
   methods and findings could provide a generalized framework for choosing
   the effective method(s) for the subsequent classification analyses.},

Title = {Between land and sea - a classification of saline and brackish
   grasslands of the Baltic Sea coast},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-348},
Abstract = {Aims: Baltic Sea coastal grasslands are influenced by saline or brackish
   sea water, a narrow tidal range and nonintensive land use. Since their
   designation as Natura 2000 habitat types under the EU Habitats
   Directive, they have become an important conservation issue in Europe.
   Little supra-regional research has been conducted to date on their
   floristic and ecological diversity, syntaxonomy and geographic
   variation. We surveyed the geographical distribution and syntaxonomical
   variation of saline and brackish grasslands to highlight large-scale
   gradients in species composition, as well as underlying climatic and
   other abiotic factors. We discuss the resulting vegetation types in the
   context of northern Europe and review implications for conservation.
   Study area: Baltic Sea coast. Methods: We compiled a comprehensive
   plot-based vegetation dataset for the Baltic Sea coast and subsequently
   selected releves by species composition and plot size. We classified
   3,732 releves, using modified TWINSPAN, identified differential species
   and syntaxa, and performed a DCA with post-hoc fitted intrinsic and
   climatic variables. We tested main differences in relevant factors for
   significance. Results: The classification resulted in 33 vegetation
   types of differing distribution range and area. Most common were the
   classes Juncetea maritimi and Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, with the classes
   Phragmito-Magnocaricetea, Cakiletea maritimae, Saginetea maritimae,
   Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae and Koelerio-Corynephoretea
   canescentis also present. Baltic Sea coastal grasslands vary in soil
   salinity and moisture and, to a lesser extent, in nutrient availability
   and base content. Conclusions: Variation in the plant communities
   reflects regional phytogeo-graphical patterns. Communities most similar

Title = {Variability and variation in Rhyncholestes raphanurus Osgood
   (Paucituberculata, Caenolestidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Background Caenolestids are a group of poorly known South American
   marsupials with a restricted distribution in Paramo and Subparamo
   environments of the Andes from Colombia and western Venezuela to Bolivia
   (represented by the genera Caenolestes and Lestoros), and Valdivian
   rainforest in southern Chile (including a separate population in Chiloe
   Island) and Argentina, where a single species lives: the Long-nosed
   shrew opossum (Rhyncholestes raphanurus). The objectives of this work
   were to analyze the intraspecific variability of R. raphanurus, which
   includes an anatomical description of the skull and dentition, describe
   its geographic variation, test for sexual dimorphism, and assess
   potential differences between continental and Island populations.
   Methods Linear Mossimann-transformed variables were used to assess
   sexual differences within a large population (La Picada), compare sexes
   within other continental populations, and in a separate analysis,
   compare continental from Island samples. A full model Principal
   Components Analysis was performed to assess differences between males
   and females of the continental and Island populations. A thorough
   description of the skull and teeth of the species and comparisons with
   other living Caenolestidae is presented. Results Rhyncholestes
   raphanurus presents little geographic variation, even between Island and
   continental populations. Similarly, we found no significant difference
   between sexes of this species in cranial and dental measurements. We
   provide a detailed description of cranial morphology and its variation,
   and also, the first description of the occipital bones, which haven't
   been previously described for any Paucituberculata. Conclusions
   Comparative studies of continental and Chiloe Island specimens support
   the treatment of R. raphanurus as a single valid species, especially
   since morphologic and morphometric differences fall within the extremes
   of continental populations. The morphology of R. raphanurus clearly
   separates this genus from other extant Caenolestidae, and in a much
   greater degree than the differences found between Lestoros and
   Caenolestes.},

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {95-109},
Abstract = {Aim: Forest-steppe complexes in the peri-Carpathian region harbour
   specific vegetation dominated by tall herbs. Our aim was to provide new
   phytosociological data on this vegetation type from the Ukraine and
   adjacent parts of Romania, compare it with previously published data,
   discuss its position in broad ecological and biogeographical context and
   suggest its syntaxonomic treatment respecting both its physiognomy and
   species composition. Study area: Western Ukraine and Romania. Methods:
   We assembled a dataset of 711 relev??s of thermophilous herb-rich
   vegetation (Trifolio-Geranietea) from the study area and adjacent
   regions of Eastern Poland and Slovakia using own field research,
   literature survey and large databases. Using intersection of three
   different classification algorithms (beta-flexible, modified TWINSPAN
   and K-means clustering) we identified a consensus delimitation of the
   vegetation type. NMDS ordination, analysis of diagnostic, constant and
   dominant species, and Didukh indicator values were used to characterize
   its species composition and habitat conditions. Results: Altogether 58
   relev??s from Western Ukraine and Romania were classified to a tall herb
   -dominated vegetation type that we identified with the association
   Trollio-Clematidetum recti T??uber et Weber 1976 described from Romania.
   We assigned it to the alliance Geranion sanguinei. It differs from other
   communities of this alliance in its preference for shady slopes, greater
   stand height and considerable representation of mesophilous and montane
   species. It is confined to calcareous bedrock with high soil pH and high
   mineral richness. Conclusions: We suggest that the studied tall
   herb-dominated vegetation is a specific steppe type, confined to
   relatively moist and nutrient rich sites in the peri-Carpathian area.
   Analogous vegetation occurs in the Alps, Balkans, hemiboreal Europe,
   South Urals and Western Siberia. Its species composition and
   biogeographical relationships provide further support for the hypothesis
   that steppe meadows of Central Europe, including tall herb-dominated
   stands, are linked to the Pleistocene and early-Holocene forest-steppe
   of temperate Eurasia.},

Title = {Density-dependent effect of allelopathy on germination and seedling
   emergence in two Ipomoea species},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Background Density in inter and intraspecific plant-plant interactions
   affects the action modes of allelopathy (autotoxicity, negative and
   positive allelopathy). Some seeds exude compounds that inhibit the
   germination of others. Ipomoea murucoides and I. pauciflora are
   sympatric tree species that form patches at the local scale where one or
   the other dominates, possibly due to allelopathy in the seeds. The
   objective of this study was to determine the possible density-dependence
   of the allelopathic effect among seeds of these species through the
   measure of seed germination and seedling emergence. Methods In both
   species, allelopathy was measured as: a) germination in mixed sowing of
   both species at different proportions, b) germination in single-species
   trials at different densities after adding seed extracts of both
   species, and c) seedling emergence in seed mixtures of both species sown
   at different proportions beneath canopies of the two Ipomoea species.
   Results Seed germination of I. murucoides was increased by the presence
   of I. pauciflora and diminished at higher densities of its own seeds;
   however, seed germination of I. pauciflora was not affected by the
   presence of I. murucoides seeds. The addition of extracts (either from
   conspecifics or congeneric) diminished the germination of both species
   and at higher seed densities the germination was lower. Seedling
   emergence did not depend on the species under which the seeds were sown
   nor on the density of the seeds. Conclusions The germination experiments
   evidenced positive allelopathy and/or autotoxicity, while there was no
   evidence of allelopathic effects in seedling emergence. The allelopathic
   activity is reported in the seeds of these species for the first time.},

Title = {Are Latin American ecologists recognized at the world level? A global
   comparison},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Background: Ioannidis et al. (2020) reported a standardized estimate of
   scientific productivity obtained from a worldwide database of 6,880,389
   scientists who published at least 5 papers picked up by the Scopus
   database, and elaborated a ranking of ca. 120,000 scientists by both
   whole trajectory (career-long) impact and their current impact at year
   2019. The goal of our paper is to contextualize Latin American
   ecologists' contribution at the world level based on the four most
   scientifically productive countries in the region.
   Methods and findings: Ioannidis et al. (2020) proposed a composite index
   that is the sum of six scientometric indicators: (1) The number of
   allocites, (2) the h index, (3) a per capita corrected version of h, (4)
   the allocites received as single author, (5) those received as single +
   first author, and (6) those as single + first + last author. We selected
   data for ecologists from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico and
   comparatively analyzed their productivity according to the proposed
   index. We also compared these data with those obtained from a global
   sample of the top ecologists worldwide.
   Conclusions: Based on Ioannidis et al.'s proposition to evaluate
   scientific productivity we extract three lessons: (1) It does not pay to
   publish many papers; what counts is the number of allocites (i.e.,
   self-citations do not add up). (2) Either be single, first, or last
   author; it does not pay to be in the middle of an authorship line. (3)
   Even worse it is to be among many co-authors because the proposed index
   allocates credits on a per capita basis.},

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: In this article we would like to touch on the key role
   played by the microbiota in the maintenance of a sustainable environment
   in the entire planet. For obvious reasons, this article does not intend
   to review thoroughly this extremely complex topic, but rather to focus
   on the main threats that this natural scenario is presently facing.
   Methods: Recent literature survey.
   Results: Despite the relevance of microorganisms have in our planet, the
   effects of climate change on microbial communities have been scarcely
   and not systematically addressed in literature. Although the role of
   microorganisms in emissions of greenhouse gases has received some
   attention, there are several microbial processes that are affected by
   climate change with consequences that are presently under assessment.
   Among them, host-pathogen interactions, the microbiome of built
   environment, or relations among plants and beneficial microbes.
   Conclusions: Further research is required to advance in knowledge of the
   effect of climate change on microbial communities. One of the main
   targets should be a complete evaluation of the global microbial
   functional diversity and the design of new strategies to cope with
   limitations in methods to grow microorganisms in the laboratory. These
   efforts should contribute to raise a general public awareness on the
   major role played by the microbiota on the various Earth ecosystems.},

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {397-408},
Abstract = {Biodiversity loss is one of the most serious global environmental
   problems caused by human activities. The intensification of agriculture
   and the increasing presence of monocultures is one of the main reasons
   for this. To study the long-term effects of maize monocultures compared
   to crop rotation systems on vegetation and biodiversity, two nearby
   sites in the small village of Metschach in Central Carinthia, Austria,
   were monitored for 30 years. These two test sites with intensively used
   arable land, divided into maize and crop rotation (14.5 ha in total)
   were taken out of production in 1989 as part of a nature conservation
   project. Changes in the composition and abundance of vascular plant
   species were recorded in 29 permanent plots. The monitoring showed that
   the previous use has long-lasting effects on species richness and
   ecological indicator values of the fallow land: The species numbers of
   the former maize field remained on average 10 species below those of the
   former crop rotation field over the entire study period. After 30 years,
   the plant communities in the former crop rotation revealed tendencies
   towards species-rich grassland communities, whereas in the former maize

Title = {Changes in plant diversity and carbon stocks along a succession from

Abstract = {Aims: The majority of research on the diversity-productivity
   relationship has utilized aboveground plant biomass as a measure of
   overall ecosystem productivity and investigated successions with
   species-poor early stages. During this study we modelled patterns of
   plant diversity and carbon pools along a succession from pasture
   abandonment to submediterranean Quercus cerris woodland and investigated
   ecosystem productivity using biomass and soil carbon. Study area: The
   hilly-mountainous area of Tolfa in Central Italy. Methods: We used
   chronosequences to analyse changes in vascular plant species richness
   and composition across successional stages and along a gradient of
   productivity (i.e. of increasing carbon stocks). To test possible
   differences across successional stages species richness and carbon pool
   data were analysed through analysis of variance. Mixed model regression
   analyses were used to test the effect of the amount of the carbon stocks
   on the variation in plant species richness and composition. Results: We
   found a high variation in plant species richness along the succession,
   with grasslands and newly formed woods showing the highest values. The
   amount of carbon in biomass and soil increased along the succession,
   even if soil carbon did not differ significantly among successional
   stages. Plant species richness was not dependent on the variation in the
   carbon pools (i.e. biomass and soil carbon) along the succession, while
   plant species composition significantly responded to this variation.
   Conclusions: Our results strongly support the need to manage
   semi-natural ecosystems through a multi-functional perspective that
   values both carbon sequestration and biodiversity.},

Title = {The vegetation of cushion peatlands in the Argentine Andes and changes
   in their floristic composition across a latitudinal gradient from 39
   degrees S to 22 degrees S},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {249-278},
Abstract = {The vegetation of the high-Andean cushion-plant peatlands is mainly
   characterized by the cushion-forming Juncaceae of the genus Oxychloe,
   Distichia and Patosia, as well as Cyperaceae of the genus Zameioscirpus.
   This particularity of Southern Hemisphere cushion peatlands is unique
   and exclusive to the high-Andean regions of South America. The floristic
   composition and site factors of 340 peatlands were studied between
   1995-2013 to investigate changes in the vegetation of the high Andean
   peatlands from its southernmost distribution in Argentina (39 degrees S,
   province of Neuquen) to the limit with Bolivia (22 degrees S, province
   of Jujuy). Site factors were characterized based on water samples. Data
   for precipitation and temperature conditions was obtained from the
   WorldClim 2.0 dataset. Cushion-plant species and their accompanying
   flora clearly reflect the changing ecological conditions along the
   marked climatic gradient from south to north. A group of species is
   limited to the southern region of the study area (provinces of Neuquen
   and Mendoza), and another group is limited almost exclusively to the
   northern region (provinces of San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Salta and
   Jujuy). Some Oxychloe species are distributed only in the transition
   zone between the winter and predominantly summer rainfall zone, however,
   many accompanying species show wide ecological amplitudes. The quality
   in the supply of minerals does not seem to play a decisive role in the
   differentiation of vegetation, except for the concentration of salts.
   Climatic conditions seem to be more relevant to the presence of the
   species. Our research shows that the survival of the plants is closely
   linked to the rainfall regime and seasonal temperature fluctuations.
   Similarly, the survival of plants and the potential formation of flowers
   and mature seeds depends on the presence of pollinators and species that
   disperse seeds (e.g. birds and camelids). Mobility by dispersion is also
   necessary for plant survival in the high Andean regions, which have
   experienced repeated climatic changes over the past centuries and
   millennia. This brought about the permanent displacement of the zoning
   of vegetation, and with it, the displacement of zones favorable for
   cushion-plant growth. The phylogenetic relationships and the spatial
   distribution suggest that the cushion-forming Juncaceae, depending on
   the evolution of climate, geomorphological processes and local site
   conditions, progressed step by step from the south to the north. Their
   current distribution is therefore largely understood as a result of
   short-term and long-term climatic changes.},

Abstract = {Large thematic databases of vegetation plots are increasingly needed for
   vegetation studies and biodiversity research. In this paper, we present
   the CircumMed Pine Forest Database (GIVD ID: EU-00-026), which in
   November 2018, comprised records from 6317 pine-dominated vegetation
   plots (releves) and associated vegetation types from 20 countries of the
   Mediterranean Basin, Near East and Crimea. These vegetation plots were
   collected through a detailed literature search for plots not previously
   included in the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), in order to fill
   geographic gaps in data coverage. The database comprises Mediterranean
   (including Oromediterranean) pine-forest vegetation plots from both
   published and unpublished sources. All vegetation plots are
   georeferenced, although coordinates vary in accuracy. The database is
   accessible through EVA or from its Custodian. We anticipate the
   CircumMed Pine Forest Database will be a valuable resource for various
   types of broad-scale studies in the fields of vegetation classification,
   plant invasion ecology, macroecology and biological conservation.},

Abstract = {Background Ecological restoration is a process that helps the recovery
   of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed. The
   success of restoration actions depend on the understanding of the
   processes, mechanisms and factors that guide vegetation dynamics. The
   restoration of plant communities can be made by unassisted (passive
   restoration, where the community recover by itself) and assisted (active
   restoration) ecological succession. It is imperative to know the scope
   of both types of activities to guide future restoration actions by
   evaluating the properties and functioning of the intervened communities.
   Methods Variance analysis of the carbon (C) stocks, basal area, canopy
   area, Shannon-Weaver index values, specific richness and abundance of
   three Tamaulipan thornscrub communities (assisted natural succession
   area, unassisted natural succession area and control area) was
   performed. Furthermore, a similarity analysis between the sampling areas
   using the floristic composition (abundance) was performed. Results In
   total, 11 families, 17 genera and 20 species of vascular plants were
   registered. The richness of species and abundance ranked as follows per
   area: assisted ecological natural succession > control > unassisted
   ecological natural succession. The species composition between sampling
   areas showed a low number of common species between plant communities.
   Conclusions The values of species richness, diversity, abundance, basal
   area, and canopy area of the assisted natural succession vegetal
   community was statistical similar to the control plan community. The
   values of C stocks showed that assisted ecological succession could
   recover not only structure and composition attributes but also this key
   ecosystem property.},

Title = {Aligning terrestrial habitat typology of Lebanon with EUNIS habitat
   classification},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {233-244},
Abstract = {The absence of nationally accepted typology to classify and describe
   habitats has been an obstacle to the development of coordinated research
   in this field and to the implementation of conservation actions;
   therefore, a classification of the natural and semi-natural terrestrial
   habitat types existing in Lebanon is presented and adapted to the
   hierarchical structure of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS)
   habitat classification. The harmonisation with an international
   classification system is essential to facilitate communication and
   research throughout the Mediterranean Basin. A total of 1597 sites
   surveyed throughout Lebanon between 2013 and 2020 were classified and
   described based on the analysis of the physiognomic parameters and
   specific composition of their vegetation. The analysis yielded 190
   habitat types for Lebanon, including 12 coastal habitats (category N),
   35 related to inland surface waters (C), 6 wetland habitats (Q), 20
   grasslands (R), 54 scrublands and heaths habitats (S), 27 types of
   woodlands (T), 17 inland unvegetated habitats (U), and 19 vegetated
   man-made habitats (V). Sixty-one habitats characteristic of Lebanon, not
   previously included in the EUNIS classification, were described and
   proposed in this typology. Those habitats include shrublands (23),
   woodlands (18), coastal habitats (6), wetlands (1), grasslands (9),
   sparsely vegetated habitats (2) and man-made vegetation (2).},

Title = {Point of view: error estimation in field assignment of land-cover types},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-148},
Abstract = {Questions: Substantial variation between observers has been found when
   comparing parallel land-cover maps, but how can we know which map is
   better? What magnitude of error and inter-observer variation is expected
   when assigning land-cover types and is this affected by the hierarchical
   level of the type system, observer characteristics, and ecosystem
   properties? Study area: Hvaler, south-cast Norway. Methods: Eleven
   observers assigned mapping units to 120 stratified random points. At
   each observation point, the observers first assigned a mapping unit to
   the point independently. The group then decided on a `true' reference
   mapping unit for that point. The reference was used to estimate total
   error. `Ecological distance' to the reference was calculated to grade
   the errors. Results: Individual observers frequently assigned different
   mapping units to the same point. Deviating assignments were often
   ecologically close to the reference. Total error, as percentage of
   assignments that deviated from the reference, was 35.0\% and 16.4\% for
   low and high hierarchical levels of the land-covertype system,
   respectively. The corresponding figures for inter-observer variation
   were 42.8\% and 19.4\%, respectively. Observer bias was found.
   Particularly high error rates were found for land-cover types
   characterised by human disturbance. Conclusions: Access to a `true'
   mapping unit for each observation point enabled estimation of error in
   addition to the inter-observer variation typically estimated by the
   standard pairwise comparisons method for maps and observers. Three major
   sources of error in the assignment of land-cover types were observed:
   dependence on system complexity represented by the hierarchical level of
   the land-cover-type system, dependence on the experience and personal
   characteristics of the observers, and dependence on properties of the
   mapped ecosystem. The results support the necessity of focusing on
   quality in land-cover mapping, among commissioners, practitioners and
   other end users.},

Title = {A floristic-ecological classification of the shrublands of the dry
   Bolivian Altiplano},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-208},
Abstract = {Aims: To identify shrubland types of the Bolivian Altiplano based on
   their floristic composition and on ecological factors. Location: Central
   and southern Bolivian Altiplano (Bolivia, central-western South
   America). Methods: Vascular plants were recorded in a field survey of
   101 releves (10 m(2)). Releves were subjected to hierarchical
   agglomerative classification to define numerical vegetation groups.
   Classification techniques were based on the beta-flexible linkage method
   (beta = -0.25) with Sorensen distance. The highest crispness values
   defined the level of the main number of clusters identified. Diagnostic
   species were identified by means of the phi coefficient of fidelity.
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test and a Z test
   were performed to assess the key ecological drivers of diversity in the
   Altiplano shrubland vegetation. Results: Based on numerical analyses of
   phytosociological releves, our work proposes four vegetation types of
   shrublands in the dry central and southern Bolivian Altiplano. They
   correspond to the following: tolillares - thickets of Fabiana densa - of
   the central-southern Altiplano with Junellia seriphioides; tolillares of
   the central-northern Altiplano with Lobivia pentlandii; lampayares -
   thickets of Lampayo castellani - with Parastrephia quadrangularis; and
   tolares - thickets of Parastrephia sp. pl . - with Parastrephia
   lepidophylla and Junellia minima. The bioclimatic variables were the
   ones best explaining the distribution patterns of the shrubland
   vegetation in the dry Bolivian Altiplano. Specifically, they separate
   the tolillares of the central-northern Altiplano with Lobivia pentlandii
   - at localities with a higher annual precipitation, annual ombrothermic
   index, and ombrothermic index of the wettest quarter - from the
   tolillares of the central-southern Altiplano with Junellia seriphioides.
   These bioclimatic gradients also position lampayares at localities with
   a lower than average value of annual precipitation, annual ombrothermic
   index, and ombrothermic index of the wettest quarter. Significant
   differences were found when comparing the topographic position, the
   degree of soil drainage and the frequency of flooding between the
   vegetation of tolillares on the one hand, and the vegetation of
   lampayares and tolares, on the other. Lampayares were exclusively
   related to sandy soils. Conclusions: Our four groups characterize
   variation within the habitat and elucidate bioclimatic gradients and
   soil features with related habitats. This knowledge could provide basic
   information on the vulnerability of different Altiplano shrubland
   habitats to climatic fluctuations, as this area is highly vulnerable to
   extreme periods of drought associated with the regional effects of
   climate change as well as to anthropogenic factors.},

Abstract = {Among the germination affecting factors, germination ecology (GME) and
   seed cleaning stage (SCS) are not well investigated. Hence, this study
   was initiated to evaluate the GME and SCS effect on the seed germination
   performance of two indigenous bamboo species. Pure and impure seed
   samples were taken from the cold room which is adjusted to 5 ??C. Then
   they were sown on prepared media under different conditions. Then the
   GP, MGT, and PV data were computed and then subjected to ANOVA. The
   ANOVA showed that the interaction effect of genotype, GME treatments,
   and SCS was very high (P ??? 0.0001) significant for all studied
   parameters. The germination pattern differences were also observed in
   SCS and GME treatments for both species. Signifi-cantly higher GP (59\%)
   and PV (8.4) were recorded in pure seeds sowed on paper at ambient
   temperature (T1) for O. abyssinica. On the same GME, Y. alpina gave the
   maximum GP (38\%) and PV (2.3) using pure seed. However, significantly
   higher MGT (9) was recorded on GME T1 and T2 using impure seed. Hence,
   pure seed sowed on paper at ambient temperature is advisable for in
   vitro germination test. However, GME having sand media at optimum
   temperature is recommended due to cost-effectiveness and is applicable
   at the community level for seedling production.},

Title = {Terrain impacts the composition of the persistent soil seed bank: A case
   study of steep high mountain grasslands in the Greater Caucasus, Georgia},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-63},
Abstract = {Aims: Under global climate and land use change, the vegetation layer of
   steep high mountain slopes is prone to increasing disturbance via
   erosion and mass-wasting events. The ecological restoration and
   stabilization of an intact vegetation layer on steep slopes with the
   soil seed bank is therefore an important factor for functional high
   mountain ecosystems. We analyze the relationships between the soil seed
   bank composition, topography, and land use and compare the plant species
   composition of the aboveground vegetation to the soil seed bank. Study
   area: Stepantsminda, Georgia, Greater Caucasus (1,800-2,500 m a.s.l.).
   Methods: 74 grassland vegetation releves (5 x 5 m) on steep high
   mountain slopes were compared to the respective persistent soil seed
   bank (05 cm depth), assessed via the seedling emergence method.
   Non-metric multidimensional scaling and vector fitting uncovered the
   relationships between topography, land use, and soil on the seed bank
   and aboveground vegetation composition. The similarity between both
   datasets was assessed with a Mantel test. Vegetation types were
   described with indicator species analysis for both aboveground and
   belowground plant species composition. Results: Exposure to the north
   and incoming solar radiation relate to seed bank composition, as well as
   the belowground species diversity, whereas the effect of land use on the
   soil seed bank remains unclear. The similarity between the aboveground
   vegetation and the soil seed bank is generally low (18\% shared species,
   Mantel test r = 0.21, no common indicator species). Conclusions: The
   higher seed density and belowground species richness on intensively
   illuminated and pastured south-exposed slopes imply a higher restoration
   potential in the case of disturbance events such as mass-wasting.
   However, the overall moderate diversity within the soil seed bank
   challenges the restoration of the aboveground grassland, especially on
   north-exposed slopes.},

Abstract = {The mountain ecosystem is a perfect podium to investigate the impact of
   climate change on overall community structure and species composition.
   The Potohar region in Pakistan was chosen to study changes in
   grass-species diversity and the distributional pattern along an
   altitudinal range of 1000 m (from 400 m to 1400 m). The major objectives
   of the study were to prepare grass-species listing and species
   composition, and patterns of their dominance and distribution at various
   habitats. Three sites separated by a distance of 50 km were selected at
   each altitude and three transect lines (each of 100 m) were laid at a
   distance of 500 m. Then five sub-transect lines were laid at distance of
   50 m on which five quadrats (1 x 1 m(2)) were laid systematically with a
   distance of 10 m between the successive quadrats. The diversity of the
   grass species is high and 114 species were recorded therein. Six
   grasses, Aristida adscensionis, Cynodon dactylon, Chrysopogon
   serrulatus, Cymbopogon jwarancusa, Dichanthium annulatum and Panicum
   orientale, are widely distributed at all altitudinal ranges. Species
   like A. adscensionis, Cenchrus ciliaris, C. jwarancusa, C. dactylon,
   Ochthochloa compressa, Panicum antidotale, Paspalum distichum and
   Phragmites karka dominate because of their high degree of tolerance to
   multiple stresses. These dominant grasses are highly palatable and
   support livestock and endemic wildlife species. The distributional range
   of other grasses is altitudinal-specific and is directly linked to the
   physiographic parameters and climate variables that influence species
   richness, dominance, community structure and species distributional
   pattern along altitudinal gradients. Over-harvesting for essential oil
   and other medicinal purposes are identified as major threats to species
   like Cymbopogon martini and Chrysopogon zizanioides. The findings of
   this study are useful in investigating the composition of grass species
   of the sub-mountainous rangelands and in developing conservation
   strategies for rare and endangered species in future studies.},

Pages = {235-248},
Abstract = {Question: Caves are unique ecosystems with a peculiar biota that include
   cyanobacteria and algae. The studies on cyanobacterial-algal cenoses
   (CAC) in caves are scarce, and no comparisons between CAC of cave and
   surface ecosystems have yet been made. Are there any differences between
   the CAC of cave and surface ecosystems? Study area: Data were collected
   from the hydrological system of the Shulgan River, including the
   Shulgan-Tash (Kapova) cave, in the South Urals, Russia. Methods:
   Forty-one samples were collected from across five sites, including
   surface and underground habitats, between 2000-2006 and in 2013.
   Cyanobacteria and algae species composition in the samples was
   identified by light microscopy. CAC were classified according to the
   Braun-Blanquet approach and PCA analysis. Results: In the investigated
   sites of the Shulgan River, 117 species and intraspecific taxa of
   cyanobacteria and algae belonging to five divisions were identified. Of
   syntaxa, the Meridionetum circulare nom. nov. (Naviculetea gregariae
   class) was described in the surface habitats upstream of the Shulgan
   River. In the Shulgan-Tash cave, the Hantzschio amphioxys-Nitzschietum
   paleae association (Mychonastetea homosphaerae class) was found. In the
   surface habitats of the lower current of the Shulgan River, after the
   Shulgan-Tash cave, the Tribonemetum viride ass. nova (Naviculetea
   gregariae class) was found. PCA analysis corroborated the results of the
   syntaxonomy analysis and revealed two main factors influencing the
   floristic composition of the investigated communities: the type of
   bottom sediment and light intensity. In the surface habitats of the
   Shulgan River, Bacillariophyta dominated, whereas cyanobacteria,
   diatoms, and green algae dominated the underground hydrological system.
   Conclusions: The CAC of the underground hydrological system of the
   Shulgan River in the Shulgan-Tash cave system differ from those of the
   river's surface hydrological system at all levels of the syntaxonomic
   hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Background Restoration practices usually emphasize on the structural
   part of the biodiversity; also, most studies have focused on plants and
   very few have been conducted on arthropods and its function after
   restoration. The Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve (PSAER) is a
   protected area immersed in Mexico City and it has been drastically
   affected by different anthropogenic disturbances. The aim of this study
   was to compare the relative diversity, richness, and abundance of
   species level identification, but also the composition through an
   analysis of ordination of taxonomic (species, family, and order level)
   and functional (trophic guild) traits of arthropods in three sites
   subjected to ecological restoration within the PSAER. Restored sites
   were also compared to conserved and disturbed sites, to evaluate whether
   restoration efforts are effective at the reserve. Methods Arthropods
   were sampled using pan traps during September 2013 in 11 sites (three
   restored, four conserved and four disturbed) inside the PSAER. All
   sampled species were taxonomically identified at species of
   morphospecies (inside a family) and assigned to a trophic guild.
   Differences in diversity, richness and abundance were evaluated through
   effective number of species, comparisons of Chao's1 estimated richness
   and a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively. Both taxonomic
   and trophic guild composition were evaluated using a multivariate
   analysis and a post hoc test. Results We found some differences in
   richness, abundance, and diversity between sites, but not a clear
   pattern of differentiation between restored to disturbed sites. The NMDS
   showed differences at species and order level, and with trophic guilds,
   among site types. Families were not useful to differentiate types of
   sites. Regarding guilds, predators were more abundant in conserved
   sites, while phytophagous insects were more abundant in disturbed sites.
   Conclusions Species and order level were useful to identify differences
   in communities of arthropods in sites with different management. The
   trophic guild approach provides information about the functional state
   of the restored sites. Nevertheless, our quick evaluation shows that
   restoration efforts at PSAER have not been successful in differentiate
   restored to disturbed sites yet.},

Title = {Avocado crops as a floral resource for native bees of Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Background Chile is the second largest avocado producer in the world.
   However, there have been few studies on interactions between native bees
   and avocado pollination in a Chilean environment. The flowering period
   of avocado is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations and so
   environmental conditions, particularly cool temperatures, can have a
   strong influence on its floral behaviour. Thus, we aimed to determine
   whether temperature also influences bee visitation rates to avocado
   flowers or if this was due to the number of available flowers. Moreover,
   we proposed to verify the attractiveness of avocado flowers to native
   bees and compare flower handling time and type of floral resource
   collected between managed and native bees. Methods An avocado orchard of
   ``Hass{''} cultivar located in the Mediterranean region of Chile was
   studied during the flowering season of 2016. The frequency of exotic and
   native bee species in flowers, floral phenology, and environmental
   temperature were analysed, and the foraging behaviours of exotic and
   native bee species in avocado flowers compared. Results Five Chilean
   native and two exotic species were recorded visiting avocado flowers at
   the studied orchard. The bees generally sought nectar rather than
   pollen. The European honeybee (Apis mellifera) was the most frequent
   flower visitor, followed by the native species Colletes cyanescens and
   Cadeguala occidentalis. There was a strong positive correlation between
   temperature and number of visits, but no significant correlation between
   number of open flowers and number of visits. Conclusions Native Chilean
   bees visited avocado flowers and some of them were frequent floral
   visitors. They generally sought for nectar rather than pollen and were
   as fast as honeybees handling avocado flowers. The environmental
   temperature plays a key role in the frequency of bees in avocado
   flowers. The warmer weather is related to the higher number of bees
   visits to avocado flowers.},

Title = {Fragmentation of Chilean Andean rivers: expected effects of hydropower
   development},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {BackgroundFragmentation (establishment of barriers e.g., hydropower
   dams, reservoirs for irrigation) is considered one of the greatest
   threats to conservation of river systems worldwide. In this paper we
   determine the fragmentation status of central Chilean river networks
   using two indices, namely Fragmentation Index (FI) and Longest Fragment
   (LF). These are based on the number of barriers and their placement as
   well as river length available for fish movement. FI and LF were applied
   to eight Andean river basins of central Chile in order to assess their
   natural, current (2018) and future (2050) fragmentation at the doorstep
   of a hydropower boom. Subsequently, we exemplify the use of these
   indices to evaluate different placement scenarios of new hydropower dams
   in order to maximize hydropower use and at the same time minimize impact
   on fish communities.ResultsIn the natural scenario 4 barriers
   (waterfalls) were present. To these 4 barriers, 80 new ones of
   anthropogenic origin were added in the current (2018) scenario, whereas
   377 new barriers are expected in near future (2050). Therefore, compared
   to the natural' scenario, in 2050 we expect 115-fold increase in
   fragmentation in analysed river systems, which is clearly reflected by
   the increase of the FI values in time. At the same time, the LF
   diminished by 12\% on average in the future scenario. The fastest
   increase of fragmentation will occur in small and medium rivers that
   correspond to 1st, 2nd and 3rd Strahler orders. Finally, case study on
   configuration of potential hydropower plants in the Biobio basin showed
   that hydropower output would be maximized and negative effects on fish
   communities minimised if new hydropower plants would be located in
   tributaries of the upper basin.ConclusionsFragmentation of Chilean
   Andean river systems is expected to severely increase in near future,
   affecting their connectivity and ecological function as well as
   resilience to other anthropogenic stressors. Indices proposed here
   allowed quantification of this fragmentation and evaluation of different
   planning scenarios. Our results suggest that in order to minimise their
   environmental impact, new barriers should be placed in tributaries in
   the upper basin and river reaches above existing barriers.},

Title = {Macrofauna community patterns in a Chiloe Island channel used intensely
   for aquaculture: the ecological status of its benthic environment},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},

Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Background It is known that aquaculture may produce negative
   environmental effects on marine ecosystems. Southern Chile is one of the
   most important salmon and mussel-producing areas in the world. Here we
   assess the ecological status of benthic communities near farming centers
   in Caucahue Channel, Chiloe, which has been used intensely for salmon
   and mussel production for 30 years. Methods The macrofauna, sediments
   and water column were characterized at distances of 5 to 100 m from
   three salmon and three mussel-producing centers. Information was also
   obtained from reference sites 500 to 3000 m from these aquaculture
   farms. The macrofauna and environmental conditions during winter were
   analyzed using uni- and multivariate analysis and the AZTI Marine Biotic
   Index (AMBI) as an indicator of benthic community condition. Results (i)
   There is a high degree of spatial dissimilarity in macrofauna and
   environmental variables among sampling sites and types of environments
   (far from or near farming centers) and between the northern and southern
   areas of the channel; (ii) sediment structure (mean grain size and
   percentage of total organic matter) correlated with the observed
   dissimilarities in macrofauna communities; and (iii) the level of
   perturbation according to AMBI was heterogeneous, with sites in the
   undisturbed/normal range to moderately disturbed/polluted. Conclusions
   We found a high spatial dissimilarity in benthic macrofauna and
   environmental variables among sampling sites, environmental types and
   between the northern and southern areas of the channel. AMBI and
   multivariate community-environment analysis are useful tools to define
   the level of perturbation of a geographic area at different spatial
   scales, using all the ecological information from each sample and
   replicates.},

Abstract = {This study examines species composition, diversity and plant community
   distribution along environmental gradients of Tulu Lafto Forest (here
   after called TLF) in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone of Oromia National
   Regional State, western Ethiopia. Seventy-five quadrats of 400 m(2) were
   systematically laid following altitudinal gradient. A complete list of
   trees, shrubs, lianas and herbs including vascular epiphytes were made
   from each quadrat. Environmental variables including soil samples were
   collected, recorded and analyzed for each quadrat. In the forest, 230
   plant species belonging to 188 genera and 79 families were identified.
   Out of these, 16 species are endemic to the flora of Ethiopia and
   Eritrea and 56 were new records for Wollega (WG) floristic region.
   Asteraceae and Fabaceae are the top species rich plant families. Cluster
   analysis and ordination methods identified 3 plant community types
   mainly influenced by topographic, edaphic and anthropogenic factors. TLF
   exhibited an intermediate Afromontane type suggesting the need to revise
   the existing vegetation classification in the country.},

Title = {Gradients, species richness and biogeographical links of steppe
   grasslands in Western Podolia (Ukraine)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},

Volume = {49},

Pages = {349-367},
Abstract = {Aims: Western Podolia is one of several regions in the Eurasian
   forest-steppe zone where diverse steppe vegetation has been relatively
   well preserved. Our aims were to describe compositional turnover of
   steppe vegetation along different environmental gradients, to identify
   the patterns of species richness and evenness across complete
   compositional gradients and to outline biogeographical links of Western
   Podolian forest-steppe, with the emphasis on the generally rare mesic
   steppe types. Study area: Western Podolia and adjacent regions of
   Western Ukraine. Methods: Two independent datasets of vegetation plots
   and environmental variables were classified using modified TWINSPAN and
   ordinated using DCA and CCA. Diagnostic, constant and dominant species
   were identified. Ecological elements were quantified using Didukh
   indicator values. Biogeographical analysis was based on an extensive
   review of literature and NMDS of species frequency data sourced from
   studies covering a large part of Central and Eastern Europe. Results:
   The main gradients in species composition correspond to ecological
   gradients of 1) topographically controlled moisture and nutrient
   availability and 2) disturbance and human impact. The first gradient
   ranges from low-productive dry stands dominated by narrow-leaved tufted
   grasses, through dry-mesic stands co-dominated by broad-leaved grasses
   and herbs, to highproductive dry-mesic to mesic stands co-dominated by
   tall herbs and broad-leaved grasses. The second gradient tends towards
   communities altered by intensive human use. Species richness of steppe
   grasslands may be extremely high and has a unimodal relationship with
   estimated productivity. It peaks at mesic sites, in places with high
   evenness of species abundances. Conclusions: The remaining steppe
   fragments in Western Podolia are nowadays partly burnt, partly grazed,
   rarely mown and partly unmanaged. They harbour a number of rare
   light-demanding species and species reaching their distributional limits
   within the study area. Exceptional diversity of the grasslands may
   originate from Early Holocene or Pleistocene forest-steppe communities.},

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-298},
Abstract = {Aims: We aimed to detect the environmental drivers conditioning plant
   diversity and to predict how modifications in habitat conditions and
   ongoing global warming could lead to vegetation changes or biodiversity
   losses in a region especially rich in peatlands despite its relatively
   low latitude. Study area: The study area was located in the Northern
   Apennines, Northern Italy (about 44 degrees 45' N; 10 degrees 20' E).
   The vegetation study was carried out at 12 peatland sites where 206
   plots were set up. Species composition in the 206 plots were recorded in
   the field and classified with cluster analysis. Data on hydrology, water
   chemistry and peat chemistry were collected at a subset of 127 plots and
   statistically analysed by a multivariate ordination method. Species
   richness and evenness were calculated for all plots. Relationships
   between species composition and environmental variables were analysed by
   stepwise multiple regression. Results: The cluster analysis defined 17
   vegetation units. Water table depth represented the major environmental
   factors accounting for vegetation patterns, with the vegetation units
   being grouped in four main blocks based on vegetation physiognomy and
   species composition: Sphagnum hummocks, Sphagnum lawns, fens and pools.
   Water chemistry and peat chemistry both presented moderate variations
   among the vegetation units with mean water pH ranging from 4.9 to 6.3.
   Concentrations of major cations in the pore water showed that all of the
   habitats investigated were influenced by telluric water, with no
   evidence of ombrotrophic conditions. Species richness and evenness both
   presented poor relations with the environment while responses of
   individual species to environmental factors were more informative on
   vegetation changes triggered by climate change. Conclusions: Prolonged
   drought events associated with high temperature in summer months are
   expected to exert a strong impact on peatland vegetation. The main
   effect of climate change on the vegetation of the peatlands investigated
   consists in the spreading of vascular plants at the expense of Sphagnum
   mosses.},

Title = {Characterization of the herbaceous layer in woody thickets of Geoffroea
   decorticans in central Pampean grasslands},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-311},
Abstract = {Questions: Woody encroachment is a complex ecological phenomenon, which
   modifies the composition and diversity of species, productivity, carbon
   storage and cycling, water dynamics, among others. In Argentina's
   semiarid grasslands, an increase in the range of distribution and the
   density of the woody species Geoffroea decorticans has been observed
   since the last decades. The aims of this research were: a) to classify
   the woody thickets dominated by Geoffroea decorticans, b) to relate the
   floristic and functional composition of the herbaceous layer to
   environmental characteristics, and c) to compare the functional
   composition between thickets and grassland vegetation. Study area: The
   study was conducted in the grasslands of the semiarid western extreme of
   the Pampas phytogeographical region. Methods: Seventy three woody
   thickets were surveyed recording the cover of all herbaceous species,
   light interception under tree canopies and the environmental context
   surrounding (i.e. natural grassland, pastures and annual crops). A
   cluster analysis was carried out to classify the thickets, and the
   composition of major functional groups was compared among cluster
   groups. To order the sampling sites along a gradient, and to evaluate
   the environmental context as constraint external variables a Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis was carried out. Finally, richness, diversity,
   exotic and annual species' richness, and shared species was compared
   between woody thickets and grassland vegetation based on bibliographic
   records. Results: The cluster analysis classified woody thickets into
   four groups. The environmental context surrounding the woody thickets
   and light interception explain 83.7\% of the observed floristic
   composition variability. Palatable species had a significantly higher
   cover than non-palatable ones. Woody thickets had more richness and
   diversity, mainly by a higher number of annual and exotic species.
   Conclusions: The increase in woody cover would increase the
   heterogeneity, richness and diversity of natural vegetation. But, at the
   same time, it would favour the entrance of exotics and annuals.},

Title = {Intermediate evergreen Afromontane forest (IAF) in northwestern
   Ethiopia: observations, description and modelling its potential

Abstract = {Question: In the most recent vegetation map of Ethiopia, the vegetation
   was classified into 19 types and subtypes. Uncertainty exists, however,
   about the classification of some areas, including forests of the
   northwestern Ethiopia and particularly Awi Zone, Zege Peninsula and
   Islands of Lake Tana. Do these forests belong to the established
   vegetation types of Ethiopia or to a new vegetation type? Study area:
   Primary data was collected from the forests of Awi Zone and secondary
   data from Zege Peninsula and the Islands of Lake Tana, in northwestern
   Ethiopia. Potential vegetation distribution modelling was accomplished
   for the entire country of Ethiopia. Methods and results: For vegetation
   data sampling, a total of 154 plots along 36 line transects, with total
   area of 6.16 ha, were investigated in Guangua-Illala and Khatasa forests
   in Awi. Climate and soil data were acquired from freely available online
   sources (WORLDCLIM and SOILGRIDS). Generally, four major steps were
   followed to determine if a new vegetation type is warranted: 1)
   floristic composition of the study area was investigated and compared
   with other study areas/vegetations (similarity analysis); 2) plant
   communities were classified and indicator species identified for each
   community in the study area (community analysis); 3) the indicator
   species were used in the potential distribution modelling and mapping
   (MaxEnt modelling); and 4) ground-truthing was carried out for the new
   vegetation type. The forests of the study area, Zege Peninsula and
   Islands of Lake Tana were found to be highly similar with the Dry
   evergreen Afromontane forest (DAF) and Moist evergreen Afromontane
   forest (MAF) except the absence of primary elements of the DAF and MAF
   in those forests. Vegetation distribution modelling showed highly
   similar forests are distributed in the Gojam and Gondar Floristic
   Regions. Those areas were also found to have an
   intermediate/transitional climate type between the MAF and DAF of
   Ethiopia. Conclusion: The results of the vegetation comparisons and
   distribution modelling showed the forests in Awi, Islands of Lake Tana,
   Zege Peninsula and the surrounding areas belong to a new vegetation type
   we named Intermediate evergreen Afromontane forest (IAF). The majority
   of the new vegetation type includes forests from the DAF and some
   forests from the MAF.},

Title = {New insights on plant communities and flora of the southern paramos of
   the Iberian Range (Spain)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {371-382},
Abstract = {Aims: In the Iberian Peninsula, high and flat areas called `paramos' are
   of great ecological interest, due to their unique but little known plant
   and animal communities. In this work, we contribute to the knowledge of
   plant composition and carry out a classification of plant communities in
   central Iberian natural `paramos'. Study area: Two Special Areas of
   Conservation (Natura 2000 Network) in Southern Soria (Spain): `Altos de
   Barahona' and `Paramo de Layna'. Methods: We sampled the vegetation
   (plant cover) in 345 plots of 1 m2 in the two `paramos' considered. A
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering of samples and an indicator value
   (IndVal) analysis were performed to classify the plant communities and
   to determine the most characteristic species of each community. Results:
   A total of 193 species, mainly chamaephytes, were found. Most of these
   are species of Mediterranean biogeographical affinity, with a high
   percentage of Iberian endemism. Plots were hierarchically classified
   into three main clusters, which in turn, successfully aggregated into
   seven subclusters reflecting characteristic visually-known plant
   communities of these `paramos': grassland-thyme scrublands of Thymus
   mastigophorus; savory scrublands of Satureja intricata; two types of
   mixed communities dominated by continental basophilic shrubs; gorse
   shrublands of Genista pumila subsp. rigidissima; praire-thyme scrublands
   of Thymus zygis subsp. zygis; and sage scrublands of Salvia
   lavandulifolia subsp. lavandulifolia. These plant communities, located
   in unique landscapes mainly in Iberia and other parts of Europe, should
   be subject to conservation and restoration measures, in order to
   maintain their ecological value and avoid the loss of unique species.},

Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study is to classify and characterize the plant
   communities of the thermophilous oak forests in Bulgaria and to reveal
   the gradients in their floristic composition and ecology. Study area:
   The whole Bulgarian territory. Methods: Phytosociological classification
   of 716 releves collected using Braun-Blanquet's approach in oak forests
   from the Black Sea coasts to the upper limit of the deciduous oak
   forests (1200-1400 m a.s.l.). The releves data set has been subjected to
   numerical analysis. Results: 19 associations and subassociations and two
   communities were identified. Six new associations and three new
   subassociations were proposed. They have been assigned to the following
   alliances: Quercion confertae, Quercion petraeao-cerridis, Carpinion
   orientalis and to the new alliance Trachystemono orientalis-Carpinion
   betuli. Conclusions: The diversity and the ecological status of the oak
   forests in Bulgaria highlight the urgent need for their protection. They
   are in poor condition mostly due to the millennial tradition of
   fellings, coppicing, burning and grazing. Further research is required
   to investigate their diversity, ecology and dynamics - in order to gain
   the knowledge needed for their conservation, management and restoration.},

Title = {Chronostratigraphic Revision of the Cloverly Formation (Lower

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-40},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Cloverly Formation is an important geologic unit for understanding
   the development of North American terrestrial landscapes and ecosystems,
   but the age of this unit is poorly constrained. We report U-Pb
   radiometric dates determined by laser ablation inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and chemical abrasion thermal
   ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) from euhedral zircons derived
   from fluvial sandstone and bentonitic claystone. We reanalyzed published
   biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and radiometric datasets, which have
   generally disregarded younger (late Albian-Cenomanian) ages for the
   formation. New data reported in this study suggest that deposition of
   the Cloverly Formation spanned the Valanginian-Cenomanian stages (ca.
   140 Ma-98 Ma), a longer time interval than the commonly cited
   Aptian-Albian depositional timeframe. The lowest member of the Cloverly
   Formation, the Pryor Conglomerate, was deposited ca. 140-130 Ma in
   response to the onset of the Sevier Orogeny shedding sediment from the
   west. The overlying Little Sheep Mudstone Member was deposited ca.
   124-109 Ma in a time of low sediment supply. In the mid-late Albian to
   early Cenomanian (ca. 109-98 Ma), sediment sourced from the east was
   deposited as the Himes Member and Greybull Sandstone. Following this,
   the Sykes Mountain Formation began nearshore deposition as the Western
   Interior Seaway transgressed from the north. Our revised
   chronostratigraphic framework for the Cloverly Formation is congruent
   with tectonic subsidence analysis showing a rapid increase in
   accommodation space in the mid-Albian. We hypothesize that more
   intensive sampling may yield multiple fossil assemblages withal the
   formation, paralleling its correlates to the south. Furthermore, we
   hypothesize that some poorly represented taxa will be synonymized with
   taxa from those same units now that their temporal equivalence has been
   demonstrated.},

Title = {Postcranial Skeletal Variation in Pencil-tailed Tree Mice (Rodentia:

Abstract = {Pencil-tailed Tree Mice (Muridae: Chiropodomys) are small arboreal
   mammals endemic to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. They are capable
   of manual and pedal grasping and have nails rather than claws on their
   pollex and hallux, but their limb morphology has never been analyzed
   from functional, ecogeographic, or taxonomic perspectives. We compared
   two species of Chiropodomys to the similarly sized but terrestrial Mus
   musculus using quantitative morphometric osteological data recorded from
   six limb bones. Principal components analysis (PCA) clearly separated
   Chiropodomys from Mus. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed
   several features linked to arboreality in Chiropodomys and
   characteristics associated with terrestriality in Mus. These include a
   wide medial epicondyle and shallow knee in Chiropodomys and a long
   olecranon process, long greater trochanter, and deep knee in Mus. PCA
   also distinguished mainland C. gliroides from island C. calamianensis of
   the Palawan Faunal Region, with the latter exhibiting larger body size,
   as predicted by the island rule. Finally, PCA clearly separated
   northeastern C. gliroides specimens collected north of the Isthmus of
   Kra from southwestern specimens collected on the Malay Peninsula south
   of the Isthmus of Kra; these preliminary results may indicate that there
   are two distinct taxa in this sample, but this must be tested with more
   specimens and data. Overall, our study revealed functional differences
   related to substrate preference, larger body size in an island endemic
   species, and postcranial evidence for an additional mainland taxon.},

Abstract = {Verrill described Astropecten comptus and Astropecten nitidus 100 years
   ago. The species have been accepted and have been reported off the east
   coast of North America and South America, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of
   Mexico. The validity of the species has never been questioned. Because
   we had difficulty distinguishing A. comptus from A. articulatus and A.
   nitidus from A. cingulatus, we examined basic morphological diagnostic
   characteristics in astropectens of the neotype of A. articulatus, the
   holotype of A. cingulatus, the paralectotype of A. comptus, the holotype
   of A. nitidus, the holotype of A. nitidus forcipatus, and many specimens
   that had been identified as A. cingulatus, A. nitidus, A. articulatus,
   A. comptus, and other Astropecten species of the West Atlantic Region.
   We conclude that A. comptus is a synonym of A. articulatus and A.
   nitidus is a synonym of A. cingulatus. This has implications for current
   concepts of zoogeography and biodiversity in the region and for the

Abstract = {Herein as a preface to Jukar's ongoing comprehensive systematic review,
   we introduce the fossil vertebrate collection made by G. Edward Lewis in
   1932 as part of the Yale-North India Expedition to British India, and
   briefly discuss its historical and scientific significance. The
   collection, which consists of approximately 1,300 specimens collected
   from 106 sites, was made 100 years after the first fossils were reported
   by Europeans in the Siwalik deposits of the Indian subcontinent, and
   includes several important specimens, most notably fossil primates.
   Studies of the fossils collected by Lewis on this 1932 expedition have
   had a substantial and long-lasting influence on Siwalik paleontology,
   and motivated much subsequent work in this region by both western and
   local Indian and Pakistani researchers. Studies of primate specimens
   collected and first described by Lewis have also heavily influenced the
   field of paleoanthropology and debates surrounding the origin of our
   species.},

Abstract = {Placobdella pediculata Hemingway, 1908 was originally described from
   individuals that were attached to Aplodinotus grunniens (freshwater

   in the type locality facilitated redescription of P. pediculata.
   Placobdella pediculata is different from its congeners in that its
   caudal sucker is extended from the body by a pedicel (peduncle), bears
   digitate processes near the rim of the caudal sucker, a smooth body
   surface, and its anal placement (few annuli anteriad of the caudal
   sucker). Molecular comparison of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence
   data from P. pediculata revealed differences of 13.8\% to 17.4\% among
   congeners. Placobdella pediculata is a distinct species.},

Title = {The Hydrozoan Taxa (Cnidaria) of Addison Emery Verrill (1839-1926), with
   a Checklist of His Records of Hydroids and Hydromedusae},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},

Pages = {41-79},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A review is given of the zoological names and current taxonomic status
   of two genera and 21 species-group taxa of hydroids attributed in this
   work to Addison Emery Verrill of the United States. Information is
   provided on type localities of his new species, and on locations and
   kinds of type material known to exist. The genus Blastothela Verrill,
   1878 is held to be congeneric with Candelabrum de Blainville, 1830, and
   its type species, B. rosea Verrill, 1878, is provisionally assigned to
   the synonymy of C. phrygium (Fabricius, 1780). Syntypes of Halecium
   robustum Verrill, 1873a, once thought lost, have been rediscovered at
   the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University and the
   Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and an earlier neotype
   designation of the species is set aside. Sertularia achilleae Verrill,
   in Coues and Yarrow, 1878, a widely overlooked nominal species, is taken
   to be conspecific with Tridentata marginata (Kirchenpauer, 1864).
   Sertularia carolinensis Verrill, 1872b, another poorly known species, is
   recognized as valid and a senior synonym of Thuiaria plumulifera Allman,
   1877. A review is given of the taxonomic and nomenclatural status of the
   polyseriate sertulariid genera Pericladium Allman, 1876 and Polyserias
   Mereschkowsky, 1877. Authorship and date of the binomen Laomedea
   angulata, usually attributed to Thomas Hincks with a date of 1861, is
   shown to have been made available earlier by Hincks in an 1859 article.
   Plumularia gracillima G.O. Sars, 1873, assigned at present to the
   halopteridid genus Polyplumaria G.O. Sars, 1874, is taken to be a
   plumulariid. It is provisionally returned to Plumularia Lamarck, 1816,
   although that genus is considered polyphyletic and in need of revision.
   Bibliographic work was undertaken to determine, as accurately as
   possible, dates of publication of the 47 papers authored by Verrill
   containing information on hydroids and hydromedusae. An annotated
   checklist of 138 species of hydrozoans reported in those works,
   including 47 anthoathecates, 90 leptothecates, and 1 trachymedusa, is
   included as an appendix.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Percina freemanorum, the Etowah Bridled Darter, is described as a new
   species endemic to the Etowah River system in Georgia, specifically in
   Long Swamp Creek, Amicalola Creek, and the upper portion of the Etowah
   River. The earliest collection records for Percina freemanorum date to
   1948 and in 2007 the species was delimited as populations of Percina
   kusha. Our investigation into the systematics of Percina kusha is
   motivated by the uncertain status of populations in the Coosawattee
   River system and observed morphological disparity in several meristic
   traits between populations in the Conasauga and Etowah River systems.
   Our analyses of morphological divergence, nuclear genotypes, and
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype networks confirm the distinctiveness
   of Percina freemanorum. Morphologically, Percina freemanorum is
   distinguished from Percina kusha through lower average numbers of
   lateral line scales (65.4 vs. 72.3); rows of transverse scales (18.0 vs.
   21.4); scales around the caudal peduncle (22.1 vs. 24.9); and modally
   more pectoral fin rays (14 vs. 13). The two species are not reciprocally
   monophyletic in phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences, but the two
   species do not share mtDNA haplotypes. Analysis of up to 158,000 double
   digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing loci resolve
   each of the two species as reciprocally monophyletic and genomic
   clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms identifies two
   genetic clusters that correspond to the morphologically delimited
   Percina freemanorum and Percina kusha.},

Title = {Are Geckos Paratenic Hosts for Caribbean Island Acanthocephalans?
   Evidence from Gonatodes antillensis and a Global Review of Squamate
   Reptiles Acting as Transport Hosts},

Abstract = {It is well known that reptiles can act as paratenic hosts for parasites
   that use mammals as their definitive hosts. However, studies of
   potential paratenic hosts in the Caribbean have been temporally
   restricted to only diurnal species of lizards, thereby neglecting a
   dominant component of the nocturnal reptilian community: geckos. Many
   gecko species are human commensals with activity periods that overlap
   temporally with those of domestic cats, making them prime candidates as
   potential transport hosts for cat parasites. However, no studies have
   reported geckos as paratenic hosts for fetid parasites on any Caribbean
   island. Here we report the first records of subcutaneous
   oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths on the Venezuelan Coastal Clawed Gecko
   (Gonatodes antillensis) based on specimens collected in Curacao and
   Bonaire. The cysts were identified as belonging to the genus Oncicola,
   likely those of Oncicola venezuelensis. This study reports these geckos
   as a new host record for oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths, as well as
   Curacao and Bonaire as new geographic locales for these acanthocephalan
   parasites. We additionally provide a review of saurian cystacanths,
   comparing the restricted taxonomic focus of transport hosts in Caribbean
   islands to the distribution of paratenic squamate hosts both in the
   Neotropics and globally. We find evidence that the ability of squamate
   reptiles to act as transport hosts is a pervasive feature across their
   Tree of Life, suggesting that these animals may serve as important
   vectors for transporting parasites between intermediate and definitive
   hosts.},

Title = {Pedal Skeletal Proportions of Bipedal and Potentially Bipedal Dinosaurs

Abstract = {Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic
   continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be
   associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of
   some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed)
   footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most
   paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some
   workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph
   ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is
   usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead
   attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a
   pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of
   the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal
   dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously
   available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those
   of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges
   from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of
   both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of
   prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal
   sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these
   features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit
   I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some
   pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all)
   morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been
   made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to
   determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.},

Title = {The Geographic Distribution of the Imperiled Barrens Darter, Etheostoma

   Darter, Etheostoma crossopterum},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Volume = {61},

Pages = {3-21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Barrens Darter, Etheostoma forbesi, is one of the most
   geographically restricted freshwater fish species in North America, with
   a distribution limited to headwater portions of nine streams in the
   western part of the upper Caney Fork, a tributary of the Cumberland
   River in Tennessee. This limited geographic distribution makes
   Etheostoma forbesi especially vulnerable to potential threats posed by
   human alterations to rivers and streams, and the risk of ecological
   competition and introgressive hybridization with the closely related
   Fringed Darter, Etheostoma crossopterum. Museum collection records and
   targeted surveys conducted since its description suggest that
   present-day range of Etheostoma forbesi does not include several streams
   it previously inhabitedsome as recently as 15 years ago. We investigate
   the geographic distribution and variation in meristic traits of both
   Etheostoma forbesi and Etheostoma crossopterum in the upper Caney Fork
   system through the examination of all available museum vouchers, and
   assess phylogeographic patterns among populations using mitochondrial
   DNA sequence data. We report a newly discovered population of Etheostoma
   forbesi from the upper Collins River, and present evidence that
   Etheostoma crossopterum has displaced Etheostoma forbesi in the Hickory
   Creek system and Mud Creek in the upper Barren Fork River system. There
   are no differences in scale counts between the two species, but the sum
   of the number of rays in the anal, pectoral, and second dorsal fins is
   diagnostic. Analysis of mtDNA variation indicates gene flow between
   Etheostoma forbesi and Etheostoma crossopterum. Our results suggest that
   sympatry of the two species in the western upper Caney Fork system is a
   potential threat to the persistence of Etheostoma forbesi.},

Abstract = {After decades of archaeological excavations, legacy collections present
   us with vast reservoirs of untapped research potential. By studying
   Ceramic Age (ca. 500 BC-AD 600) Caribbean pottery from Hacienda Grande
   (Puerto Rico) and Salt River (St. Croix), this exploratory study devised
   a method for the use of nondestructive geochemical analyses (portable
   X-ray fluorescence) on large ceramic collections to research various
   aspects of cultural interaction, such as trade, exchange, social
   networks, and mobility. A set of ceramic information was divided into
   multiple variables to test the geochemical data for patterns of
   variability due to vessel use, production techniques, or provenance of
   raw materials. The results indicate that the potters from Hacienda
   Grande most likely used only one local clay source, but applied
   different production and finishing techniques in relation to the vessel
   function; whereas, the ceramics found in Salt River indicate at least
   two clay sources or different tempers, yet little variation in finishing
   techniques. The results obtained in this study support the image of
   self-sufficient communities that maintained a close source-to-site
   distance in ceramic production and consumption. Furthermore, the
   observed similarities between islands point to a shared cultural package
   as the result of knowledge transmission through interaction, rather than
   transportation of pottery between sites and islands.},

Abstract = {Deinosuchus is a genus of large crocodylian that inhabited North America
   during the Late Cretaceous. This massive predator has become one of the
   most well-known prehistoric organisms, with a considerable amount of
   literature on its biogeography, ecology, and evolution published.
   However, ontogenetic changes of Deinosuchus and other species of extinct
   large, predatory crocodyliforms have remained poorly understood because
   of a lack of remains known from juvenile individuals and issues
   surrounding the ability of histological analysis of adult material to
   provide information on yearly growth. Here, I describe a tooth from a
   juvenile Deinosuchus estimated at less than 1 m in total body length. As
   the first reported specimen of a juvenile Deinosuchus, to the author's
   knowledge, in the literature, the new fossil evinces the extremely small
   size of young individuals of this taxon compared to adults more than 8 m
   and 3,500 kg. Furthermore, the tooth shows that some morphological
   discrepancies existed between the dentition of juvenile and adult
   Deinosuchus individuals, including the size of the nutritive region. In
   addition to being the first specimen of Deinosuchus from northeastern
   North America described in detail, the tooth emphasizes the biological
   extremes of attaining large body size in Deinosuchus and may add support
   to the hypothesis that the ontogeny of gigantic crocodyliforms was
   characterized by extended periods of juvenile growth.},

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Turtles of the clade Testudinoidea have a rather scarce fossil record in
   Afro-Arabia, ranging from the late Eocene up to the Quaternary. The vast
   majority of testudinoid fossils from Afro-Arabia are ascribed to
   Testudinidae, which has had a continuous presence in the area since the
   late Eocene. Geoemydidae is poorly documented by fragments found
   throughout the Neogene across northern Africa and the Middle East.
   Emydidae is absent from the fossil record of this area. All valid named
   taxa pertain to testudinids. Within Testudinidae, the majority of known
   fossil species are members of the clade Geochelona, while a few others
   belong to the clade Testudona. Four fossil taxa are members of
   now-extinct genera, five are members of extant genera, and seven cannot
   be assigned to a known genus with certainty. The fossil record also
   documents that several extant genera had a much broader distribution
   during the Neogene and Quaternary. Endemic insular lineages were
   formerly present on the Canary Islands, Cape Verde islands, and on
   several islands in the Western Indian Ocean. The highest known diversity
   of testudinoids seems to have existed during the Neogene; however,
   definitive conclusions are hampered by the extremely poor Paleogene
   record and large, unsampled areas of Afro-Arabia. A taxonomic review of
   the 22 named Afro-Arabian taxa finds 16 nomina valida, 1 nomen
   invalidum, and 5 nomina dubia.},

Abstract = {This study documented and assessed benthic macroinvertebrate communities
   on a section of Canyon Creek through Tensleep Preserve in Washakie
   County, Wyoming, USA. Data for these communities are compared with
   previous samples collected downstream on agricultural land, as well as
   upstream and downstream from two subterranean, limestone sinks on the
   preserve. A shift from Plecoptera, Coleoptera, and Ephemeroptera to
   mainly Ephemeroptera to mainly Trichoptera was observed from the
   uppermost to the lowermost sites; Chironomidae and Diptera dominated the
   previously sampled section. High proportions of scrapers in sampled
   communities on the preserve beginning downstream of the upstream sink
   system suggested a prevalence of autochthonous detritus over
   allochthonous detritus at these sites. Macroinvertebrate community
   compositions and calculated metrics indicated high water quality for
   sites on the preserve and lower water quality for the agriculturally
   impacted sites. Ten taxa recorded from samples between the subterranean
   sinks were not recorded elsewhere. The mayfly Ameletus validus was
   abundant at the exit of the upper sink system at which the substrate was
   lined with irregular lime-stone slabs, and this taxon may be limited to
   the interior of this sink. Neothremma is identified as a feasible
   indicator taxon for climate change.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {The fossil record of nonbaenid paracryptodires ranges from the Late
   Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) to the Paleocene of North America and Europe
   only. Earlier remains may be present as early as the Middle Jurassic
   (Bathonian). Only a single dispersal event is documented between the two
   continents after their breakup during the Cretaceous in the form of the
   appearance of the Compsemys lineage in the Paleocene of France.
   Nonbaenid paracryptodires were restricted to freshwater aquatic
   environments but display adaptations to diverse feeding strategies
   consistent with generalist, gape-and-suction, and hypercarnivorous
   feeding. Current phylogenies recognize two species-rich subclades within
   Paracryptodira, Baenidae and Pleurosternidae, which jointly form the
   clade Baenoidea. A taxonomic review of nonbaenid paracryptodires
   concludes that of 34 named taxa, 11 are nomina valida, 15 are nomina
   invalida, and 8 are nomina dubia.},

Abstract = {We used isotopic and genomic data to explore the ecological and social

   crocodiles in ancient Egypt. Ancient DNA was recovered from four
   mummified crocodile hatchlings held in the collections of the Peabody
   Museum of Natural history, Yale University. Previous genetic analyses of
   crocodile mummies have indicated that most mummies represent the newly
   resurrected taxon, Crocodylus suchus Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1807.
   However, mitogenomic data for the Yale Peabody Museum mummies indicates
   that these specimens represent the first genomically authenticated
   representatives of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti,
   1768) in museum collections. We explore these findings within the
   broader context of modern and historical distributions of both crocodile
   species and the potential implications for our understanding of funerary
   practices involving crocodiles in ancient Egypt.},

   acrodonty) and no tooth replacement, though it is likely teeth were
   added posteriorly over time. Previous interpretations of tooth
   implantation in procolophonids were conflated with replacement patterns
   and mode of implantation. Additionally, the combination of dental
   characters of the specimen suggests Scoloparia glyphanodon had an

Abstract = {The dajid parasite Holophryxus alaskensis Richardson, 1905a is reported
   from Pasiphaea pacifica Rathbun, 1902 collected at 1,200 m depth near
   Baja California, Mexico. This represents the southernmost record for
   this species at approximately twice the depth of prior records. A
   juvenile specimen of Holophryxus attached to Parapasiphae sulcatifrons
   Smith, 1884 collected at 1,625 m depth from the Bear Seamount (an
   underwater volcano in the western Atlantic Ocean) was found to be
   similar in morphology to juveniles of H. alaskensis. However, it is also
   not possible to determine whether it is conspecific with either of the
   known Atlantic species of Holophryxus (H. acanthephyrae Stephensen,
   1912a and H. richardi Koehler, 1911). This is the first record of P.
   sulcatifrons as a host for any epicaridean. Finally, H. acanthephyrae is
   reported for the first time from off the Bahamas, where it was found on
   Acanthephyra pupurea A. Milne-Edwards, 1881 collected at 2,134 m depth.

   documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New
   York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and
   homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a
   bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly
   facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are
   noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates
   with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous
   interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh
   body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria.
   This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the
   metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.},

Abstract = {Placobdella parasitica (Say, 1824) is one of the most commonly
   encountered turtle leeches in North America. Molecular analysis of
   individuals of P. parasitica representing various populations throughout
   its range in North America using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
   gene, revealed the presence of nine distinct groups: (1)P. parasitica
   sensu stricto containing members, including the neotype specimen,
   occurring broadly throughout the central United States westward from the
   Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and throughout southern
   Ontario, Canada, and the upper midwestern United States as far east as
   New York State; (2) West Virginia; (3) Mississippi/Alabama; (4)
   Northeast, including New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont; (5) New
   England, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut; (6)
   North Carolina/West Virginia; (7) South Carolina; (8) Unnessee; and (9)
   Florida. Both neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analyses recovered
   an east-west split along the Appalachian Mountains with groups 1-3
   clustering together and groups 4-9 clustering separately, with the
   exception of group 8 (Tennessee) that placed with the eastern groups.
   Group 1 includes specimens from a broad geographic distribution, yet
   with relatively low genetic variation, a pattern observed in other
   glossiphoniid species in North America. The groups with members east of
   the Appalachian Mountains are more tightly clustered by locality. This
   leech species is known to parasitize several turtle species, including
   Chrysemys pitta, the painted turtle that originated in the central Gulf
   Coast region and dispersed northward representing a recolonization after
   Pleistocene glaciation. The neighbor-joining tree and pairwise distance
   data could suggest that P. parasitica has a similar phylogeographic
   pattern and dispersal history with its turtle hosts. In view of the
   morphological uniformity among the various groups, P. parasitica is
   provisionally considered to be a widely distributed, molecularly
   variable species.},

Title = {The Chelicerae of Slimonia (Eurypterida; Pterygotoidea)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pterygotid eurypterids are the most speciose eurypterid Glade,
   accounting for almost a fifth of the approximately 250 known species,
   although it is unclear whether this increase in diversity is due to
   their increased dispersal ability, shift in predation style to
   cheliceral-driven prey capture, or some other factor. Determining if the
   development of their characteristic large chelicerae represents a key
   trait facilitating increased diversification is hindered by uncertainty
   regarding the form of the chelicerae in Slimonia, the sister taxon to
   Pterygotidae. Here I report the discovery of a specimen of Slimonia
   acuminata preserving the chelicerae in detail and corroborate reports
   from the 1800s suggesting that the chelicerae of Slimonia were short and
   robust. The evidence from the new specimen, taken in concert with the
   morphology of the rest of the animal, indicates that Slimonia was an
   active predator that captured prey with its robust prosomal appendages.
   The apparent increase in pterygotid species diversity therefore does
   indeed seem to be associated with the development of the large
   chelicerae; however, further work is needed to determine whether
   taphonomic biases in preservation due to increased sclerotization of the
   chelicerae or taxonomic oversplitting due to minor changes in denticle
   morphology are driving this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The genus Lepidisis was established by Verrill in 1883 for three species

   description. Using what remains of Verrill's syntype specimens and a new
   specimen collected from off of the coast of the New England region, USA,
   we show that Verrill made a serious mistake in his description of the
   type species, and that mistake has caused some of the confusion
   surrounding this genus. We redescribe the type species, then use that
   description to evaluate the other species currently assigned to the

Abstract = {The homology of the arachnid chelicera with respect to other head
   appendages in Panarthropoda has long been debated. Gene expression data
   and the re-interpretation of early transitional fossils have supported
   the homology of the deutocerebrum and its associated appendages,
   implying a homology between primary antennae (mandibulates), chelicerae
   (euchelicerates), and chelifores (sea spiders). Nevertheless,
   comparatively little is known about the mechanistic basis of
   proximo-distal (PD) axis induction in chelicerates, much less the basis
   for cheliceral fate specification. Here, we describe a new cheliceral
   teratology in the spider Tetragnatha versicolor Walckenaer, 1841, which
   consists on a duplication of the PD axis of the left chelicera
   associated with a terminal secondary schistomely on the fang of the
   lower axis. This duplication offers clues as to potential shared
   mechanisms of PD axis formation in the chelicera. We review the state of
   knowledge on PD axis induction mechanisms in arthropods and identify
   elements of gene regulatory networks that are key for future functional
   experiments of appendage development in non-insect model systems. Such
   investigations would allow a better understanding of PD axis induction
   of modified and poorly studied arthropod limbs (e.g., chelicerae,
   chelifores, and ovigers).},

Volume = {231},

Abstract = {Most morphological studies focus on adult specimens, or if developmental
   studies are pursued, especially in Euarthropoda, they focus on embryonic
   development. Araneae (spiders) is one of these groups, in consequence
   with understudied post-embryonic development. Here we present aspects of
   the post-embryonic stages of different species of Mesothelae, sister
   group to the remaining spiders (when fossil species are not taken into
   account). We used different imaging methods and measured different
   external morphological structures to detect possible ontogenetic
   changes. One structure exhibiting post-embryonic changes is the
   chelicera. Here the significant change occurs between the last immature
   stage and the adult, yet only in males. For the spinnerets, we could not
   detect ontogenetic changes, but instead a high variability in length and
   width, probably due to their lack of pivot joints between the elements.
   The strongest morphological change during ontogeny occurred on the
   sternum, which begins with a rather roundish shape in the first stage
   and changes to being fairly elongate in shape in the last immature
   stages and the adult. This specific sternum shape only occurs in adults
   of mesothelan spiders, while opisthothelan spiders have a broader
   sternum also in the adult. We discuss our results in an evolutionary
   context, also taking into account recent finds of fossil spiders.},

Abstract = {The morphology and physiology of the oogenesis have been well studied in
   the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus. However, the molecular
   interactions that regulate the process of egg formation, key for the
   reproductive cycle of the vector, is still largely unknown. In order to
   understand the molecular and cellular basis of the oogenesis, we
   examined the function of the gene Bicaudal C (BicC) during oogenesis and
   early development of R. prolixus. We show that R. prolixus BicC
   (Rp-BicC) gene is expressed in the germarium, with cytoplasmic
   distribution, as well as in the follicular epithelium of the developing
   oocytes. RNAi silencing of Rp-BicC resulted in sterile females that lay
   few, small, non-viable eggs. The ovaries are reduced in size and show a
   disarray of the follicular epithelium. This indicates that Rp-BicC has a
   central role in the regulation of oogenesis. Although the follicular
   cells are able to form the chorion, the uptake of vitelline by the
   oocytes is compromised. We show evidence that the polarity of the
   follicular epithelium and the endocytic pathway, which are crucial for
   the proper yolk deposition, are affected. This study provides insights
   into the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte development and show
   that Rp-BicC is important for de developmental of the egg and,
   therefore, a key player in the reproduction of this insect.},

Abstract = {Fox genes encode transcription factors that contain a DNA binding
   domain, the forkhead domain, and are known from diverse animal species.
   The exact homology of the Fox genes of different species is debated and
   this makes inferences about the evolution of the Fox genes, and their
   duplications and losses difficult. We have performed phylogenetic
   analyses of the Fox gene complements of 32 panarthropod species. Our
   results confirm an ancestral complement of FoxA, FoxB, FoxC, FoxD, FoxF,
   FoxG, FoxJ1, FoxJ2/3, FoxK, FoxL1, FoxL2, FoxN1/4, FoxN2/3, FoxO, FoxP,
   and FoxQ2 in the Arthropoda, and additionally FoxH and FoxQ1 in the
   Panarthropoda (including tardigrades and onychophorans). We identify a
   novel Fox gene sub-family, that we designate as FoxT that includes two
   genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Circadianly Regulated Gene (Crg-1) and
   forkhead domain 3F (fd3F). In a very recent paper, the same new Fox gene
   sub-family was identified in insects (Lin et al. 2021). Our analysis
   confirms the presence of FoxT and shows that its members are present
   throughout Panarthropoda. We show that the hitherto unclassified gene
   CG32006 from the fly Drosophila melanogaster belongs to FoxJ1. We also
   detect gene losses: FoxE and FoxM were lost already in the panarthropod
   ancestor, whereas the loss of FoxH occurred in the arthropod ancestor.
   Finally, we find an ortholog of FoxQ1 in the bark scorpion Centruroides
   sculpturatus, confirmed not only by phylogenetic analysis, but also by
   forming an evolutionarily conserved gene cluster with FoxF, FoxC, and
   FoxL1. This suggests that FoxQ1 belongs to the ancestral Fox gene
   complement in panarthropods and also in chelicerates, but has been lost
   at the base of the mandibulate arthropods.},

Abstract = {In the spider, determination of the dorsal-ventral body (DV) axis
   depends on the interplay of the dorsal morphogen encoding gene
   decapentaplegic (Dpp) and its antagonist, short gastrulation (sog), a
   gene that is involved in the correct establishment of ventral tissues.
   Recent work demonstrated that the forkhead domain encoding gene FoxB is
   involved in dorsal-ventral axis formation in spider limbs. Here, Dpp
   likely acts as a dorsal morphogen, and FoxB is likely in control of
   ventral tissues as RNAi-mediated knockdown of FoxB causes dorsalization
   of the limbs. In this study, we present phenotypes of FoxB knockdown
   that demonstrate a function in the establishment of the DV body axis.
   Knockdown of FoxB function leads to embryos with partially duplicated
   median germ bands (Duplicitas media) that are possibly the result of
   ectopic activation of Dpp signalling. Another class of phenotypes is
   characterized by unnaturally slim (dorsal-ventrally compressed) germ
   bands in which ventral tissue is either not formed, or is specified
   incorrectly, likely a result of Dpp over-activity. These results suggest
   that FoxB functions as an antagonist of Dpp signalling during body axis
   patterning, similarly as it is the case in limb development. FoxB thus
   represents a general player in the establishment of dorsal-ventral
   structures during spider ontogeny.},

Title = {The Notch repressor complex in Drosophila: in vivo analysis of Hairless
   mutants using overexpression experiments},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {229},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {During development of higher animals, the Notch signalling pathway
   governs cell type specification by mediating appropriate gene expression
   responses. In the absence of signalling, Notch target genes are silenced
   by repressor complexes. In the model organism Drosophila melanogaster,
   the repressor complex includes the transcription factor Suppressor of
   Hairless {[}Su(H)] and Hairless (H) plus general co-repressors. Recent
   crystal structure analysis of the Drosophila Notch repressor revealed
   details of the Su(H)-H complex. They were confirmed by mutational
   analyses of either protein; however, only Su(H) mutants have been
   further studied in vivo. Here, we analyse three H variants predicted to
   affect Su(H) binding. To this end, amino acid replacements Phenylalanine
   237, Leucines 245 and 247, as well as Tryptophan 258 to Alanine were
   introduced into the H protein. A cell-based reporter assay indicates
   substantial loss of Su(H) binding to the respective mutant proteins
   H-FA, H-LLAA and H-WA. For in vivo analysis, UAS-lines H-FA, H-LLAA and
   H-WA were generated to allow spatially restricted overexpression. In
   these assays, all three mutants resembled the H-LD control, shown before
   to lack Su(H) binding, indicating a strong reduction of H activity. For
   example, the H variants were impaired in wing margin formation, but
   unexpectedly induced ectopic wing venation. Concurrent overexpression
   with Su(H), however, suggests that all mutant H protein isoforms are
   still able to bind Su(H) in vivo. We conclude that a weakening of the
   cohesion in the H-Su(H) repressor complex is sufficient for disrupting
   its in vivo functionality.},

   In arthropods, Sp6-9, the ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster D-Sp1

   the expression of Sp6-9 during the development of the velvet worm is
   conserved, suggesting that the key function of the Sp6-9 gene dates back

Abstract = {Mesona chinensis Benth (MCB) is one of the main economic crops in
   tropical and subtropical areas. To understand the codon usage bias (CUB)
   in M. chinensis Benth, chloroplast genome is essential to study its
   genetic law, molecular phylogenetic relationships, and exogenous gene
   expression. Results showed that the GC content of 53 CDS sequences was
   37.95\%, and GC1, GC2, and GC3 content were 46.02\%, 38.26\%, and
   29.85\%, respectively. The general GC content order was GC1>GC2>GC3.
   Moreover, the majority of genes had an effective number of codon (ENC)
   value greater than 40, except ndhE, rps8, and rps18. Correlation
   analysis results revealed that the GC content was significantly
   correlated with GC1, GC2, GC3, and ENC. Neutrality plot analysis,
   ENC-plot analysis, and PR2-plot analysis presented that the CUB of M.
   chinensis Benth chloroplast genome was mainly affected by mutation and
   selection. In addition, GGG, GCA, and TCC were found to be the optimal
   codons. Furthermore, results of cluster analysis and evolutionary tree
   showed that M. chinensis Benth was closely related to Ocimum basilicum,
   indicating that there was a certain correlation between the CUB of the
   chloroplast gene and the genetic relationship of plant species. Overall,
   the study on the CUB of chloroplast genome laid a basis for genetic
   modification and phylogenetic research of M. chinensis Benth chloroplast
   genome.},

Abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase is ubiquitously present in metazoans and is
   involved in a wide range of biological processes. Three distinctNosgenes
   have been so far identified in vertebrates exhibiting a complex
   expression pattern and transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless,
   although independent events ofNosduplication have been observed in
   several taxa, only few studies described the regulatory mechanisms
   responsible for their activation in non-vertebrate animals. To shed
   light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal-typeNosexpression, we
   focused on two non-vertebrate chordates: the
   cephalochordateBranchiostoma lanceolatumand the tunicateCiona robusta.
   Here, throughout transphyletic and transgenic approaches, we identified
   genomic regions in both species acting asNosfunctional enhancers during
   development.In vivoanalyses ofNosgenomic fragments revealed their
   ability to recapitulate the endogenous expression territories.
   Therefore, our results suggest the existence of evolutionary conserved
   mechanisms responsible for neuronal-typeNosregulation in non-vertebrate
   chordates. In conclusion, this study paves the way for future
   characterization of conserved transcriptional logic underlying the
   expression of neuronal-typeNosgenes in chordates.},

Abstract = {Earliest craniates possess a newly enlarged, elaborated forebrain with
   new cell types and neuronal networks. A key question in vertebrate
   evolution is when and how this cerebral expansion took place. The
   exon-junction complex (EJC) plays an essential role in mRNA processing
   of all Eukarya. Recently, it has been proposed that the EJC represses
   recursive RNA splicing in Deuterostomes, with implication in human brain
   diseases like microcephaly and depression. However, the EJC or EJC
   subunit contribution to brain development in non-vertebrate
   Deuterostomes remained unknown. Being interested in the evolution of
   chordate characters, we focused on the model species,Branchiostoma
   lanceolatum(Cephalochordata) andCiona robusta(Tunicata), with the aim to
   investigate the ancestral and the derived expression state
   ofMagohorthologous genes. This study identifies thatMagohis part of a
   conserved syntenic group exclusively in vertebrates and suggests
   thatMagohhas experienced duplication and loss events in mammals. During
   early development in amphioxus and ascidian, maternal contribution and
   zygotic expression ofMagohgenes in various types of progenitor cells and
   tissues are consistent with the condition observed in other Bilateria.
   Later in development, we also show expression ofMagohin the brain of
   cephalochordate and ascidian larvae. Collectively, these results provide
   a basis to further define what functional role(s)Magohexerted during
   nervous system development and evolution.},

Abstract = {Pelodiscus sinensis is the most common turtle species raised in East and
   Southeast Asia. The Japanese strain and the Qingxi black strain are
   important aquatic breeds of P. sinensis in China with unique
   characteristics in terms of production performance and appearance,
   including skin color. In this study, melanin content measure and
   histological analysis on skin samples of these two strains were carried
   out to compare their color characteristics. The results showed that
   Qingxi black turtles clearly have a greater ability to deposit melanin
   than the Japanese strain especially in the abdomen. Then, de novo
   transcriptome assembly and differential expression profiling analyses on
   the ventral skin from the two strains were performed to identify the
   genes responsible for the differences in skin color using the Illumina
   RNA-Seq system with three biological replicates. A total of 19,331
   annotated unigenes were found by aligning to the reference genome of P.
   sinensis using TopHat v2.0.12. Differential expression analysis revealed
   that 670 genes were expressed differently, including 185 upregulated
   genes and 485 downregulated genes in Qingxi black strain using the DESeq
   R package (|log(2)FoldChange|>= 1, padj <0.05). Sixteen differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs), which were randomly selected, were confirmed by
   quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). GO and KEGG analyses revealed four
   DEGs (agouti signaling protein, frizzled family receptor 1,
   phospholipase C, and protein kinase C) were related to melanogenesis
   pathway. Gene expression levels of the four DEGs as well as three genes
   from the tyrosinase gene family were measured by qRT-PCR. The results
   indicated that agouti signaling protein, tyrosinase-related protein, and
   dopachrome tautomerase could be the main genes responsible for the
   difference in abdominal skin color between the two turtle strains. This
   study provided valuable information for further analysis of the
   melanogenesis mechanisms in different varieties of P. sinensis.},

Title = {Transcriptome profiling reveals male- and female-specific gene

Abstract = {Xenopus laevis is an amphibian (frog) species widely used in
   developmental biology and genetics. To unravel the molecular machinery
   regulating sex differentiation of Xenopus gonads, we analyzed for the
   first time the transcriptome of developing amphibian gonads covering sex
   determination period. We applied microarray at four developmental
   stages: (i) NF50 (undifferentiated gonad during sex determination), (ii)
   NF53 (the onset of sexual differentiation of the gonads), (iii) NF56
   (sexual differentiation of the gonads), and (iv) NF62 (developmental
   progression of differentiated gonads). Our analysis showed that during
   the NF50, the genetic female (ZW) gonads expressed more sex-specific
   genes than genetic male (ZZ) gonads, which suggests that a robust
   genetic program is realized during female sex determination in Xenopus.
   However, a contrasting expression pattern was observed at later stages
   (NF56 and NF62), when the ZW gonads expressed less sex-specific genes
   than ZZ gonads, i.e., more genes may be involved in further development
   of the male gonads (ZZ). We identified sexual dimorphism in the
   expression of several functional groups of genes, including signaling
   factors, proteases, protease inhibitors, transcription factors,
   extracellular matrix components, extracellular matrix enzymes, cell
   adhesion molecules, and epithelium-specific intermediate filaments. In
   addition, our analysis detected a sexually dimorphic expression of many
   uncharacterized genes of unknown function, which should be studied
   further to reveal their identity and if/how they regulate gonad
   development, sex determination, and sexual differentiation. Comparison
   between genes sex-specifically expressed in developing gonads of Xenopus
   and available transcriptome data from zebrafish, two reptile species,
   chicken, and mouse revealed significant differences in the genetic
   control of sex determination and gonad development. This shows that the
   genetic control of gonad development is evolutionarily malleable.},

Title = {Independent evolution of complex development in animals and plants: deep
   homology and lateral gene transfer},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {229},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-34},

Abstract = {The evolution of multicellularity is a premier example of phenotypic
   convergence: simple multicellularity evolved independently many times,
   and complex multicellular phenotypes are found in several distant
   groups. Furthermore, both animal and plant lineages have independently
   reached extreme levels of morphological, functional, and developmental
   complexity. This study explores the genetic basis for the parallel
   evolution of complex multicellularity and development in the animal and
   green plant (i.e., green algae and land plants) lineages. Specifically,
   the study (i) identifies the SAND domaina DNA-binding domain with
   important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and
   differentiation, as unique to animals, green algae, and land plants; and
   (ii) suggests that the parallel deployment of this ancestral domain in
   similar regulatory roles could have contributed to the independent
   evolution of complex development in these distant groups. Given the deep
   animal-green plant divergence, the limited distribution of the SAND
   domain is best explained by invoking a lateral gene transfer (LGT) event
   from a green alga to an early metazoan. The presence of a sequence motif
   specifically shared by a family of SAND-containing transcription factors
   involved in the evolution of complex multicellularity in volvocine algae
   and two types of SAND proteins that emerged early in the evolution of
   animals is consistent with this scenario. Overall, these findings imply
   that (i) in addition to be involved in the evolution of similar
   phenotypes, deep homologous sequences can also contribute to shaping
   parallel evolutionary trajectories in distant lineages, and (ii) LGT
   could provide an additional source of latent homologous sequences that
   can be deployed in analogous roles and affect the evolutionary
   potentials of distantly related groups.},

Abstract = {The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has many key roles in the development of
   animals, including a conserved and central role in the specification of
   the primary (antero-posterior) body axis. The posterior expression of
   Wnt ligands and the anterior expression of secreted Wnt inhibitors are
   known to be conserved during the larval metamorphosis of tapeworms.
   However, their downstream signaling components for Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling have not been characterized. In this work, we have studied the
   core components of the beta-catenin destruction complex of the human
   pathogen Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of alveolar
   echinococcosis. We focused on two Axin paralogs that are conserved in
   tapeworms and other flatworm parasites. Despite their divergent
   sequences, both Axins could robustly interact with one E. multilocularis
   beta-catenin paralog and limited its accumulation in a heterologous
   mammalian expression system. Similarly to what has been described in
   planarians (free-living flatworms), other beta-catenin paralogs showed
   limited or no interaction with either Axin and are unlikely to function
   as effectors in Wnt signaling. Additionally, both Axins interacted with
   three divergent GSK-3 paralogs that are conserved in free-living and
   parasitic flatworms. Axin paralogs have highly segregated expression
   patterns along the antero-posterior axis in the tapeworms E.
   multilocularis and Hymenolepis microstoma, indicating that different
   beta-catenin destruction complexes may operate in different regions
   during their larval metamorphosis.},

Abstract = {Gene expression and translation in plant mitochondria remain poorly
   understood due to the complicated transcription of its mRNA. In this
   study, we report the 5' and 3' RNA extremities and promoters of five
   mitochondrial genes, atp1, atp4, atp6, atp9, and cox3. The results
   reveal that four genes (atp1, atp4, atp6, and cox3) are transcribed from
   multiple initiation sites but with a uniform transcript at the 3' end,
   indicating that heterogeneity of the 5' end is a common feature in the
   transcription of kenaf mitochondrial genes. Furthermore, we found that
   the transcription initiation sites of these four genes are significantly
   different in UG93A, UG93B, and the F-1 hybrid. These data indicate that
   nuclear loci and unknown transcription factors within the mitochondria
   of different cytoplasmic types may be involved in mitochondrial
   transcription. Promoter architecture analysis showed that the promoter
   core sequences are conserved in the kenaf mitochondrial genome but are
   highly divergent, suggesting that these elements are essential for the
   promoter activity of mitochondrial genes in kenaf. Our results reveal
   that the heterogeneity of the 5' end and uniformity at the 3' end are
   common transcriptional features of mitochondrial genes. These data
   provide essential information for understanding the transcription of
   mitochondrial genes in kenaf and can be used as a reference for other
   plants.},

Abstract = {hlh-1is a myogenic transcription factor required for body-wall muscle
   specification during embryogenesis inCaenorhabditis elegans. Despite its
   well-known role in muscle specification, comprehensive regulatory
   control upstream ofhlh-1remains poorly defined. Here, we first
   established a statistical reference for the spatiotemporal expression
   ofhlh-1at single-cell resolution up to the second last round of
   divisions for most of the cell lineages (from 4- to 350-cell stage)
   using 13 wild-type embryos. We next generated lineal expression
   ofhlh-1after RNA interference (RNAi) perturbation of 65 genes, which
   were selected based on their degree of conservation, mutant phenotypes,
   and known roles in development. We then compared the expression profiles
   between wild-type and RNAi embryos by clustering according to their
   lineal expression patterns using mean-shift and density-based clustering
   algorithms, which not only confirmed the roles of existing genes but
   also uncovered the potential functions of novel genes in muscle
   specification at multiple levels, including cellular, lineal, and
   embryonic levels. By combining the public data on protein-protein
   interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and genetic interactions with
   our RNAi data, we inferred regulatory pathways upstream ofhlh-1that
   function globally or locally. This work not only revealed diverse and
   multilevel regulatory mechanisms coordinating muscle differentiation
   duringC. elegansembryogenesis but also laid a foundation for further
   characterizing the regulatory pathways controlling muscle specification
   at the cellular, lineal (local), or embryonic (global) level.},

Abstract = {The molluscan larval shell formation is a complicated process. There is
   evidence that the mantle of the primary larva (trochophore) contains
   functionally different cell populations with distinct gene expression
   profiles. However, it remains unclear how these cells are specified. In
   the present study, we identified three cell populations from the shell
   gland in earlier stages (gastrula) from the bivalve mollusc Crassostrea
   gigas. These cell populations were determined by analyzing the
   co-expression relationships among six potential shell formation (pSF)
   genes using two-color hybridization. The three cell populations, which
   we designated as SGCPs (shell gland cell populations), formed a
   concentric-circle pattern from outside to inside of the shell gland.
   SGCP I was located in the outer edge of the shell gland and the cells
   expressed pax2/5/8, gata2/3, and bmp2/4. SGCP II was located more
   internally and the cells expressed two engrailed genes. The last
   population, SGCP III, was located in the central region of the shell
   gland and the cells expressed lox4. Determination of the gene expression
   profiles of SGCPs would help trace their origins and fates and elucidate
   how these cell populations are specified. Moreover, potential roles of
   the SGCPs, e.g., development of sensory cells and shell biogenesis, are
   suggested. Our results reveal the internal organization of the embryonic
   shell gland at the molecular level and add to the knowledge of larval
   shell formation.},

Abstract = {GRAS family transcription factors (TF) are involved in multiple
   biological processes in plants. In recent years among the 54 identified
   GRAS proteins, only few have been studied functionally in tomato
   (Solanum lycopersicum). In the present study, a novel and previously
   uncharacterized member of tomato GRAS transcription factors family
   SlGRAS15 was isolated and functionally characterized. It was observed
   that SlGRAS15 preferably expressed in roots, followed by young leaves,
   stem, and comparatively low transcripts levels were noticed in all other
   tissues. To explore the SlGRAS15 function in detail, an RNA interference
   (RNAi) vector targeting SlGRAS15 was constructed and transformed into
   tomato plants. The transgenic plants carrying SlGRAS15-RNAi displayed
   pleiotropic phenotypes associated with multiple agronomical traits
   including reduced plant height and small leaf size with pointed margins,
   increased node number, lateral shoots, and petiolules length. In
   addition, transcriptional analysis revealed that silencing SlGRAS15
   altered vegetative growth by downregulating gibberellin (GA)
   biosynthesis genes and stimulating the GA deactivating genes, thus
   lowering the endogenous GA content in tomato transgenic lines. Moreover,
   the GA signaling downstream gene (SlGAST1) was downregulated but the
   negative regulator of GA signaling (SlDELLA) was upregulated by SlGRAS15
   silencing. The root and hypocotyl length in SlGRAS15-RNAi lines showed
   reduced growth under normal conditions (Mock) as compared with the wild
   type (WT) control plants. Taken together, these findings enhanced our
   understanding that suppression of SlGRAS15 lead to a series of
   developmental processes by modulating gibberellin signaling and
   demonstrate an association between the SlGRAS15 and GA signaling pathway
   during vegetative growth in tomato.},

Title = {Evolutionary conservation of opsin gene expression patterns in the

Abstract = {Recent large-scale studies of opsin gene contents in representatives of
   the largest order of insects, the Coleoptera (beetles), revealed that
   the blue wavelength-sensitive (B) opsin subfamily is absent in this
   clade, while the ultraviolet- (UV) and long wavelength-sensitive (LW)
   opsin subfamilies are broadly conserved with gene duplications possibly
   reintroducing blue sensitivity in select subclades. Little is known yet,
   however, how opsin genes are expressed in the compound eyes of beetles.
   In a previous study, we analyzed opsin gene expression in the red flour
   beetleTribolium castaneum, a member of the family of darkling beetles
   (Tenebrionidae), and found that a singleton LW opsin homolog is
   homogeneously expressed in all photoreceptors of the compound eye retina
   with a singleton UV opsin homolog being co-expressed in the R7 subtype
   photoreceptors. To probe for the evolutionary conservation of these
   expression patterns, we isolated complete opsin transcript sequences
   from three additional species in the subfamily Tenebrionidae (Tribolium
   confusum,Tenebrio molitor,Zophobas morio) and studied their expression
   via whole mount in situ hybridization in the pupal retina. These
   experiments revealed very similar, if not identical, photoreceptor
   subtype-specific expression patterns in all three species compared
   withT. castaneum. Documenting a deep conservation of photoreceptor
   subtype-specific opsin gene expression in this range of darkling
   beetles, our study provides a first point of reference for broader
   comparative studies of retinal organization in the Coleoptera.},

Title = {Expression patterns of signalling molecules and transcription factors in
   the early rabbit embryo and their significance for modelling amniote
   axis formation},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {231},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {73-83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The anterior-posterior axis is a central element of the body plan and,
   during amniote gastrulation, forms through several transient domains
   with specific morphogenetic activities. In the chick, experimentally
   proven activity of signalling molecules and transcription factors lead
   to the concept of a `global positioning system' for initial axis
   formation whereas in the (mammotypical) rabbit embryo, a series of
   morphological or molecular domains are part of a putative
   `three-anchor-point model'. Because circular expression patterns of
   genes involved in axis formation exist in both amniote groups prior to,
   and during, gastrulation and may thus be suited to reconcile these
   models, the expression patterns of selected genes known in the chick,
   namely the ones coding for the transcription factors eomes and tbx6, the
   signalling molecule wnt3 and the wnt inhibitor pkdcc, were analysed in
   the rabbit embryonic disc using in situ hybridisation and placing
   emphasis on their germ layer location. Peripheral wnt3 and eomes
   expression in all layers is found initially to be complementary to
   central pkdcc expression in the hypoblast during early axis formation.
   Pkdcc then appears - together with a posterior-anterior gradient in wnt3
   and eomes domains - in the epiblast posteriorly before the emerging
   primitive streak is marked by pkdcc and tbx6 at its anterior and
   posterior extremities, respectively. Conserved circular expression
   patterns deduced from some of this data may point to shared mechanisms
   in amniote axis formation while the reshaping of localised gene
   expression patterns is discussed as part of the `three-anchor-point
   model' for establishing the mammalian body plan.},

Abstract = {Cotton cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has been extensively studied;
   however, information regarding its molecular mechanisms has not yet been
   disclosed. Therefore, to explore the molecular mechanism of pollen
   abortion of cotton CMS line H276A, transcript profiles of 30
   mitochondrial protein-encoding genes at tetrad stage were conducted with
   northern blot and a differential expression gene cox3 was identified.
   Quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that
   the expression level of cox3 in the CMS line H276A was 0.39-fold
   compared to its maintainer line H276B. In addition, the immunoblot
   analysis revealed that the amount of COX3 protein was decreased to
   59.38\% in CMS line H276A. The 5` and 3` terminals of the transcript of
   cox3 in two materials were determined simultaneously with circularized
   RNA reverse-transcribed PCR (CR-RT-PCR). The data indicated that seven
   5` end of transcript of cox3 in H276A
   (-451/-464/-465/-467/-471/-472/-508 respect to ATG) were identified
   which were different from that of H276B (-411/-412). A total of 15
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was detected by clone sequencing
   analysis of upstream of cox3. To our knowledge, we are the first to
   comprehensively analyze the transcripts of the mitochondrial genome in
   the cotton CMS line and to identify the 5` and 3` terminals of the
   transcript of cox3 in cotton. Our data will provide a framework for a
   better understanding of molecular mechanisms of CMS and mitochondrial
   gene expression in cotton.},

Title = {Potential stress tolerance roles of barley germins and GLPs},

Volume = {231},

Pages = {109-118},

Abstract = {Germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) known as germination markers are
   encoded by multigene families in several plant species, including
   barley. To date, functional analysis has revealed germins and GLPs are
   involved in diverse processes such as embryonic development and stress
   responses. The aim of this study was the analysis of barley germins and
   GLPs. In this study, 80 putative germins and GLPs have been identified
   in barley by using known 17 germins and GLP sequences. Analysis of
   germins and GLPs showed all germins and GLPs are distributed on all
   seven chromosomes that most of them spread through chromosome 3, 4 and 7
   with 16, 18 and 12 proteins on each, respectively. The protein sizes
   varied between 185 and 335 amino acids, with an average length of 225
   aa. Twelve conserved motifs were found. While germin motifs 1 and 3 were
   detected in all germins and GLPs, some motifs were found to be related
   to signalization. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction analysis
   demonstrated some GLPs are associated with RAB6-interacting golgin,
   oligopeptide transmembrane transporter activity, beta-glucuronidase
   activity, protein N-linked glycosylation, multi-pass membrane protein,
   and proteins containing zinc finger (Znf) domain and RING (really
   interesting new gene)-type zinc finger domains. Our findings suggest
   that barley germins and GLPs may have diverse functions that make them
   important candidates for crop improvement.},

Abstract = {A polka-dotted fruit fly, Drosophila guttifera, has a unique
   pigmentation pattern on its wings and is used as a model for evo-devo
   studies exploring the mechanism of evolutionary gain of novel traits. In
   this species, a morphogen-encoding gene, wingless, is expressed in
   species-specific positions and induces a unique pigmentation pattern. To
   produce some of the pigmentation spots on wing veins, wingless is
   thought to be expressed in developing campaniform sensillum cells, but
   it was unknown which of the four cell types there express(es) wingless.
   Here we show that two of the cell types, dome cells and socket cells,
   express wingless, as indicated by in situ hybridization together with
   immunohistochemistry. This is a unique case in which non-neuronal SOP
   (sensory organ precursor) progeny cells produce Wingless as an inducer
   of pigmentation pattern formation. Our finding opens a path to
   clarifying the mechanism of evolutionary gain of a unique wingless
   expression pattern by analyzing gene regulation in dome cells and socket
   cells.},

Abstract = {Spiders are equipped with a large number of innervated cuticular
   specializations, which respond to various sensory stimuli. The
   physiological function of mechanosensory organs has been analysed in
   great detail in some model spider species (e.g. Cupiennius salei);
   however, much less is known about the distribution and function of
   chemosensory organs. Furthermore, our knowledge on how the sense organ
   pattern develops on the spider appendages is limited. Here we analyse
   the development of the pattern and distribution of six different
   external mechano- and chemosensory organs in all postembryonic stages
   and in adult male and female spiders of the species Parasteatoda
   tepidariorum. We show that except for small mechanosensory setae,
   external sense organs appear in fixed positions on the pedipalps and
   first walking legs, arranged in longitudinal rows along the
   proximal-distal axis or in invariable positions relative to
   morphological landmarks (joints, distal tarsal tip). A comparison to
   other Entelegynae spiders shows that these features are conserved. We
   hope that this study lays the foundation for future molecular analysis
   to address the question how this conserved pattern is generated.},

Abstract = {Otospiralin (OTOSP) is a small protein of unknown function, expressed in
   fibrocytes of the inner ear and required for normal cochlear auditory
   function. Despite its conservation from fish to mammals, expression of
   otospiralin was only investigated in mammals. Here, we report for the
   first time the expression profile of OTOS orthologous genes in zebrafish
   (Danio rerio): otospiralin and si:ch73-23l24.1 (designated
   otospiralin-like). In situ hybridization analyses in zebrafish embryos
   showed a specific expression of otospiralin-like in notochord (from 14
   to 48 hpf) and similar expression patterns for otospiralin and
   otospiralin-like in gut (from 72 to 120 hpf), swim bladder (from 96 to
   120 hpf) and inner ear (at 120 hpf). Morpholino knockdown of otospiralin
   and otospiralin-like showed no strong change of the body structure of
   the embryos at 5 dpf and the inner ear was normally formed.
   Nevertheless, knockdown embryos showed a reduced number of kinocilia in
   the lateral crista, indicating that these genes play an important role
   in kinocilium formation. RT-qPCR revealed that otospiralin is highly
   expressed in adult zebrafish inner ear comparing to the others analyzed
   tissues as previously shown for mice. Interestingly, otospiralin-like
   was not detected in the inner ear which suggests that otospiralin have a
   more important function in hearing than otospiralin-like. Phylogenetic
   analysis of otospiralin proteins in vertebrates indicated the presence
   of two subgroups and supported the functional divergence observed in
   zebrafish for otospiralin and otospiralin-like genes. This study offers
   the first insight into the expression of otospiralin and
   otospiralin-like in zebrafish. Expression data point to an important
   role for otospiralin in zebrafish hearing and a specific role for
   otospiralin-like in notochord vacuolization.},

Abstract = {The two modes of development in sea urchins are direct development, in
   which the adult develops directly from the gastrula to the adult and
   does not feed, and indirect development, in which the adult develops
   indirectly through a feeding larva. In this account of the indirect,
   feeding larva of Heliocidaris tuberculata, the question raised is
   whether an evolutionary difference of unequal cell divisions contributes
   to the development of feeding structures in the indirect larva. In
   indirect development, the cell divisions at the fourth and fifth cell
   cycles of the zygote are unequal, with four small micromeres formed at
   the vegetal pole at the fifth cell division. In direct development,
   these cell divisions are not unequal. From their position at the head of
   the archenteron, the small micromeres are strategically located to
   contribute to the feeding tissues of the larva and the adult of H.

Abstract = {Decades have passed since the early molecular embryogenesis of

   mechanisms underlying early embryonic development in other insects,

   in more detail. The information clearly demonstrated that Drosophila
   embryogenesis is not representative of other insects and has highly
   distinctive characteristics. At the same time, this new data has been
   gradually clarifying ancestral operating mechanisms. The silk moth,
   Bombyx mori, is a lepidopteran insect and, as a representative of the
   order, has many unique characteristics found in early embryonic
   development that have not been identified in other insect groups.
   Herein, some of these characteristics are introduced and discussed in
   the context of recent information obtained from other insects.},

Abstract = {Due to fascinating mechanical and biological characteristics spider silk
   is of great interest in many research fields. Among the orb-weavers
   Nephila edulis is one of the species used as source for natural spider

   natural habitat, behavior, and breeding and compares them with the
   established methods and conditions within a research laboratory. Keeping
   conditions and methods of rearing are described in detail. Within a
   keeping facility with reliable supply of food, cannibalism rate is
   significantly reduced and spiders mate all year long. Cohabitants of the
   genus Steatoda are routinely found in laboratory keeping. While these
   small spiders do not pose a threat to Nephila edulis, cellar spiders
   (family Pholcidae) have to be extracted as they have been observed
   hunting for Nephila spiders.},

Title = {Cold acclimation diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana: CRISPR/Cas9 as a

Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},
Number = {5-6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this period of climate change, it is of major importance to increase
   knowledge about the mechanisms by whose plants adapt to their
   environment. Tandem gene arrays (TAG) are overrepresented in the pool of
   tandem duplicates involved in stress response and are consequently of
   special interest. Nevertheless, until recently, addressing questions
   about individual genes or fine regulations in such structures was very
   difficult due to the close arrangement of the genome, almost preventing
   the production of targeted simple or multiple mutants. The CRISPR/Cas9
   new tool offers new opportunities as the setting of gene deletion
   strategies in various genetic backgrounds. Here, we used this technology
   on the cold acclimation CBF pathway in different accessions of
   Arabidopsis thaliana with the same set of guide RNAs. Deleted lines free
   of T-DNA have been produced for simple or multiple copies of CBF genes
   and evaluated for cold tolerance after acclimation. Expression levels of
   CBF genes and five COR genes have also been analyzed. Our data suggest
   first that two or three missing CBF genes are necessary to induce a
   strong reduction in cold tolerance and secondly that most deletions have
   a low impact on the expression of remaining CBF copies which contradicts
   the previous hypothesis in the literature. Our results thus show that
   the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion strategy is a useful performance tool to
   investigate how tandem gene arrays work.},

Abstract = {Hoxa2 genes provide critical patterning signals during development, and
   their regulation and function have been extensively studied. We report a
   previously uncharacterized significant sequence divergence of a highly
   conserved hindbrain hoxa2b enhancer element in the family syngnathidae
   (pipefishes, seahorses, pipehorses, seadragons). We compared the hox
   cis-regulatory element variation in the Gulf pipefish and two species of
   seahorse against eight other species of fish, as well as human and
   mouse. We annotated the hoxa2b enhancer element binding sites across
   three species of seahorse, four species of pipefish, and one species of
   ghost pipefish. Finally, we performed in situ hybridization analysis of
   hoxa2b expression in Gulf pipefish embryos. We found that all syngnathid
   fish examined share a modified rhombomere 4 hoxa2b enhancer element,
   despite the fact that this element has been found to be highly conserved
   across all vertebrates examined previously. Binding element sequence
   motifs and spacing between binding elements have been modified for the
   hoxa2b enhancer in several species of pipefish and seahorse, and that
   the loss of the Prep/Meis binding site and further space shortening
   happened after ghost pipefish split from the rest of the syngnathid
   clade. We showed that expression of this gene in rhombomere 4 is lower
   relative to the surrounding rhombomeres in developing Gulf pipefish
   embryos, reflecting previously published functional tests for this
   enhancer. Our findings highlight the benefits of studying highly
   derived, diverse taxa for understanding of gene regulatory evolution and
   support the hypothesis that natural mutations can occur in deeply
   conserved pathways in ways potentially related to phenotypic diversity.},

Abstract = {One of the benefits of cooperative hunting may be that predators can
   subdue larger prey. In spiders, cooperative, social species can capture
   prey many times larger than an individual predator. However, we propose
   that cooperative prey capture does not have to be associated with larger
   caught prey per se, but with an increase in the ratio of prey to
   predator body size. This can be achieved either by catching larger prey
   while keeping predator body size constant, or by evolving a smaller
   predator body size while maintaining capture of large prey. We show that
   within a genus of relatively large spiders, Stegodyphus, subsocial
   spiders representing the ancestral state of social species are capable
   of catching the largest prey available in the environment. Hence, within
   this genus, the evolution of cooperation would not provide access to
   otherwise inaccessible, large prey. Instead, we show that social
   Stegodyphus spiders are smaller than their subsocial counterparts, while
   catching similar sized prey, leading to the predicted increase in
   prey-predator size ratio with sociality. We further show that in a genus
   of small spiders, Anelosimus, the level of sociality is associated with
   an increased size of prey caught while predator size is unaffected by
   sociality, leading to a similar, predicted increase in prey-predator
   size ratio. In summary, we find support for our proposed `prey to
   predator size ratio hypothesis' and discuss how relaxed selection on
   large body size in the evolution of social, cooperative living may
   provide adaptive benefits for ancestrally relatively large predators.},

Title = {The cleavage pattern of calanoid copepods-a case study},

Abstract = {Many crustacean groups show stereotyped cleavage patterns during early
   ontogeny. However, these patterns differ between the various major
   crustacean taxa, and a general mode is difficult to extract. Previous
   studies suggested that also copepods undergo an early cleavage with a
   more or less stereotyped pattern of blastomere divisions and fates. Yet,
   copepod embryology has been largely neglected. The last investigation of
   this kind dates back more than a century and the results are somewhat
   contradictory when compared with those of other researchers. To overcome
   these problems, we studied the early development of a so far undescribed
   calanoid copepod species, Skistodiaptomus sp., applying histochemical
   staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and bifocal 4D microscopy.
   The blastomere arrangement of the four-cell stage of this species varies
   to a large degree. It can either form a typical radial pattern with the
   four blastomeres lying in one plane or a tilted orientation of the axes
   connecting the sister cells of the previous division. In both cases, a
   stereotyped division pattern is maintained inside each quadrant during
   subsequent cleavages. In addition, we found two types of blastomere
   arrangements with a mirror symmetry. Most divisions within the quadrants
   follow the perpendicularity rule until the eighth cleavage. Deviations
   from this rule occur only in the narrow regions where the different
   quadrants touch and near the site of gastrulation. Gastrulation is
   initiated around the descendants of one individually identifiable
   blastomere of the 16-cell stage. This cell divides in a specific manner
   forming a characteristic cell arrangement, the gastrulation triangle.
   This gastrulation triangle initiates the internalization process of the
   gastrulation and it is encircled by another characteristic cell type,
   the crown cells. Our observations reveal several similarities to the
   early development of Calanus finmarchicus, another calanoid species.
   These relate to blastomere arrangements and divisions and the pattern of
   gastrulation. As Calanoida represent a basal or near basal branch of the
   copepod tree, this description will provide the ground for
   reconstruction of the cleavage pattern of the last common ancestor of
   Copepoda.},

Abstract = {Melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), which is expressed in the terminally
   differentiated sebaceous gland, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).
   MC5R exists mostly in mammals but is completely lost in whales; only the
   relic of MC5R can be detected in manatees, and phenotypically, they have
   lost sebaceous glands. Interestingly, whales and manatees are both
   aquatic mammals but have no immediate common ancestors. The loss of MC5R
   and sebaceous glands in whales and manatees is likely to be a result of
   convergent evolution. Here, we find that MC5R in whales and manatees are
   lost by two different mechanisms. Homologous recombination of MC5R in
   manatees and the insertion of reverse transcriptase in whales lead to
   the gene loss, respectively. On one hand, in manatees, there are two
   ``TTATC{''} sequences flanking MC5R, and homologous recombination of the
   segments between the two ``TTATC{''} sequences resulted in the partial
   loss of the sequence of MC5R. On the other hand, in whales, reverse
   transcriptase inserts between MC2R and RNMT on the chromosome led to the
   loss of MC5R. Based on these two different mechanisms for gene loss in
   whales and manatees, we finally concluded that MC5R loss might be the
   result of convergent evolution to the marine environment, and we
   explored the impact on biological function that is significant to
   environmental adaptation.},

Abstract = {Mouth formation involves the processes of mouth opening, formation of
   the oral cavity, and the development of associated sensory organs. In
   deuterostomes, the surface ectoderm and the anterior part of the
   archenteron are reconfigured and reconnected to make a mouth opening.
   This study of the larval development of the larvacean,Oikopleura dioica,
   investigates the cellular organization of the oral region, the
   developmental processes of the mouth, and the formation of associated
   sensory cells.O. dioicais a simple chordate whose larvae are transparent
   and have a small number of constituent cells. It completes organ
   morphogenesis in 7 h, between hatching 3 h after fertilization and the
   juvenile stage at 10 h, when it attains adult form and starts to feed.
   It has two types of mechanosensory cell embedded in the oral epithelium,
   which is a single layer of cells. There are twenty coronal sensory cells
   in the circumoral nerve ring and two dorsal sensory organ cells. Two
   bilateral lip precursor cells (LPCs), facing the anterior surface,
   divide dorsoventrally and make a wedge-shaped cleft between the two
   daughter cells named the dorsal lip cell (DLC) and the ventral lip cell
   (VLC). Eventually, the DLC and VLC become detached and separated into
   dorsal and ventral lips, triggering mouth opening. This is an intriguing
   example of cell division itself contributing to morphogenesis. The
   boundary between the ectoderm and endoderm is present between the lip
   cells and coronal sensory cells. All oral sensory cells, including
   dorsal sensory organ cells, were of endodermal origin and were not
   derived from the ectodermal placode. These observations on mouth
   formation provide a cellular basis for further studies at a molecular
   level, in this simple chordate.},

Abstract = {The group Xiphosurida (horseshoe ``crabs{''}) is today only represented
   by four species. However, in the fossil record, several dozen species
   have been described, especially from the Carboniferous (about 300
   million years ago). Several species have been interpreted as
   representatives of Euproops or Belinurus, but there is ongoing
   discussion which of these species are valid and how they can be
   differentiated. Recent studies suggested that differences in the timing
   of individual development could provide information for species
   distinction, exemplified by studies on Euproops danae (Mazon Creek, USA)
   and Euproops sp. ({''}Piesproops{''}; Piesberg, Germany). For this
   study, we reinvestigated all Carboniferous xiphosurids from the British
   Coal Measures stored in the collections of the Natural History Museum
   London. Size comparisons of the specimens revealed nine size groups; the
   smaller specimens were originally labelled as Belinurus, the larger ones
   as Euproops. The nine size groups exhibit five different morphotypes
   differing in structures surrounding the posterior shield (=
   thoracetron): spines of different lengths and, in larger specimens, a
   more or less developed flange. Two of these morphotypes show
   significantly longer spines than the remaining specimens and could be
   conspecific as E. anthrax. The remaining specimens are interpreted as
   growth series of another species, presumably of E. rotundatus. An
   ontogenetic flange formation is also known from E. danae and the
   ``Piesproops{''}, but the timing differs between all three species. In
   E. rotundatus, the flange develops rather late, but then comparably
   abruptly, which makes this development more metamorphic in relation to
   development in the other species.},

Abstract = {The core molecular mechanisms of dorsal organizer formation during
   gastrulation are highly conserved within the chordate lineage. One of
   the key characteristics is that Nodal signaling is required for the
   organizer-specific gene expression. This feature appears to be
   ancestral, as evidenced by the presence in the most basally divergent
   chordate amphioxus. To provide a better understanding of the evolution
   of organizer-specific gene regulation in chordates, we analyzed the
   cis-regulatory sequence of amphioxus Chordin in the context of the
   vertebrate embryo. First, we generated stable zebrafish transgenic
   lines, and by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, characterized in
   detail the expression pattern of GFP driven by the cis-regulatory
   sequences of amphioxus Chordin. Next, we performed a 5'deletion analysis
   and identified an enhancer sufficient to drive the expression of the
   reporter gene into a chordate dorsal organizer. Finally, we found that
   the identified enhancer element strongly depends on Nodal signaling,
   which is consistent with the well-established role of this pathway in
   the regulation of the expression of dorsal organizer-specific genes
   across chordates. The enhancer identified in our study may represent a
   suitable simple system to study the interplay of the evolutionarily
   conserved regulatory mechanisms operating during early chordate
   development.},

Abstract = {During primitive streak formation in the chick embryo, cells undergo
   mesendoderm specification and convergent extension at the same time and
   in the same cells. Previous work has implicated cVG1 (GDF3) as a key
   factor for induction of primitive streak identity and positioning the
   primitive streak, whereas FGF signalling was implicated in regulating
   cell intercalation via regulation of components of the WNT-planar cell
   polarity (PCP) pathway. FGF has also been reported to be able to induce
   a primitive streak (but lacking the most axial derivatives such as
   notochord/prechordal mesendoderm). These signals emanate from different
   cell populations in the embryo, so how do they interact to ensure that
   the same cells undergo both cell intercalation and acquire primitive
   streak identity? Here we begin to address this question by examining in
   more detail the ability of the two classes of signals in regulating the
   two developmental events. Using misexpression of inducers and/or
   exposure to inhibitors and in situ hybridisation, we study how these two
   signals regulate expression of Brachyury (TBXT) and PRICKLE1 as markers
   for the primitive streak and the PCP, respectively. We find that both
   signals can induce both properties, but while FGF seems to be required
   for induction of the streak by cVG1, it is not necessary for induction
   of PRICKLE1. The results are consistent with cVG1 being a common
   regulator for both primitive streak identity and the initiation of
   convergent extension that leads to streak elongation.},

Abstract = {Size and shape constitute fundamental aspects in the description of
   morphology. Yet while the developmental-genetic underpinnings of trait
   size, in particular with regard to scaling relationships, are
   increasingly well understood, those of shape remain largely elusive.
   Here we investigate the potential function of the Notch signaling
   pathway in instructing the shape of beetle horns, a highly diversified
   and evolutionarily novel morphological structure. We focused on the
   bull-headed dung beetle Onthophagus taurus due to the wide range of horn
   sizes and shapes present among males in this species, in order to assess
   the potential function of Notch signaling in the specification of horn
   shape alongside the regulation of shape changes with allometry. Using
   RNA interference-mediated transcript depletion of Notch and its ligands,
   we document a highly conserved role of Notch signaling in general
   appendage formation. By integrating our functional genetic approach with
   a geometric morphometric analysis, we find that Notch signaling
   moderately but consistently affects horn shape, and does so differently
   for the horns of minor, intermediate-sized, and major males. Our results
   suggest that the function of Notch signaling during head horn formation
   may vary in a complex manner across male morphs, and highlights the
   power of integrating functional genetic and geometric morphometric
   approaches in analyzing subtle but nevertheless biologically important
   phenotypes in the face of significant allometric variation.},

Title = {Candidate gene screen for potential interaction partners and regulatory

Volume = {230},

Abstract = {The Hox gene labial (lab) governs the formation of the tritocerebral
   head segment in insects and spiders. However, the morphology that
   results from lab action is very different in the two groups. In insects,
   the tritocerebral segment (intercalary segment) is reduced and lacks
   appendages, whereas in spiders the corresponding segment (pedipalpal
   segment) is a proper segment including a pair of appendages (pedipalps).
   It is likely that this difference between lab action in insects and
   spiders is mediated by regulatory targets or interacting partners of
   lab. However, only a few such genes are known in insects and none in
   spiders. We have conducted a candidate gene screen in the spider
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum using as candidates Drosophila melanogaster
   genes known to (potentially) interact with lab or to be expressed in the
   intercalary segment. We have studied 75 P. tepidariorum genes (including
   previously published and duplicated genes). Only 3 of these
   (proboscipedia-A (pb-A) and two paralogs of extradenticle (exd)) showed
   differential expression between leg and pedipalp. The low success rate
   points to a weakness of the candidate gene approach when it is applied
   to lineage specific organs. The spider pedipalp has no counterpart in
   insects, and therefore relying on insect data apparently cannot identify
   larger numbers of factors implicated in its specification and formation.
   We argue that in these cases a de novo approach to gene discovery might
   be superior to the candidate gene approach.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {229},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {43-52},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {One of the earliest patterning events in the vertebrate neural plate is
   the specification of mes/r1, the territory comprising the prospective
   mesencephalon and the first hindbrain rhombomere. Within mes/r1, an
   interface of gene expression defines the midbrain-hindbrain boundary
   (MHB), a lineage restriction that separates the mesencephalon and
   rhombencephalon. wnt1 is critical to mes/r1 development and functions
   within the MHB as a component of the MHB gene regulatory network (GRN).
   Despite its importance to these critical and early steps of vertebrate
   neurogenesis, little is known about the factors responsible for wnt1
   transcriptional regulation. In the zebrafish, wnt1 and its neighboring
   paralog, wnt10b, are expressed in largely overlapping patterns,
   suggesting co-regulation. To understand wnt1 and wnt10b transcriptional
   control, we used a comparative genomics approach to identify relevant
   enhancers. We show that the wnt1-wnt10b locus contains multiple
   cis-regulatory elements that likely interact to generate the wnt1 and
   wnt10b expression patterns. Two of 11 conserved enhancers tested show
   activity restricted to the midbrain and MHB, an activity that is
   conserved in the distantly related spotted gar orthologous elements.
   Three non-conserved elements also play a likely role in wnt1 regulation.
   The identified enhancers display dynamic modes of chromatin
   accessibility, suggesting controlled deployment during embryogenesis.
   Our results suggest that the control of wnt1 and wnt10b expression is
   under complex regulation involving the interaction of multiple
   enhancers.},

Abstract = {Tarantulas represent some of the heaviest and most famous spiders.
   However, there is little information about the embryonic development of
   these spiders or their relatives (infraorder Mygalomorphae) and
   time-lapse recording of the embryonic development is entirely missing. I
   here describe the complete development of the Brazilian white knee
   tarantula, Acanthoscurria geniculata, in fixed and live embryos. The
   establishment of the blastoderm, the formation, migration and signalling
   of the cumulus and the shape changes that occur in the segment addition
   zone are analysed in detail. In addition, I show that there might be
   differences in the contraction process of early embryos of different
   theraphosid spider species. A new embryonic reference transcriptome was
   generated for this study and was used to clone and analyse the
   expression of several important developmental genes. Finally, I show
   that embryos of A. geniculata are amenable to tissue transplantation and
   bead insertion experiments. Using these functional approaches, I induced
   axis duplication in embryos via cumulus transplantation and ectopic
   activation of BMP signalling. Overall, the mygalomorph spider A.
   geniculata is a useful laboratory system to analyse evolutionary
   developmental questions, and the availability of such a system will help
   understanding conserved and divergent aspects of spider/chelicerate
   development.},

Abstract = {Establishment of the body plan of multicellular organisms by the primary
   body axis determination and cell-fate specification is a key issue in
   biology. We have examined the mRNA localization of three Wnt pathway
   components gsk3, -catenin, and disheveled and investigated the effects
   of four selective inhibitors of these proteins on the early
   developmental stages of the spiral cleavage embryo of the fresh water
   snail Lymnaea (L.) stagnalis. mRNAs for gsk3 and -catenin were
   distributed uniformly throughout the embryo during development whereas
   disheveled mRNA showed specific localization with intra- and
   inter-blastomere differences in concentration along the A-V axis during
   spiral cleavages. Remarkably, through inhibitor studies, we identified a
   short sensitive period from the 2- to 4-cell stage in which GSK3
   inhibition by the highly specific 1-azakenpaullone (AZ) and by LiCl
   induced a subsequent dramatic developmental delay and alteration of the
   cleavage patterns of blastomeres at the fifth cleavage (16- to 24-cell
   stage) resulting in exogastrulation and other abnormalities in later
   stages. Inhibition of -Catenin or Disheveled had no effect. Our
   inhibitor experiments establish a novel role for GSK3 in the
   developmental timing and orientated cell division of the snail embryo.
   Further work will be needed to identify the downstream targets of the
   kinase.},

   Holm's organizer and self-regulation of embryonic fields},

Volume = {230},

Abstract = {Bilaterally symmetric body plans of vertebrates and arthropods are
   defined by a single set of two orthogonal axes, the anterior-posterior
   (or head-tail) and dorsal-ventral axes. In vertebrates, and especially
   amphibians, complete or partial doubling of the bilaterian body axes can
   be induced by two different types of embryological manipulations:
   transplantation of an organizer region or bi-sectioning of an embryo.
   Such axis doubling relies on the ability of embryonic fields to flexibly
   respond to the situation and self-regulate toward forming a whole body.
   This phenomenon has facilitated experimental efforts to investigate the
   mechanisms of vertebrate body axes formation. However, few studies have
   addressed the self-regulatory capabilities of embryonic fields
   associated with body axes formation in non-vertebrate bilaterians. The
   pioneer spider embryologist angstrom ke Holm reported twinning of spider
   embryos induced by both types of embryological manipulations in 1952;
   yet, his experiments have not been replicated by other investigators,
   and access to spider or non-vertebrate twins has been limited. In this
   review, we provide a historical background on twinning experiments in
   spiders, and an overview of current twinning approaches in familiar
   spider species and related molecular studies. Moreover, we discuss the
   benefits of the spider model system for a deeper understanding of the
   ancestral mechanisms of body axes formation in arthropods, as well as in
   bilaterians.},

Abstract = {Axis formation is one of the most important events occurring at the
   beginning of animal development. In the ascidian egg, the
   antero-posterior axis is established at this time owing to a dynamic
   cytoplasmic movement called cytoplasmic and cortical reorganisation.
   During this movement, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and
   maternal mRNAs (postplasmic/PEM RNAs) are translocated to the future
   posterior side. Although accumulating evidence indicates the crucial
   roles played by the asymmetrical localisation of these organelles and
   the translational regulation of postplasmic/PEM RNAs, the organisation
   of ER has not been described in sufficient detail to date owing to
   technical difficulties. In this study, we developed three different
   multiple staining protocols for visualising the ER in combination with
   mitochondria, microtubules, or mRNAs in whole-mount specimens. We
   defined the internally expanded ``dense ER{''} using these protocols and
   described cisterna-like structures of the dense ER using focused ion
   beam-scanning electron microscopy. Most importantly, we described the
   dynamic changes in the colocalisation of postplasmic/PEM mRNAs and dense
   ER; for example, macho-1 mRNA was detached and excluded from the dense
   ER during the second phase of ooplasmic movements. These detailed
   descriptions of the association between maternal mRNA and ER can provide
   clues for understanding the translational regulation mechanisms
   underlying axis determination during ascidian early embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing methods are used to reveal functions of genes
   and molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes in many
   species, including nematodes. In evolutionary biology, the nematode
   Pristionchus pacificus is a satellite model and has been used to
   understand interesting phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity and
   self-recognition. In P. pacificus, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations are
   induced by microinjecting a guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein into the
   gonads. However, mutant screening is laborious and time-consuming due to
   the absence of visual markers. In this study, we established a Co-CRISPR
   strategy by using a dominant roller marker in P. pacificus. We found
   that heterozygous mutations in Ppa-prl-1 induced the roller phenotype,
   which can be used as an injection marker. After the co-injection of
   Ppa-prl-1 gRNA, target gRNA, and the Cas9 protein, roller progeny and
   their siblings were examined using the heteroduplex mobility assay and
   DNA sequencing. We found that some of the roller and non-roller siblings
   had mutations at the target site. We used varying Cas9 concentrations
   and found that a higher concentration of Cas9 did not increase
   genome-editing events. The Co-CRISPR strategy promotes the screening for
   genome-editing events and will facilitate the development of new
   genome-editing methods in P. pacificus.},

Abstract = {Silicatein is the main protein responsible for the formation of
   spicules, tiny structures that constitute the silica skeleton of marine
   demosponges (Phylum Porifera). A unique innovation in Porifera that
   evolved from the cathepsin L family of proteins, it has been reported
   that two amino acids (S and H) are necessary to form the catalytic triad
   (SHN) to enable silica condensation. However, a diversity of silicatein
   sequence variants has since been reported with a variable pattern of
   presence/absence across sponge groups. Variants containing CHN or C/SQN
   at the active site appear more common in sponges from the Haplosclerida.
   Here, we report the expression levels of five silicatein variants
   through different developmental stages in the haplosclerid Haliclona
   indistincta. All five silicatein variants were expressed at low levels
   in the free-swimming larvae, which lack spicules and expression
   significantly increased at the two developmental phases in which
   spicules were visible. At these two phases, silicateins of CHN and C/SQN
   types were much more highly expressed than the SHN type indicating a
   possible ability of active sites with these alternative amino acids to
   condense silica and a more complex evolutionary story for spicule
   formation in marine demosponges than previously understood.},

Abstract = {Large-scale studies on community ecology are highly desirable but often
   difficult to accomplish due to the considerable investment of time,
   labor and, money required to characterize richness, abundance,
   relatedness, and interactions. Nonetheless, such large-scale
   perspectives are necessary for understanding the composition, dynamics,
   and resilience of biological communities. Small invertebrates play a
   central role in ecosystems, occupying critical positions in the food web
   and performing a broad variety of ecological functions. However, it has
   been particularly difficult to adequately characterize communities of
   these animals because of their exceptionally high diversity and
   abundance. Spiders in particular fulfill key roles as both predator and
   prey in terrestrial food webs and are hence an important focus of
   ecological studies. In recent years, large-scale community analyses have
   benefitted tremendously from advances in DNA barcoding technology.
   High-throughput sequencing (HTS), particularly DNA metabarcoding,
   enables community-wide analyses of diversity and interactions at
   unprecedented scales and at a fraction of the cost that was previously
   possible. Here, we review the current state of the application of these
   technologies to the analysis of spider communities. We discuss
   amplicon-based DNA barcoding and metabarcoding for the analysis of
   community diversity and molecular gut content analysis for assessing
   predator-prey relationships. We also highlight applications of the third
   generation sequencing technology for long read and portable DNA
   barcoding. We then address the development of theoretical frameworks for
   community-level studies, and finally highlight critical gaps and future
   directions for DNA analysis of spider communities.},

Volume = {232},

Abstract = {The origin, diversification, and secondary loss of sexually dimorphic
   characters are common in animal evolution. In some cases, structurally
   and functionally similar traits have evolved independently in multiple
   lineages. Prominent examples of such traits include the male-specific
   grasping structures that develop on the front legs of many dipteran
   insects. In this report, we describe the evolution and development of
   one of these structures, the male-specific ``sex brush.{''} The sex
   brush is composed of densely packed, irregularly arranged modified
   bristles and is found in several distantly related lineages in the
   family Drosophilidae. Phylogenetic analysis using 250 genes from over
   200 species provides modest support for a single origin of the sex brush
   followed by many secondary losses; however, independent origins of the
   sex brush cannot be ruled out completely. We show that sex brushes
   develop in very similar ways in all brush-bearing lineages. The dense
   packing of brush hairs is explained by the specification of bristle
   precursor cells at a near-maximum density permitted by the lateral
   inhibition mechanism, as well as by the reduced size of the surrounding
   epithelial cells. In contrast to the female and the ancestral male
   condition, where bristles are arranged in stereotypical, precisely
   spaced rows, cell migration does not contribute appreciably to the
   formation of the sex brush. The complex phylogenetic history of the sex
   brush can make it a valuable model for investigating coevolution of
   sex-specific morphology and mating behavior.},

Abstract = {Aphids are hemimetabolous insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis
   without pupation. The annual life cycle of most aphids includes both an
   asexual (viviparous) and a sexual (oviparous) phase. Sexual reproduction
   only occurs once per year and is followed by many generations of asexual
   reproduction, during which aphids propagate exponentially with
   telescopic development. Here, we discuss the potential links between
   viviparous embryogenesis and derived developmental features in the pea
   aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, particularly focusing on germline
   specification and axis determination, both of which are key events of
   early development in insects. We also discuss potential evolutionary
   paths through which both viviparous and oviparous females might have
   come to utilize maternal germ plasm to drive germline specification.
   This developmental strategy, as defined by germline markers, has not
   been reported in other hemimetabolous insects. In viviparous females,
   furthermore, we discuss whether molecules that in other insects
   characterize germ plasm, like Vasa, also participate in posterior
   determination and how the anterior localization of the hunchback
   orthologue Ap-hb establishes the anterior-posterior axis. We propose
   that the linked chain of developing oocytes and embryos within each
   ovariole and the special morphology of early embryos might have driven
   the formation of evolutionary novelties in germline specification and
   axis determination in the viviparous aphids. Moreover, based upon the
   finding that the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is closely associated
   with germ cells throughout embryogenesis, we propose presumptive roles
   for B. aphidicola in aphid development, discussing how it might regulate
   germline migration in both reproductive modes of pea aphids. In summary,
   we expect that this review will shed light on viviparous as well as
   oviparous development in aphids.},

Abstract = {The zinc finger-containing transcription factor Gli3 is a key mediator
   of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In vertebrates, Gli3 has widespread
   expression pattern during early embryonic development. Along the
   anteroposterior axes of the central nervous system (CNS), dorsoventral
   neural pattern elaboration is achieved through Hh mediated
   spatio-temporal deployment of Gli3 transcripts. Previously, we and
   others uncovered a set of enhancers that mediate many of the known
   aspects of Gli3 expression during neurogenesis. However, the potential
   role of Gli3 associated enhancers in trait evolution has not yet
   received any significant attention. Here, we investigate the
   evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated CNS-specific enhancers that
   have been reported so far. A subset of these enhancers has undergone an
   accelerated rate of molecular evolution in the human lineage in
   comparison to other primates/mammals. These fast-evolving enhancers have
   acquired human-specific changes in transcription factor binding sites
   (TFBSs). These human-unique changes within subset of Gli3 associated
   CNS-specific enhancers were further validated as single nucleotide
   polymorphisms through 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 data. This work not
   only infers the molecular evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated
   enhancers but also provides clues for putative genetic basis of the
   population-specificity of gene expression regulation.},

Abstract = {Crinoids are considered as the most basal extant echinoderms. They
   retain aboral nervous system with a nerve center, which has been
   degraded in the eleutherozoan echinoderms. To investigate the evolution
   of patterning of the nervous systems in crinoids, we examined temporal
   and spatial expression patterns of three neural patterning-related
   homeobox genes,six3,pax6, andotx, throughout the development of a
   feather starAnneissia japonica. These genes were involved in the
   patterning of endomesodermal tissues instead of the ectodermal neural
   tissues in the early planktonic stages. In the stages after larval
   attachment, the expression of these genes was mainly observed in the
   podia and the oral nervous systems instead of the aboral nerve center.
   Our results indicate the involvement of these three genes in the
   formation of oral nervous system in the common ancestor of the
   echinoderms and suggest that the aboral nerve center is not
   evolutionally related to the brain of other bilaterians.},

Title = {What lies beneath: Hydra provides cnidarian perspectives into the
   evolution of FGFR docking proteins},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {230},

Pages = {227-238},

Abstract = {Across the Bilateria, FGF/FGFR signaling is critical for normal
   development, and in both Drosophila and vertebrates, docking proteins
   are required to connect activated FGFRs with downstream pathways. While
   vertebrates use Frs2 to dock FGFR to the RAS/MAPK or PI3K pathways, the
   unrelated protein, downstream of FGFR (Dof/stumps/heartbroken), fulfills
   the corresponding function in Drosophila. To better understand the
   evolution of the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR, the available
   sequence databases were screened to identify Frs2, Dof, and other key
   pathway components in phyla that diverged early in animal evolution.
   While Frs2 homologues were detected only in members of the Bilateria,
   canonical Dof sequences (containing Dof, ankyrin, and SH2/SH3 domains)
   were present in cnidarians as well as bilaterians (but not in other
   animals or holozoans), correlating with the appearance of FGFR. Although
   these data suggested that Dof coupling might be ancestral, gene
   expression analysis in the cnidarian Hydra revealed that Dof is not
   upregulated in the zone of strong FGFRa and FGFRb expression at the bud
   base, where FGFR signaling controls detachment. In contrast, transcripts
   encoding other, known elements of FGFR signaling in Bilateria, namely
   the FGFR adaptors Grb2 and Crkl, which are acting downstream of Dof (and
   Frs2), as well as the guanyl nucleotide exchange factor Sos, and the
   tyrosine phosphatase Csw/Shp2, were strongly upregulated at the bud
   base. Our expression analysis, thus, identified transcriptional
   upregulation of known elements of FGFR signaling at the Hydra bud base
   indicating a highly conserved toolkit. Lack of transcriptional Dof
   upregulation raises the interesting question, whether Hydra FGFR
   signaling requires either of the docking proteins known from Bilateria.},

Abstract = {Sexual reproduction is pervasive in animals and has led to the evolution
   of sexual dimorphism. In most animals, males and females show marked
   differences in primary and secondary sexual traits. The formation of
   sex-specific organs and eventually sex-specific behaviors is defined
   during the development of an organism. Sex determination processes have
   been extensively studied in a few well-established model organisms.
   While some key molecular regulators are conserved across animals, the
   initiation of sex determination is highly diverse. To reveal the
   mechanisms underlying the development of sexual dimorphism and to
   identify the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of different
   sexes, sex determination mechanisms must thus be studied in detail in
   many different animal species beyond the typical model systems. In this
   perspective article, we argue that spiders represent an excellent group
   of animals in which to study sex determination mechanisms. We show that
   spiders are sexually dimorphic in various morphological, behavioral, and
   life history traits. The availability of an increasing number of genomic
   and transcriptomic resources and functional tools provides a great
   starting point to scrutinize the extensive sexual dimorphism present in
   spiders on a mechanistic level. We provide an overview of the current
   knowledge of sex determination in spiders and propose approaches to
   reveal the molecular and genetic underpinnings of sexual dimorphism in
   these exciting animals.},

Abstract = {Anterior patterning in animals is based on a gene regulatory network,
   which comprises highly conserved transcription factors like six3, pax6
   and otx. More recently, foxQ2 was found to be an ancestral component of
   this network but its regulatory interactions showed evolutionary
   differences. In most animals, foxQ2 is a downstream target of six3 and
   knockdown leads to mild or no epidermal phenotypes. In contrast, in the
   red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, foxQ2 gained a more prominent role
   in patterning leading to strong epidermal and brain phenotypes and being
   required for six3 expression. However, it has remained unclear which of
   these novel aspects were insect or arthropod specific. Here, we study
   expression and RNAi phenotype of the single foxQ2 ortholog of the spider
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We find early anterior expression similar to
   the one of insects. Further, we show an epidermal phenotype in the
   labrum similar to the insect phenotype. However, our data indicate that
   foxQ2 is positioned downstream of six3 like in other animals but unlike
   insects. Hence, the epidermal and neural pattering function of foxQ2 is
   ancestral for arthropods while the upstream role of foxQ2 may have
   evolved in the lineage leading to the insects.},

Abstract = {In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a hierarchic segmentation gene
   cascade patterns the anterior-posterior body axis of the developing
   embryo. Within this cascade, the pair-rule genes (PRGs) transform the
   more uniform patterning of the higher-level genes into a metameric
   pattern that first represents double-segmental units, and then, in a
   second step, represents a true segmental pattern. Within the PRG
   network, primary PRGs regulate secondary PRGs that are directly involved
   in the regulation of the next lower level, the segment-polarity genes
   (SPGs). While the complement of primary PRGs is different in Drosophila
   and the beetle Tribolium, another arthropod model organism, both paired
   (prd) and sloppy-paired (slp), acts as secondary PRGs. In earlier
   studies, the interaction of PRGs and the role of the single slp ortholog
   in Tribolium have been investigated in some detail revealing conserved
   and diverged aspects of PRG function. In this study, I present the
   identification and the analysis of embryonic expression patterns of a
   second slp gene (called slp2) in Tribolium. While the previously
   identified gene, slp, is expressed in a typical PRG pattern, expression
   of slp2 is more similar to that of the downstream-acting SPGs, and shows
   expression similarities to slp2 in Drosophila. The previously reported
   differences between the function of slp in Drosophila and Tribolium may
   partially account for the function of the newly identified second slp
   paralog in Tribolium, and it may therefore be advised to conduct further
   studies on PRG function in the beetle.},

Abstract = {In the arthropod model species Drosophila melanogaster, a dipteran fly,
   segmentation of the anterior-posterior body axis is under control of a
   hierarchic gene cascade. Segmental boundaries that form morphological
   grooves are established posteriorly within the segmental expression
   domain of the segment-polarity gene (SPG) engrailed (en). More important
   for the development of the fly, however, are the parasegmental
   boundaries that are established at the interface of en expressing cells
   and anteriorly adjacent wingless (wg) expressing cells. In Drosophila,
   both segmental and transient parasegmental grooves form. The latter are
   positioned anterior to the expression of en. Although the function of
   the SPGs in establishing and maintaining segmental and parasegmental
   boundaries is highly conserved among arthropods, parasegmental grooves
   have only been reported for Drosophila, and a spider (Cupiennius salei).
   Here, we present new data on en expression, and re-evaluate published
   data, from four distantly related spiders, including Cupiennius, and a
   distantly related chelicerate, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Gene
   expression analysis of en genes in these animals does not corroborate
   the presence of parasegmental grooves. Consequently, our data question
   the general presence of parasegmental grooves in arthropods.},

Abstract = {The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway has been widely associated to the
   reestablishment of anteroposterior body polarities in the embryonic
   development and regeneration in animals. For instance, in annelids,
   cellular proliferation, wound healing, and blastema development can be
   affected when this pathway is disrupted. However, very little is known
   about the genetic regulatory processes involved in these anomalies.
   Here, we investigate the morphological effects of 1-azakenpaullone, a
   pharmacological inhibitor of GSK3 beta that is supposed to over-activate
   the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, during the anterior and posterior
   regeneration of the annelid Syllis malaquini. The results showed that
   high concentrations of 1-azakenpaullone affect the stages of blastema
   differentiation and resegmentation. Therefore, GSK3 beta-associated gene
   regulatory networks are candidate to investigate the genetic mechanisms
   involved in the regular course of S. malaquini regeneration.},

Abstract = {Our studies conducted on reptilian limb muscle development revealed, for
   the first time, early forelimb muscle differentiation at the
   morphological and molecular level. Sand lizard skeletal muscle
   differentiation in the early forelimb bud was investigated by light,
   confocal, and transmission electron microscopy as well as western blot.
   The early forelimb bud, filled with mesenchymal cells, is surrounded by
   monolayer epithelium cells. The immunocytochemical analysis revealed the
   presence of Pax3- and Lbx-positive cells in the vicinity of the
   ventro-lateral lip (VLL) of the dermomyotome, suggesting that VLL is the
   source of limb muscle progenitor cells. Furthermore, Pax3- and
   Lbx-positive cells were observed in the dorsal and ventral myogenic
   pools of the forelimb bud. Skeletal muscle development in the early limb
   bud is asynchronous, which is manifested by the presence of myogenic
   cells in different stages of differentiation: multinucleated myotubes
   with well-developed contractile apparatus, myoblasts, and mitotically
   active premyoblasts. The western blot analysis revealed the presence of
   MyoD and Myf5 proteins in all investigated developmental stages. The
   MyoD western blot analysis showed two bands corresponding to monomeric
   (mMyoD) and dimeric (dMyoD) fractions. Two separate bands were also
   detected in the case of Myf5. The observed bands were related to
   non-phosphorylated (Myf5) and phosphorylated (pMyf5) fractions of Myf5.
   Our investigations on sand lizard forelimb myogenesis showed that the
   pattern of muscle differentiation in the early forelimb bud shares many
   features with rodents and chicks.},

Abstract = {Computer-assisted 4D manual cell tracking has been a valuable method for
   understanding spatial-temporal dynamics of embryogenesis (e.g., Stach \&

   1-28 2017; Wolff et al. eLife, 7, e34410 2018) since the method was
   introduced in the late 1990s. Since two decades SIMI (R) BioCell
   (Schnabel et al. Dev Biol, 184, 234-265 1997), a software which
   initially was developed for analyzing data coming from the, at that time
   new technique of 4D microscopy, is in use. Many laboratories around the
   world use SIMI BioCell for the manual tracing of cells in embryonic
   development of various species to reconstruct cell genealogies with high
   precision. However, the software has several disadvantages: limits in
   handling very large data sets, the virtually no maintenance over the
   last 10years (bound to older Windows versions), the difficulty to access
   the created cell lineage data for analyses outside SIMI BioCell, and the
   high cost of the program. Recently, bioinformatics, in close
   collaboration with biologists, developed new lineaging tools that are
   freely available through the open source image processing platform Fiji.
   Here we introduce a software tool that allows conversion of SIMI BioCell
   lineage data to a format that is compatible with the Fiji plugin MaMuT
   (Wolff et al. eLife, 7, e34410 2018). Hereby we intend to maintain the
   usability of SIMI BioCell created cell lineage data for the future and,
   for investigators who wish to do so, facilitate the transition from this
   software to a more convenient program.},

Abstract = {Johnston's organ has been shown to act as an antennal auditory organ
   across a spectrum of insect species. In the hemimetabolous desert locust
   Schistocerca gregaria, Johnston's organ must be functional on hatching
   and so develops in the pedicellar segment of the antenna during
   embryogenesis. Here, we employ the epithelial cell marker Lachesin to
   identify the pedicellar domain of the early embryonic antenna and then
   triple-label against Lachesin, the mitosis marker phosphohistone-3, and
   neuron-specific horseradish peroxidase to reveal the sense-organ
   precursors for Johnston's organ and their lineages. Beginning with a
   single progenitor at approximately a third of embryogenesis, additional
   precursors subsequently appear in both the ventral and dorsal pedicellar
   domains, each generating a lineage or clone. Lineage locations are
   remarkably conserved across preparations and ages, consistent with the
   epithelium possessing an underlying topographic coordinate system that
   determines the cellular organization of Johnston's organ. By
   mid-embryogenesis, twelve lineages are arranged circumferentially in the
   pedicel as in the adult structure. Each sense-organ precursor is
   associated with a smaller mitotically active cell from which the
   neuronal complement of each clone may derive. Neuron numbers within a
   clone increase in discrete steps with age and are invariant between
   clones and across preparations of a given age. At mid-embryogenesis,
   each clone comprises five cells consolidated into a tightly bound
   cartridge. A long scolopale extends apically from each cartridge to an
   insertion point in the epithelium, and bundled axons project basally
   toward the brain. Comparative data suggest mechanisms that might also
   regulate the developmental program of Johnston's organ in the locust.},

Abstract = {Mechanical influencers have long been shown to affect mature bone. Bone
   mechanosensation is a key feature that allows the skeleton to adapt to
   environmental constraints. In this study, we describe the response of
   immature, developing bones to a mechanical stimulus. To do so, zebrafish
   larvae at different stages of development were exposed to whole-body
   vibration (WBV) at a low frequency of 20 Hz, for up to 4 days. Whole
   mount Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining revealed age-related and
   bone type-specific defects. Specifically, the parhypural and hypural 1
   caudal fin endoskeletal elements were affected when the exposure to WBV
   started early during their development. We show that these WBV-induced
   parhypural and hypural 1 patterning defects are triggered by a
   Sox9-independent pathway, potentially by reducing the distance
   separating adjacent chondrogenic condensations in the developing tail
   skeleton. The remaining hypurals were unaffected by the WBV treatment.
   Altogether, our results indicate that, upon exposure to vibration,
   chondrogenic cell progenitors can react to mechanical stimuli early
   during their development, which ultimately affects the skeletal
   patterning of the growing zebrafish larvae. These findings open a new
   research avenue to better understand the cellular processes involved in
   developing, patterning, and maintaining skeletal tissue.},

Title = {Expression and potential functions of KIF3A/3B to promote nuclear

Abstract = {KIF3A and KIF3B are homologous motor subunits of the Kinesin II protein
   family. KIF3A, KIF3B, and KAP3 form a heterotrimeric complex and play a
   significant role in spermatogenesis. Here, we first cloned full-length
   kif3a/3b cDNAs from Larimichthys polyactis. Lp-kif3a/3b are highly
   related to their homologs in other animals. The proteins are composed of
   three domains, an N-terminal head domain, a central stalk domain, and a
   C-terminus tail domain. Lp-kif3a/3bmRNAs were found to be ubiquitously
   expressed in the examined tissues, with high expression in the testis.
   Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to analyze the
   expression of Lp-kif3a/3b mRNAs during spermiogenesis. The results
   showed that Lp-kif3a/3b mRNAs had similar expression pattern and were
   continuously expressed during spermiogenesis. From middle spermatid to
   mature sperm, Lp-kif3a/3b mRNAs gradually localized to the side of the
   spermatid where the midpiece and tail form. In addition, we used
   immunofluorescence (IF) to observe that Lp-KIF3A protein co-localizes
   with tubulin during spermiogenesis. In early spermatid, Lp-KIF3A protein
   and microtubule signals were randomly distributed in the cytoplasm. In
   middle spermatid, however, the protein was detected primarily around the
   nucleus. In late spermatid, the protein migrated primarily to one side
   of the nucleus where the tail forms. In mature sperm, Lp-KIF3A and
   microtubules accumulated in the midpiece. Moreover, Lp-KIF3A
   co-localized with the mitochondria. In mature sperm, Lp-KIF3A and
   mitochondria were present in the midpiece. Therefore, Lp-KIF3A/KIF3B may
   be involved in spermiogenesis in L. polyactis, particularly during
   nuclear reshaping and tail formation.},

Abstract = {Spiders have emerged as one of the leading model organisms in many
   research fields due to their compelling biology. Often, scientific
   investigations involving the use of spiders face inevitable problems
   associated with the lack of specimens from laboratory stock, resulting
   in difficulties in yielding reproducible investigations for predictive
   research. Thus, several species of well-studied spiders, including
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum, have been successfully bred for such
   purposes. Crossopriza lyoni is a Haplogyne spider, globally distributed
   and widespread in human inhabitants, prompting interest in various
   studies over the last decades. Despite its scientific importance, no
   laboratory-bred C. lyoni has been documented. Therefore, we describe a
   successful captive breeding system of the species under controlled
   conditions to establish a laboratory stock culture. Methods for mating
   induction, egg collection and segregation, artificial embryo incubation,
   and colony husbandry are discussed. The technique presented is a simple
   and low-cost approach that is reliable for C. lyoni propagation in the
   laboratory over several generations.},

Abstract = {Germ cell-specific genes play an important role in establishing the
   reproductive system in sexual organisms and have been used as valuable
   markers for studying gametogenesis and sex differentiation. Previously,
   we isolated a vasa transcript as a germ cell marker to trace the origin
   and migration of germ cells in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium
   nipponense. Here, we identified a new germ cell-specific marker MnTdrd
   RNA and assessed its temporal and spatial expression during oogenesis
   and embryogenesis. MnTdrd transcripts were expressed in high abundance
   in unfertilized eggs and embryos at cleavage stage and then dropped
   significantly during late embryogenesis, suggesting that MnTdrd mRNA is
   maternally inherited. In situ hybridization of ovarian tissue showed
   that MnTdrd mRNA was initially present in the cytoplasm of
   previtellogenic oocyte and localized to the perinuclear region as the
   accumulation of yolk in vitellogenic oocyte. Whole-mount in situ
   hybridization of embryos showed that MnTdrd-positive signals were only
   localized in one blastomere until 16-cell stage. In the blastula, there
   were approximately 16 MnTdrd-positive blastomeres. During
   embryonized-zoea stage, the MnTdrd-positive cells aggregated as a
   cluster and migrated to the genital rudiment which would develop into
   primordial germ cells (PGCs). The localized expression pattern of MnTdrd
   transcripts resembled that of the previously identified germ cell marker
   vasa, supporting the preformation mode of germ cell specification.
   Therefore, we concluded that MnTdrd, together with vasa, is a component
   of the germ plasm and might have critical roles in germ cell formation
   and differentiation in the prawn. Thus, MnTdrd can be used as a novel
   germ cell marker to trace the origin and migration of germ cells.},

Title = {Developmental gene expression as a phylogenetic data class: support for
   the monophyly of Arachnopulmonata},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Despite application of genome-scale datasets, the phylogenetic placement
   of scorpions within arachnids remains contentious between two different
   phylogenetic data classes. Paleontologists continue to recover scorpions
   in a basally branching position, partly owing to their morphological
   similarity to extinct marine orders like Eurypterida (sea scorpions).
   Phylogenomic datasets consistently recover scorpions in a derived
   position, as the sister group of Tetrapulmonata (a clade of arachnids
   that includes spiders). To adjudicate between these hypotheses using a
   rare genomic change (RGC), we leveraged the recent discovery of ancient
   paralogy in spiders and scorpions to assess phylogenetic placement. We
   identified homologs of four transcription factors required for appendage
   patterning (dachshund, homothorax, extradenticle, and optomotor blind)
   in arthropods that are known to be duplicated in spiders. Using genomic
   resources for a spider, a scorpion, and a harvestman, we conducted gene
   tree analyses and assayed expression patterns of scorpion gene
   duplicates. Here we show that scorpions, like spiders, retain two copies
   of all four transcription factors, whereas arachnid orders like mites
   and harvestmen bear a single copy. A survey of embryonic expression
   patterns of the scorpion paralogs closely matches those of their spider
   counterparts, with one paralog consistently retaining the putatively
   ancestral pattern found in the harvestman, as well as the mite, and/or
   other outgroups. These data comprise a rare genomic change in
   chelicerate phylogeny supporting the inference of a distal placement of
   scorpions. Beyond demonstrating the diagnostic power of developmental
   genetic data as a phylogenetic data class, a derived placement of
   scorpions within the arachnids, together with an array of stem-group
   Paleozoic scorpions that occupied marine habitats, effectively rules out
   a scenario of a single colonization of terrestrial habitat within
   Chelicerata, even in tree topologies contrived to recover the monophyly
   of Arachnida.},

   elongation is represented by the Wnt genes, secreted glycoprotein
   ligands that signal to specific receptors on neighbouring cells and
   thereby establish cell-to-cell communication. In segmented animals such
   as annelids and arthropods, Wnt signalling is also likely involved in
   segment border formation and regionalisation of the segments. Priapulids
   represent unsegmented worms that are distantly related to arthropods.
   Despite their interesting phylogenetic position and their importance for
   the understanding of ecdysozoan evolution, priapulids still represent a
   highly underinvestigated group of animals. Here, we study the embryonic
   expression patterns of the complete sets of Wnt genes in the priapulids
   Priapulus caudatus and Halicryptus spinulosus. We find that both
   priapulids possess a complete set of 12 Wnt genes. At least in
   Priapulus, most of these genes are expressed in and around the
   posterior-located blastopore and thus likely play a role in posterior
   elongation. Together with previous work on the expression of other
   genetic factors such as caudal and even-skipped, this suggests that
   posterior elongation in priapulids is under control of the same (or very
   similar) conserved gene regulatory network as in arthropods.},

Abstract = {Upstream stimulatory factors are kinds of multi-functional transcription
   factors, which are expressed in eukaryotes widely, including Upstream
   stimulatory factor 1 (USFl) and upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2).
   USF protein has a typical basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper
   (b-HLH-LZ) structure, which is involved in cell cycle, cell
   proliferations, glucose and lipid metabolism, and other biochemical
   processes. Although the USF family is an important regulator of cellular
   processes, little is known about the USF genes of lampreys, especially
   their evolutionary relationships, expression profiles, and biological
   functions. Here, an upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) homolog from
   lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri) was identified and characterized
   (designated as L-USF2) because it is closer to USF2 subfamily than to
   USF1 subfamily. The cDNA fragment of L-USF2 has an open reading frame
   (ORF) of 765-bp length, encodes 254 amino acids, and contains an HLH
   domain at the c-terminal of amino acids. Meanwhile, motifs and genetic
   structure analysis reveal that USF2 gene exons are conserved. Moreover,
   the 3D structure analysis indicates that L-USF2 adopts the general USF2
   folding and has a high structural similarity with H-USF2. The synteny
   results showed that the L-USF2 adjacent gene changed greatly compared
   with the jaw vertebrates. By real-time quantitative experiment and
   Western blot analysis, we found that L-USF2 gene played a significant
   role in the immune responses. This study not only provides us with a
   further understanding of the evolution and function of the USF gene
   family but also provides a basis for exploring its immune responses and
   immune defenses in lampreys.},

Title = {Towards reconstructing the dipteran demise of an ancient essential gene:
   E3 ubiquitin ligase Murine double minute},

Volume = {230},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Genome studies have uncovered many examples of essential gene loss,
   raising the question of how ancient genes transition from essentiality
   to dispensability. We explored this process for the deeply conserved E3
   ubiquitin ligase Murine double minute (Mdm), which is lacking in
   Drosophila despite the conservation of its main regulatory target, the
   cellular stress response gene p53. Conducting gene expression and
   knockdown experiments in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, we
   found evidence that Mdm has remained essential in insects where it is
   present. Using bioinformatics approaches, we confirm the absence of the
   Mdm gene family in Drosophila, mapping its loss to the stem lineage of
   schizophoran Diptera and Pipunculidae (big-headed flies), about 95-85
   million years ago. Intriguingly, this gene loss event was preceded by
   the de novo origin of the gene Companion of reaper (Corp), a novel p53
   regulatory factor that is characterized by functional similarities to
   vertebrate Mdm2 despite lacking E3 ubiquitin ligase protein domains.
   Speaking against a 1:1 compensatory gene gain/loss scenario, however, we
   found that hoverffies (Spphidae) and pointed-wing flies (Lonchoptcridae)
   possess both Mdm and Corp. This implies that the two p53 regulators have
   been coexisting for 150 million years in select dipteran clades and for
   at least 50 million years in the lineage to Schizophora and
   Pipunculidae. Given these extensive time spans of Mdm/Corp coexistence,
   we speculate that the loss of Mdm in the lineage to Drosophila involved
   further acquisitions of compensatory gene activities besides the
   emergence of Corp. Combined with the previously noted reduction of an
   ancestral P53 contact domain in the Mdm homologs of crustaceans and
   insects, we conclude that the loss of the ancient Mdm gene family in
   flies was the outcome of incremental functional regression over long
   macroevolutionary time scales.},

Abstract = {The Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus is regarded as an ideal
   model for studying local adaptations, such as longevity, tolerance to
   starvation, and cutaneous respiration. Transcriptome analysis is useful
   for studying the large and complex genomes of amphibians. Based on the
   coding gene set of adult A. davidianus, dozens of A. davidianus-specific
   genes were identified and three signaling pathway (JAK-STAT, HIF-1, and
   FoxO) genes were expanded as compared with other amphibians. The results
   of the pathway analysis of A. davidianus-specific genes indicated that
   the molecular adaptation of A. davidianus may have required a more rapid
   evolution of the immune system. Additionally, for the first time, the
   gene expressions in different parts of the skin tissue were compared.
   The results of the comparison analysis demonstrated that lateral skin
   could be more focused on mucus secretion, dorsal skin on immunity and
   melanogenesis, and abdominal skin on water and salt metabolism. This
   study provides the first insight into studying longevity and starvation
   tolerance in A. davidianus, and offers a basis for further investigation
   of the molecular mechanisms of adaptations in amphibians.},
