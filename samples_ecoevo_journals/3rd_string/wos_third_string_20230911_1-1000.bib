Title = {Pollution induces epigenetic effects that are stably transmitted across
   multiple generations},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 3},
Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the effects of pollutants on phenotypes
   can be passed to subsequent generations through epigenetic inheritance,
   affecting populations long after the removal of a pollutant. But there
   is still little evidence that pollutants can induce persistent
   epigenetic effects in animals. Here, we show that low doses of commonly
   used pollutants induce genome-wide differences in cytosine methylation
   in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex. Uniclonal populations were
   either continually exposed to pollutants or switched to clean water, and
   methylation was compared to control populations that did not experience
   pollutant exposure. Although some direct changes to methylation were
   only present in the continually exposed populations, others were present
   in both the continually exposed and switched to clean water treatments,
   suggesting that these modifications had persisted for 7 months (>15
   generations). We also identified modifications that were only present in
   the populations that had switched to clean water, indicating a long-term
   legacy of pollutant exposure distinct from the persistent effects.
   Pollutant-induced differential methylation tended to occur at sites that
   were highly methylated in controls. Modifications that were observed in
   both continually and switched treatments were highly methylated in
   controls and showed reduced methylation in the treatments. On the other
   hand, modifications found just in the switched treatment tended to have
   lower levels of methylation in the controls and showed increase
   methylation in the switched treatment. In a second experiment, we
   confirmed that sublethal doses of the same pollutants generate effects
   on life histories for at least three generations following the removal
   of the pollutant. Our results demonstrate that even low doses of
   pollutants can induce transgenerational epigenetic effects that are
   stably transmitted over many generations. Persistent effects are likely
   to influence phenotypic development, which could contribute to the rapid
   adaptation, or extinction, of populations confronted by anthropogenic
   stressors.},

Title = {Divergence and introgression among the virilis group of Drosophila},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {537-551},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Speciation with gene flow is now widely regarded as common. However, the
   frequency of introgression between recently diverged species and the
   evolutionary consequences of gene flow are still poorly understood. The
   virilis group of Drosophila contains 12 species that are geographically
   widespread and show varying levels of prezygotic and postzygotic
   isolation. Here, we use de novo genome assemblies and whole-genome
   sequencing data to resolve phylogenetic relationships and describe
   patterns of introgression and divergence across the group. We suggest
   that the virilis group consists of three, rather than the traditional
   two, subgroups. Some genes undergoing rapid sequence divergence across
   the group were involved in chemical communication and desiccation
   tolerance, and may be related to the evolution of sexual isolation and
   adaptation. We found evidence of pervasive phylogenetic discordance
   caused by ancient introgression events between distant lineages within
   the group, and more recent gene flow between closely related species.
   When assessing patterns of genome-wide divergence in species pairs
   across the group, we found no consistent genomic evidence of a
   disproportionate role for the X chromosome as has been found in other
   systems. Our results show how ancient and recent introgressions confuse
   phylogenetic reconstruction, but may play an important role during early
   radiation of a group.},

Abstract = {Although rapid phenotypic evolution has been documented often, the
   genomic basis of rapid adaptation to natural environments is largely
   unknown in multicellular organisms. Population genomic studies of
   experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
   provide a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon. Guppy populations
   that were transplanted from high-predation (HP) to low-predation (LP)
   environments have been shown to evolve toward the phenotypes of
   naturally colonized LP populations in as few as eight generations. These
   changes persist in common garden experiments, indicating that they have
   a genetic basis. Here, we report results of whole genome variation in
   four experimental populations colonizing LP sites along with the
   corresponding HP source population. We examined genome-wide patterns of
   genetic variation to estimate past demography and used a combination of
   genome scans, forward simulations, and a novel analysis of allele
   frequency change vectors to uncover the signature of selection. We
   detected clear signals of population growth and bottlenecks at the
   genome-wide level that matched the known history of population numbers.
   We found a region on chromosome 15 under strong selection in three of
   the four populations and with our multivariate approach revealing subtle
   parallel changes in allele frequency in all four populations across this
   region. Investigating patterns of genome-wide selection in this uniquely
   replicated experiment offers remarkable insight into the mechanisms
   underlying rapid adaptation, providing a basis for comparison with other
   species and populations experiencing rapidly changing environments.},

Title = {Interacting host modifier systems control Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic
   incompatibility in a haplodiploid mite},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-265},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia spread within host populations
   by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs when
   parasite-modified sperm fertilizes uninfected eggs and is typified by
   great variation in strength across biological systems. In haplodiploid
   hosts, CI has different phenotypic outcomes depending on whether the
   fertilized eggs die or develop into males. Genetic conflict theories
   predict the evolution of host modulation of CI, which in turn influences
   the stability of reproductive parasitism. However, despite the ubiquity
   of CI-inducing parasites in nature, there is scarce evidence for
   intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype. Here, we
   tested for intraspecific host modulation of Wolbachia-induced CI in
   haplodiploid Tetranychus urticae mites. Using a single CI-inducing
   Wolbachia variant and mitochondrion, a nuclear panel was created that
   consisted of infected and cured near-isogenic lines. We performed a
   highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross composed of
   incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier
   systems that cause striking variation in CI strength when carried by
   infected T. urticae males. We observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in
   our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of the
   CI phenotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the
   maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian
   inheritance. Both male and female modulation interacted with the
   genotype of the mating partner. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as
   an important target of selection for host modulation of CI strength and
   underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI
   phenotype. Our findings reveal that intraspecific host modulation of CI
   is underpinned by complex genetic architectures and confirm that the
   evolution of reproductive parasitism is contingent on host genetics.},

Title = {Why did the Wolbachia transinfection cross the road? drift,
   deterministic dynamics, and disease control},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-105},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Maternally inherited Wolbachia transinfections are being introduced into
   natural mosquito populations to reduce the transmission of dengue, Zika,
   and other arboviruses. Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility
   provides a frequency-dependent reproductive advantage to infected
   females that can spread transinfections within and among populations.
   However, because transinfections generally reduce host fitness, they
   tend to spread within populations only after their frequency exceeds a
   critical threshold. This produces bistability with stable equilibrium
   frequencies at both 0 and 1, analogous to the bistability produced by
   underdominance between alleles or karyotypes and by population dynamics
   under Allee effects. Here, we analyze how stochastic frequency variation
   produced by finite population size can facilitate the local spread of
   variants with bistable dynamics into areas where invasion is unexpected
   from deterministic models. Our exemplar is the establishment of wMel
   Wolbachia in the Aedes aegypti population of Pyramid Estates (PE), a
   small community in far north Queensland, Australia. In 2011, wMel was
   stably introduced into Gordonvale, separated from PE by barriers to A.
   aegypti dispersal. After nearly 6 years during which wMel was observed
   only at low frequencies in PE, corresponding to an apparent equilibrium
   between immigration and selection, wMel rose to fixation by 2018. Using
   analytic approximations and statistical analyses, we demonstrate that
   the observed fixation of wMel at PE is consistent with both stochastic
   transition past an unstable threshold frequency and deterministic
   transformation produced by steady immigration at a rate just above the
   threshold required for deterministic invasion. The indeterminacy results
   from a delicate balance of parameters needed to produce the delayed
   transition observed. Our analyses suggest that once Wolbachia
   transinfections are established locally through systematic
   introductions, stochastic ``threshold crossing{''} is likely to only
   minimally enhance spatial spread, providing a local ratchet that
   slightly-but systematically-aids area-wide transformation of
   disease-vector populations in heterogeneous landscapes.},

Title = {Sex-specific natural selection on SNPs in Silene latifolia},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {308-318},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Selection that acts in a sex-specific manner causes the evolution of
   sexual dimorphism. Sex-specific phenotypic selection has been
   demonstrated in many taxa and can be in the same direction in the two
   sexes (differing only in magnitude), limited to one sex, or in opposing
   directions (antagonistic). Attempts to detect the signal of sex-specific
   selection from genomic data have confronted numerous difficulties. These
   challenges highlight the utility of ``direct approaches,{''} in which
   fitness is predicted from individual genotype within each sex. Here, we
   directly measured selection on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in
   a natural population of the sexually dimorphic, dioecious plant, Silene
   latifolia. We measured flowering phenotypes, estimated fitness over one
   reproductive season, as well as survival to the next year, and genotyped
   all adults and a subset of their offspring for SNPs across the genome.
   We found that while phenotypic selection was congruent (fitness covaried
   similarly with flowering traits in both sexes), SNPs showed clear
   evidence for sex-specific selection. SNP-level selection was
   particularly strong in males and may involve an important gametic
   component (e.g., pollen competition). While the most significant SNPs
   under selection in males differed from those under selection in females,
   paternity selection showed a highly polygenic tradeoff with female
   survival. Alleles that increased male mating success tended to reduce
   female survival, indicating sexual antagonism at the genomic level.
   Perhaps most importantly, this experiment demonstrates that selection
   within natural populations can be strong enough to measure sex-specific
   fitness effects of individual loci. Males and females typically differ
   phenotypically, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. These
   differences arise when selection on males differs from selection on
   females, either in magnitude or direction. Estimated relationships
   between traits and fitness indicate that sex-specific selection is
   widespread, occurring in both plants and animals, and explains why so
   many species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Finding the specific loci
   experiencing sex-specific selection is a challenging prospect but one
   worth undertaking given the extensive evolutionary consequences.
   Flowering plants with separate sexes are ideal organisms for such
   studies, given that the fitness of females can be estimated by counting
   the number of seeds they produce. Determination of fitness for males has
   been made easier as thousands of genetic markers can now be used to
   assign paternity to seeds. We undertook just such a study in S.
   latifolia, a short-lived, herbaceous plant. We identified loci under
   sex-specific selection in this species and found more loci affecting
   fitness in males than females. Importantly, loci with major effects on
   male fitness were distinct from the loci with major effects on females.
   We detected sexual antagonism only when considering the aggregate effect
   of many loci. Hence, even though males and females share the same
   genome, this does not necessarily impose a constraint on their
   independent evolution.},

Title = {Why did the Wolbachia transinfection cross the road? drift,
   deterministic dynamics, and disease control},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JAN 5},
Abstract = {Maternally inherited Wolbachia transinfections are being introduced into
   natural mosquito populations to reduce the transmission of dengue, Zika,
   and other arboviruses. Wo/bachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility
   provides a frequency-dependent reproductive advantage to infected
   females that can spread transinfections within and among populations.
   However, because transinfections generally reduce host fitness, they
   tend to spread within populations only after their frequency exceeds a
   critical threshold. This produces bistability with stable equilibrium
   frequencies at both 0 and 1, analogous to the bistability produced by
   underdominance between alleles or karyotypes and by population dynamics
   under Allee effects. Here, we analyze how stochastic frequency variation
   produced by finite population size can facilitate the local spread of
   variants with bistable dynamics into areas where invasion is unexpected
   from deterministic models. Our exemplar is the establishment of wMel
   Wolbachia in the Aedes aegypti population of Pyramid Estates (PE), a
   small community in far north Queensland, Australia. In 2011, wMel was
   stably introduced into Gordonvale, separated from PE by barriers to A.
   aegypti dispersal. After nearly 6 years during which wMel was observed
   only at low frequencies in PE, corresponding to an apparent equilibrium
   between immigration and selection, wMel rose to fixation by 2018. Using
   analytic approximations and statistical analyses, we demonstrate that
   the observed fixation of wMel at PE is consistent with both stochastic
   transition past an unstable threshold frequency and deterministic
   transformation produced by steady immigration at a rate just above the
   threshold required for deterministic invasion. The indeterminacy results
   from a delicate balance of parameters needed to produce the delayed
   transition observed. Our analyses suggest that once Wolbachia
   transinfections are established locally through systematic
   introductions, stochastic ``threshold crossing{''} is likely to only
   minimally enhance spatial spread, providing a local ratchet that
   slightly-but systematically-aids area-wide transformation of
   disease-vector populations in heterogeneous landscapes.},

Title = {Differing associations between sex determination and sex-linked
   inversions in two ecotypes of Littorina saxatilis},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {358-374},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sexual antagonism is a common hypothesis for driving the evolution of
   sex chromosomes, whereby recombination suppression is favored between
   sexually antagonistic loci and the sex-determining locus to maintain
   beneficial combinations of alleles. This results in the formation of a
   sex-determining region. Chromosomal inversions may contribute to
   recombination suppression but their precise role in sex chromosome
   evolution remains unclear. Because local adaptation is frequently
   facilitated through the suppression of recombination between adaptive
   loci by chromosomal inversions, there is potential for inversions that
   cover sex-determining regions to be involved in local adaptation as
   well, particularly if habitat variation creates environment-dependent
   sexual antagonism. With these processes in mind, we investigated sex
   determination in a well-studied example of local adaptation within a
   species: the intertidal snail, Littorina saxatilis. Using SNP data from
   a Swedish hybrid zone, we find novel evidence for a female-heterogametic
   sex determination system that is restricted to one ecotype. Our results
   suggest that four putative chromosomal inversions, two previously
   described and two newly discovered, span the putative sex chromosome
   pair. We determine their differing associations with sex, which suggest
   distinct strata of differing ages. The same inversions are found in the
   second ecotype but do not show any sex association. The striking
   disparity in inversion-sex associations between ecotypes that are
   connected by gene flow across a habitat transition that is just a few
   meters wide indicates a difference in selective regime that has produced
   a distinct barrier to the spread of the newly discovered sex-determining
   region between ecotypes. Such sex chromosome-environment interactions
   have not previously been uncovered in L. saxatilis and are known in few
   other organisms. A combination of both sex-specific selection and
   divergent natural selection is required to explain these highly unusual
   patterns.},

Title = {Population-level variation in parasite resistance due to differences in
   immune initiation and rate of response},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {162-177},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Closely related populations often differ in resistance to a given
   parasite, as measured by infection success or failure. Yet, the
   immunological mechanisms of these evolved differences are rarely
   specified. Does resistance evolve via changes to the host's ability to
   recognize that an infection exists, actuate an effective immune
   response, or attenuate that response? We tested whether each of these
   phases of the host response contributed to threespine sticklebacks'
   recently evolved resistance to their tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus.
   Although marine stickleback and some susceptible lake fish permit
   fast-growing tapeworms, other lake populations are resistant and
   suppress tapeworm growth via a fibrosis response. We subjected
   lab-raised fish from three populations (susceptible marine
   ``ancestors,{''} a susceptible lake population, and a resistant lake
   population) to a novel immune challenge using an injection of (1) a
   saline control, (2) alum, a generalized pro-inflammatory adjuvant that
   causes fibrosis, (3) a tapeworm protein extract, or (4) a combination of
   alum and tapeworm protein. With enough time, all three populations
   generated a robust fibrosis response to the alum treatments. Yet, only
   the resistant population exhibited a fibrosis response to the tapeworm
   protein alone. Thus, these populations differed in their ability to
   respond to the tapeworm protein but shared an intact fibrosis pathway.
   The resistant population also initiated fibrosis faster in response to
   alum, and was able to attenuate fibrosis, unlike the susceptible
   populations' slow but longer lasting response to alum. As fibrosis has
   pathological side effects that reduce fecundity, the faster recovery by
   the resistant population may reflect an adaptation to mitigate the costs
   of immunity. Broadly, our results confirm that parasite detection and
   immune initiation, activation speed, and immune attenuation
   simultaneously contribute to the evolution of parasite resistance and
   adaptations to infection in natural populations.},

Title = {Impact of Salmonella genome rearrangement on gene expression},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {426-437},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In addition to nucleotide variation, many bacteria also undergo changes
   at a much larger scale via rearrangement of their genome structure (GS)
   around long repeat sequences. These rearrangements result in genome
   fragments shifting position and/or orientation in the genome without
   necessarily affecting the underlying nucleotide sequence. To date,
   scalable techniques have not been applied to GS identification, so it
   remains unclear how extensive this variation is and the extent of its
   impact upon gene expression. However, the emergence of multiplexed,
   long-read sequencing overcomes the scale problem, as reads of several
   thousand bases are routinely produced that can span long repeat
   sequences to identify the flanking chromosomal DNA, allowing GS
   identification. Genome rearrangements were generated in Salmonella
   enterica serovar Typhi through long-term culture at ambient temperature.
   Colonies with rearrangements were identified via long-range PCR and
   subjected to long-read nanopore sequencing to confirm genome variation.
   Four rearrangements were investigated for differential gene expression
   using transcriptomics. All isolates with changes in genome arrangement
   relative to the parent strain were accompanied by changes in gene
   expression. Rearrangements with similar fragment movements demonstrated
   similar changes in gene expression. The most extreme rearrangement
   caused a large imbalance between the origin and terminus of replication
   and was associated with differential gene expression as a factor of
   distance moved toward or away from the origin of replication. Genome
   structure variation may provide a mechanism through which bacteria can
   quickly adapt to new environments and warrants routine assessment
   alongside traditional nucleotide-level measures of variation.},

Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-188},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The mismatch between when individuals breed and when we think they
   should breed has been a long-standing problem in evolutionary ecology.
   Price et al. is a classic theory paper in this field and is mainly cited
   for its most obvious result: if individuals with high nutritional
   condition breed early, then the advantage of breeding early may be
   overestimated when information on nutritional condition is absent. Price
   at al.'s less obvious result is that individuals, on average, are
   expected to breed later than the optimum. Here, we provide an
   explanation of their non-intuitive result in terms of hard selection,
   and go on to show that neither of their results are expected to hold if
   the relationship between breeding date and nutrition is allowed to
   evolve. By introducing the assumption that the advantage of breeding
   early is greater for individuals in high nutritional condition, we show
   that their most cited result can be salvaged. However, individuals, on
   average, are expected to breed earlier than the optimum, not later. More
   generally, we also show that the hard selection mechanisms that underpin
   these results have major implications for the evolution of plasticity:
   when environmental heterogeneity becomes too great, plasticity is
   selected against, prohibiting the evolution of generalists.},

Title = {A need for standardized reporting of introgression: Insights from
   studies across eukaryotes},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {344-357},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the rise of affordable next-generation sequencing technology,
   introgression-or the exchange of genetic materials between taxa-has
   become widely perceived to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature.
   Although this claim is supported by several keystone studies, no
   thorough assessment of the frequency of introgression across eukaryotes
   in nature has been performed to date. In this manuscript, we aim to
   address this knowledge gap by examining patterns of introgression across
   eukaryotes. We collated a single statistic, Patterson's D, which can be
   used as a test for introgression across 123 studies to further assess
   how taxonomic group, divergence time, and sequencing technology
   influence reports of introgression. Overall, introgression has mostly
   been measured in plants and vertebrates, with less attention given to
   the rest of the Eukaryotes. We find that the most frequently used
   metrics to detect introgression are difficult to compare across studies
   and even more so across biological systems due to differences in study
   effort, reporting standards, and methodology. Nonetheless, our analyses
   reveal several intriguing patterns, including the observation that
   differences in sequencing technologies may bias values of Patterson's D
   and that introgression may differ throughout the course of the
   speciation process. Together, these results suggest the need for a
   unified approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities and
   highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed
   once this unified approach is met.},

Abstract = {Animals often adjust their behavior according to social context, but the
   capacity for such behavioral flexibility can vary among species. Here,
   we test for interspecific variation in behavioral flexibility by
   comparing burrowing behavior across three species of deer mice (genus
   Peromyscus) with divergent social systems, ranging from promiscuous
   (Peromyscus leucopus and Peromyscus maniculatus) to monogamous
   (Peromyscus polionotus). First, we compared the burrows built by
   individual mice to those built by pairs of mice in all three species.
   Although burrow length did not differ in P. leucopus or P. maniculatus,
   we found that P. polionotus pairs cooperatively constructed burrows that
   were nearly twice as long as those built by individuals and that
   opposite-sex pairs dug longer burrows than same-sex pairs. Second, to
   directly observe cooperative digging behavior in P. polionotus, we
   designed a burrowing assay in which we could video-record active digging
   in narrow, transparent enclosures. Using this novel assay, we found,
   unexpectedly, that neither males nor females spent more time digging
   with an opposite-sex partner. Rather, we demonstrate that opposite-sex
   pairs are more socially cohesive and thus more efficient digging
   partners than same-sex pairs. Together, our study demonstrates how
   social context can modulate innate behavior and offers insight into how
   differences in behavioral flexibility may evolve among closely related
   species.},

Title = {Limited sex differences in plastic responses suggest evolutionary
   conservatism of thermal reaction norms: A meta-analysis in insects},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {394-411},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Temperature has a profound effect on the growth and development of
   ectothermic animals. However, the extent to which ecologically driven
   selection pressures can adjust thermal plastic responses in growth
   schedules is not well understood. Comparing temperature-induced plastic
   responses between sexes provides a promising but underexploited approach
   to evaluating the evolvability of thermal reaction norms: males and
   females share largely the same genes and immature environments but
   typically experience different ecological selection pressures. We
   proceed from the idea that substantial sex differences in plastic
   responses could be interpreted as resulting from sex-specific
   life-history optimization, whereas similarity among the sexes should
   rather be seen as evidence of an essential role of physiological
   constraints. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of sex-specific
   thermal responses in insect development times, using data on 161 species
   with comprehensive phylogenetic and ecological coverage. As a reference
   for judging the magnitude of sex specificity in thermal plasticity, we
   compared the magnitude of sex differences in plastic responses to
   temperature with those in response to diet. We show that sex-specific
   responses of development times to temperature variation are broadly
   similar. We also found no strong evidence for sex specificity in thermal
   responses to depend on the magnitude or direction of sex differences in
   development time. Sex differences in temperature-induced plastic
   responses were systematically less pronounced than sex differences in
   responses induced by variations in larval diet. Our results point to the
   existence of substantial constraints on the evolvability of thermal
   reaction norms in insects as the most likely explanation. If confirmed,
   the low evolvability of thermal response is an essential aspect to
   consider in predicting evolutionary responses to climate warming.},

Title = {The evolution of thermal performance in native and invasive populations
   of Mimulus guttatus},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {136-148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The rise of globalization has spread organisms beyond their natural
   range, allowing further opportunity for species to adapt to novel
   environments and potentially become invaders. Yet, the role of thermal
   niche evolution in promoting the success of invasive species remains
   poorly understood. Here, we use thermal performance curves (TPCs) to
   test hypotheses about thermal adaptation during the invasion process.
   First, we tested the hypothesis that if species largely conserve their
   thermal niche in the introduced range, invasive populations may not
   evolve distinct TPCs relative to native populations, against the
   alternative hypothesis that thermal niche and therefore TPC evolution
   has occurred in the invasive range. Second, we tested the hypothesis
   that clines of TPC parameters are shallower or absent in the invasive
   range, against the alternative hypothesis that with sufficient time,
   standing genetic variation, and temperature-mediated selection, invasive
   populations would re-establish clines found in the native range in
   response to temperature gradients. To test these hypotheses, we built
   TPCs for 18 native (United States) and 13 invasive (United Kingdom)
   populations of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. We grew clones
   of multiple genotypes per population at six temperature regimes in
   growth chambers. We found that invasive populations have not evolved
   different thermal optima or performance breadths, providing evidence for
   evolutionary stasis of thermal performance between the native and
   invasive ranges after over 200 years post introduction. Thermal optimum
   increased with mean annual temperature in the native range, indicating
   some adaptive differentiation among native populations that was absent
   in the invasive range. Further, native and invasive populations did not
   exhibit adaptive clines in thermal performance breadth with latitude or
   temperature seasonality. These findings suggest that TPCs remained
   unaltered post invasion, and that invasion may proceed via broad thermal
   tolerance and establishment in already climatically suitable areas
   rather than rapid evolution upon introduction.},

Title = {Age-specific survivorship and fecundity shape genetic diversity in
   marine fishes},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-62},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Genetic diversity varies among species due to a range of
   eco-evolutionary processes that are not fully understood. The neutral
   theory predicts that the amount of variation in the genome sequence
   between different individuals of the same species should increase with
   its effective population size (Ne). In real populations, multiple
   factors that modulate the variance in reproductive success among
   individuals cause Ne to differ from the total number of individuals (N).
   Among these, age-specific mortality and fecundity rates are known to
   have a direct impact on the Ne/N ratio. However, the extent to which
   vital rates account for differences in genetic diversity among species
   remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by comparing
   genome-wide genetic diversity across 16 marine fish species with similar
   geographic distributions but contrasted lifespan and age-specific
   survivorship and fecundity curves. We sequenced the whole genome of 300
   individuals to high coverage and assessed their genome-wide
   heterozygosity with a reference-free approach. Genetic diversity varied
   from 0.2\% to 1.4\% among species, and showed a negative correlation
   with adult lifespan, with a large negative effect (slope=-0.089 per
   additional year of lifespan) that was further increased when brooding
   species providing intense parental care were removed from the dataset
   (slope=-0.129 per additional year of lifespan). Using published vital
   rates for each species, we showed that the Ne/N ratio resulting simply
   from life tables parameters can predict the observed differences in
   genetic diversity among species. Using simulations, we further found
   that the extent of reduction in Ne/N with increasing adult lifespan is
   particularly strong under Type III survivorship curves (high juvenile
   and low adult mortality) and increasing fecundity with age, a typical
   characteristic of marine fishes. Our study highlights the importance of
   vital rates as key determinants of species genetic diversity levels in
   nature.},

Abstract = {Acquiring a subterranean lifestyle entails a substantial shift for many
   aspects of terrestrial vertebrates' biology. Although this lifestyle is
   associated with multiple instances of convergent evolution, the relative
   success of some subterranean lineages largely remains unexplained. Here,
   we focus on the mammalian transitions to life underground, quantifying
   bone microanatomy through high-resolution X-ray tomography. The true
   moles stand out in this dataset. Examination of this family's bone
   histology reveals that the highly fossorial moles acquired a unique
   phenotype involving large amounts of compacted coarse cancellous bone.
   This phenotype exceeds the adaptive optimum seemingly shared by several
   other subterranean mammals and can be traced back to some of the first
   known members of the family. This remarkable microanatomy was acquired
   early in the history of the group and evolved faster than the gross
   morphology innovations of true moles' forelimb. This echoes the pattern
   described for other lifestyle transitions, such as the acquisition of
   bone mass specializations in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. Highly
   plastic traits-such as those pertaining to bone structure-are hence
   involved in the early stages of different types of lifestyle
   transitions.},

Abstract = {The pace of tree microevolution during Anthropocene warming is largely
   unknown. We used a retrospective approach to monitor genomic changes in
   oak trees since the Little Ice Age (LIA). Allelic frequency changes were
   assessed from whole-genome pooled sequences for four age-structured
   cohorts of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) dating back to 1680, in each of
   three different oak forests in France. The genetic covariances of
   allelic frequency changes increased between successive time periods,
   highlighting genome-wide effects of linked selection. We found imprints
   of parallel linked selection in the three forests during the late LIA,
   and a shift of selection during more recent time periods of the
   Anthropocene. The changes in allelic covariances within and between
   forests mirrored the documented changes in the occurrence of extreme
   events (droughts and frosts) over the last 300 years. The genomic
   regions with the highest covariances were enriched in genes involved in
   plant responses to pathogens and abiotic stresses (temperature and
   drought). These responses are consistent with the reported sequence of
   frost (or drought) and disease damage ultimately leading to the oak
   dieback after extreme events. They provide support for adaptive
   evolution of long-lived species during recent climatic changes. Although
   we acknowledge that other sources (e.g., gene flow, generation overlap)
   may have contributed to temporal covariances of allelic frequency
   changes, the consistent and correlated response across the three forests
   lends support to the existence of a systematic driving force such as
   natural selection.},

Title = {Interacting host modifier systems control Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic
   incompatibility in a haplodiploid mite},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-265},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia spread within host populations
   by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs when
   parasite-modified sperm fertilizes uninfected eggs and is typified by
   great variation in strength across biological systems. In haplodiploid
   hosts, CI has different phenotypic outcomes depending on whether the
   fertilized eggs die or develop into males. Genetic conflict theories
   predict the evolution of host modulation of CI, which in turn influences
   the stability of reproductive parasitism. However, despite the ubiquity
   of CI-inducing parasites in nature, there is scarce evidence for
   intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype. Here, we
   tested for intraspecific host modulation of Wolbachia-induced CI in
   haplodiploid Tetranychus urticae mites. Using a single CI-inducing
   Wolbachia variant and mitochondrion, a nuclear panel was created that
   consisted of infected and cured near-isogenic lines. We performed a
   highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross composed of
   incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier
   systems that cause striking variation in CI strength when carried by
   infected T. urticae males. We observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in
   our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of the
   CI phenotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the
   maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian
   inheritance. Both male and female modulation interacted with the
   genotype of the mating partner. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as
   an important target of selection for host modulation of CI strength and
   underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI
   phenotype. Our findings reveal that intraspecific host modulation of CI
   is underpinned by complex genetic architectures and confirm that the
   evolution of reproductive parasitism is contingent on host genetics.},

Title = {Conceptualizing the evolutionary quantitative genetics of phenological
   life-history events: Breeding time as a plastic threshold trait},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {220-233},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Successfully predicting adaptive phenotypic responses to environmental
   changes, and predicting resulting population outcomes, requires that
   additive genetic (co)variances underlying microevolutionary and plastic
   responses of key traits are adequately estimated on appropriate
   quantitative scales. Such estimation in turn requires that focal traits,
   and their underlying quantitative genetic architectures, are
   appropriately conceptualized. Here, we highlight that directly analyzing
   observed phenotypes as continuously distributed quantitative traits can
   potentially generate biased and misleading estimates of additive genetic
   variances and individual-by-environment and gene-by-environment
   interactions, and hence of forms of plasticity and genetic constraints,
   if in fact the underlying biology is best conceptualized as an
   environmentally sensitive threshold trait. We illustrate this scenario
   with particular reference to the key phenological trait of seasonal
   breeding date, which has become a focus for quantifying joint
   microevolutionary, plastic, and population responses to environmental
   change, but has also become a focus for highlighting that predicted
   adaptive outcomes are not always observed. Specifically, we use simple
   simulations to illustrate how potentially misleading inferences on
   magnitudes of additive genetic variance, and forms of environmental
   interactions, can arise by directly analyzing observed breeding dates if
   the transition to breeding in fact represents a threshold trait with
   latent-scale plasticity. We summarize how existing and new datasets
   could be (re)analyzed, potentially providing new insights into how
   critical microevolutionary and plastic phenological responses to
   environmental variation and change can arise and be constrained.},

Title = {Context dependence in the symbiosis between Dictyostelium discoideum and
   Paraburkholderia},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {245-254},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many organisms form symbiotic relationships with other species. These
   symbioses often exhibit context dependence, where the sign or magnitude
   of one partner's effect on the other will change in different
   environments. Context-dependent effects make it difficult to assign
   interactions to categories like mutualisms or antagonisms because they
   involve both benefits and costs depending on the environment. However,
   in some cases, accounting for context dependence can clarify an
   interaction so that it more easily fits a mutualism or antagonism. We
   investigated context dependence using the symbiosis between
   Dictyostelium discoideum and two symbiotic Paraburkholderia species. In
   this symbiosis, Paraburkholderia bacteria allow hosts to carry food
   bacteria to food-poor contexts, where hosts rarely survive without food,
   but reduce host fitness in the more hospitable food-rich contexts. The
   effect of food context on Paraburkholderia symbionts is unknown. We show
   that Paraburkholderia symbionts are also affected by this context,
   through facing reduced competition after being dispersed by hosts to
   food-poor contexts. We also identify a new way that symbionts affect
   hosts, where symbiont density reduces host fitness, but less so in
   food-poor contexts. Finally, we use simulations to show that infected
   hosts benefit in the long term across variable food contexts, especially
   in the harshest environments with little food. These results show that
   context dependence in symbiosis can have many consequences for hosts and
   symbionts, although in general for D. discoideum and Paraburkholderia,
   both are likely to benefit.},

Title = {Adaptive divergence and the evolution of hybrid trait mismatch in
   threespine stickleback},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Selection against mismatched traits in hybrids is the phenotypic
   analogue of intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities. Mismatch occurs when
   hybrids resemble one parent population for some phenotypic traits and
   the other parent population for other traits, and is caused by dominance
   in opposing directions or from segregation of alleles in recombinant
   hybrids. In this study, we used threespine stickleback fish
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) to test the theoretical prediction that
   trait mismatch in hybrids should increase with the magnitude of
   phenotypic divergence between parent populations. We measured
   morphological traits in parents and hybrids in crosses between a marine
   population representing the ancestral form and twelve freshwater
   populations that have diverged from this ancestral state to varying
   degrees according to their environments. We found that trait mismatch
   was greater in more divergent crosses for both F-1 and F-2 hybrids. In
   the F-1, the divergence-mismatch relationship was caused by traits
   having dominance in different directions, whereas it was caused by
   increasing segregating phenotypic variation in the F-2. Our results
   imply that extrinsic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate as phenotypic
   divergence proceeds.},

Title = {A reexamination of theoretical arguments that indirect selection on mate

Abstract = {Female preference for male ornaments or displays can evolve by indirect
   selection resulting from genetic benefits of mate choices, or by direct
   selection resulting from nongenetic benefits or selection on sensory
   systems occurring in other contexts. In an influential paper,
   Kirkpatrick and Barton used a good-genes model and evolutionary rates
   estimated from the fossil record to conclude that indirect selection on
   preference is likely to be weak compared to typical strengths of direct
   selection. More recent authors have extrapolated from Kirkpatrick and
   Barton's conclusions to suggest that the presence of preference-trait
   genetic correlations in equations for indirect but not direct selection
   gives a purely theoretical basis to the conclusion that the former is
   likely to be weaker than the latter. Here, I challenge these views, and
   argue that the relative importance of direct and indirect selection on
   preference is an empirical issue that defies simple generalizations.
   First, I show that Kirkpatrick and Barton based their conclusion on a
   questionable claim about typical rates of evolution due to direct
   selection. Second, I argue that claiming that direct selection on
   preference is stronger than indirect selection because only equations
   for the latter contain a genetic correlation mistakes the mathematical
   simplicity with which direct selection is usually represented for
   evidence regarding its magnitude. By comparing a simple equation for the
   selection response of preference caused by somatic ({''}direct{''})
   benefits to Kirkpatrick and Barton's result for the response to indirect
   selection, I show that indirect selection on preference is not
   inherently weaker than direct selection. I also point out an important
   but overlooked reason why selection on preference under the sensory bias
   hypothesis can be expected to be less effective in the long run than
   that from either somatic or genetic benefits of mate choices.},

Title = {Allometric conservatism in the evolution of bird beaks},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},

Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evolution can involve periods of rapid divergent adaptation and
   expansion in the range of diversity, but evolution can also be
   relatively conservative over certain timescales due to functional,
   genetic-developmental, and ecological constraints. One way in which
   evolution may be conservative is in terms of allometry, the scaling
   relationship between the traits of organisms and body size. Here, we
   investigate patterns of allometric conservatism in the evolution of bird
   beaks with beak size and body size data for a representative sample of
   over 5000 extant bird species within a phylogenetic framework. We
   identify clades in which the allometric relationship between beak size
   and body size has remained relatively conserved across species over
   millions to tens of millions of years. We find that allometric
   conservatism is nonetheless punctuated by occasional shifts in the
   slopes and intercepts of allometric relationships. A steady accumulation
   of such shifts through time has given rise to the tremendous diversity
   of beak size relative to body size across birds today. Our findings are
   consistent with the Simpsonian vision of macroevolution, with
   evolutionary conservatism being the rule but with occasional shifts to
   new adaptive zones.},

Title = {From genotype to phenotype: Genetic redundancy and the maintenance of an
   adaptive polymorphism in the context of high gene flow},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-202},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A central question in evolution is how several adaptive phenotypes are
   maintained within a species. Theory predicts that the genetic
   determination of a trait, and in particular the amounts of redundancy in
   the mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, mediates evolutionary outcomes
   of phenotypic selection. In Mediterranean wild thyme, numerous discrete
   chemical phenotypes (chemotypes) occur in close geographic proximity.
   Chemotypes are defined by the predominant monoterpene produced by
   individual plants in their essential oil. In this study, we analyze the
   ecological genetics of six chemotypes nested within two well-established
   chemical families (hereafter ecotypes). Ecotypes, and chemotypes within
   ecotypes, are spatially segregated, and their distributions track local
   differences in the abiotic environment. By combining population genomic,
   phenotypic, and environmental data from 700 individuals, we show how the
   genetics of ecotype determination mediates this evolutionary response.
   Variation in three terpene-synthase loci explains variation in ecotype
   identity, with one single locus accounting for as much as 78\% of this
   variation. Phenotypic selection combined with low segregating genotypic
   redundancy of ecotypes leaves a clear footprint at the genomic level:
   alleles associated with ecotype identity track environmental variation
   despite extensive gene flow. Different chemotypes within each ecotype
   differentially track environmental variation. Their identity is
   determined by multiple loci and displays a wider range of genotypic
   redundancy that dilutes phenotypic selection on their characteristic
   alleles. Our study thus provides a novel illustration of how genetic
   redundancy of a phenotype modulates the ability of selection to maintain
   adaptive differentiation. Identifying the precise genetics of the
   chemical polymorphism in thyme is the next crucial step for our
   understanding of the origin and maintenance of a polymorphism that is
   present in many aromatic plants.},

Title = {Plant-associate interactions and diversification across trophic levels},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {375-389},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Interactions between species are widely understood to have promoted the
   diversification of life on Earth, but how interactions spur the
   formation of new species remains unclear. Interacting species often
   become locally adapted to each other, but they may also be subject to
   shared dispersal limitations and environmental conditions. Moreover,
   theory predicts that different kinds of interactions have different
   effects on diversification. To better understand how species
   interactions promote diversification, we compiled population genetic
   studies of host plants and intimately associated herbivores, parasites,
   and mutualists. We used Bayesian multiple regressions and the BEDASSLE
   modeling framework to test whether host and associate population
   structures were correlated over and above the potentially confounding
   effects of geography and shared environmental variation. We found that
   associates' population structure often paralleled their hosts'
   population structure, and that this effect is robust to accounting for
   geographic distance and climate. Associate genetic structure was
   significantly explained by plant genetic structure somewhat more often
   in antagonistic interactions than in mutualistic ones. This aligns with
   a key prediction of coevolutionary theory that antagonistic interactions
   promote diversity through local adaptation of antagonists to hosts,
   while mutualistic interactions more often promote diversity via the
   effect of hosts' geographic distribution on mutualists' dispersal.},

Title = {Strong selective environments determine evolutionary outcome in
   time-dependent fitness seascapes},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {266-279},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impact of fitness landscape features on evolutionary outcomes has
   attracted considerable interest in recent decades. However, evolution
   often occurs under time-dependent selection in so-called fitness
   seascapes where the landscape is under flux. Fitness seascapes are an
   inherent feature of natural environments, where the landscape changes
   owing both to the intrinsic fitness consequences of previous adaptations
   and extrinsic changes in selected traits caused by new environments. The
   complexity of such seascapes may curb the predictability of evolution.
   However, empirical efforts to test this question using a comprehensive
   set of regimes are lacking. Here, we employed an in vitro microbial
   model system to investigate differences in evolutionary outcomes between
   time-invariant and time-dependent environments, including all possible
   temporal permutations, with three subinhibitory antimicrobials and a
   viral parasite (phage) as selective agents. Expectedly, time-invariant
   environments caused stronger directional selection for resistances
   compared to time-dependent environments. Intriguingly, however,
   multidrug resistance outcomes in both cases were largely driven by two
   strong selective agents (rifampicin and phage) out of four agents in
   total. These agents either caused cross-resistance or obscured the
   phenotypic effect of other resistance mutations, modulating the
   evolutionary outcome overall in time-invariant environments and as a
   function of exposure epoch in time-dependent environments. This suggests
   that identifying strong selective agents and their pleiotropic effects
   is critical for predicting evolution in fitness seascapes, with
   ramifications for evolutionarily informed strategies to mitigate drug
   resistance evolution.},

Title = {The ecology and quantitative genetics of seed and seedling traits in
   upland and lowland ecotypes of a perennial grass},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {460-473},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plants have evolved diverse reproductive allocation strategies and seed
   traits to aid in dispersal, persistence in the seed bank, and
   establishment. In particular, seed size, dormancy, and early seedling
   vigor are thought to be key functional traits with important recruitment
   and fitness consequences across abiotic stress gradients. Selection for
   favored seed-trait combinations, or against maladaptive combinations, is
   likely an important driver shaping recruitment strategies. Here, we test
   for seed-trait plasticity and patterns of recruitment using two
   genotypes representative of contrasting upland and lowland ecotypes of
   Panicum hallii with field experiments in native versus foreign habitats.
   Furthermore, we test whether seed traits have been under directional
   selection in P. hallii using the v-test based on trait variance in a
   genetic cross. Finally, we evaluate the genetic architecture of ecotypic
   divergence for these traits with quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.
   Field experiments reveal little plasticity but support a hypothesis of
   adaptation divergence among ecotypes based on recruitment. Patterns of
   segregation within recombinant hybrids provides strong support for
   directional selection driving ecotypic divergence in seed traits.
   Genetic mapping revealed a polygenic architecture with evidence of
   genetic correlation between seed mass, dormancy, and seedling vigor. Our
   results suggest that the evolution of these traits may involve
   constraints that affect the direction of adaptive divergence. For
   example, seed size and germination percentage shared two colocalized QTL
   with antagonistic additive effects. This supports the hypothesis of a
   functional genetic relationship between these traits, resulting in
   either large seed/strong dormancy or small seed/weak dormancy trait
   combinations. Overall, our study provides insights into the factors
   facilitating and potentially constraining ecotypic differentiation in
   seed traits.},

Abstract = {The absence of microbial exposure early in life leaves individuals
   vulnerable to immune overreaction later in life, manifesting as
   immunopathology, autoimmunity, or allergies. A key factor is thought to
   be a ``critical window{''} during which the host's immune system can
   ``learn{''} tolerance, and beyond which learning is no longer possible.
   Animal models indicate that many mechanisms have evolved to enable
   critical windows, and that their time limits are distinct and
   consistent. Such a variety of mechanisms, and precision in their
   manifestation suggest the outcome of strong evolutionary selection. To
   strengthen our understanding of critical windows, we explore their
   underlying evolutionary ecology using models encompassing demographic
   and epidemiological transitions, identifying the length of the critical
   window that would maximize fitness in different environments. We
   characterize how direct effects of microbes on host mortality, but also
   indirect effects via microbial ecology, will drive the optimal length of
   the critical window. We find that indirect effects such as magnitude of
   transmission, duration of infection, rates of reinfection, vertical
   transmission, host demography, and seasonality in transmission all have
   the effect of redistributing the timing and/or likelihood of encounters
   with microbial taxa across age, and thus increasing or decreasing the
   optimal length of the critical window. Declining microbial population
   abundance and diversity are predicted to result in increases in immune
   dysfunction later in life. We also make predictions for the length of
   the critical window across different taxa and environments. Overall, our
   modeling efforts demonstrate how critical windows will be impacted over
   evolution as a function of both host-microbiome/pathogen interactions
   and dispersal, raising central questions about potential mismatches
   between these evolved systems and the current loss of microbial
   diversity and/or increases in infectious disease.},

Title = {How much does the unguarded X contribute to sex differences in life
   span?},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {319-329},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Females and males often have markedly different mortality rates and life
   spans, but it is unclear why these forms of sexual dimorphism evolve.
   The unguarded X hypothesis contends that dimorphic life spans arise from
   sex differences in X or Z chromosome copy number (i.e., one copy in the
   ``heterogametic{''} sex; two copies in the ``homogametic{''} sex), which
   leads to a disproportionate expression of deleterious mutations by the
   heterogametic sex (e.g., mammalian males; avian females). Although data
   on adult sex ratios and sex-specific longevity are consistent with
   predictions of the unguarded X hypothesis, direct experimental evidence
   remains scant, and alternative explanations are difficult to rule out.
   Using a simple population genetic model, we show that the unguarded X
   effect on sex differential mortality is a function of several reasonably
   well-studied evolutionary parameters, including the proportion of the
   genome that is sex linked, the genomic deleterious mutation rate, the
   mean dominance of deleterious mutations, the relative rates of mutation
   and strengths of selection in each sex, and the average effect of
   mutations on survival and longevity relative to their effects on
   fitness. We review published estimates of these parameters, parameterize
   our model with them, and show that unguarded X effects are too small to
   explain observed sex differences in life span across species. For
   example, sex differences in mean life span are known to often exceed
   20\% (e.g., in mammals), whereas our parameterized models predict
   unguarded X effects of a few percent (e.g., 1-3\% in Drosophila and
   mammals). Indeed, these predicted unguarded X effects fall below
   statistical thresholds of detectability in most experiments, potentially
   explaining why direct tests of the hypothesis have generated little
   support for it. Our results suggest that evolution of sexually dimorphic
   life spans is predominantly attributable to other mechanisms,
   potentially including ``toxic Y{''} effects and sexual dimorphism for
   optimal investment in survival versus reproduction.},

Title = {Sex-dependent effects of parental age on offspring fitness in a
   cooperatively breeding bird},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {438-449},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parental age can have considerable effects on offspring phenotypes and
   health. However, intergenerational effects may also have longer term
   effects on offspring fitness. Few studies have investigated parental age
   effects on offspring fitness in natural populations while also testing
   for sex- and environment-specific effects. Further, longitudinal
   parental age effects may be masked by population-level processes such as
   the selective disappearance of poor-quality individuals. Here, we used
   multigenerational data collected on individually marked Seychelles
   warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to investigate the impact of
   maternal and paternal age on offspring life span and lifetime
   reproductive success. We found negative effects of maternal age on
   female offspring life span and lifetime reproductive success, which were
   driven by within-mother effects. There was no difference in annual
   reproductive output of females born to older versus younger mothers,
   suggesting that the differences in offspring lifetime reproductive
   success were driven by effects on offspring life span. In contrast,
   there was no association between paternal age and female offspring life
   span or either maternal or paternal age and male offspring life span.
   Lifetime reproductive success, but not annual reproductive success, of
   male offspring increased with maternal age, but this was driven by
   between-mother effects. No paternal age effects were found on female
   offspring lifetime reproductive success but there was a positive
   between-father effect on male offspring lifetime reproductive success.
   We did not find strong evidence for environment-dependent parental age
   effects. Our study provides evidence for parental age effects on the
   lifetime fitness of offspring and shows that such effects can be sex
   dependent. These results add to the growing literature indicating the
   importance of intergenerational effects on long-term offspring
   performance and highlight that these effects can be an important driver
   of variation in longevity and fitness in the wild.},

Title = {The genomic signature of wild-to-crop introgression during the
   domestication of scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.)},
Journal = {EVOLUTION LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) is one of the five
   domesticated Phaseolus species. It is cultivated in small-scale
   agriculture in the highlands of Mesoamerica for its dry seeds and
   immature pods, and unlike the other domesticated beans, P. coccineus is
   an open-pollinated legume. Contrasting with its close relative, the
   common bean, few studies focusing on its domestication history have been
   conducted. Demographic bottlenecks associated with domestication might
   reduce genetic diversity and facilitate the accumulation of deleterious
   mutations. Conversely, introgression from wild relatives could be a
   source of variation. Using Genotyping by Sequencing data (79,286
   single-nucleotide variants) from 237 cultivated and wild samples, we
   evaluated the demographic history of traditional varieties from
   different regions of Mexico and looked for evidence of introgression
   between sympatric wild and cultivated populations. Traditional varieties
   have high levels of diversity, even though there is evidence of a severe
   initial genetic bottleneck followed by a population expansion.
   Introgression from wild to domesticated populations was detected, which
   might contribute to the recovery of the genetic variation. Introgression
   has occurred at different times: constantly in the center of Mexico;
   recently in the North West; and anciently in the South. Several factors
   are acting together to increase and maintain genetic diversity in P.
   coccineus cultivars, such as demographic expansion and introgression.
   Wild relatives represent a valuable genetic resource and have played a
   key role in scarlet runner bean evolution via introgression into
   traditional varieties.},

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphisms are widespread in animals and plants, for
   morphological as well as physiological traits. Understanding the genetic
   basis of sexual dimorphism and its evolution is crucial for
   understanding biological differences between the sexes. Genetic variants
   with sex-antagonistic effects on fitness are expected to segregate in
   populations at the early phases of sexual dimorphism emergence.
   Detecting such variants is notoriously difficult, and the few
   genome-scan methods employed so far have limited power and little
   specificity. Here, we propose a new framework to detect a signature of
   sexually antagonistic (SA) selection. We rely on trio datasets where
   sex-biased transmission distortions can be directly tracked from parents
   to offspring, and identify signals of SA transmission distortions in
   genomic regions. We report the genomic location of six candidate regions
   detected in human populations as potentially under sexually antagonist
   selection. We find an enrichment of genes associated with embryonic
   development within these regions. Last, we highlight two candidate
   regions for SA selection in humans.},

Title = {Modeling of fire spread in sagebrush steppe using FARSITE: an approach
   to improving input data and simulation accuracy},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Background Model simulations of wildfire spread and assessments of their
   accuracy are needed for understanding and managing altered fire regimes
   in semiarid regions. The accuracy of wildfire spread simulations can be
   evaluated from post hoc comparisons of simulated and actual wildfire
   perimeters, but this requires information on pre-fire vegetation fuels
   that is typically not available. We assessed the accuracy of the
   Fire-Area Simulator (FARSITE) model parameterized with maps of fire
   behavior fuel models (FBFMs) obtained from the widely used LANDFIRE, as
   well as alternative means which utilized the classification of Rangeland
   Analysis Platform (RAP) satellite-derived vegetation cover maps to
   create FBFM maps. We focused on the 2015 Soda wildfire, which burned
   113,000 ha of sagebrush steppe in the western USA, and then assessed the
   transferability of our RAP-to-FBFM selection process, which produced the
   most accurate reconstruction of the Soda wildfire, on the nearby 2016
   Cherry Road wildfire. Results Parameterizing FARSITE with maps of FBFMs
   from LANDFIRE resulted in low levels of agreement between simulated and
   observed area burned, with maximum Sorensen's coefficient (SC) and
   Cohen's kappa (K) values of 0.38 and 0.36, respectively. In contrast,
   maps of FBFMs derived from unsupervised classification of RAP vegetation
   cover maps led to much greater simulated-to-observed burned area
   agreement (SC = 0.70, K = 0.68). The FBFM map that generated the
   greatest simulated-to-observed burned area agreement for the Soda
   wildfire was then used to crosswalk FBFMs to another nearby wildfire
   (2016 Cherry Road), and this FBFM selection led to high FARSITE
   simulated-to-observed burned area agreement (SC = 0.80, K = 0.79).
   Conclusions Using RAP to inform pre-fire FBFM selection increased the
   accuracy of FARSITE simulations compared to parameterization with the
   standard LANDFIRE FBFM maps, in sagebrush steppe. Additionally, the
   crosswalk method appeared to have regional generalizability. Flanking
   and backfires were the primary source of disagreements between simulated
   and observed fire spread in FARSITE, which are sources of error that may
   require modeling of lateral heterogeneity in fuels and fire processes at
   finer scales than used here.},

Title = {A systematic review of empirical evidence for landscape-level fuel
   treatment effectiveness},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background Adverse effects of wildfires can be mitigated within fuel
   treatments, but empirical evidence of their effectiveness across large
   areas is needed to guide design and implementation at the landscape
   level. We conducted a systematic literature review of empirically based
   studies that tested the influence of landscape-level fuel treatments on
   subsequent wildfires in North America over the past 30 years to evaluate
   how treatment type and configuration affect subsequent wildfire behavior
   or enable more effective wildfire response. Results We identified 2240
   papers, but only 26 met our inclusion criteria. Wildfire sizes ranged
   from 96 to 186,874 ha and total treated area ranged from 8 to 53,423 ha.
   Total treated area within a wildfire perimeter was highly correlated
   with wildfire area (r = 0.89, n = 93 wildfires), and the average
   proportion of wildfire area that was treated was 22\%. All studies
   demonstrated wildfire behavior changes within treatment boundaries
   (i.e., site-level effect), but only 12 studies provided evidence that
   treatments influence wildfires outside of treatment boundaries (i.e.,
   landscape-level effect). These 12 landscape-level papers showed effects
   on fire severity, fire progression, and fire extent, but were dissimilar
   in design and analysis approaches, constraining the ability to
   generalize about the type and configuration of fuel treatments to
   maximize effectiveness. Conclusions It is clear that the state of
   knowledge based on empirical evidence is at its infancy. This is likely
   because of the vast challenges associated with designing and
   implementing sampling designs that account for combinations of spatial
   and temporal configurations prior to wildfire occurrence. We also
   suspect part of the reason empirical evidence is lacking is because the
   distinction between site-level and landscape-level effects is not well
   recognized in the literature. All papers used the term landscape, but
   rarely defined the landscape, and some specified identifying
   landscape-level effects that were truly site-level effects. Future
   research needs to develop innovative ways to interpret the role of fuel
   treatments at the landscape level to provide insight on strategic
   designs and approaches to maximize fuel treatment effectiveness.},

Title = {Trends in western USA fire fuels using historical data and modeling},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Background Recent increases in wildfire activity in the Western USA are
   commonly attributed to a confluence of factors including climate change,
   human activity, and the accumulation of fuels due to fire suppression.
   However, a shortage of long-term forestry measurements makes it
   difficult to quantify regional changes in fuel loads over the past
   century. A better understanding of fuel accumulation is vital for
   managing forests to increase wildfire resistance and resilience.
   Numerical models provide one means of estimating changes in fuel loads,
   but validating these models over long timescales and large geographic
   extents is made difficult by the scarcity of sufficient data. One such
   model, MC2, provides estimates of multiple types of fuel loads and
   simulates fire activity according to fuel and climate conditions. We
   used the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) observed data to
   validate MC2 estimates of fuel load change over time where possible.
   Results We found that the MC2 model's accuracy varied geographically,
   but at a regional scale the distributions of changes in fuel loads were
   similar to distributions of FIADB values. While FIADB data provided
   consistent measurement types across a wide geographic area, usable data
   only spanned approximately 30 years. We therefore supplemented this
   quantitative validation with a qualitative comparison to data that
   covered less area, but for much longer time spans: long-term forestry
   plots outside of the FIA plot network and repeat photography studies.
   Both model results and long-term studies show increases in fuel loads
   over the past century across much of the western USA, with exceptions in
   the Pacific Northwest and other areas. Model results also suggest that
   not all of the increases are due to fire suppression. Conclusions This
   model validation and aggregation of information from long-term studies
   not only demonstrate that there have been extensive fuel increases in
   the western USA but also provide insights into the level of uncertainty
   regarding fire suppression's impact on fuel loads. A fuller
   understanding of changing fuel loads and their impact on fire behavior
   will require an increase in the number of long-term observational
   forestry studies.},

Title = {Vegetation fires along the Czech rail network},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Background In the past, fires around railways were often associated with
   steam locomotives. Although steam locomotives have disappeared from
   everyday rail traffic, fires still occur. A vegetation fire near Bzenec
   (Czech Republic) on 21 June 2018 affected, for example, 124,110 m(2) of
   forest and grassland. The investigation revealed that the fire was
   caused by a spark from a passing train. In this study, we analyzed
   vegetation fires that occurred near Czech railway lines between 2011 and
   2019 to investigate their temporal pattern and relation to weather
   conditions or to identify the most hazardous locations. Results Fires
   were concentrated mainly between March and August in the afternoon. They
   are also more likely to occur during periods of high air temperature,
   low rainfall, low relative air humidity, and low wind speed. Using the
   KDE+ method, we identified 186 hotspots, which contained 510 vegetation
   fires and represented only 0.3\% of the length of the entire Czech rail
   network. Spatial analysis revealed that there are more than 4 times
   higher odds that a vegetation fire occurs near an electrified railway
   line than near a non-electrified line or that additional 10 freight
   trains per 24 h increases the odds by 5\%. Conclusions As the results
   show, vegetation fires near railway lines are still relatively common
   phenomenon, mainly due to favorable weather conditions. Grassy areas
   with dry or dead vegetation are particularly at risk. These areas can be
   ignited, for example, by sparks from the brakes of railway vehicles. Due
   to global warming, vegetation fires can be expected to occur more
   frequently in the future. The identified hotspots can thus be used to
   reduce the risk of fires, for example by managing the surrounding
   vegetation.},

Title = {Vegetation's influence on fire behavior goes beyond just being fuel},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Background The structure and function of fire-prone ecosystems are
   influenced by many interacting processes that develop over varying time
   scales. Fire creates both instantaneous and long-term changes in
   vegetation (defined as live, dead, and decomposing plant material)
   through combustion, heat transfer to living tissues, and subsequent
   patterns of recovery. While fuel available for combustion may be
   relative to the amount of vegetation, it is equally instructive to
   evaluate how the physical structure and other characteristics of
   vegetation influence fire dynamics, and how these interactions change
   between fire events. This paper presents a conceptual framework for how
   vegetation not only embodies the legacy of previous fires but creates
   the physical environment that drives fire behavior beyond its combustion
   as a fuel source. Results While many environmental factors affect both
   the post-fire vegetation trajectory and fire dynamics themselves, we
   present a conceptual framework describing how vegetation's structural
   characteristics control the local microclimate and fluid dynamics of
   fire-induced flows, and how that is influenced by ecosystem and
   atmospheric processes. Shifting our focus from fuels to vegetation
   allows us to integrate spatial and temporal feedbacks between fire,
   vegetation, soil, and the atmosphere across scales. This approach
   synthesizes the combustion and flammability science, the physical
   influence on fire behavior, and the ecosystem dynamics and processes
   that occur between fires and within a fire regime. Conclusions We
   conclude that fire behavior, including its prediction and ecological
   effects, should be broadened to include the dynamic processes that
   interact with vegetation, beyond its role as fuel. Our conceptual
   framework illustrates the crucial feedbacks across scales that link the
   finer details of vegetation and fire behavior processes that occur
   within a fire and have additive effects that feedback into the coarser
   scale processes and functions within an ecosystem. Shifting the fuels
   paradigm to integrate the combustion, physical, and ecological roles of
   vegetation as complex drivers of fire behavior and outcomes will broaden
   discovery within wildland fire science and ecology.},

   favorable environmental conditions for germination, survival, and
   growth. We investigated the spatiotemporal limitations to post-fire
   seedling establishment and height growth in dry to moist mixed conifer
   forests with and without post-fire forest management treatments (salvage
   logging, grass seeding) in areas burned from low to high severity. In
   2011, we measured post-fire seedling establishment year, juvenile
   density (seedlings and saplings), and height growth (annual and total)
   in 50 plots with six conifer species in the School Fire (2005), Blue
   Mountains, WA, USA. In 2021, we remeasured the plots for post-fire
   juvenile density and height growth. Results: Post-fire juvenile tree
   densities appeared sufficient for self-replacement of forest (> 60 stems
   ha(-1)) in 96\% of plots in 2021 (median 3130 stems ha(-1)), but
   densities were highly variable (range 33-100,501 stems ha(-1)). Annual
   seedling establishment was positively correlated with cooler, wetter
   climate conditions during the summer of germination (July-September) and
   the growing season of the subsequent year (April-September) for multiple
   tree species. We found lower juvenile densities at greater distances to
   seed sources and with higher grass cover, while salvage logging had no
   effect. Annual height growth was shorter on warmer, drier topographic
   positions for three species, whereas annual height growth was associated
   with climate variability for one species. Shifts in height class
   structure from 2011 to 2021 were, in part, explained by differences
   among species in annual height growth. Conclusions: Abundant and
   widespread tree seedling establishment for multiple conifer species
   after fire was strong evidence that most burned sites in the present
   study are currently on a trajectory to return to forest. However,
   post-fire establishment may be constrained to brief periods of cooler,
   wetter climate conditions following future fires. Long-term monitoring
   of post-fire recovery dynamics is needed to inform management activities
   designed to adapt forests to climate change and future disturbances,
   which will collectively shape future forest structure and composition.},

Abstract = {Background Wildfires are increasing in size and severity in forests of
   the western USA, driven by climate change and land management practices
   during the 20th century. Altered fire regimes have resulted in a greater
   need for knowledge on best practices for managing burned landscapes,
   especially in instances where a return to a previous forested ecosystem
   is desired. We examined a large wildfire from 2018 in southern Colorado
   to understand how fire severity and post-fire logging influenced stand
   structure, fuels, vegetation, and soil microsite conditions. Results Two
   years post-fire and 1 year post logging, there was no difference in
   understory vegetation response. Logged plots demonstrated lower daily
   average temperature and minimum soil moisture and higher fuel loading
   across most fuel size classes relative to unlogged plots, which also
   corresponded with a loss of dead standing wood and little to no canopy
   cover. Early post-fire conifer regeneration was low across all plots,
   but lower soil moisture and higher soil temperature negatively impacted
   the density of regeneration. Conclusions Successful tree regeneration is
   mediated by multiple factors from the microsite to landscape scale.
   Here, we demonstrate the importance of those microsite conditions such
   as soil moisture and temperature in predicting conifer tree
   establishment in the early post-fire period. Careful consideration of
   soil impacts and the associated changes to forest conditions should be
   taken when conducting post-fire logging to prevent detrimental effects
   on microsite conditions and forest recovery.},

Title = {Resilience of Mediterranean communities to fire depends on burn severity
   and type of ecosystem},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Background: Burn severity plays an important role in shaping vegetation
   recovery in Mediterranean ecosystems. In the present study, we aimed to
   evaluate the influence of burn severity on short-term vegetation
   resilience in different ecosystems. We selected the Cabrera wildfire
   (northwest Iberian Peninsula), which affected shrubland, heathland,
   broomland, and oak woodland ecosystems in 2017. Immediately after the
   fire, we established 249 field plots within the burned area, in which
   burn severity was quantified by the application of the Composite Burn
   Index, differentiating three burn severity categories: low, moderate,
   and high. Moreover, we fixed 136 plots in unburned areas at two
   different maturity stages: young (unburned for the last 10 years) and
   old (unburned for the last 20 years) vegetation. Two years after the
   wildfire, we evaluated the total percentage cover of vegetation in four
   vertical strata ranging from 0 to > 4 m, as well as the cover of each
   woody species and total herbaceous vegetation in the lowest stratum
   (0-0.5 m). Resilience of the 2017 burned areas was interpreted in terms
   of the difference in vegetation cover and species composition in
   relation to the two different maturity stages. Results: The results
   showed that the lowest stratum was the most resilient in the short term.
   In fact, all ecosystems presented high resilience of this stratum in
   low-severity areas. In shrublands and heathlands, this was mainly the
   consequence of the regeneration of herbaceous vegetation, as the
   dominant woody species did not fully recover in any of the burned
   situations (at least 21\% and 11\% less cover in shrubland and heathland
   burned plots compared to areas of young vegetation). Specifically, the
   resilience of this stratum was higher in broomlands and oak woodlands,
   mainly under moderate and high severities. In these ecosystems, woody
   dominant species recovered with respect to young vegetation at the
   0-0.5-m level. Despite this, burn severity had a negative impact on the
   short-term resilience of the uppermost strata in broomlands and oak
   woodlands (cover values close to 0\%). Conclusions: The effects of burn
   severity on short-term vegetation resilience differed among type of
   ecosystems and vertical strata, so these results may constitute a
   starting point for the evaluation of the influence of burn severity and
   vegetation composition and structure on ecosystem resilience.},

Title = {Potential operational delineations: new horizons for proactive,

Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Background The PODs (potential operational delineations) concept is an
   adaptive framework for cross-boundary and collaborative land and fire
   management planning. Use of PODs is increasingly recognized as a best
   practice, and PODs are seeing growing interest from federal, state,
   local, tribal, and non-governmental organizations. Early evidence
   suggests PODs provide utility for planning, communication, coordination,
   prioritization, incident response strategy development, and fuels
   mitigation and forest restoration. Recent legislative action codifies
   the importance of PODs by devoting substantial financial resources to
   their expansion. The intent of this paper is to explore new horizons
   that would help land and fire management organizations better address
   risks and capitalize on opportunities. Specifically, we focus on how
   PODs are a natural platform for improvement related to two core elements
   of risk management: how we leverage preparation and foresight to better
   prepare for the future; and how we learn from the past to better
   understand and improve performance and its alignment with strategy.
   Results We organize our exploration of new horizons around three key
   areas, suggesting that PODs can enable climate-smart forest and fire
   management and planning, inform more agile and adaptive allocation of
   suppression resources, and enable risk-informed performance measurement.
   These efforts can be synergistic and self-reinforcing, and we argue that
   expanded application of PODs at local levels could enhance the
   performance of the broader wildland fire system. We provide rationales
   for each problem area and offer growth opportunities with attendant
   explanations and illustrations. Conclusions With commitment and careful
   effort, PODs can provide rich opportunities for innovation in both
   backward-looking evaluative and forward-looking anticipatory frameworks.
   In addition to continued improvement of core PODs elements, attention
   must be paid to being more inclusive and participatory in PODs planning,
   to building sufficient capacity to expand PODs applications in
   meaningful boundary spanning ways, to ensure their continuity and
   relevance over time through maintenance and updating, and to deliver
   necessary information to responders to inform the effective management
   of wildfires. Lastly, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of PODs and
   related initiatives is essential to support organizational learning and
   continual improvement.},

Title = {Short-term benefits of prescribed fire to bird communities of dry
   forests},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background Low-severity prescribed fire is an important tool to manage
   fire-maintained forests across North America. In dry conifer forests of
   the western USA, prescribed fire is often used to reduce fuel loads in
   forests characterized historically by mixed- and low-severity fire
   regimes. Understanding the ecological effects of prescribed fire
   treatments is important for predicting the impacts of these management
   actions on wildlife communities. Few studies, however, have estimated
   small landbird responses to forest treatments at spatial scales relevant
   to their ecology or have examined potential differences in treatment
   effects applied within historically mixed- vs. low-severity fire
   regimes. Therefore, we evaluated prescribed fire treatment effects and
   relationships with burn severity for avian communities in dry conifer
   forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) located on seven
   national forests in the interior western USA. We surveyed birds for 1-4
   years and 1-3 years before and after prescribed fire treatments at
   mixed- and low-severity fire regime locations, respectively, following a
   before-after, control-impact study design - 8 paired control-treatment
   units in mixed-severity locations (16 total study units with 320 survey
   points) and 4 paired control-treatment units in low-severity locations
   (10 total study units with 278 survey points). Using a Bayesian
   hierarchical multi-species occupancy model, we investigated responses to
   prescribed fire treatments by a community of 95 bird species. Results We
   found statistically supported treatment effects and/or burn severity
   relationships for 33 species primarily in mixed-severity locations. The
   data supported positive treatment effects at mixed-severity locations
   for 9 species (American robin {[}Turdus migratorius], western bluebird
   {[}Sialia mexicana], hairy woodpecker {[}Dryobates villosus],
   black-backed woodpecker {[}Picoides arcticus], American three-toed
   woodpecker {[}Picoides dorsalis], house wren {[}Troglodytes aedon],
   dusky flycatcher {[}Empidonax oberholseri], western wood-pewee
   {[}Contopus sordidulus], gray flycatcher {[}Empidonax wrightii]), whose
   occupancy was more likely after treatment at the most severely burned
   units, and a negative effect for one species (ruby-crowned kinglet
   {[}Corthylio calendula]), whose occupancy was less likely after
   treatment at the most severely burned units. At low-severity locations,
   only two species exhibited treatment effects, both negative (red-faced
   warbler {[}Cardellina rubrifrons] and lark sparrow {[}Chondestes
   grammacus]). We also found supported occupancy relationships with burn
   severity post-treatment (i.e., regardless of species distribution before
   treatment) for 29 species, most of which were consistent with their life
   histories (e.g., patterns of positive relationships for cavity-nesting,
   bark insectivores and negative relationships for open-nesting, foliage
   insectivores). Stronger responses to prescribed fire treatments at
   mixed-severity locations were unexpected because prescribed fire
   applications were more similar to historical wildfires characteristic of
   low-severity fire regimes. Conclusions Bird populations in historically
   low-severity locations may be relatively unresponsive to prescribed fire
   because fire there is typically more frequent and regular. By
   comparison, fire events in forests characterized by a mixed-severity
   regime are less common, potentially eliciting more responses to an
   infrequent opportunity, even by species that are strongly associated
   with recently burned forests by wildfire.
   Our results suggest that fire management activities intended to reduce
   fuels and lower the risk of high-severity wildfire can also be effective
   in creating habitat for some fire specialists at least in the short
   term.},

   on breeding birds in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, USA},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Background Salvage logging of fire-killed trees in western US conifer
   forests has been shown to negatively affect many wildlife species, but
   there are few quantitative studies from the Sierra Nevada, CA. Salvage
   intensity (i.e., the proportion of fire-killed trees removed during
   logging activities) has also rarely been measured; instead, most studies
   track the presence/absence of salvage activities. We explored the
   effects of post-fire salvage on the breeding bird community following
   the 2012 Chips and 2013 Rim fires using a before-after control-impact
   sample design, and modeled species responses to salvage including a test
   of whether species responded to salvage intensity or the presence of
   salvage activities as a whole. Results Salvage operations removed an
   average of 71\% of the snag basal area in the Chips Fire and 64\% in the
   Rim Fire within 50 m of our salvaged survey locations. Bird species
   responses to salvage in both fires were largely non-significant or
   negative (Chips: 11 negative, 4 positive, 19 non-significant; Rim: 13
   negative, 4 positive, 20 non-significant). Statistical support for the
   salvage intensity vs. salvage activity models was split evenly among all
   species. Positive salvage responders in both fires included species
   adapted to open habitats and seed consumers, while a wide variety of
   species, including woodpeckers, species associated with open and dense
   mature forest, and some shrub nesters, responded negatively to salvage.
   We also evaluated five salvage prescription scenarios based on snag
   basal area, salvage intensity, and area treated to determine whether any
   combination could minimize the negative effects on the salvage-sensitive
   species yet retain the same salvage yield. The scenarios with the
   smallest area targeted with high-intensity salvage saw the smallest
   declines in abundance and diversity, but nearly all scenarios reduced
   both measures. Conclusions No combinations of salvage intensity and
   distribution from among the scenarios we explored were able to fully
   mitigate the negative effect on the bird community; however, the
   magnitude of declines in abundance and diversity was smaller than
   expected, and the majority of the species analyzed had a non-significant
   response. We recommend targeting salvage activities in the Sierra Nevada
   to those locations where snags pose a safety issue or where
   reforestation is most needed to conserve this fire-adapted bird
   community.},

Title = {Fire history and vegetation data reveal ecological benefits of recent
   mixed-severity fires in the Cumberland Mountains, West Virginia, USA},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Background Without periodic fire, fire-adapted plant communities across
   the Central Hardwood Forest Region (CHF) in the USA have undergone
   significant changes in forest structure and species composition, most
   notably a decrease in oak regeneration and herbaceous diversity and an
   increase in shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive tree species. In this study,
   we conducted a comparative analysis of two mixed pine-oak
   (Pinus-Quercus) forests with different land management histories in the
   Cumberland Mountains of southern West Virginia where fire ecology and
   fire effects are understudied. We reconstructed the fire history of both
   sites from fire-scarred shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) and pitch
   pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees to describe variation in the fire
   regimes over time. We also made plant community measurements that
   spatially coincided with fire-scarred pines to assess present-day plant
   community structure in relation to recent fire history. Results Before
   1970, fires at Hite Fork and Wall Fork occurred frequently and almost
   exclusively in the dormant season, every 7-8 years on average. The fire
   regimes diverged in the Post-Industrial era (1970-2020), during which
   there was a single fire at Wall Fork, while six major fires, scarring
   more than 40\% of sampled trees, occurred between 1985 and 2017 at Hite
   Fork. Four of these dormant-season fires correspond to late fall
   incendiary fires in the observational record. These differences in
   recent fire history had large effects on plant community structure.
   Recent mixed-severity fires at Hite Fork likely caused mortality of
   pole-sized trees and opened the canopy, creating conditions favorable
   for pine recruitment and resulted in significantly higher species
   richness in the herbaceous layer compared to Wall Fork, which exhibited
   the effects of mesophication. Conclusions Our results suggest that
   frequent mixed-severity fire in pine-oak forests of the Cumberland
   Mountains can meet management objectives by reducing mesophytic tree
   abundance, increasing herbaceous diversity and pine recruitment, and
   generally promoting forest heterogeneity.},

Title = {Prescribed fire in longleaf pine ecosystems: fire managers' perspectives
   on priorities, constraints, and future prospects},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Background Projected trajectories of climate and land use change over
   the remainder of the twenty-first century may result in conditions and
   situations that require flexible approaches to conservation planning and
   practices. For example, prescribed burning is a widely used management
   tool for promoting longer-term resilience and sustainability in longleaf
   pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States, but regional
   stressors such as climatic warming, changing fire conditions, and an
   expanding wildland-urban interface may challenge its application. To
   facilitate the development of fire management strategies that account
   for such changes, we surveyed nearly 300 fire managers to elicit
   information on the criteria used for prioritizing burn sites, current
   burning practices and constraints, and expectations for changes in
   burning opportunities, including those pertaining to climate change and
   urban growth. Results Respondents noted that their most common criteria
   for selecting longleaf pine stands for burning were fire history,
   ecosystem health, and fuel reduction, with the presence of threatened
   and endangered species also given priority by public land managers. Many
   respondents (38\%) cited recent burn frequencies that fall short of
   historic burn intervals. Barriers to burning included legal,
   institutional, and managerial constraints, such as proximity to human
   developments, public concerns, and risk aversion, as well as
   environmental and resource constraints, including weather, air quality
   restrictions, and lack of personnel, equipment, or funding. Roughly half
   of all respondents expect that opportunities to burn will be reduced
   over the next 30 years, particularly during the growing season. Fire
   manager perceptions of factors that will limit prescribed burning in the
   future include a similar suite of constraints, many of which will be
   affected by projected regional changes in land use and climate.
   Conclusions On an organizational level, burn window availability and
   resource limitations constrain prescribed burning practices. More
   broadly, policy and legal frameworks coupled with trends in urbanization
   and climate change are expected to interact with operational constraints
   to challenge managers' abilities to implement landscape-scale burning
   strategies and achieve restoration goals. Additional research and
   engagement with fire managers are needed to investigate opportunities
   for introducing policy flexibility, leveraging shared management
   interests, and developing creative solutions to expand burning
   opportunities.},

Title = {Contradictions and continuities: a historical context to Euro-American
   settlement era fires of the Lake States, USA},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Background The Lake States experienced unprecedented land use changes
   during Euro-American settlement including large, destructive fires.
   Forest changes were radical in this region and largely attributed to
   anomalous settlement era fires in slash (cumulation of tops and
   branches) following cutover logging. In this study, I place settlement
   era fires in a historical context by examining fire scar data in
   comparison to historical accounts and investigate
   fire-vegetation-climate relationships within a 400-year context. Results
   Settlement era fires (1851-1947) were less frequent than pre-settlement
   fires (1548-1850) with little evidence that slash impacted fire
   frequency or occurrence at site or ecoregion scales. Only one out of 25
   sites had more frequent settlement era fires, and that site was a pine
   forest that had never been harvested. Settlement era fires were similar
   across disparate ecoregions and forest types including areas with very
   different land use history. Settlement fires tended to burn during
   significantly dry periods, the same conditions driving large fires for
   the past 400 years. The burned area in the October 8, 1871, Peshtigo
   Fire was comprised of mesic forests where fuels were always abundant and
   high-severity fires would be expected under the drought conditions in
   1871. Furthermore, slash would not have been a major contributor to fire
   behavior or effects in the Peshtigo Fire when logging was still limited
   to relatively accessible pine forests. Conclusions Historical written
   accounts of fires and settlement era survey records provide a reference
   point for landscape changes but lack temporal depth to understand forest
   dynamics. Tree-ring analyses provide a longer (ca. 400 year) context and
   more mechanistic understanding of landscape dynamics. While settlement
   land use changes of Lake States forests were pervasive, fires were not
   the ultimate degrading factor, but rather likely one of the few natural
   processes still at work.},

Title = {Comparing risk-based fuel treatment prioritization with alternative
   strategies for enhancing protection and resource management objectives},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Background Advances in fire modeling help quantify and map various
   components and characterizations of wildfire risk and furthermore help
   evaluate the ability of fuel treatments to mitigate risk. However, a
   need remains for guidance in designing landscape-scale fuel treatments
   with protection objectives, resource management objectives, and wildfire
   response in mind. It is also important to consider how human factors
   related to risk tolerance may affect opportunities to manage fire. We
   build on these themes to illustrate an approach for examining whether,
   and how, fuel management can simultaneously minimize housing exposure
   while maximizing area suitable for expansion of beneficial wildfire. We
   generate multiple hypothetical post-treatment conditions according to
   distinct treatment prioritization schemes (Housing Protection, Federal
   Transmission, Random) and variable treatment extents and compare
   performance across strategies for a 8.5 million ha case study landscape
   in north-central New Mexico, USA. Results In general, we find that
   treating near housing units can provide the greatest level of protection
   relative to treating more remote wildlands to reduce transmission
   potential. Treating on federal lands to reduce federal transmission was
   highly effective at reducing exposure from federal fires and at
   expanding opportunities for beneficial fire but contributed
   comparatively little to reducing housing exposure from all fires. We
   find that treatment extents as low as 2.5-5\% can yield significant
   benefits with spatially optimized strategies, whereas the random
   strategy did not perform comparably until reaching a much larger
   treatment extent. Increasing risk tolerance for housing exposure
   expanded the area suitable for managed fire, while decreasing risk
   tolerance for beneficial fire opportunity and flame length probability
   shrunk the area suitable for managed fire. Conclusions This work
   provides a contribution in terms of explicitly framing risk analysis and
   fuel treatment design around federal land and resource management
   objectives and adds to the knowledge base for designing effective
   landscape fuel treatment strategies that can protect communities and
   expand beneficial wildfire on a fire-prone landscape. Successful
   integration of these themes requires embracing all pillars of the
   National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, including
   coordinated management of fuels on various ownerships, home ignition
   zone mitigation, and cross-boundary fire response planning that can
   guide fire operations in reducing transmission and expand response
   options.},

   ecosystems},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: Fire is a multifaceted force. Fire activity and risk of fire
   incidence across US forested ecosystems have accelerated over the last
   two decades. At the same time, human land-use choices and climate change
   interacted with fire, in an era we are called to meet specific
   sustainability goals of reducing CO2 emissions and protecting
   biodiversity, ecosystems, and their resources. To understand the
   development of the traits and functions of organisms, and the processes
   and drivers of natural and human-induced events that cause fire, it is
   essential to study the fire ecology in the context of human land-use
   history in the forested ecoregions of the USA.
   Results: This book is a research synthesis of the fire ecology in the US
   forest ecosystems at the regional level. Two main pillars are analyzed
   across all ecoregions and forest types covered in the book, the drivers
   and linkages that form fire history and interactions initiated by
   recurring fire events, and the interdependence of fire with the forest
   ecosystem dynamics and humans.
   Conclusions: The research, policy, and management tools available for
   managing fire as a disturbance and as prevention and mitigation
   treatment need cross-boundary revision. It is fundamental to realize the
   precise role of fire at present and to redefine the role of fire in the
   short and long term. This book is an invitation to change our
   perspective and methods towards these directions.},

Title = {Reliability of cross-regional applications of global fire danger models:
   a Peruvian case study},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Background: Fire danger indexes (FDIs) are used as proxies for fire
   potential and are often developed for specific locations. For practical
   purposes, the extrapolation of the underlying calculations into novel
   locations is common, but it is generally uncertain if the relationships
   between FDIs and fire potential observed in the environment in which the
   index was developed are equally relevant in others. For example,
   although a topographically, ecologically, and climatologically complex
   country, f ire danger forecasts in Peru use a standard set of nationwide
   thresholds applied to the Fire Weather Index. In this study, we validate
   the underlying assumption that weather-fire relationships are spatially
   uniform within Peru by (1) making cross-regional comparisons of the
   statistical distributions of four FDIs-Burning Index, Energy Release
   Component, Fire Weather Index, and Keetch-Byram Drought Index, and (2)
   making crossregional comparisons of the expected daily MODIS hotspot
   count percentiles conditioned on FDI values.
   Results: Significant regional differences in the distributions of daily
   FDI values were observed in every pair of regions within Peru, and with
   the exception of a pair of regions within the Amazon, little data (< 90
   days) were necessary to detect these differences. After controlling for
   FDI values and seasonal and annual effects with regressions, differences
   in predicted hotspot percentiles were common, differing by as much as 47
   percentage points. Across the pairs of regions, the magnitude of these
   differences tended to decrease as climatic similarity increased, but
   some counterexamples were also apparent.
   Conclusions: The noticeable differences in the distributions of daily
   FDI values suggest that a standard set of breakpoints may produce
   unreliable inferences regarding fire potential. We also find that even
   if the climatic conditions were similar across Peru, the same FDI values
   in two locations can produce substantially differing predictions of
   wildfire activity. This suggests that other factors besides FDI values
   can strongly mediate wildfire activity and that better fire potential
   predictions could be produced if these factors are accounted for.},

Title = {Fire interval and post-fire climate effects on serotinous forest
   resilience},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Background: Climate change is eroding forest resilience to disturbance
   directly through warming climate and indirectly through increasing
   disturbance activity. Forests characterized by stand-replacing fire
   regimes and dominated by serotinous species are at risk when the
   inter-fire period is insufficient for canopy seed bank development and
   climate conditions for recruitment in the post-fire growing season are
   unsuitable. Although both factors are critical to serotinous forest
   persistence, their relative importance for post-fire regeneration in
   serotinous forests remains poorly understood. To assess the relative
   effects of each factor, we established plots in severely burned knobcone
   pine (Pinus attenuata Lemmon) forests in Oregon and California, USA,
   representing a range of past fire intervals (6 to 31+ years).
   Specifically, we evaluated effects of fire interval and pre-fire canopy
   seed bank (proxies for seed supply) and post-fire climate on three
   metrics of post-fire tree regeneration (seedling density, probability of
   self-replacement, percent population recovery).
   Results: Seed supply consistently had the strongest effect on post-fire
   regeneration. Between 6- and 31-year fire intervals, post-fire seedling
   density increased from 1000 to 100,000 seedlings ha(-1), while
   probability of self-replacement increased from similar to 0 to similar
   to 100\% and percent population recovery increased from 20 to 2000\% of
   the pre-fire population, respectively. Similarly, increasing the canopy
   seed bank by two orders of magnitude increased seedling density and
   percent population recovery by two orders and one order of magnitude,
   respectively, and increased the probability of self-replacement by >
   50\%. Greater post-fire climatic moisture deficit exacerbated the effect
   of seed supply; an additional 4-6 years between fires was required under
   high moisture stress conditions to reach similar regeneration levels as
   under low moisture stress conditions.
   Conclusion: The overriding effect of seed supply-strongly driven by
   pre-fire stand age-on post-fire regeneration suggests that altered fire
   frequency (an indirect effect of climate change) will have a profound
   impact on serotinous forests. Although direct effects of hot and dry
   climate are lower in magnitude, they can alter forest recovery where
   seed supply nears a threshold. These findings reveal how fire interval
   and climate combine to determine changes in forest cover in the future,
   informing management and vulnerability mapping.},

Title = {An analysis of the recent fire regimes in the Angolan catchment of the
   Okavango Delta, Central Africa},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background This paper presents an analysis of fire regimes in the poorly
   studied Angolan catchment of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We used
   MODIS data to examine the frequency and seasonality of fires over 20
   years (from 2000 to 2020) in three dominant vegetation types (miombo
   woodlands, open woodlands and grasslands, and short closed to open
   bushlands), and in areas where people were present, and where they were
   absent. Results The median fire return intervals for both open woodlands
   and grasslands and short bushlands were relatively short (1.9 and 2.2
   years respectively). In miombo woodlands, fires were less frequent
   (median return periods of 4.5 years). Human population density had no
   discernible effect on the fire return intervals, but about 14\% of the
   miombo woodlands experienced no fires over 20 years. Ongoing shifting
   cultivation within miombo woodlands has led to structural changes and
   the introduction of fire into this vegetation type where fires were rare
   or absent in the past. About 12\% of the miombo did not burn during the
   period examined where people were present, whereas close to 20\% of the
   sites remained unburnt where people were absent. This suggests that
   people did not change the fire return interval in any of the vegetation
   types studied, but that they altered the amount of the landscape that is
   flammable in miombo vegetation. Fires occurred between June and
   September, with a peak in the late dry season (August and September).
   Conclusions Historical research indicates that late dry-season fires are
   detrimental to miombo woodlands, and our analysis suggests that
   degradation in parts of the catchment has led to the introduction of
   fire to this previously fire-free and fire-sensitive vegetation type.
   Deforestation of miombo woodlands, and the consequent introduction of
   fire, is a cause for concern with respect to the ecological stability of
   the Okavango Delta. Managers should therefore aim to protect the
   remaining closed-canopy miombo stands from further clearing and to
   attempt to shift the timing of burns to the early dry season to reduce
   their intensity.},

Title = {Pre-Columbian red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) fire regimes of
   north-central Pennsylvania, USA},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background Fire-dependent vegetation communities in the northeastern USA
   have undergone significant transitions since social and ecological
   disruptions associated with Euro-American colonization of North America.
   There is much interest, though little information available, about
   historical fire regimes of fire-adapted vegetation communities in the
   northeastern USA in pre-Columbian times (i.e., pre-1492 CE). We
   intensively investigated a red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)-oak (Quercus
   spp.) forested landscape in north-central Pennsylvania, USA, for
   exceptionally old red pine remnants (stumps, snags) where previous
   research had suggested the potential to develop fire-scar and tree-ring
   chronologies which extend to time periods prior to 1492. Results
   Tree-ring and fire-scar chronologies recovered from red pine trees
   extend back to 1370 and 1402, respectively. Red pine trees were broadly
   distributed across this landscape (34.4 km(2) area) prior to 1492, and
   frequent fire (i.e., mean fire return intervals of 4.1 years at
   landscape scale, 9.7-11.7 years at smaller spatial scales (0.5-7.1
   km(2))) was observed in the time period prior to sustained contact
   between Indigenous peoples and Euro-American colonizers circa 1609.
   Conclusions This study resulted in the longest fire-scar record in
   eastern North America and offers unique foundational ecological
   information regarding pre-Columbian fire regimes of northeastern USA
   fire-adapted forest communities. Fire scars provide physical evidence
   that fire was an important ecological component of this landscape before
   and after 1492 and that the current period of reduced fire activity is
   unprecedented in the 500 years prior to fire exclusion practices that
   were widely adopted circa 1915. Beyond fire scars, the spatial and
   temporal extent of the red pine tree-ring record provides evidence that
   red pine, a fire-dependent species, was historically a more important
   component of this landscape than it is today. The conservation of red
   pine vegetation communities will require incorporating recurring fire
   into management plans, for the successful regeneration and perpetuation
   of red pine, and to sustain associated flora and fauna of conservation
   concern.},

Title = {A spatially explicit analytical framework to assess wildfire risks on
   brown bear habitat and corridors in conservation areas},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Background Humans have altered fire regimes across ecosystems due to
   climate change, land use change, and increasing ignition. Unprecedented
   shifts in fire regimes affect animals and contribute to habitat
   displacement, reduced movement, and increased mortality risk. Mitigating
   these effects require the identification of habitats that are
   susceptible to wildfires. We designed an analytical framework that
   incorporates fire risk mapping with species distribution modeling to
   identify key habitats of Ursus arctos with high probability of fire in
   Iran. We applied the random forest algorithm for fire risk mapping. We
   also modeled brown bear habitats and predicted connectivity between them
   using species distribution models and connectivity analysis,
   respectively. Finally, the fire risk map, critical habitats, and
   corridors were overlaid to spatially identify habitats and corridors
   that are at high risk of fire. Results We identified 17 critical
   habitats with 5245 km(2) of corridors connecting them, 40.06\% and
   11.34\% of which are covered by conservation areas, respectively. Our
   analysis showed that 35.65\% of key habitats and 23.56\% of corridors
   are at high risk of fire. Conclusions Since bears habitat in this
   semi-arid landscape rely on forests at higher altitudes, it is likely
   that shifting fire regimes due to changing climate and land use
   modifications reduce the extent of habitats in the future. While it is
   not well known how fire affects bears, identifying its key habitat where
   wildfires are likely to occur is the first step to manage potential
   impacts from increasing wildfires on this species.},

Title = {Fire severity and tree size affect post-fire survival of Afrotemperate
   forest trees},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background Fire is recognized as an important factor in determining the
   distribution and composition of Southern Cape Afrotemperate Forest in
   South Africa, although comprehensive understanding of the resilience of
   these forests to fire is lacking. We investigated effects of fire
   severity and tree size on post-fire survival of Afrotemperate forest
   tree species. Results Fire severity was estimated from observed damage
   to the main stem of trees, and trees were considered to have survived if
   they resprouted from the main stem or had green foliage in the canopy. A
   total of 88 plots, 40 species, and 1 378 trees were surveyed 19-24
   months post-fire. We assessed the survival response of all trees
   collectively and for 10 species (with sample size > 40) individually,
   using logistic regression. Relative to other forests of the world, the
   post-fire survival rate (45\%) of Afrotemperate forest trees
   collectively was comparable to that in coniferous and tropical forests
   but lower than that in other temperate forests and in neighboring dune
   thicket. Fire severity had a significant negative effect on survival and
   tree size had a significant positive effect. Total variance explained by
   the model (for species collectively) was 40.8\%, of which fire severity
   and tree size combined explained 13.2\%, and species as random factor,
   27.6\%. Respective tree species showed differential survival
   responses-four species showed high survival (> 60\%), while five species
   showed low survival (< 40\%). Further, some species exhibited strong
   resprouting from the base or main stem while others rarely resprouted.
   The survival response and resprouting abilities of species which occur
   in both Afrotemperate forest and neighboring, more fire-exposed dune
   thicket, were generally poorer in forest. Such discrepancies imply that
   historical fire regimes associated with vegetation types likely drive
   species adaptions. Conclusions Our findings suggest that fire severity
   and fire frequency (in terms of how tree size relates to fire frequency)
   are important for maintaining species richness and diversity within and
   between forest types. Varying resilience to fire among species supports
   previous assertions that fire affects species composition and diversity
   in these forests and suggests that potential changes in fire regimes due
   to global change will have consequences for forest conservation.},

Title = {Effects of repeated fire on Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Background The dominant species of Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub sprout
   after burning from belowground rhizomes or fire-resistant aboveground
   buds with rapid reestablishment of cover. Responses to single fires are
   well documented; however, responses to repeated fires may differ. Fire
   return intervals, differences among sites, and species may influence
   responses. We used transect data from four sites on Kennedy Space
   Center/Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge to test whether growth
   differed through repeated fires. Two sites burned five times in 36
   years, one site burned five times in 25 years, and one burned four times
   in 18 years. We used linear mixed models that account for repeated
   measures to determine if the number of fires affected height, total
   cover >= 0.5 m and < 0.5 m, bare ground, and cover of the dominant oak
   (Quercus) >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) >= 0.5 m. We
   compared community composition through repeated fires using nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling ordination. Results Height, total cover >= 0.5
   m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto >= 0.5 m
   increased with time since burn; total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground
   decreased. A quadratic term in the growth model was significant except
   for total cover < 0.5 m. There were site differences for all variables
   except bare ground. The number of fires decreased height, total cover >=
   0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 and increased total cover <
   0.5 m and bare ground but had no effect on cover of Serenoa repens >=
   0.5 m. Community changes after repeated fires were similar in nonmetric
   multidimensional ordinations with time since burn correlated to the
   first or second axis. Conclusions Scrub recovered from repeated fires at
   a range of intervals and seasons, but short return intervals reduced
   growth with responses differing among species.},

Title = {Decoupling between soil moisture and biomass drives seasonal variations
   in live fuel moisture across co-occurring plant functional types},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Background Wildfires are important global disturbances influencing
   ecosystem structure and composition. The moisture content of living and
   senescent plant components are key determinants of wildfire activity,
   yet our understanding of how seasonal fluctuations in water availability
   and biomass control live foliar moisture content (LFMC) across
   co-occurring plant functional types is limited in diverse forested
   landscapes. Results We recorded root-zone volumetric water content (VWC)
   and sampled leaf mass area (LMA) and LFMC of three co-occurring plant
   functional types across six field sites. We used a linear mixed effects
   model to quantify the drivers of LFMC and understand whether LFMC
   dynamics were coupled or decoupled from site conditions. Both LMA and
   VWC were significant predictors of LFMC variability (p < 0.001),
   although the strength and direction of these relationships varied across
   functional types. LFMC dynamics of understorey plant functional types
   were strongly coupled to site conditions, where the site random effect
   explained 44.2\% (shrub) and 74.8\% (herb) of the variability in LFMC
   across the season respectively. In contrast, overstorey plants were
   decoupled from site conditions, which explained only 8.1\% of the
   variability in LFMC. Conclusions LFMC of understorey plants responded to
   changes in soil water availability (VWC), while overstorey trees
   responded to biomass fluctuations (LMA). We present a conceptual model
   describing the influence of these factors on LFMC, which aligns with our
   findings and draws on the broader literature. This knowledge and
   conceptual approach can be used to improve our ability to characterize
   seasonal LFMC variation across different plant functional types, in turn
   improving our capacity to predict wildfire risk.},

Title = {Modeled interactions of mountain pine beetle and wildland fire under
   future climate and management scenarios for three western US landscapes},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Background Mountain pine beetle (MPB) is a native disturbance agent
   across most pine forests in the western US. Climate changes will
   directly and indirectly impact frequencies and severities of MPB
   outbreaks, which can then alter fuel characteristics and wildland fire
   dynamics via changes in stand structure and composition. To investigate
   the importance of MPB to past and future landscape dynamics, we used the
   mechanistic, spatially explicit ecosystem process model FireBGCv2 to
   quantify interactions among climate, MPB, wildfire, fire suppression,
   and fuel management under historical and projected future climates for
   three western US landscapes. We compared simulated FireBGCv2 output from
   three MPB modules (none, simple empirical, and complex mechanistic)
   using three focus variables and six exploratory variables to evaluate
   the importance of MPB to landscape dynamics. Results We found that
   inclusion of MPB (empirical or mechanistic) in the simulations
   significantly changed past and future landscape dynamics and that the
   mechanistic MPB module had more cross-scale interactions that increased
   variability, and perhaps realism, of simulation results. We also
   evaluated impacts of fire and fuel management on MPB dynamics and found
   that fire suppression influenced fuel loadings more than MPB
   disturbance, but at a landscape scale, most fuel treatment programs did
   little to change fuel loadings, MPB dynamics, and burned area, except
   under high fire suppression. Conclusions Synergistic interactions of
   climate, MPB, and wildfire catalyzed landscape-scale changes in
   vegetation distributions, fuels, and fire regimes in FireBGCv2
   simulations. Models that simulate climate change on pine-dominated
   landscapes may be improved by including mechanistic MPB simulations to
   account for potentially important ecological interactions.},

Title = {Canopies, the Final Frog-tier: exploring responses of a specialist
   treefrog to prescribed fire in a pyrogenic ecosystem},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Background Pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States were shaped
   by frequent fires. Land managers use prescribed fires to control fuels
   but also to restore historical fire dynamics. Broad outcomes of this
   practice are well-understood, but impacts on many organisms are still
   being explored. Frogs, for example, have upland and wetland
   requirements, limited mobility, and skin susceptible to desiccation.
   Treefrogs spend most of their lives in uplands away from water. When
   fire approaches, animals may escape to an unburned area, shelter in
   place, or be killed by the fire. We examined which of these mechanisms
   is the prevailing short-term response for a specialist treefrog in a
   pyrogenic flatwood system. Results We assessed the short-term impacts of
   prescribed fire on the dynamics of an upland flatwood specialist, the
   pinewoods treefrog Dryophytes femoralis, using a replicated
   before-after-control-impact field experiment. We set pipes as treefrog
   refugia at 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, and 9(+) m in 12 pine trees spread evenly
   across two treatments: reference trees in units burned in 2020 and trees
   in units with 2021 prescribed fire. Prescribed fires occurred on 16
   April and 21 July 2021. Every 2 weeks between 5 March and 5 September,
   we checked pipes for frogs and assigned them unique color marks. We
   observed 78 individuals with 199 additional recaptures. We modeled
   abundance (as raw counts), survival, and vertical movement using
   mark-recapture methods, multi-state, and mixed linear models with a
   Bayesian framework. Survival and recapture were comparable among
   prescribed fire treatments, but abundances and movement probability
   varied. Frogs in trees in areas burned during the study were more likely
   to stay in place and less likely to descend to lower heights. We
   observed more frogs in trees after a 2021 fire compared to reference
   trees. Conclusions The prevailing mechanism for resiliency to fire for
   pinewoods treefrogs was migration up large pines, then likely
   recolonization to lower vegetation layers when plants regreen post-fire.
   This substantiates conclusions from other works that the integrity of
   mature pines is key to sustaining native biodiversity. Future work and
   management should consider the three-dimensional structure of habitat
   when developing burn prescriptions and study designs.},

Title = {Multitemporal lidar captures heterogeneity in fuel loads and consumption
   on the Kaibab Plateau},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Background Characterization of physical fuel distributions across
   heterogeneous landscapes is needed to understand fire behavior, account
   for smoke emissions, and manage for ecosystem resilience. Remote sensing
   measurements at various scales inform fuel maps for improved fire and
   smoke models. Airborne lidar that directly senses variation in
   vegetation height and density has proven to be especially useful for
   landscape-scale fuel load and consumption mapping. Here we predicted
   field-observed fuel loads from airborne lidar and Landsat-derived fire
   history metrics with random forest (RF) modeling. RF models were then
   applied across multiple lidar acquisitions (years 2012, 2019, 2020) to
   create fuel maps across our study area on the Kaibab Plateau in northern
   Arizona, USA. We estimated consumption across the 2019 Castle and Ikes
   Fires by subtracting 2020 fuel load maps from 2019 fuel load maps and
   examined the relationship between mapped surface fuels and years since
   fire, as recorded in the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS)
   database. Results R-squared correlations between predicted and
   ground-observed fuels were 50, 39, 59, and 48\% for available canopy
   fuel, 1- to 1000-h fuels, litter and duff, and total surface fuel (sum
   of 1- to 1000-h, litter and duff fuels), respectively. Lidar metrics
   describing overstory distribution and density, understory density,
   Landsat fire history metrics, and elevation were important predictors.
   Mapped surface fuel loads were positively and nonlinearly related to
   time since fire, with asymptotes to stable fuel loads at 10-15 years
   post fire. Surface fuel consumption averaged 16.1 and 14.0 Mg ha(- 1)
   for the Castle and Ikes Fires, respectively, and was positively
   correlated with the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). We
   estimated surface fuel consumption to be 125.3 +/- 54.6 Gg for the
   Castle Fire and 27.6 +/- 12.0 Gg for the portion of the Ikes Fire (42\%)
   where pre- and post-fire airborne lidar were available. Conclusions We
   demonstrated and reinforced that canopy and surface fuels can be
   predicted and mapped with moderate accuracy using airborne lidar data.
   Landsat-derived fire history helped account for spatial and temporal
   variation in surface fuel loads and allowed us to describe temporal
   trends in surface fuel loads. Our fuel load and consumption maps and
   methods have utility for land managers and researchers who need
   landscape-wide estimates of fuel loads and emissions. Fuel load maps
   based on active remote sensing can be used to inform fuel management
   decisions and assess fuel structure goals, thereby promoting ecosystem
   resilience. Multitemporal lidar-based consumption estimates can inform
   emissions estimates and provide independent validation of conventional
   fire emission inventories. Our methods also provide a remote sensing
   framework that could be applied in other areas where airborne lidar is
   available for quantifying relationships between fuels and time since
   fire across landscapes.},

Title = {Vegetation type conversion in the US Southwest: frontline observations
   and management responses},

Abstract = {Background Forest and nonforest ecosystems of the western United States
   are experiencing major transformations in response to land-use change,
   climate warming, and their interactive effects with wildland fire. Some
   ecosystems are transitioning to persistent alternative types, hereafter
   called ``vegetation type conversion{''} (VTC). VTC is one of the most
   pressing management issues in the southwestern US, yet current
   strategies to intervene and address change often use trial-and-error
   approaches devised after the fact. To better understand how to manage
   VTC, we gathered managers, scientists, and practitioners from across the
   southwestern US to collect their experiences with VTC challenges,
   management responses, and outcomes. Results Participants in two
   workshops provided 11 descriptive case studies and 61 examples of VTC
   from their own field observations. These experiences demonstrate the
   extent and complexity of ecological reorganization across the region.
   High-severity fire was the predominant driver of VTC in semi-arid
   coniferous forests. By a large margin, these forests converted to
   shrubland, with fewer conversions to native or non-native herbaceous
   communities. Chaparral and sagebrush areas nearly always converted to
   non-native grasses through interactions among land use, climate, and
   fire. Management interventions in VTC areas most often attempted to
   reverse changes, although we found that these efforts cover only a small
   portion of high-severity burn areas undergoing VTC. Some areas incurred
   long (>10 years) observational periods prior to initiating
   interventions. Efforts to facilitate VTC were rare, but could cover
   large spatial areas. Conclusions Our findings underscore that type
   conversion is a common outcome of high-severity wildland fire in the
   southwestern US. Ecosystem managers are frontline observers of these
   far-reaching and potentially persistent changes, making their
   experiences valuable in further developing intervention strategies and
   research agendas. As its drivers increase with climate change, VTC
   appears increasingly likely in many ecological contexts and may require
   management paradigms to transition as well. Approaches to VTC
   potentially include developing new models of desired conditions, the use
   of experimentation by managers, and broader implementation of adaptive
   management strategies. Continuing to support and develop science-manager
   partnerships and peer learning groups will help to shape our response to
   ongoing rapid ecological transformations.},

   Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and
   Coptera sp. (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) emerged from pupae of both D.

Abstract = {RESUMEN En la Region Oriental del Paraguay se encuentran los humedales
   del Complejo Ypoa, declarados como sitio RAMSAR y categorizados como
   Reserva de Recursos Manejados. Pese a estas categorias de proteccion, su
   biodiversidad ha sido escasamente estudiada. El objetivo de este trabajo
   fue determinar la riqueza, composicion y abundancia de anuros y reptiles
   de estos humedales (diversidad alfa y gamma), cuantificar la diferencia
   en la composicion de especies entre los sitios de muestreo (diversidad
   beta) y evaluar la variacion temporal en la riqueza de especies en
   relacion a variables climaticas. Se seleccionaron tres sitios de
   muestreo y se realizo un esfuerzo de muestreo de 45 dias. La deteccion
   de herpetozoos se realizo a traves de busquedas activas asociadas a
   listas MacKinnon en el caso de anuros, instalacion de trampas pozo con
   cercos de conduccion y redes de embudo acuaticas. Los datos de
   precipitacion, humedad y temperatura mensual se obtuvieron del Centro
   Meteorologico Nacional. Se identificaron 32 especies de anuros y 21 de
   reptiles a escala regional en los humedales del Ypoa. El sitio con mayor
   riqueza de especies de anuros fue Quiindy (27 especies), y para
   reptiles, Carapegua (10 especies). Las curvas de acumulacion y los
   estimadores de riqueza indicaron que a mayor esfuerzo de muestreo se
   seguiran registrando especies de reptiles, sin embargo, en el caso de
   los anuros, el muestreo fue suficiente para caracterizar el 89 \% de la
   riqueza de este ensamble. La similitud en la composicion de anuros entre
   los sitios varia entre 0.571-0.708, y entre reptiles 0.071-0.182. Menos
   de un tercio de las especies registradas fueron clasificadas como
   abundantes en los humedales, incluyendo Melanophryniscus paraguayensis,
   la unica especie de anuro endemica del Paraguay. Se registro una
   correlacion positiva entre la riqueza de especies de anuros y reptiles y
   la temperatura del aire en los meses de muestreo.},

Abstract = {The presence of a predator can cause behavioral changes in its prey,
   such as decreased foraging activity. Previous studies have indicated
   that the scorpion Ananteris mauryi has the ability to identify the
   chemical traces of its intraguild predator Tityus pusillus, causing it
   to reduce its exploratory activity. In this study, the foraging
   activities of A. mauryi in a natural environment with different
   densities of T. pusillus were compared. The study was carried out
   through active searches from 19:00 to 22:00 in five fragments of the
   Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco, Brazil, one having a low density of T.
   pusillus and four returning high densities. In total, 81 individuals of
   A. mauryi were observed, and 49.4\% were recorded in the area with a low
   density of T. pusillus. In general, A. mauryi individuals exhibited a
   similar foraging activity in the fragment with low and higher density of
   T. pusillus. Similarly, A. mauryi was found on leaf litter bottom layers
   independently of T. pusillus density. Therefore, our results suggest
   that their predator density does not exert any influence on foraging
   activity and microhabitat choice in A. mauryi.},

   wood. This study is aimed to characterize the Simple Sequence Repeat
   (SSR) variability of 123 trees selected from six provinces of Ecuador.
   The results showed that the natural mahogany population had a low level
   of genetic diversity (A = 6.9; Ho = 0.39; He = 0.43) and a significant
   heterozygous deficit inbreeding coefficient (F = 0.16). The probability
   of identity (PI) of the 12 microsatellite markers was low 4.3 x 10(-9)
   and the cumulative exclusion probability of 99.99\%. Additionally, the
   relatedness coefficient among individuals was -0.010 (se = 0.004). The
   genetic diversity among populations was moderate (phi ST = 8\%). In
   addition, the structure analysis showed two genetic groups; however, it
   was possible to distinguish admixture within the entire range evaluated.
   These results show the need to establish strategies that allow the
   recovery and increase of the genetic diversity in natural populations,
   especially with the selection of trees to harvest seeds, as well as
   crossing the tree genetic pool to recombine their diversity.},

Abstract = {The northwestern region of Argentina has several gaps in
   ichthyogeographic knowledge and there are still bodies of water without
   records of the species that inhabit them. When planning mitigation
   projects or conservation or management actions, little knowledge of the
   biology of a species presents itself as a restriction. Therefore, the
   objective is to know the reproductive biology of the torrent catfish (H.
   macraei) in the Natural Protected Area La Cienaga, San Juan, with the
   purpose of generating basic information as a tool for the future
   management of these populations. The torrent catfish, Hatcheria macraei
   (Girard, 1855) is a Siluriformes that belongs to the Trichomycteridae
   family, it is a rheophilic and phototactic negative species, which is
   characterized by living in cold and well-oxygenated waters with sandy
   and rocky substrates. In a period of one year, fecundity, reproductive
   potential, minimum reproductive size were determined, sexual dimorphism
   was evaluated, and the state of gonadal development was described. It
   was determined that the species presents an opportunistic strategy,
   presenting a prolonged reproduction period from October to November.},

Abstract = {The habitat fragmentation caused by reservoir construction in different
   aquatic systems in the Magdalena River basin is a latent threat to the
   diversity of fishes and aquatic environments in the Andean region of
   Colombia. Contributing to the knowledge about how fish assemblages are
   formed in these scenarios is fundamental for the management and
   decision-making on the aquatic resources of the basin. In this
   communication, we describe the results of a fish characterization in the
   area of influence of the Piedras Blancas reservoir, a high Andean
   reservoir built for hydroelectric power generation. Only three species
   of fish that make up the evaluated assemblage were captured, and two of
   them, Cyprinus carpio and Xiphophorus maculatus, are not native to the
   basin. Possibly, with a greater sampling effort, more species can be
   found. The native species Hemibrycon sp. is distributed mainly in a
   creek, while in the reservoir, the introduced species dominate. The
   environmental variables were in optimal ranges for the development of
   life in the evaluated environments. It is important to advance the
   knowledge about the distribution of the introduced and native species in
   the basin to generate recommendations that contribute to the management
   of these species in the aquatic systems of Colombian Andes.},

Title = {The burrowing crayfish Parastacus pugnax (Decapoda: Parastacidae) in the
   Semiarid Region of Chile: findings of a naturalized or threatened
   population?},

Abstract = {Parastacus pugnax is an endemic burrowing crayfish from the basins of
   the Mediterranean and Temperate Wet regions of Chile. For the first
   time, specimens were found incidentally in the Semiarid Region of Chile
   (Choapa River Basin). In these regions, hydrological changes derived
   from global warming and the intensive use of water for irrigation have
   resulted in highly fragmented habitats, where the effects of the dry
   season are exacerbated by periods of permanent drought. Unfortunately,
   in the Semiarid Region there are not regulatory measures for the
   conservation of the native biota. The aims of this study were to
   determine the spatial distribution patterns of P. pugnax in the Choapa
   River Basin (similar to 31 degrees S) to expand and contribute with
   updated knowledge about the distribution and natural history of this
   species highlighting local environmental management issues. Seasonal
   occurrence surveys were carried out at eight sites stratified by
   elevation in the lower, middle, and upper zones of this basin. This was
   complemented by semi-structured interviews within local prawn ` s
   fisher. Parastacus pugnax was distributed across similar to 25 km in the
   lower and middle zone of the basin, and it is present in lentic and
   lotic environments. The occurrence of this excavator species in lotic
   environments is somehow unusual according to its ecology, which suggests
   that it is a primary facultative excavator, so a re-evaluation of its
   current ecological category (category 1; primary excavator) is
   necessary. According to the interviewees, P. pugnax corresponds to a
   naturalized species introduced by humans similar to 25-30 years ago for
   artisanal aquaculture in ponds. The wide altitudinal distribution of P.
   pugnax in the Choapa River Basin indicates the need to re-evaluate its
   distribution limits, which traditionally placed the Parastacidae family
   to the south of Aconcagua River Basin (similar to 33 degrees S). To
   understand the origin of the species in the Choapa River Basin, is clue
   to specify the phylogenetic structure and determinate whether the
   presence in the Semiarid Region is constrained to the Choapa River Basin
   or extends to other basins within this region.},

Abstract = {Scinax belloni is a small bromeligenous treefrog that lives in the
   mountainous areas of southeastern Brazil. The call of the species has
   been previously described, but recently gathered data revealed an
   unreported acoustic unit that we describe herein. Intraspecific
   variation within the species call was also updated based on an increased
   sample size. The call is composed of two types of multipulsed notes: a
   short note, which is in agreement with the previous description, and a
   trill note that is emitted in association with the short note. The trill
   note was likely not reported in the previous description because of the
   small sample size. Further studies should elucidate the social function
   of the trill note. Acoustic units somewhat resembling the trill note are
   shared by a few other Scinax species, but the nomenclatural instability
   of these calls hamper detailed comparisons. This highlights the need for
   a standardized and comparative acoustic analysis to elucidate homologous
   and comparable acoustic units among the bromeligenous Scinax species.},

Abstract = {The American mink (Neovison vison) has been introduced for fur farming
   into several countries around the world. In southern South America,
   although invasive populations have established in Argentina and Chile,
   no feral minks have been recorded in the Pampas Biome to date. We report
   a potentially new biological invasion in Uruguay, presenting
   observations, pictures and a museum specimen of feral minks in the
   locality Melilla, Montevideo Department, which probably escaped or were
   released from a local fur farm. We obtained 35 mink records between 2010
   and 2020, mostly close to the fur farm, within a 2.5 km radius. Our
   report provides the northernmost mink records in South America, being
   the first in the Pampas Biome. American mink is a feared invader in most
   of the sites where it has been introduced, and therefore these new
   records are important mainly to plan and apply management interventions.},

Abstract = {Bergmann's rule is one of the most vigorously debated ecogeographic
   patterns but has rarely been examined in Neotropical bats. Herein, I
   examined Bergmann's rule in Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus
   lituratus along an elevation gradient of 2500 m at both inter- and
   intraspecific level. I measured 384 specimens from collections belonged
   to C. perspicillata (89 female, 102 male) and A. lituratus (89 female,
   104 male). The size of C. perspicillata increased with increasing
   elevation and decreasing temperature, whereas A. lituratus showed the
   converse pattern. For both species, females did not differ between
   elevation categories, contrary to males that were larger above 1000 m in
   C. perspicillata, but smaller in A. lituratus. Conformity to Bergmann's
   rule depends on bat size and sex. Despite C. perspicillata follows the
   pattern, the explanatory mechanisms still need to be understood. By
   contrast, A. lituratus follows the converse of Bergmann's rule due to
   naked and highly vascularized wings that aid thermoregulation in warmer
   environments. Male size is more sensitive to changes in temperature for
   both species which may be partially explained by sexual selection.
   Elevation and temperature are not the only factors related to bat
   morphology and other mechanisms may explain size in bats.},

Title = {Cooperative harassment strategy by the European Starling to usurp
   cavities and reproductive cost for the neotropical Green-barred
   Woodpecker},

Abstract = {The European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is a cavity-nesting bird with
   great invasive potential. As a result of human intervention, this bird
   is now distributed across all continents (except Antarctica) and its
   distribution range is increasing at an alarming rate. The European
   Starling was introduced to Argentina in 1983 and is currently
   distributed across almost the entire country. It is considered one of
   the hundred most damaging invasive species in the world and constitutes
   a serious competitive threat to native cavity-nesting birds.
   Interactions between European Starlings and cavity-nesting birds
   generally have negative consequences on native bird populations,
   although there are still few reports in the literature that account for
   the degree of damage. In this study, we report for the first time
   details of the harassment strategy and subsequent cavity usurpation by
   European Starlings on a breeding pair of Green-barred Woodpeckers
   (Colaptes melanochloros) in an urban area of central-eastern Argentina.
   Over one breeding season, the woodpeckers excavated seven cavities, none
   of which were successful. In six of these reproductive attempts (86\%)
   we recorded interactions with European Starlings and in five (71\%) the
   cavity was usurped. On three occasions we recorded a cooperative
   harassment strategy by a group of European Starlings causing the
   woodpeckers to abandon the cavity. Our report is especially relevant if
   we consider the invasive potential of the European Starling worldwide
   and the frequently limited cavity supply in bird breeding habitats.
   Therefore, we encourage governmental authorities and environmental NGOs
   to take measures to control the populations of this aggressive invasive
   species.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are among the most threatened and yet the most
   biodiverse Neotropical ecosystems. However, current patterns of
   biological occupancy in these forests remain poorly studied. Here, we
   document the diversity, patterns of seasonal turnover and change of
   species composition over time of birds in a highly exploited but
   protected tropical dry forest of southwestern Ecuador, Bosque Protector
   Puyango. Using a combination of mist netting, song recording and direct
   observations, we surveyed the study site over a 2-month period of
   fieldwork during both the dry and rainy seasons. We then performed a
   literature review of the species reported in this site and compared the
   changes in composition over time using a historical survey. One hundred
   sixty-one species of birds belonging to 40 families were recorded inside
   the area. One hundred and six species were found in this survey and 55
   were recovered from the literature. Seasonality did not significantly
   affect species abundance and richness; however, species dominance
   changed notably. Although the overall species richness of the site has
   been maintained, we found an overwhelming change of species composition
   during the last two decades in this forest. Our results show that this
   highly threatened forest still hosts a unique high avian diversity.
   Conservation actions should be encouraged in the region, motivating the
   local communities to develop non-extractive economic practices, such as
   birdwatching and ecotourism.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Breeding in colonies is a defining characteristic of many waterbird
   species and several behavioural and habitat traits determine nest-site
   selection. Although there is relatively extensive literature on the
   topic, information on the within-colony distribution of nests lacks for
   mixed colonies, especially for ardeid-cormorant associations and in
   regions such as Central America. Here, geospatial data on vegetation
   associated with a mixed colony, established in a small alluvial forest
   northwest of El Salvador and collected from June to November 2015 was
   assessed to identify some behavioural and habitat features that could
   influence nest-site selection. Four ardeid species (Ardea alba, Egretta
   thula, Bubulcus ibis, and Nycticorax nycticorax) and one cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) conformed the colony, where the last was the
   outstanding species. The total area of the colony was 2.14 ha (14\% of
   La Barra forest) with high nest densities (584.58 nests/ha). Spatial
   analyses indicate that some species prefer to occupy trees/shrubs close
   to other trees/shrubs with conspecific or similarly sized species. A
   remarkable height-strata distribution was found, with large-sized
   species in the canopy, and small-sized species in the lower strata. The
   resulting estimates of the generalized linear models applied suggest
   that the within-colony nest-site selection is determined by the
   combination of higher heights of the tree/shrub used for nesting,
   nearest distance to a food source, fewer species sharing the same
   tree/shrub and an increasing effect of the interaction of the latter two
   factors. Finally, the temporal evolution of La Barra's colony shows that
   the increasing number of Neotropical Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   brasilianus) could be shaping and threatening the colony's species
   structure and possibly the vegetation as well. Conservation measures
   should be implemented to manage the population of this species.},

Abstract = {Ganoderma is a cosmopolitan genus that includes a great diversity of
   species. Many of them have been historically described based only on
   morphological characteristics; however, due to their morphological
   plasticity, there is no complete understanding about their relationship
   and taxonomic status. Commonly applied names, particularly in the
   southern Neotropics, come from species of North Hemisphere distribution
   (e.g. G. lucidum, G. resinaceum and G. applanatum). The objective of the
   present work was to perform a survey of Ganoderma species thriving in
   Uruguay. We aimed to identify and characterize them through molecular,
   morphological and ecological analysis. The results confirm the presence
   of four reddish laccate species first registered for Uruguay (G.
   dorsale, G. platense, G. martinicense and G. mexicanum), and one
   non-laccate species (G. australe s.l.) composed of two clades. The
   species are morphologically differentiated mainly by its stipe, pilear
   surface, context, pores, basidiospores and cutis cells. Regarding the
   ecological data, the species present differences in substrate
   preferences. In addition, a taxonomic discussion regarding phylogenetic
   relationships and taxonomic status of Uruguayan Ganoderma species is
   presented.},

   cannot be mobilized by plants, as they exist in a bound form. Therefore,
   it is need to understand mechanisms that naturally increase the
   acquisition of nutrients by plants. Earthworms are crucial soil
   engineers that play a key role in soil functioning. In this study we
   have estimated the impact of three factors, earthworm species,
   ecological group, and soil type, on the ion content of casts of Eisenia
   nordenskioldi, E. ventripapillata, E. nana, Lumbricus rubellus, and
   Aporrectodea caliginosa. Laboratory experiments were performed in
   microcosms on three soil types. We analyzed five water-soluble cations
   and six anions in the earthworm casts by capillary zone electrophoresis
   to determine their content in casts compared to soil. For three of the
   five species studied this is the first information obtained on the
   matter. The obtained data demonstrated that soil type has the biggest
   impact on the observed changes in the cast ion content, probably due to
   the differences in the initial concentrations and soil properties.
   Within each soil type, the observed effects were mostly
   species-specific, and the species belonging to the same ecological group
   (endogeic and epi-endogeic) did not have similar effects. The exposure
   to different earthworm species resulted in pronounced differences in the
   concentrations of magnesium, calcium, ammonium, and chloride, while the
   soil type had the highest impact on sulfate, fluoride, acetate, and
   sodium ions. Therefore, the terms `ecological group and `functional
   group' are not equivalent for earthworm casts, and replacing an
   earthworm species with another belonging to the same ecological group
   may result in changes of the soil ion composition.},

Abstract = {The short-tailed bats Carollia brevicaudum and C. perspicillata are two
   of the most abundant and widely distributed species of phyllostomids in
   the Neotropics. Many authors have found intraspecific variation
   throughout its distribution, mainly in body size and coloration. Since
   there is no consensus on the magnitude of intraspecific variation, in
   this study we assessed the variation patterns of seven populations of
   both C. brevicaudum (n = 185) and C. perspicillata (n = 190) from Peru
   and Ecuador. The populations were delimited by potential barriers of
   distribution such as the main eastern basins, the Amazonas River, and
   the Andes. We took 26 craniomandibular measurements and used univariate,
   multivariate, and cluster analyses. We found significant morphometric
   differences between certain pairs of populations of both species, but
   none are supported by all the analyses. The broad overlap of the
   variables in the populations evaluated of both species suggests a
   morphological complexity not related to the assessed geographies.
   RESUMEN Los murcielagos colicortos Carollia brevicaudum y C.
   perspicillata son dos de las especies de filostomidos mas abundantes y
   ampliamente distribuidos en el Neotropico. Debido a esto, diversos
   autores han encontrado variacion intraespecifica a lo largo de su
   distribucion, principalmente en tamano corporal y coloracion. Dado a que
   no hay un consenso en la magnitud de la variacion intraespecifica, en
   este estudio evaluamos los patrones de variacion de siete poblaciones de
   C. brevicaudum (n = 185) y C. perspicillata (n = 190) de poblaciones de
   Peru y Ecuador. Las poblaciones se delimitaron en base a las principales
   cuencas, rio Amazonas y Andes. Se emplearon 26 medidas
   craneo-mandibulares y se aplicaron analisis univariados, multivariados y
   de conglomerados. Nuestros resultados sugieren que hay diferencias
   morfometricas significativas entre determinados pares de poblaciones de
   ambas especies, pero ninguna es soportada consistentemente por todos los
   analisis. La amplia superposicion de las poblaciones evaluadas en ambas
   especies sugiere una complejidad morfologica no relacionada con las
   geografias evaluadas.},

Abstract = {Bon Accord Lagoon (BAL), Tobago is home to a Thalassia testudinum (K.D.
   Koenig, 1805) dominated seagrass community and polychaetes usually show
   an affinity to seagrass beds compared to other environments. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the polychaete community
   associated with the Thalassia beds in BAL, determine seasonal variation,
   and compare with the neighbouring hard bottom polychaete community in
   Mt. Irvine Bay (MIB). Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a 15
   cm diameter corer at a depth of 10 cm. Six stations were sampled during
   the wet and dry seasons of 2018. Samples were sieved in the field using
   a 0. 5 mm mesh screen. They were stained and preserved with a 10\%
   formalin-seawater mixture, sorted and macrofaunal species identified to
   the lowest possible taxonomic level. Thirty - one polychaete families
   were ranked according to trophic categories as described by Fauchald and
   Jumars (1979) and updated where possible. Average family density for the
   dry season was recorded at 206.89 +/- 307.53 ind/m(2) and 129.55 +/-
   227.23 ind/m(2) for the wet. Maldanidae and Syllidae recorded highest
   densities for dry and wet seasons respectively. Deposit feeders were the
   largest trophic group represented across both seasons in the BAL with
   Maldanidae being the most dominant. Carnivorous polychaetes dominated
   MIB with Syllidae being the most dominant. BAL showed higher diversity
   and richness compared to MIB. Based on functional traits of the
   community the environment at BAL can be regarded as healthy. This study
   establishes a much-needed baseline for future research and management of
   marine biodiversity in southwest Tobago.},

Abstract = {The spatial patterns of carbon pool in landscape vary greatly with
   variation of forest structures and climate conditions. In this field
   study, the carbon storage in overstory, understory, litter layer of
   plants and soil carbon in forests was investigated in 26-28 year-old
   Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) pure and mixed forests along a
   latitudinal gradient (20-30 degrees N) crossing Hunan and Guangxi
   provinces of China, during the period of May 2015-August 2017. We found
   that the total carbon storage in Masson pine forests ranged 88.92-149.41
   Mg/ha, of which 54.03\% occurred in aboveground compound and 45.97\%
   occurred belowground. The overall total carbon storage distribution was
   34.62-68.72 Mg/ha, 3.82-10.19 Mg/ha, 2.37-3.96 Mg/ha, and 6.06-12.08
   Mg/ha in stems, branches, leaves, and roots, respectively. The carbon
   storage in the overstory of forest stands and forest soils significantly
   decreased with increasing latitude, while the carbon storage in the
   understory and litter of the forest stands significantly increased as
   the latitude increased. `Ihe overall carbon storage significantly
   decreases by 8.26 Mg/ha in Masson pine forests as the latitude increased
   by one degree. The carbon storage increased by 8.43\% in Masson pine
   mixed forests compared to the pure forest stands after the
   transformation from the pure forest stands into the mixed forest stands
   similar to 15 years later. The results of changes in carbon storage in
   the studied forests with the latitudinal gradient could be attributed to
   variations in hydrothermal conditions with changing latitudes. The
   forest structure with different tree species composition was another
   important factor regulating carbon storage in forest ecosystems at the
   same latitude. The results provided a scientific basis for better
   understanding of latitudinal variation and spatial distribution of
   carbon storage in Masson pine forest stands with optimal forest stand
   structures in subtropical region of China.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric conditions play an important role in structuring avian
   communities in space and time. Here we assess the role of weather
   conditions on the distribution and abundance of the enigmatic glossy
   ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in Northeast Algeria in both wintering
   grounds and in breeding areas in a survey spanning from 2011 to 2019.
   During the study period, cooler years were wetter and warmer years were
   drier. The wintering population size in the region could be estimated to
   200-300 individuals. The number of individuals in wintering grounds
   increased in recent years in one site (Berrihane), but it did not show a
   strong association with weather conditions prior to wintering. Four
   breeding colonies were detected in highly-vegetated ponds with in-water
   trees where the number of breeding pairs was the highest. Extinction was
   recorded for two colonies (50\% of colonies) where one permanently
   disappeared and one exhibited a series of extinctions and
   recolonizations across years. The estimated colony size was larger at El
   Dakhla (60-105 pairs) than El Chatt (0-42 pairs), Fezara Lake (25-41
   pairs), and Tonga Lake (0-2 pairs). Climate conditions seemed to
   correlate with the number of pairs in one site (El Chatt) such that warm
   and dry years were associated with lower number of individuals. We
   discuss that disturbance and pollution might play a role in colony
   establishment but the number of pairs is positively related to the
   extinction of a nearby colony, suggesting that those refuge colonies are
   crucial for the persistence of the species in the area. This study
   presents historical data on the occurrence and abundance of a relatively
   unstudied species and gives new information on its climatic sensitivity
   which might be helpful for predicting future climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {The growth rate of the diameter of trees is significantly correlated
   with their age; therefore, a growth model can be established to predict
   the dynamics of the population. To reveal the relationship between
   individual age and diameters at breast height (DBH) of D. involucrata,
   five populations were chosen in the largest distribution area of D.
   involucrata in Sichuan province. Dendrochronology and regression model
   was used to evaluate the distribution of the DBH and its relationship
   with the age, respectively. All 130 D. involucrata trees recorded in the
   studied plots, with the minimum DBH of 3.8 cm, and the maximum of 45.5
   cm, corresponding to the minimum age of 4 years and the maximum age of
   98 years. The results showed that in the first 11 DBH classes (DBH < 22
   cm), the tree DBH increases relatively slowly with the growth of the
   age. After the 11th DBH class, the DBH class increases slowly with
   increasing tree age. The tree age exceeds 20 years, the increase in the
   DBH growth rates with tree age is similar among the five populations.
   The linear models were fitted to determine the regression equation for
   the DBH growth curve of D. involucrata, which can be well described by a
   parabolic model. Under normal forest stand development and growth
   conditions, the model can be widely applied to study the ages of
   individual D. involucrata.},

Title = {Allometry, biomass and productivity in Pinus massoniana forests of
   China: an updated review of published data},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Field measurements of forest biomass are labor-consuming and usually
   destructive, but such direct datasets are the foundation for further
   developing indirect estimation such as biomass equation and biomass
   expansion factors that were used to scale biomass estimation or carbon
   storage from site or local surveys up to regional or national level.
   Pinus massoniana is widely distributed throughout 17 provinces of China
   and has a high economic value. This study is an updated review of the
   allometric equations, biomass allocation data and productivity
   estimations in Pinus massoniana forests of China published in articles
   during the period from 1982 to 2019. Different allometric equations of
   Pinus massoniana showed site-specific dependences. The aboveground and
   total tree biomass were expressed as power equations of mean age for
   Pinus massoniana forests. The mean value of aboveground tree biomass,
   total tree biomass and ecosystem biomass across all ages for Masson pine
   forests was 109.81, 127.65 and 138.76 Mg/ha, respectively. The mean
   proportion of stem, branch and foliage to aboveground tree biomass for
   Pinus massoniana was 77.1\%, 15.9\% and 7\%, respectively. The tree root
   biomass continuously increased with the aboveground tree biomass and a
   power relationship was found between the tree root biomass and
   aboveground tree biomass for Pinus massoniana forests. The tree net
   primary productivity increased with aboveground tree biomass for Pinus
   massoniana forests, and the relationship was expressed as a linear
   equation. The mean tree, litter and ecosystem net primary productivity
   was 7.04, 4.88 and 8.30 Mg/ha/year, respectively. These findings provide
   key parameters for the biomass estimation and carbon accounting studies
   of widely planted Pinus massoniana forests in China.},

Abstract = {The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) is considered a key species
   for its role as an ecosystem engineer. Given their important ecological
   function, there is a great concern in the scientific community regarding
   the many reports of disappearances or great abundance reductions
   throughout its distribution (from southern Mexico to northern
   Argentina). Based on an extensive survey effort, we report new data of
   presence of WLP after a period of no detections in the Argentine Yungas.
   The study was conducted in the Yungas ecoregion, provinces of Jujuy and
   Salta, Argentina. Data was collected from camera trap, direct sightings
   and footprints during 2013-2021. From a total of 30,186 trap nights, we
   obtained 8 WLP detections. There were no detections before 2017, while
   as of 2018 there was at least one camera trap record in each of the
   years. Additionally, opportunistic records were obtained yearly from
   2019 to 2021. The period without detections could be related to a period
   of a population cycle, as suggested in different regions of America
   during the last century, being disease the most likely cause. These
   cycles generally follow a pattern of a rapid population decline, a
   period of absence or low abundance followed by slow population growth.
   We believe that if the trend continues and the number of detections
   increases, we could be facing the early stages of the increase phase in
   the WLP population cycle in the Argentine Yungas. This type of report is
   important to document and contribute to a better understanding of the
   WLP population cycle process.},

Abstract = {The upper Jejui River is a major tributary of the Paraguay River in
   eastern Paraguay and is the principal drainage for the Mbaracayu Forest
   Biosphere Reserve. Despite the international significance of the
   biosphere reserve and detailed documentation of its terrestrial fauna
   and flora, the fish fauna in its streams remains relatively unknown,
   with 48 species previously recorded. We sampled 35 sites within the
   biosphere reserve over five years (2007-2011) to assess the richness of
   its ichthyofauna. These surveys yielded a new total of 105 known species
   for the biosphere reserve, including two newly-recorded orders,
   Gymnotiformes and Cyprinodontiformes, and 14 newly-recorded families.
   Fish community composition resembled that of previously-reported fish
   communities from the Paraguay River drainage, with characiforms and
   siluriforms comprising the majority of the species (57.1\% and 31.4\%,
   respectively). Post hoc analyses showed significantly greater
   ichthyofaunal diversity at sites within the Mbaracayu Forest Nature
   Reserve, a core protected forest area within the biosphere reserve,
   compared to areas outside the nature reserve, suggesting a negative
   impact from deforestation and land conversion on fish assemblages in
   these headwater streams. Broad regional deforestation places greater
   emphasis on important management decisions that will protect current
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {In Northwest Argentina, nothing is known about the relationship of
   Araneae and Coleoptera with sugar cane crops. Using pitfall traps in
   three continuous native forest sites (N) and three native forest
   windbreaks surrounded by sugar cane crops (W) in the province of Salta,
   we assessed a)- whether the native diversity of epigeal Araneae and
   Coleoptera in the Chaco Serrano forest changes as a result of the
   fragmentation of the habitat caused by the sugar cane plots, and b)-
   whether the diversity of predatory species increases in native forest
   windbreaks as a consequence of the contribution of species that come
   from crops. In the spring of 2006 and the summer of 2007, we collected
   599 Araneae and 555 Coleoptera, with community W (S = 132, N = 535)
   containing much more species but fewer individuals than community N (S =
   111, N = 619). We found that the spatial and phenological patterns of
   the alpha and beta diversities of N were altered in W communities. Thus,
   habitat fragmentation generated by sugar cane plots led to the local
   extinction of native Araneae and Coleoptera species. The abundance of
   generalist Araneae and herbivorous Coleoptera increased in W habitats,
   but the coprophagous and detritivorous beetles decreased. The diversity
   of predatory species (Araneae and some Coleoptera) increased in W
   habitats, although their abundance declined relative to N habitats.
   Species turnover determined beta diversity between N and W sites;
   however, between the W sites, nestedness increased and spiders showed a
   greater loss of species. The spatial heterogeneity between sites,
   seasons, and habitats had a substantial effect on the composition of the
   Araneae and Coleoptera assemblages, hence influencing regional
   diversity. Eight species were habitat indicators, particularly
   Leprolochus birabeni (Zodariidae), which responds unfavourably to
   perturbations in the agricultural landscape, and could be deployed as
   environmental monitors in the Chaco Serrano.},

Abstract = {Cryphiops caementarius is an amphidromous freshwater prawn endemic to
   the basins of Peru and northern Chile, where its populations are
   strongly threatened by hydric and fishing overexploitation. Mortalities
   of C. caementarius caused by canalization and water extraction in the
   Choapa River Basin are reported during March 2020 in Tunga Norte
   (similar to 250 specimens) and January 2021 in Limahuida (similar to 300
   specimens). This situation was also reported in other basins in the
   Semiarid north of Chile during 2014 and 2018. These changes are related
   to the water crisis facing this country zone and reflects a mismatching
   in the water management in the face of the socio-economic development
   and native species conservation.},

Abstract = {We surveyed dragonflies (Odonata) at 87 sites in the anthropologically
   modified Pampa biome of southern Brazil to evaluate how regionally rare
   and common species form species assemblages in habitats with different
   water physiochemistry, habitat structures, and other environmental
   variables. We classified 9 out of the 90 species encountered as
   regionally common and 59 as regionally rare. A discriminant analysis
   confirmed that localities with only a few common species were
   characteristic in the set of rare species present, while localities
   housing more common species showed no clear pattern. A PCA revealed that
   a subset of the common species were strongly positively associated with
   water temperature, turbidity, dissolved O-2 and pH but negatively
   associated with desertification. In contrast, rare species were
   positively associated with grassland habitat, but negatively with
   agriculture, salinity, and conductivity. In general, the associations of
   the rare species were weaker than those of common species. Finally, a
   correlation suggested that sites with six or more common species present
   had a reduced number of rare species compared to sites with fewer common
   species. It is possible that common species reduce the available niche
   space for weaker competitors among the rare species. We conclude that
   the original species assemblages in the biome may have been species poor
   with few regionally common species. Current anthropogenic change has
   increased the number of common species, which in turn has negative
   effects on the survival possibilities of rare species.},

Abstract = {RESUMEN En este estudio, basandonos en evidencias morfologicas y
   moleculares, describimos una nueva especie del genero Pristimantis que
   habita en las montanas y valles aridos de la provincia del Azuay,
   incluyendo zonas urbanas y periurbanas de la ciudad de Cuenca. La nueva
   especie se destaca por presentar una textura dermal externa fuertemente
   granulada, una papilla proyectada en la punta del hocico y un canto de
   advertencia que consiste en series combinadas de tres y dos notas,
   Morfologicamente, la nueva especie es similar con P. cajamarcensis, P.
   ceuthospilus, P. jimenezi, P. lojanus, P. phoxocephalus y P torresi, por
   presentar una quilla en la punta del hocico, sin embargo, su textura
   dermal fuertemente granular, ausencia de tuberculos, y su coloracion
   rosacea con reticulaciones irregulares oscuras y una caracteristicas
   barra interorbital blanca, la distinguen de estas especies. Con P.
   cajamarcensis, P. ceuthopilus y otras dos especies con incertidumbre
   taxonomica, forma un clado distribuido en el sur de Ecuador y norte de
   Peru. Nuestros resultados resaltan la importancia de aumentar estudios
   taxonomicos a fin de documentar eficazmente la biodiversidad en la
   region andina, asi como, la importancia de desarrollar planes de
   monitoreo y conservacion que incluyan a especies que habitan en areas
   urbanas y semiurbanas.
   In this study, based on morphological and molecular evidence, we
   described a new species of the Pristimantis genus inhabiting the
   mountains and dry inter-Andean dry valleys in the Azuay province,
   including urban and semiurban areas in the city of Cuenca. The new
   species is characterized by coarsely granulated dermal texture, papillae
   in the tip of the snout, and an advertisement call consisting of a
   combined series of three and two notes. Morphologically, the new species
   is similar to P. cajamarcensis, P. ceuthospilus, P. jimenezi, P.
   lojanus, P. phoxocephalus, and P. torresi. However, it can be
   differentiated from this species by its dermal texture, absence of
   tubercles in the dorsum, and its pinkish-brown coloration with dark
   irregular reticulations and the interorbital white stripe. The new
   species forms a strongly supported clade distributed in southern Ecuador
   and northern Peru with P. cajamarcensis, P. ceuthopilus, and two other
   Pristimantis with taxonomic uncertainty. Our results highlight the
   importance of taxonomic studies to document the biodiversity in the
   Andean region and to develop monitoring and conservation plans that
   include species that inhabit urban and semi-urban areas.},

Abstract = {Advancements in biologging technology allow terabytes of data to be
   collected that record the location of individuals but also their
   direction, speed and acceleration. These multi-stream data sets allow
   researchers to infer movement and behavioural patterns at high
   spatiotemporal resolutions and in turn quantify fine-scale changes in
   state along with likely ecological causes and consequences. The scope
   offered by such data sets is increasing and there is potential to gain
   unique insights into a suite of ecological and life history phenomena.
   We use multi-stream data from global positioning system (GPS) and
   accelerometer (ACC) devices to quantify breeding events remotely in an
   Arctic breeding goose. From a training set of known breeders we
   determine the movement and overall dynamic body acceleration patterns
   indicative of incubation and use these to classify breeding events in
   individuals with unknown reproductive status. Given that researchers are
   often constrained by the amount of biologging data they can collect due
   to device weights, we carry out a sensitivity analysis. Here we explore
   the relative merits of GPS vs ACC data and how varying the temporal
   resolution of the data affects the accuracy of classifying incubation
   for birds. Classifier accuracy deteriorates as the temporal resolution
   of GPS and ACC are reduced but the reduction in precision (false
   positive rate) is larger in comparison to recall (false negative rate).
   Precision fell to 94.5\%, whereas recall didn't fall below 98\% over all
   sampling schedules tested. Our data set could have been reduced by
   c.95\% while maintaining precision and recall > 98\%. The GPS-only
   classifier generally outperformed the ACC-only classifier across all
   accuracy metrics but both performed worse than the combined GPS and ACC
   classifier. GPS and ACC data can be used to reconstruct breeding events
   remotely, allowing unbiased, 24-h monitoring of individuals. Our
   resampling-based sensitivity analysis of classifier accuracy has
   important implications with regards to both device design and sampling
   schedules for study systems, where device size is constrained. It will
   allow researchers with similar aims to optimize device battery, memory
   usage and lifespan to maximise the ability to correctly quantify life
   history events.},

Title = {Detection range of two acoustic transmitters in four reservoir habitat

Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background Recently, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks
   (SDGFP), has undertaken a suite of rigorous acoustic telemetry studies.
   The goals and scope of the individual research projects vary but all use
   the same receiver array throughout Lake Sharpe in central South Dakota.
   Prior to initiating the telemetry studies, we sought to describe the
   detection probability of receivers from a representation of habitats
   within Lake Sharpe, South Dakota. We used both a V9-2H transmitter and a
   V13-1L transmitter in combination with VR2W 69 kHz passive receivers
   {[}all from Innovasea (Vemco)] to determine detection probability in
   four novel habitats of Lake Sharpe. Both transmitter and receiver were
   moored at fixed distances (200 m 400, and 600 m) for multiple
   consecutive days and detection probability compared between transmitter
   type, distance, site, and diel period using ANOVA following arcsine
   square-root transformation. Results We found significant differences in
   detection probability between the four habitat types for both the V9 and
   V13 transmitters. Sites protected from wind and wave action, and with
   little boat traffic, had larger detection ranges compared to areas that
   were wind exposed and host more boat traffic. The site immediately
   downstream from a hydroelectric dam that is exposed to both high wind
   fetch and is popular for boating, exhibited the poorest detection
   probability at all distances for both transmitter types. V13
   transmitters consistently exhibited greater detection probability
   relative to V9 transmitters and this difference was greater at further
   distances. In general, detection probability was higher at nighttime
   compared to daytime and these differences were significant dependent on
   transmitter, site, and distance. Conclusions Using the information
   presented, SDGFP has modified their receiver array to maximize the
   ability to detect acoustic transmitters in the novel habitats of Lake
   Sharpe. Specifically, receiver spacing was reduced and/or expanded
   dependent on the distance, where 50\% detection probability was
   attained. More work is needed to identify those factors that influence
   detection probability of acoustic telemetry systems.},

Title = {Dispersal and seasonal movements of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus

Abstract = {Background Understanding connectivity is critical to the management of
   exploited fish stocks, but migratory dynamics of Pacific halibut
   (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region
   are not well-understood. In the current study, 145 Pacific halibut >= 82
   cm fork length were tagged with Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) tags
   to evaluate interannual dispersal, seasonal migration, and
   depth-specific habitat use. Results Endpoint locations obtained after 1
   year at liberty (n = 79), fishery recoveries after 2-3 years at liberty
   (n = 5), and at-liberty geopositions based on light data (n = 5313
   estimates from 109 fish) indicated geographically distinct movement
   patterns: Pacific halibut tagged in the Western and Central Aleutian
   Islands remained within the island groups in which the fish had been
   tagged; fish in the eastern Bering Sea remained in that ocean basin,
   moving among International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) regulatory
   areas and into Russian waters; those tagged south of Unimak Pass in IPHC
   Regulatory Area 4A displayed the greatest amount of emigration,
   dispersing eastward both seasonally and interannually to as far south as
   Washington State. Analysis of daily maximum depth and temperature data
   from 113 individuals demonstrated group-level variation in summer
   temperatures experienced by the fish and in the timing, duration, and
   synchrony of movement to deep-water wintering grounds. Conclusions
   Depth-specific habitat use was suggestive of regionally explicit
   migratory contingents, while interannual dispersal patterns were
   consistent with the existence of multiple functional spawning units. The
   results may guide future research to examine cross-basin connectivity in
   the Northern Bering Sea and provide inputs for numerical modelling of
   individual movements, larval advection, and recruitment analyses.},

Title = {Eavesdropping on the brain at sea: development of a surface-mounted
   system to detect weak electrophysiological signals from wild animals},

Abstract = {Despite rapid advances in sensor development and technological
   miniaturization, it remains challenging to non-invasively record
   small-amplitude electrophysiological signals from an animal in its
   natural environment. Many advances in ecophysiology and biologging have
   arisen through sleep studies, which rely on detecting small signals over
   multiple days and minimal disruption of natural animal behavior. This
   paper describes the development of a surface-mounted system that has
   allowed novel electrophysiological recordings of sleep in wild marine
   mammals. We discuss our iterative design process by providing
   sensor-comparison data, detailed technical illustrations, and material
   recommendations. We describe the system's performance over multiple days
   in 12 freely moving northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris)
   sleeping on land and in water in captivity and the wild. We leverage
   advances in signal processing by applying independent components
   analysis and inertial motion sensor calibrations to maximize signal
   quality across large (> 10 gigabyte), multi-day datasets. Our study adds
   to the suite of biologging tools available to scientists seeking to
   understand the physiology and behavior of wild animals in the context in
   which they evolved.},

Title = {Alternative measurement systems for recording cardiac activity in
   animals: a pilot study},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Monitoring and assessing cardiac activity in animals, especially heart
   rate variability, has been gaining importance in the last few years as
   an indicator of animal health, well-being and physical condition. This
   pilot study tested the sensors based on ballistocardiography sensing the
   mechanical vibrations caused by the animal's cardiovascular system,
   which have proved useful in measuring cardiac activity in humans. To
   verify the accuracy of these measurement systems, the conventional
   measurements based on electrocardiography were carried out and the
   outcomes were compared. The main objectives were to verify the
   suitability of these sensors in measuring cardiac activity in animals,
   to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these sensors, and to
   identify future challenges. Measurements were performed on various
   animals, specifically a goat, a cow, a horse, and a sheep.
   Electrocardiographic measurement, which has demonstrated high accuracy
   in procedures for animals, was used as the study's gold standard. A
   disadvantage of this method, however, is the long time required to
   prepare animals and shear spots to attach electrodes. The accuracy of a
   ballistocardiographic sensor was compared to reference
   electrocardiographic signals based on Bland-Altman plots which analysed
   the current heart rate values. Unfortunately, the ballistocardiographic
   sensor was highly prone to poor adhesion to the animal's body, sensor
   movement when the animal was restless, and motion artefacts.
   Ballistocardiographic sensors were shown only to be effective with
   larger animals, i.e., the horse and the cow, the size of these animals
   allowing sufficient contact of the sensor with the animal's body.
   However, this method's most significant advantage over the conventional
   method based on electrocardiography is lower preparation time, since
   there is no need for precise and time-demanding fixation of the sensor
   itself and the necessity of shaving the animal's body.},

Title = {Validation of indwelling vaginal sensor to monitor body temperature in
   ewes},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Remote-sensing technology facilitates longitudinal collection of body
   temperature during periods of hot or cold environmental stress without
   human interference, producing high-frequency measurements whilst
   reducing labour and stress to the animal. A pilot study was conducted to
   validate an improved, minimally invasive method for the continual
   measurement of vaginal temperature (VT) in female sheep. A silicon mould
   of a modified controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device (Zoetis
   Animal Health, Parsippany), was manufactured to securely house a
   temperature logger (Micro-T 16-bit; Star Oddi, Iceland) and allow direct
   contact at the collection site. These temperature-sensing CIDR devices
   were validated against manual rectal temperature (RT) measurements
   collected from 15 mature, non-pregnant, non-lactating Merino ewes.
   Rectal temperature was measured from each individual, six times per day
   in 2-h intervals for 14 consecutive days. The simultaneous measures of
   VT and RT did not differ significantly within each ewe (P > 0.05) and
   demonstrated a moderate linear relationship (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.05). The
   mean (+/- SEM) difference between RT and VT was small (0.010 +/- 0.004
   degrees C), with a 95\% confidence interval of - 0.26 to 0.29 degrees C.
   Additionally, the coefficient of variation was lower on average for VT
   (0.49\%) compared to RT (0.59\%). Differences among paired readings were
   likely due to interval variation as well as penetration depth, air
   influx and faecal temperature when collecting RT. The initial silicone
   manufacturing costs were high (2200 AUD), with each unit costing 1.25
   (AUD) thereafter; however, the temperature-sensing CIDR device was an
   effective and efficient research tool for the remote monitoring of body
   temperature. While further validation of these devices within extensive
   grazing environments is warranted, the collection and analysis of
   longitudinal physiological data from ewes has the potential to improve a
   variety of management aspects related to extensively grazed ewes
   maintained and joined in harsh conditions.},

Abstract = {Dwarf caimans (Alligatoridae: Paleosuchus palpebrosus and Paleosuchus
   trigonatus), are small crocodilians exhibiting cryptic behaviour and
   complex habitat use that occur throughout the Amazon region. Our goals
   were to evaluate individual home range, habitat occupancy and movement
   patterns where they occur in sympatry in relation to seasonal
   water-level variation. We tracked five P. palpebrosus and seven P.
   trigonatus using VHS radio transmitters along the shores of two streams
   directly influenced by the flooding pulse of the Purus River.
   Paleosuchus palpebrosus individuals moved greater distances on a daily
   basis and had larger home ranges than P. trigonatus, and the species had
   different responses to increases in water levels. Paleosuchus
   palpebrosus moved into flooded forests, as do their principle prey
   species. Conversely, larger P. trigonatus individuals usually remained
   near the main stream, and were relatively sedentary. Intraspecific
   home-range overlap was higher than interspecific overlap in both
   species. Thus, habitat occupancy patterns as a function of water-level
   variation might facilitate coexistence of the two species of dwarf
   caimans in the same location. This study shows that when living in
   sympatry under a seasonal flooding regime, Paleosuchus species show a
   degree of habitat partitioning evidenced by different daily movement
   rates, home-range sizes and home-range locations.},

Abstract = {Fire-induced effects on biota activity and diversity, and soil
   attributes, could have implications for biodiversity conservation and
   recovery of semiarid grassland ecosystems. Here, we examined the
   abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, and soil
   attributes in burned and unburned grasslands in the semiarid Nanhuashan
   Natural Reserve in western Loess Plateau of China. Arthropods and soil
   were sampled in springtime one year after fire disturbance. We found no
   significant differences in total abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods
   between burned and unburned grasslands. However, the taxonomic richness
   and the Shannon index of ground-dwelling arthropods were found to be
   significantly greater in burned than unburned grasslands. Postfire
   effects also indicated significant differences in dominance hierarchy
   among taxa within functional groups as a consequence of increasing
   predatory abundance but decreasing phytophagous one from unburned to
   burned grasslands. Likewise, soil bulk density declined, whereas soil
   C/N increased significantly from unburned to burned grasslands. In
   conclusion, fire could promote the taxonomic richness and the diversity
   of ground-dwelling arthropods, thus being indicators of positive effect
   of fire disturbance on biodiversity conservation of semiarid grassland
   ecosystems of northwestern China. However, soil bulk density and soil
   C/N could be susceptible to fire-driven changes of soil attributes.},

Abstract = {The anadromous alewife is a commercially fished clupeid in Atlantic
   Canada, whose oceanic migration is poorly understood. Migration of
   alewives is presently investigated from the lower reaches of Gaspereau
   River into Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy. Seventy-five post-spawning adults
   were tagged on their downstream migration; within two days of being
   tagged, most alewives had left Gaspereau River and 57 entered into the
   Southern Bight of Minas Basin. Thirty-one alewives were detected in
   Minas Passage and their average time from tagging to final detection was
   28 days with standard deviation of 11 days. None of the alewives were
   detected in Minas Passage until day 20 after the start of tagging. After
   day 20, the residence timescale in Minas Basin was only 8.8 days with
   95\% CI of 8.4-9.3 days. Fast tidal currents prevail in much of the
   study area, and alewives travelled many large tidal excursions in Minas
   Basin and Minas Passage. Separation distances between pairs of alewives
   increased greatly after day 20, indicating tidal mixing over large
   distances within the study area. Offshore movement was associated with
   seasonal warming, with alewives moving down the spatial temperature
   gradient and into deeper waters. Offshore, larger tidal displacements
   widely dispersed tagged alewives through Minas Basin and to Minas
   Passage. During transit of Gaspereau River, 18 +/- 2 alewives were lost
   with corroborating evidence of mortality for 4 of these. By day 20, the
   apparent mortality within Minas Basin was <= 10 alewives. Individual
   alewives were observed to make many transits through Minas Passage
   during their migration, where they may become exposed to in-stream tidal
   turbines.},

Abstract = {Studies on the quantification and spatial distribution of stored carbon,
   as well as the potential for carbon uptake by forests, are of great
   importance. We assessed the spatial distribution and dynamic of carbon
   in forest plots in the Middle Xingu. These plots are part of the
   vegetation monitoring area of the Belo Monte Dam. We estimated the
   biomass of trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 10 cm using an
   allometric equation with forest inventory data in the eastern Amazonian
   region in the Xingu River area. We evaluated the vegetation structure
   and carbon stock dynamic in 2012, 2014, and 2016, and temporal effects
   on carbon uptake. The periodic annual increase in carbon was
   significantly higher between 2012 and 2014 (2.5 Mg ha(-1)) than between
   2014 and 2016 (1.84 Mg ha(-1)). Plant biomass was highly influenced by
   the abundance of species with low diameters (between 10 cm and 50 cm
   DBH). Despite the mortality rate being higher than the recruitment in
   the second period (2014-2016), we found that the forest did function as
   a carbon sink but showing increases in carbon emissions.},

Abstract = {Lead (Pb) has generated a worldwide concern for its genotoxic effects on
   human health, and its ability to be bioaccumulative in ecosystems, but
   nevertheless, there are no estimates of wildlife from terrestrial
   habitats in Ecuador. Our objective was to determine the concentration of
   Pb in soft and bone tissues from bats species collected in areas with
   urban influence in Guayas province, western Ecuador. The specimens were
   collected with mist nets, manual capture from animals found dead or
   dying in the streets, and museological collections. We applied
   Mann-Whitney U test to analyze differences between males and females,
   and between guilds. 66 chiropterans were analyzed, distributed in 14
   species, where 98.5\% presented Pb in its body. The nectarivore guild
   showed highest Pb concentrations than insectivores and frugivores. In
   the analysis of sexes, no significant differences were found in soft
   tissue of Glossophaga soricina, Artibeus lituratus, A. aequatorialis and
   Molossus molossus. Museological samples made possible to detect Pb in
   several synanthropic species. Finally, Pb should be considered an
   emerging threat for bats due its possible genotoxic effects over
   populations.},

Title = {Potential distribution of five native grass species in northern Mexico

Abstract = {Grasslands are recognized as the most threatened communities on the
   planet due to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances. In the state
   of Chihuahua, Mexico, native grasslands have a great ecological
   importance due to their wide distribution; however, studies on the
   current and future potential distributions of grasslands, as well as
   their temporal dynamics based on climatic variability, are lacking.
   `thus, we analysed the potential distribution of five native grasses
   (Bouteloua curtipendula, Bouteloua gracilis, Leptochloa dubia, Digitaria
   californica and Setaria macrostachya) based on climatic factors. The
   present data of these species were consulted at the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility (GBIF) and recorded with location information:
   latitude and longitude. This database was complemented with presence
   data of the five species from previous studies. To characterize the
   climate niche, the values of the climatic factors at the locations of
   the species presence, were obtained from the World-Clim. Then, current
   and future potential distributions of these native species, were
   generated based on three climate change scenarios, based on
   Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0). Under
   the RCP2.6 scenario, the estimated area of S. macrostachya was 12,525.5
   ha, representing 7.4\% of the state. For B. gracilis, the potential
   areas under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios were 20,391.49 and 23,079.08
   ha, respectively. B. curtipendula represented the smallest area, with
   4.6\% under the scenario RCP2.6. The distribution of grassland species
   in northern Mexico is mainly determined by climatic factors; as it may
   apply for the rest of the grassland species within this area, so those
   results could increase our knowledge about their potential distribution.},

Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We provide the first records of possible conspecific brood parasitism in
   the lesser whitethroat Sylvia curruca and the common linnet Linaria
   cannabina, two species of small passerines. In 2018 we found two
   unusually large clutches, one for each species (8 and 9 eggs,
   respectively), both containing two distinct egg morphs differing in
   coloration. Further detailed analysis of egg morphology and brood
   phonology (in the whitethroat) suggested that the eggs in each nest had
   been laid by different females. Surprisingly, two seemingly full sized
   clutches were laid in both nests, a pattern that is unusual in
   conspecific brood parasitism in passerines, whose nests are typically
   parasitized with single eggs. Alternatives to conspecific brood
   parasitism are therefore discussed. We argue that traditional
   field-based methods, when carefully used, may be sufficient to document
   brood parasitism recorded during occasional observations. We finally
   conclude that enlarged broods, resulting from conspecific brood
   parasitism, are probably more frequent than expected, but they may be
   often overlooked.},

Abstract = {Fire has major impact on species diversity in natural ecosystems around
   the world. The consequences of fires for invertebrates can be immediate,
   and recovery of species assemblages may be a long-term process. We
   recorded moth communities from May to November 2019 in a pine forest in
   Western Bohemia, Czech Republic, where a local fire occurred in April of
   that year. We used UV light traps at one burned site and two neighboring
   unburned sites with a similar character as the burned site before the
   fire event. We analyzed moth assemblages using several species diversity
   indices - index of dominance, Shannon-Wiener index and Shannon- Wiener
   evenness, Simpson index, and Chao1 non-parametric estimation. We
   detected 67 species at the burned site, and 97 and 106 at the unburned
   sites. The three most frequently trapped species at all sites were
   Macaria liturata, Buphalus piniaria and Thera obeliscata, representing
   common forest geometrid moths. We observed a decline in species number
   and abundance at the burned site compared to the unburned sites,
   probably due to the direct mortality of larvae. On the contrary, the
   burned site was more diverse according to the diversity indices. The
   fire disrupted the original character of the coniferous forest, which
   was proved by a decline of species feeding on conifers and Vaccinium
   spp. The burned site attracted species associated with dry habitats such
   as Eublemma purpurina, Charissa obscurata and Scopula rubiginata. Even
   though wildfires are viewed negatively in general, they might
   temporarily enhance diversity in a homogeneous landscape.},

Title = {An update of the geographical distribution of Hylodes pipilans (Canedo

Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is hotspot for conservation
   priorities due to the high concentration and maintenance of
   biodiversity, comprising more than 600 species of amphibians, of which
   88\% are endemic to this biome. Many of these species are under some
   level of threat, especially those with restricted distributions to
   mountainous regions. Hylodes is the most speciose genus within
   Hylodidae, housing 26 recognized species of the diurnal frogs related to
   streams of forest massifs in the BAF. Hylodes pipilans is endemic to the
   state of Rio de Janeiro, considered restricted to the Serra do Orgaos
   mountains. Here, we updated its records based on fieldwork, bioacoustics
   analysis, and museum data, enhancing the species distribution
   comprehension. Additionally, we evaluate its occurrence inside of
   protected areas, updating information to subsidize conservation actions
   for this poorly known Torrent frog. We recorded individuals of H.
   pipilans in Parque Nacional da Serra dos Orgaos and Reserva Biologica do
   Tingua. The vocalizations analyzed were compatible with the bioacoustics
   traits of H. pipilans. Its distribution covers part of six
   municipalities in the Serra dos Orgaos Mountain range, northern portion
   of Serra do Mar, between 245 and 814 meters above sea level. The new
   record to the Reserva Biologica do Tingua is the species southernmost
   record. Despite the previous assessment on the conservation status of H.
   pipilans suggest as a least concern species, little is known about its
   occurrence extension, occupancy area, population trends, and ecological
   information. Thus, the present study is particularly important to
   enhance the understanding of altitudinal and geographic distribution
   range for H. pipilans. These will assist in the species conservation
   status reassessment.},

Title = {Natural history of Odonata assemblages in tropical streams in Puerto

Abstract = {Freshwater macroinvertebrates play an important role in maintaining
   stream food webs. Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are important
   top predators in these communities and serve as indicators of stream
   health. Our understanding of odonate assemblages is limited in the
   Caribbean and the natural history of most odonate species in the region
   remains unknown. The focus of this research is to study the natural
   history of odonate species in headwater montane streams following major
   hurricane impacts in Puerto Rico. We monitored assemblages from August
   2018 to July 2019 in two headwater streams within El Yunque National
   Forest, Puerto Rico. The study streams drain a protected forest, with
   aseasonal precipitation patterns, relatively constant water temperature,
   and flashy hydrographs that quickly respond to rain events. We sampled
   226 adults and 550 larvae, dominated by three Caribbean endemics:
   Scapanea frontalis, Macrothemis celeno, and Telebasis vulnerata. Only S.
   frontalis and M. celeno were abundant enough to assess the temporal
   patterns and their natural history. Larval density fluctuated throughout
   the year with short peaks in abundance during different times of the
   year, according to the species. Small individuals (<= 10 mm body length)
   were more abundant than the large ones. However, all size classes were
   present during the year. The dominant species, S. frontalis and M.
   celeno, had continuous development patterns, without identifiable size
   classes and multiple overlapping generations. The exception was the last
   stadium that formed a separate group in the body length vs head width
   plots. Species had clear habitat preferences; S. frontalis was abundant
   in riffles and preferred areas with high amounts of cobble. Macrothemis
   celeno prefers pool habitats with fine substrates. While we found trends
   for negative relations between abundance and discharge, canopy cover,
   water temperature, and rainfall, none was statistically significant.
   Observed patterns suggest a lack of strong temporal seasonality in the
   natural history of Odonata, which coincides with the aseasonal
   environment of streams draining our study area. Overall, our study is
   the first to assess temporal variability of Odonata assemblages in
   montane streams of Puerto Rico and provides information on Caribbean
   endemic species.},

   Salamander (Ambystoma amblycephalum), a micro-endemic axolotl from
   Mexico scientifically confirmed only once since its original description
   in 1940, and now presumably extinct. In 2018, paedomorphic and
   metamorphosed adults, as well as clutches and larvae, were found in a
   cattle pond at Nahuatzen, Michoacan state, Mexico, similar to 60 km away
   from the type locality (Tacicuaro). Morphometric comparisons suggested
   high similarity with the type series of A. amblycephalum, while
   mitochondrial DNA barcoding (16S and control region) revealed close (but
   imperfect) matching to a reference sequence. We gathered data on life
   history and ecology of this population, which could be the only extant
   relic of A. amblycephalum. Its highly limited distribution and
   presumably low population density are hallmarks for a high risk of
   extinction, and alarms on the critical situation of many micro-endemic
   salamanders of Mexico, hence calling for immediate conservation actions.},

Title = {Macroinvertebrates' response to different land use in lowland streams
   from Uruguay: use of artificial substrates for biomonitoring},

Abstract = {The use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality is an
   effective and low-cost tool, which is widely implemented in
   biomonitoring programmes. Certain taxa are characteristic of impaired
   watercourses (e.g. Oligochaeta, Chironomidae and Amphipoda), while
   others are characteristic of good-quality watercourses (e.g.
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera; EPT). In this work, we
   evaluated the response of the macroinvertebrate assemblages to different
   land uses. For this purpose, artificial substrate colonization
   experiments were conducted in streams including urban (U, n = 3),
   intensive agriculture and dairy production (AD, n = 4) and extensive
   cattle ranching (CR, n = 4) land uses. Because in Uruguay pristine
   ecosystems are practically non-existent and streams of low order streams
   associated with extensive cattle production represent the lowest
   deterioration water quality condition, CR sites were used as control
   reference streams. Physicochemical water parameters were measured. For
   macroinvertebrate sampling, 10 artificial substrates were installed in
   each stream. A total of 110 artificial substrates were analysed. Each
   sample/site consisted of a plastic mesh bag of 1.2 cm opening, which
   were filled with 160 cm(3) (including 73.3 +/- 5.8 cm(3) interstitial
   water) of stones sieved between 1.3 and 1.5 cm. During the summer of
   2018 (February), devices were left in streams for 15 days for
   communities to colonize them. U and AD land use represented the
   stressors with the highest impact on the attributes and composition of
   the macroinvertebrate communities. Abundance of EPT was higher in CR,
   meanwhile Caenogastropoda dominated in AD, and Amphipoda in U sites.
   Macroinvertebrate groups to order level classification were able to
   effectively discriminate between different land uses. The use of
   artificial substrate also demonstrated to be efficient method for
   monitoring macroinvertebrate community. We did not find a correlation
   between the physicochemical water parameters and the macroinvertebrate
   community. In this context, we propose a rapid and cost-effective
   biomonitoring approach, capable of estimating the degree of impact of
   different land uses.},

Abstract = {Background Recent declines of honeybees and simplifications of wild bee
   communities, at least partly attributed to changes of agricultural
   landscapes, have worried both the public and the scientific community.
   To understand how wild and managed bees respond to landscape structure
   it is essential to investigate their spatial use of foraging habitats.
   However, such studies are challenging since the foraging behaviour of
   bees differs between species and can be highly dynamic. Consequently,
   the necessary data collection is laborious using conventional methods
   and there is a need for novel methods that allow for automated and
   continuous monitoring of bees. In this work, we deployed an
   entomological lidar in a homogenous white clover seed crop and profiled
   the activity of honeybees and other ambient insects in relation to a
   cluster of beehives. Results In total, 566,609 insect observations were
   recorded by the lidar. The total measured range distribution was
   separated into three groups, out of which two were centered around the
   beehives and considered to be honeybees, while the remaining group was
   considered to be wild insects. The validity of this model in separating
   honeybees from wild insects was verified by the average wing modulation
   frequency spectra in the dominating range interval for each group. The
   temporal variation in measured activity of the assumed honeybee
   observations was well correlated with honeybee activity indirectly
   estimated using hive scales as well as directly observed using transect
   counts. Additional insight regarding the three-dimensional distribution
   of bees close to the hive was provided by alternating the beam between
   two heights, revealing a ``funnel like{''} distribution around the
   beehives, widening with height. Conclusions We demonstrate how lidar can
   record very high numbers of insects during a short time period. In this
   work, a spatial model, derived from the detection limit of the lidar and
   two Gaussian distributions of honeybees centered around their hives was
   sufficient to reproduce the observations of honeybees and background
   insects. This methodology can in the future provide valuable new
   information on how external factors influence pollination services and
   foraging habitat selection and range of both managed bees and wild
   pollinators.},

Title = {Depth-based geolocation processing of multi-year striped marlin archival
   tag data reveals residency in the Eastern Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background The first successful application of implanted archival tags
   on striped marlin showed great potential in obtaining long-term tracks
   for an improved understanding of movement ecology, which is important
   for informing fisheries management decisions. Ten tags were physically
   recovered from fish tagged in the Eastern Pacific between 2008 and 2016,
   but unfortunately due to the failure of the external sensor stalk which
   houses the light sensor, full records of daily fish position could not
   be attained. Results Depth-based geolocation, which exploits the diel
   swimming patterns of striped marlin, was applied to derive position
   estimates for archival tagged fish up to 7.7 years. Reconstructed tracks
   revealed tagged striped marlin remained in the Eastern Pacific
   throughout the tracked duration. Trans-equatorial movements were also
   documented for the first time for striped marlin in this region, as were
   extended occupancy of > 1 year in pelagic waters. Conclusions Striped
   marlin connected both coastal and offshore habitats with seasonal runs,
   likely in fulfillment of their life history requirements from foraging
   to reproduction. Circadian rhythms in billfish and other pelagic fishes
   are well-established, and could provide a viable, alternative means to
   position an individual in a low or no light environment, and situations
   with sub-optimal or limited bio-logging capabilities. Depth-based
   geolocation, however rudimentary, has revealed variability in striped
   marlin horizontal movements over the multi-year observation period, and
   offered a unique spatiotemporal perspective that was unavailable to
   scientists and fisheries managers until now.},

Title = {Mutualism between Lasius ant species and Stomaphis aphids in relation to
   social parasitism among the ants},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ant species Lasius (Lasius) brunneus (Latr.) and L. (Dendrolasius)
   fuliginosus (Latr.) are known mutualists of the myrmecophilous giant
   tree aphids of the genus Stomaphis Walk. Species of the Lasius subgenus
   Chthonolasius Ruzs., which live cryptically underground, have not been
   considered regular mutualists of those aphids. They often nest close to
   the known mutualists with which they are through their mutual colony
   developments intimately interrelated - as temporary social parasites of
   L. brunneus or temporary hosts of L. fuliginosus. Such a constellation
   raises the question about contacts of L. (Chthonolasius) species with
   Stomaphis aphids. Here, we describe modes of interaction between L.
   (Chthonolasius) umbratus (Nyl.) and S. graffii Cholod. which is usually
   hosted by L. (L.) brunneus. Our field data from Poland and elsewhere in
   Europe, together with published information, support our view that also
   L. (Ch.) umbratus and other underground-living species of the subgenus
   Chthonolasius are true mutualists of Stomaphis which take care of the
   aphids. Such ants differ by their protective behaviour from ants which
   prey on or only exploit aphids. The co-occurrence of L. (Chthonolasius)
   species with Stomaphis aphids has hitherto been relatively rarely
   reported, which probably is due to the cryptic lifestyle of these ants.
   We discuss the complex interrelations among the above Lasius F. species
   which belong to separate levels of social parasitism, and their
   relations with Stomaphis aphids. We also suggest that L. (Chthonolasius)
   species, which in the socially-parasitic hierarchy are located between
   Lasius s. str. and L. (Dendrolasius), may serve as transmitters of
   Stomaphis aphids from the former to the latter species.},

Title = {First insights into the movements and vertical habitat use of blue
   marlin (Makaira nigricans) in the eastern North Atlantic},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Background The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) is a vulnerable migratory
   fish inhabiting tropical and subtropical pelagic waters of the Atlantic,
   Pacific and Indian Oceans. The biology and spatial ecology of the
   species in the eastern North Atlantic is poorly understood, despite
   being exploited in the region by recreational and commercial fisheries.
   Here, we present results of the first study to use pop-up satellite
   archival tags to track blue marlin off Madeira, Portugal (n = 3) and
   obtain insights into the movements and habitat use of the species within
   the eastern North Atlantic. Results Blue marlin were tracked for 24 to
   83 days, moving from Madeira to pelagic waters off the Canary Islands,
   Cape Verde Islands, as well as along the continental shelf brake of
   Europe and Africa. Blue marlin spent 71\% of their time in the upper 5 m
   and 89\% in the upper 50 m, though all individuals dived to depths over
   200 m (maximum: 336 m). Temperature at depth ranged from 12 to 28.6
   degrees C, but the greatest proportion of time was spent in waters
   between 20 and 26 degrees C. Detailed depth and temperature time-series
   data were obtained from a tag recovered eight years later. These data
   show clear diel differences in depth use, involving consistent use of
   the surface at night and deeper dive activity during the day,
   predominately to depths greater than 50 m. Conclusions The highly
   migratory patterns of this vulnerable species in the eastern North
   Atlantic highlights the need for both local and international
   conservation measures. Depth-use patterns, particularly the high usage
   of the upper 5 m of the water column, make them susceptible to surface
   longline fisheries.},

Title = {Integrating biochemical and behavioral approaches to develop a bait to

Abstract = {It is estimated that more than 500 species of insects have been
   introduced to the Galapagos Islands via human activities. One of these
   insect invaders is the yellow paper wasp, Polistes versicolor (Olivier)
   (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), a social wasp native to continental South
   America. In Galapagos, these wasps are voracious predators of insect
   larvae, compete with native species for insect prey or for floral
   resources and are a human nuisance. Wasp suppression methods currently
   in use are inefficient and attract non-target species, calling for the
   development of species-specific attractants that can be used in baits to
   lure and kill wasps. To evaluate the potential for using wasp
   semiochemicals in baits, we determined the biochemical composition of
   the head, thorax, Dufour's and venom glands of P. versicolor foragers
   via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Male and female wasps
   were tested for behavioral responses to body segment extracts from both
   sexes. Female body extracts consistently elicited more behavioral
   responses in both male and female wasps than male extracts. Females
   reacted to female head, thorax and abdomen (the Dufour's and venom
   glands are located in the abdomen) extracts, whereas males reacted
   significantly to female head and thorax extracts. One male body extract,
   the head, elicited two significant behaviors: female wasps groomed more
   often, and males touched the filter paper more often compared to the
   blank control. Head extracts consistently changed the behavior of female
   and male wasps and, together with female thorax extracts, have potential
   as species-specific lures for yellow paper wasps. Heads were mainly
   composed of hydrocarbon lipids and oleamide, a ligand for
   odorant-binding proteins. The thorax consisted of fatty aldehydes,
   long-chain alkanes and fatty amide lipids. Field trials of blends of
   these compounds in high wasp density areas of Galapagos are the next
   step to confirm if any of these compounds are attractive to P.
   versicolor.

Abstract = {High Andean ponds and reservoirs are among the least-studied
   environments. We evaluated the composition of littoral macrobenthos and
   how it is affected by the physicochemical conditions of the water in El
   Pane reservoir (Peru), located at 4,550 m.a.s.l. Samples were taken
   between November 2017 and October 2018 from three zones in the
   reservoir: low (downstream), middle and high (upstream); two of these
   zones with fish farms (low and middle) and one zone without fish farms
   (high). The following physicochemical parameters of the water were
   measured: dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature. The
   macrobenthic community was analysed through diversity indices such as
   Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson's dominance index (D), Pielou's evenness
   (J'), true diversity (D-1), and richness (S). The influence of the
   physicochemical variables on the macrobenthos was estimated by canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling
   (NMDS). Dissolved oxygen was found to have lower values (<0.5 mg/l) than
   specified in the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS).
   Macroinvertebrate richness for the whole reservoir was 17 families, and
   the family with highest relative abundance was Chironomidae (42.24\% in
   the low zone, 51\% in the middle zone and 40.43\% in the high zone). The
   indices showed greater species richness in the high zone, where there
   are no fish farms. Dissolved oxygen and conductivity were the main
   factors determining macrobenthos distribution and composition.},

Abstract = {The male and female terminalia of the poorly known sharpshooter
   Macugonalia semiguttata are described and illustrated for the first time
   based on specimens from a mountainous region in Rio de Janeiro State,
   southeastern Brazil (Atlantic Forest). External characters of the head,
   thorax, and abdomen of this species are also described and illustrated.
   Macugonalia semiguttata is compared with other seven similar species of
   the diverse genus Macugonalia Young, 1977. Among the 28 known species of
   this genus, it is apparently closely related to Macugonalia dallasi
   (Signoret, 1853), Macugonalia geographica (Signoret, 1855), and
   Macugonalia elegantula Cavichioli, 2004. Specimens of M. semiguttata
   were collected from the leaves and branches of shrubs and small trees in
   an area of low forest (circa 1,700 m a.s.l.), which is intermediate
   between the typical Atlantic Forest and the vegetation of alpine fields.},

Title = {Very small collars: an evaluation of telemetry location estimators for
   small mammals},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background Fine-scale tracking of animals such as Peromyscus spp. is
   still done with micro-very high frequency collars due to the animal's
   small size and habitat usage. In most cases, tracking micro-very high
   frequency collars requires manual telemetry, yet throughout the
   literature, there is little reporting of individual telemetry methods or
   error reporting for small mammal spatial analyses. Unfortunately, there
   is even less documentation and consensus on the best programs used to
   calculate fine-scale animal locations from compass azimuths. In this
   study, we present a strategy for collecting fine-scale spatial data on
   Peromyscus spp. as a model species for micro-very high frequency collars
   and assess multiple programmatic options and issues when calculating
   telemetry locations. Results Mice were trapped from April to October
   2018-2019 with Sherman traps in Howard County, Maryland, USA. Collars
   were placed on 61 mice, of which 31 were included in the analyses. We
   compared the two most cited location estimator programs in the
   literature, location of a signal software and Locate III, as well as the
   Sigloc package in program R. To assess the programmatic estimates of
   coordinates at a fine scale and examine programmatic impacts on
   different analyses, we created and compared minimum convex polygon and
   kernel density estimator home ranges from locations produced by each
   program. We found that 95\% minimum convex polygon home range size
   significantly differed across all programs. However, we found more
   similarities in estimates across calculations of core home ranges.
   Kernel density estimator home ranges had similar patterns as the minimum
   convex polygon home ranges with significant differences in home range
   size for 95\% and 50\% contours. These differences likely resulted from
   different inclusion requirements of bearings for each program.
   Conclusions This study highlights how different location estimator
   programs could change the results of a small mammal study and emphasizes
   the need to calculate telemetry error and meticulously document the
   specific inputs and settings of the location estimator.},

Title = {Dead-reckoning elucidates fine-scale habitat use by European badgers
   Meles meles},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Background Recent developments in both hardware and software of
   animal-borne data loggers now enable large amounts of data to be
   collected on both animal movement and behaviour. In particular, the
   combined use of tri-axial accelerometers, tri-axial magnetometers and
   GPS loggers enables animal tracks to be elucidated using a procedure of
   `dead-reckoning'. Although this approach was first suggested 30 years
   ago by Wilson et al. (1991), surprisingly few measurements have been
   made in free-ranging terrestrial animals. The current study examines
   movements, interactions with habitat features, and home-ranges
   calculated from just GPS data and also from dead-reckoned data in a
   model terrestrial mammal, the European badger (Meles meles). Methods
   Research was undertaken in farmland in Northern Ireland. Two badgers
   (one male, one female) were live-trapped and fitted with a GPS logger, a
   tri-axial accelerometer, and a tri-axial magnetometer. Thereafter, the
   badgers' movement paths over 2 weeks were elucidated using just GPS data
   and GPS-enabled dead-reckoned data, respectively. Results Badgers
   travelled further using data from dead-reckoned calculations than using
   the data from only GPS data. Whilst once-hourly GPS data could only be
   represented by straight-line movements between sequential points, the
   sub-second resolution dead-reckoned tracks were more tortuous. Although
   there were no differences in Minimum Convex Polygon determinations
   between GPS- and dead-reckoned data, Kernel Utilisation Distribution
   determinations of home-range size were larger using the former method.
   This was because dead-reckoned data more accurately described the
   particular parts of landscape constituting most-visited core areas,
   effectively narrowing the calculation of habitat use. Finally, the
   dead-reckoned data showed badgers spent more time near to field margins
   and hedges than simple GPS data would suggest. Conclusion Significant
   differences emerge when analyses of habitat use and movements are
   compared between calculations made using just GPS data or GPS-enabled
   dead-reckoned data. In particular, use of dead-reckoned data showed that
   animals moved 2.2 times farther, had better-defined use of the habitat
   (revealing clear core areas), and made more use of certain habitats
   (field margins, hedges). Use of dead-reckoning to provide detailed
   accounts of animal movement and highlight the minutiae of interactions
   with the environment should be considered an important technique in the
   ecologist's toolkit.},

Title = {Active acoustic telemetry reveals ontogenetic habitat-related variations
   in the coastal movement ecology of the white shark},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Background Little is known about the fine-scale behavioural choices
   white sharks make. The assessment of movement at high spatio-temporal
   resolution can improve our understanding of behavioural patterns. Active
   acoustic telemetry was used along a coastal seascape of South Africa to
   investigate the movement-patterns of 19 white sharks tracked for 877 h
   within habitats known to host different prey types. Results A
   three-state hidden Markov model showed higher ontogenetic variability in
   the movements of white sharks around estuary-related coastal reef
   systems compared to around a pinniped colony. Our results further
   suggest white sharks (1) use the same searching strategy in areas where
   either pinnipeds or fishes are present; (2) occupy sub-tidal reef
   habitats possibly for either conserving energy or recovering energy
   spent hunting, and (3) travel directly between the other two states.
   Conclusions White sharks appear not to simply roam coastal habitats, but
   rather adopt specific temporally optimized behaviours associated with
   distinct habitat features. The related behaviours are likely the result
   of a balance among ontogenetic experience, trophic niche, and
   energetics, aimed at maximizing the use of temporally and spatially
   heterogeneous environments and resources. The possible implications for
   the future conservation of white sharks in coastal areas are discussed,
   with particular attention to South Africa's present conservation and
   management challenges.},

Title = {Evidence of long-distance coastal sea migration of Atlantic salmon,

Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {Background Combining data from multiple acoustic telemetry studies has
   revealed that west coast England Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smolts
   used a northward migration pathway through the Irish Sea to reach their
   feeding grounds. Hundred Atlantic salmon smolts were captured and tagged
   in May 2020 in the River Derwent, northwest England as part of an
   Environment Agency/Natural England funded project. Results Three tagged
   smolts were detected on marine acoustic receivers distributed across two
   separate arrays from different projects in the Irish Sea. One fish had
   migrated approximately 262 km in 10 days from the river mouth at
   Workington Harbour, Cumbria to the northernmost receiver array operated
   by the SeaMonitor project; this is the longest tracked marine migration
   of an Atlantic salmon smolt migrating from the United Kingdom. This
   migrating fish displayed behaviours which resulted in fast northward
   migration. The remaining two fish were detected on a receiver array
   operated by a third project: the Collaborative Oceanography and
   Monitoring for Protected Areas and Species (COMPASS). Conclusion These
   detections further provide evidence that migration to reach marine
   feeding grounds of at least a proportion of salmon smolts from rivers
   draining into the Irish Sea is northerly, though without a southern
   marine array it is impossible to conclude that this is the only route.
   The pattern of these detections would not have been possible without the
   collaborative efforts of three distinct and separately funded projects
   to share data. Further work is required to fully understand migration
   trajectories in this species on the west coast of the British Isles.},

Title = {The effects of feral dogs on wildlife in a nature reserve in southern
   Turkey},

Abstract = {Feral dogs can negatively impact wildlife through predation, fear
   interceded behavioural changes, harassment, hybridisation, and disease
   transmission. Thus, the presence of feral dogs in nature reserves poses
   a major problem for wildlife conservation. In this study, we recorded
   the effects of free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) on wildlife species
   in a protected Mediterranean forest reserve in southern Turkey. By using
   camera traps and line transects we sought to understand how the presence
   of feral dogs impacted the main wildlife species in the study area.
   Applying presence-absence transect surveys and camera trapping
   techniques to estimate animal occurrence we covered approximately 97,00
   ha and recorded 4209 images over a 154-week period. We found that the
   presence of feral dogs was significantly correlated with the movement of
   frequently observed wildlife species. Based on transect surveys, the
   species significantly affected by dog presence were fallow deer (Dama
   dama), wild boar (Sus scrofa), beech marten (Martes foina), badger
   (Meles meles), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Based on the camera trap
   data, fallow deer were negatively affected and wild boar not affected by
   dog occurrence while wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and caracal (Caracal
   caracal) were positively affected. The occurrence of wild boars, wild
   goats, hares, beech martens, red foxes and caracals across our study
   area increased with distance from agricultural land, while the
   occurrence of deer decreased. Overall, our findings suggest that the
   presence of dogs has a strong influence on wildlife in our study
   reserve. Since protected areas often are a final refuge for many of the
   species observed in this study, there is a need to take urgent measures
   to prevent feral dog impacts on wildlife and to reduce feral dog
   populations in wildlife reserves.},

Title = {Development and validation of a drill attachment for faster and safer
   deployments of fin-mounted geolocators in large-bodied sharks},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Fin-mounted geolocators are widely used in marine studies to track
   animal movements and to design informed management strategies. However,
   the deployment protocols of such geolocators, which normally consist of
   drilling one to multiple holes using a template, can be challenging, and
   depending on the animal's stress physiology and ocean conditions, speed
   and accuracy may be crucial. Here, we present the plans for a drill
   attachment allowing the template-free drilling of up to four holes
   simultaneously for a faster, more accurate and safer deployment of
   fin-mounted geolocators. The drill attachment was successfully tested on
   four great and two scalloped hammerheads, Sphyrna mokarran and Sphyrna
   lewini, which were all tagged with 4-bolt Smart Position and Temperature
   (SPOT) tags. The time required to secure the geolocators, from drill
   alignment to the complete fastening of the last bolt, ranged from 68 to
   85 s (78.2 +/- 10.9 s, mean +/- SD). The new drill attachment further
   allowed the successful tagging of a great hammerhead alongside a
   research vessel in rough seas that would have made the deployment using
   traditional protocols more challenging. Simultaneously drilling four
   holes reduces the need to keep the animal's fin steady for an extended
   period of time and thus makes the deployment of fin-mounted geolocators
   less dependent on the animal's behavior and the weather conditions. As
   such, the 4-hole drill attachment makes the mounting process faster and
   more reliable and should reduce the stress experienced by the animal.},

Title = {Can metrics of acceleration provide accurate estimates of energy costs
   of locomotion on uneven terrain? Using domestic sheep (Ovis aries) as an
   example},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Background Locomotion is often a necessity for animal survival and can
   account for a large proportion of an individual's energy budget.
   Therefore, determining the energy costs of locomotion is an important
   part of understanding the interaction between an animal and its
   environment. Measures of animal acceleration, specifically `dynamic body
   acceleration' (DBA) has proved to be a useful proxy of the energy cost
   of locomotion. However, few studies have considered the effects of
   interacting factors such as the animal's speed or changes to the terrain
   slope on the putative acceleration versus energy expenditure
   relationship and how this may affect the relationship between DBA and
   energy expenditure. Methods Here we conducted a methodological study to
   evaluate the ability of the metric `vectorial dynamic body
   acceleration', VeDBA, obtained from tri-axial accelerometer data
   loggers, to act as a proxy for energy expenditure in non-uniform
   environments. We used indirect calorimetry to measure the oxygen
   consumption (V?O-2) of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) that were exposed to
   different ambient temperatures when immobile (resting) and that walked
   at various speeds (0.8 to 2.9 km h(-1)) and slope angles (- 6 degrees to
   6 degrees) on a treadmill while simultaneously measuring tri-axial
   acceleration recorded at 40 Hz by body-mounted tags. Results The lower
   critical temperature of sheep was identified as 18 degrees C, and V?O-2
   when they were immobile was 3.67 mL O-2 kg(-1) min(-1). There were
   positive relationships between V?O-2,O- VeDBA, and speed of walking.
   However, VeDBA correlated less well with V?O-2 when the terrain slope
   either inclined or declined. Conclusions We advocate caution when using
   DBA metrics for establishing energy use in animals moving over uneven
   terrain and suggest that each study species or location must be examined
   on a case-by-case basis. Reliance upon the relationship described
   between acceleration and energy expenditure on horizontal-surface
   treadmills can lead to potential under- or over-estimates of energy
   expenditure when animals walk on uneven or inclined ground.},

Title = {Effects of altitude and leaf age on leaf shape in an alpine shrub: the
   relevance for the leaf area estimation model},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-43},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nondestructive methods to estimate leaf area (LA) by leaf length (L)
   and/or width (W) are useful in plant physiology and ecology studies.
   However, both environmental and ontogenic factors may influence leaf
   size and/or shape, which may alter the coefficient of LA models. We
   carried an investigation along an altitudinal gradient in the Sergyemla
   Mountains, southeast Tibet. In August 2009, we selected nine sites at
   about every 50 m in altitude from 4,250 m to 4,640 m a.s.l. A total of
   4,245 different leaf-aged Rhododendron aganniphum var. schizopeplum (a
   dominant overstory species) leaves were measured. Compared with the
   single dimensional models, the two-dimensional model encompassing both L
   and W (model 5) reflected higher R-2 (0.98-0.99) and lower MSE
   (1.19-3.21) across different leaf age groups for each site, implying
   that such model could provide the best fit for LA estimation. Analysis
   of covariance further illustrated that two leaf dimensions model was
   irrespective of leaf age effects in eight out of the nine sites. Leaf
   shape (L:W ratio) varied between sites and tended to decrease at higher
   altitudes (4500-4640 m a.s.l.), leading to significant differences in
   coefficients of the two-dimension model between every two adjacent
   sites. For overstory species in alpine habitats, altitude rather than
   leaf age may affect leaf shape which alters the coefficients of LA
   estimation models. Since leaf shape of different species (overstory
   species versus understory ones) may show different responses to a
   certain environmental gradient, researchers must pay attention to the
   variation of leaf shape when estimating species-specific LA by measuring
   L and W, especially when leaves of the top overstory species were
   collected at different sites.},

Title = {First descriptions of the seasonal habitat use and residency of
   scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus
   galapagensis) at a coastal seamount off Japan},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Background The Northwestern Pacific is a data-poor region for studies
   into the movements and habitat use of open ocean and pelagic sharks.
   However, this region experiences considerable pressure from commercial
   fishing. Therefore, shark movement data from this region carry
   significant implications for conservation and management, particularly
   for threatened species. Here, we provide the first data on seasonal
   residency and movements of scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and
   Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), using acoustic and
   satellite telemetry, and dive logbooks, off Japan. Results Eight female
   sharks, four of each species, were tagged around a coastal seamount off
   southeastern Japan (Mikomoto Island) in August 2015, and monitored for a
   period of up to 363 days using an array of six receivers around the
   island. Analyses of the more abundant scalloped hammerhead acoustic data
   suggest high seasonal residency predominantly from August to November
   associated with lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, before sharks then
   leave the island and return the following summer. Residency for
   scalloped hammerhead sharks were highest among those receivers closest
   to the Kuroshio Current, which produces strong coastal upwelling,
   however SST was not found to be predictive of occurrence at Mikomoto.
   Shark presence was corroborated by analysis of dive-log data from a
   local ecotourism operator. We also produced two unique satellite tracks,
   whereby a scalloped hammerhead exhibited a 200-km dispersal into a
   coastal embayment west of the tagging location and a Galapagos shark
   migrated over 800 km offshore into the high seas. Conclusion This study
   provided some of the first behavioral and movement data for scalloped
   hammerhead and Galapagos sharks in Japan. Our findings suggest varying
   spatial and temporal visitation of two shark species to a coastal
   seamount, underscored by some degree of seasonal residency and site
   fidelity and linked, for scalloped hammerhead sharks at least, to
   varying productivity. Furthermore, we provided preliminary evidence for
   long-distance dispersal of these species, and some site fidelity to
   seamounts in the region. This study highlights the importance of
   describing shark movements to aid in filling critical data gaps for
   poorly understood, endemic populations of threatened species.},

Title = {Using low-fix rate GPS telemetry to expand estimates of ungulate
   reproductive success},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Background Population parameters such as reproductive success are
   critical for sustainably managing ungulate populations, however
   obtaining these data is often difficult, expensive, and invasive.
   Movement-based methods that leverage Global Positioning System (GPS)
   relocation data to identify parturition offer an alternative to more
   invasive techniques such as vaginal implant transmitters, but thus far
   have only been applied to relocation data with a relatively fine (one
   fix every < 8 h) temporal resolution. We employed a machine learning
   method to classify parturition/calf survival in cow elk in southeastern
   Kentucky, USA, using 13-h GPS relocation data and three simple movement
   metrics, training a random forest on cows that successfully reared their
   calf to a week old. Results We developed a decision rule based upon a
   predicted probability threshold across individual cow time series,
   accurately classifying 89.5\% (51/57) of cows with a known reproductive
   status. When used to infer status of cows whose reproductive outcome was
   unknown, we classified 48.6\% (21/38) as successful, compared to 85.1\%
   (40/47) of known-status cows. Conclusions While our approach was limited
   primarily by fix acquisition success, we demonstrated that coarse collar
   fix rates did not limit inference if appropriate movement metrics are
   chosen. Movement-based methods for determining parturition in ungulates
   may allow wildlife managers to extract more vital rate information from
   GPS collars even if technology and related data quality are constrained
   by cost.},

Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background Environmental conditions can influence animal movements,
   determining when and how much animals move. Yet few studies have
   quantified how abiotic environmental factors (e.g., ambient temperature,
   snow depth, precipitation) may affect the activity patterns and
   metabolic demands of wide-ranging large predators. We demonstrate the
   utility of accelerometers in combination with more traditional GPS
   telemetry to measure energy expenditure, ranging patterns, and movement
   ecology of 5 gray wolves (Canis lupus), a wide-ranging social carnivore,
   from spring through autumn 2015 in interior Alaska, USA. Results Wolves
   exhibited substantial variability in home range size (range 500-8300
   km(2)) that was not correlated with daily energy expenditure. Mean daily
   energy expenditure and travel distance were 22 MJ and 18 km day(-1),
   respectively. Wolves spent 20\% and 17\% more energy during the summer
   pup rearing and autumn recruitment seasons than the spring breeding
   season, respectively, regardless of pack reproductive status. Wolves
   were predominantly crepuscular but during the night spent 2.4 x more
   time engaged in high energy activities (such as running) during the pup
   rearing season than the breeding season. Conclusion Integrating
   accelerometry with GPS telemetry can reveal detailed insights into the
   activity and energetics of wide-ranging predators. Heavy precipitation,
   deep snow, and high ambient temperatures each reduced wolf mobility,
   suggesting that abiotic conditions can impact wolf movement decisions.
   Identifying such patterns is an important step toward evaluating the
   influence of environmental factors on the space use and energy
   allocation in carnivores with ecosystem-wide cascading effects,
   particularly under changing climatic conditions.},

Title = {Taking the time for range testing: an approach to account for temporal
   resolution in acoustic telemetry detection range assessments},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Background In acoustic telemetry studies, detection range is usually
   evaluated as the relationship between the probability of detecting an
   individual transmission and the distance between the transmitter and
   receiver. When investigating animal presence, however, few detections
   will suffice to establish an animal's presence within a certain time
   frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting
   factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary
   presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an
   acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the
   probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within
   that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time
   bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and
   detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. Results
   The accuracy and specificity of over 84\% for both temporal resolutions
   showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach,
   we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct
   hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated
   that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver
   did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but
   would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the
   programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the
   tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed
   distinctly from a single transmission's detectability, with an increase
   of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50\% detection probability
   (D-50). Conclusion When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice
   to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs
   distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission
   within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range
   testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the
   assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design,
   the data analysis and the interpretation of results.},

Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Animals sometimes forage in mixed species groups, where an individual of
   a ``follower{''} species actively trails a foraging individual of
   another ``nuclear{''} species to benefit from the latter's foraging
   strategy. Here, we report on a serendipitous observation of a large,
   benthic, reef-associated predator, the nurse shark (G. cirratum)
   following a pod of bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus) in an apparent
   attempt to feed on benthic prey disturbed by dolphin foraging. Data from
   a shark-borne camera, accelerometer, depth, and temperature datalogger
   package show the nurse shark following the dolphin pod for a period of
   15 min and performing multiple, rapid vertical ascents from a depth of
   24 m to near the surface following dolphins. The shark performed gliding
   descents behind dolphins back to the benthos and repeatedly swam through
   clouds of sand that were produced from dolphin crater feeding behavior.
   The dolphins appeared to ignore the shark except for three occasions
   when they struck the shark in the head with their caudal flukes. The
   shark eventually appeared to locate a benthic prey item as it turned
   sharply, stopped swimming, and performed what appeared to be suction
   feeding near the bottom, with clouds of sand rapidly expelled from its
   gills. This is the first report of rapid vertical ascents and
   interspecific foraging in a nurse shark.},

Title = {A satellite-linked tag for the long-term monitoring of diving behavior
   in large whales},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Despite spending most time underwater, the technology in use to track
   whales over large geographic ranges via satellite has been largely
   limited to locational data, with most applications focusing on
   characterizing their horizontal movements. We describe the development
   of the RDW tag, a new Argos-based satellite telemetry device that
   incorporates sensors for monitoring the movements and dive behavior of
   large whales over several months without requiring recovery. Based on an
   implantable design, the tag features a saltwater conductivity switch, a
   tri-axial accelerometer, and an optional pressure transducer, along with
   onboard software for data processing and detection of behavioral events
   or activities of interest for transmission. We configured the software
   to detect dives and create per-dive summaries describing behavioral
   events associated with feeding activities in rorqual whales. We
   conducted a validation by proxy of the dive summary and event detection
   algorithms using field data from a medium-duration archival tag. We also
   conducted a simulation exercise to examine how the expected data
   recovery would vary under different dive behavior scenarios and compared
   those results to empirical values from field deployments of the RDW tag
   on blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae)
   whales. The dive summary algorithm accurately reported dive depth and
   duration, while the accuracy of the lunge-feeding event detection
   algorithm was dependent on the precision of the accelerometer data that
   was used, with a predicted accuracy of 0.74 for correctly classifying
   feeding dives from 1/64-G precision data and 0.95 from 1-mG precision
   data. Simulated data recovery was lower with sparser transmission
   schedules, shorter mean dive durations, and lower rates of successfully
   received transmissions. Empirical data recovery was lower than expected
   from the simulation, suggesting the effect of additional factors, such
   as data gaps. By measuring key aspects of the per-dive behavior of large
   whales over multi-month timescales of movement, the RDW tags provide the
   ability to monitor previously unobservable behaviors across entire
   geographic ranges, extending the applications of satellite telemetry
   devices to new areas of whale physiology, behavior, ecology, and
   conservation.},

Title = {The effect of externally attached archival data loggers on the
   short-term dispersal behaviour and migration speed of European eel
   (Anguilla anguilla L.)},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background Externally attached archival data logging tags are
   increasingly used to unravel migration routes of fish species at sea.
   Due to the relatively large size of the tags, their application on
   seaward migrating anguillid eels often forms a challenge in terms of
   feasibility and impact on the eel's swimming performance. In this study,
   we investigated the impact of externally attached pop-up data storage
   tags (PDSTs) on the departure direction, time spent at the release
   location and ground speed of European eels (Anguilla anguilla). Results
   We tagged 66 eels with internal acoustic transmitters of which half of
   the eels were additionally tagged with externally attached PDSTs. A
   network of acoustic receivers allowed us to analyse if the dispersal
   behaviour (i.e. residence time and departure direction) from the release
   site differed between eels tagged with and without the PDSTs. In
   addition, we tracked the eels for ca. 83 km in the marine environment
   and determined their migration speed. The results showed no differences
   between eels tagged with or without external PDSTs in respect of the
   external tagging effect on residence time (n = 60), departure direction
   at the release site (n = 60) or on the migration speed (n = 20).
   Conclusions We conclude that the impact of the PDSTs is minimal on these
   metrics for at least the first part of the marine migration. While these
   field-based findings suggest that anguillid eels may be largely
   unaffected by the applied PDSTs, we recognize that more research is
   needed in both the field and the laboratory to study the impact of PDSTs
   and externally attached tags in general on fish swimming performance and
   energy expenditure. This can help interpret the results from the field,
   but also aid developing more hydrodynamic tag shapes or improved
   attachment methods.},

   recorders for short to medium term studies, as well as tags developed
   for large scale migration telemetry studies are available as
   off-the-shelf devices, or in many cases as custom made sensor packages.
   Deployment of those instruments is often the limiting factor for data
   collection. The Aerial Remote Tag System (ARTS) is a flexible system
   which can easily be adapted to deploy different tag sensor packages and
   biopsy collection devices. This paper presents the history and design of
   the ARTS, and accessories developed for instrumentation and biopsy
   sampling of cetaceans, such as the recent developed ARTS-LKDart for
   biopsy sampling. Deployment of archival tags usually requires radio
   tracking of the instrumented animal, or at least tracking of the tag for
   recovery. Thus, we also here describe the automatic digital signal
   processing radio direction finder, the Direction Finder Horten (DFHorten
   unit).},

Title = {Spatial behavior of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Northern Apennines: are
   we managing them correctly?},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},

Abstract = {Background Throughout their range, red deer are a well-studied species.
   In Italy, this species occupies two ecologically different ranges: the
   Alps and the Apennines. Although several studies have described the
   spatial behaviour of red deer in the Italian Alps, no data are available
   for the Apennine population. Results The spatial behaviours of 13 deer
   from the Northern Apennines range were analysed for the first time using
   GPS-GSM telemetry from 2011 to 2017. Red deer displayed two coexisting
   strategies, i.e., migratory and stationary. In our sample, females
   tended to migrate more than males. We found a high level of
   interindividual variability in the date of migration/return, while each
   migratory deer was very conservative during the study period. The
   migration ranges were on average 12 +/- 4.2 km from the resident range.
   Both migratory and resident deer displayed high site fidelity. No switch
   from the migratory to stationary strategy was observed for any deer
   during the study period; however, the period could have been too short
   to detect any switch. At the management level, over 18 management cycles
   occurred during the study period, and a spatial mismatch was found
   between deer range and management units (districts) in 38.9\% (7) of the
   cases. Merging the districts belonging to each province to obtain an
   area of approximately 1000 km(2) would partially address such spatial
   mismatch, reducing its occurrence to 22\%. Conclusions Despite the small
   sample size, these results can guide future management actions. However,
   an in-depth study with a larger sample size is required to better
   understand and manage the red deer Apennines population.},

Abstract = {The Rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), native to India, South
   Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, is considered one of the most invasive
   bird species. It has been recorded in 37 countries, in some of which it
   was originally introduced as a pet. It has become an agricultural pest
   and a threat to native birds in many countries. In South America,
   populations of this species were only known to exist in Venezuela and
   the Caribbean Islands. We report the finding of a small reproductive
   population of Rose-ringed parakeets in the city of Corrientes, in
   northeastern Argentina. We provide information on its observed feeding
   patterns and interactions with two other species of birds. We suggest
   monitoring the species and its population trends, as well as starting an
   awareness campaign of the dangers to native fauna posed by invasive
   alien species.},

Abstract = {The deviation of expected relationships between taxonomic (TD),
   phylogenetic (PD), and functional (FD) diversity may inform about some
   processes (speciation, extinction, competition, and migration)
   responsible for current biodiversity patterns. We studied the
   relationship between different dimensions of bird diversity (TD, PD, and
   FD) of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) in a context of future climate change.
   We used ecological niche models to predict the current and future
   potential distribution of 257 bird species of the YP and estimate their
   TD, PD, and FD. We calculated a standardized effect size of PD (SES.PD)
   and FD (SES.FD) to provide an estimation of phylogenetic and functional
   diversity, independent from species richness. Finally, we evaluated the
   effectiveness of the system of PAs comparing the observed diversity
   values in each PA versus what is expected for a null model. We found a
   positive correlation between PD and TD, and a negative correlation
   between FD and TD in the current and future scenarios. Finally, we found
   that none of the PAs protect more diversity of birds than expected by a
   null model. Our results suggest that macroevolutionary processes have
   played an important role in the composition of the current Yucatan
   Peninsula avian assemblages. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the
   PAs suggests the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity
   conservation in the YP.},

Abstract = {The movements and habitat use of three species of Sigmodontine rodents
   (Akodon mollis, Phyllotis haggard and Thomasomys paramorum) from the
   high Andes of Ecuador were evaluated using the spool-and-line technique
   in four transects. The floristic composition was analyzed at sampling
   sites to explain how these three species of Sigmodontine rodents use the
   vegetation as a habitat. Rodents were captured using live Sherman traps
   and equipped with a spool-and-line device. Each thread trail was traced,
   and their nests, feeders and shelters were recorded using GPS receivers.
   Also, the construction materials, nest morphology and shelters used
   during foraging, and the food resources were described. These three
   rodent species overlap in their distribution, but they present certain
   preferences for different habitats such as grasslands, open areas with
   cushions and shrubs, respectively. This study is an approach to the
   natural history of these Sigmodontine rodents in high mountain
   elevations.},

Abstract = {Satellite telemetry devices can record movement data of animals along
   with the environmental data. Such data are relayed remotely via
   satellite systems, but are constrained by the limited bandwidth
   availability. A satellite relay data logger (SRDL) that can abstract
   dive profiles and compress the data for transmission using a broken
   stick model (BSM) has been widely used in studies on dive behavior and
   physiology of marine animals. However, there is still uncertainty in the
   abstracted dive profiles. Here, we aimed to evaluate the certainty of
   abstracted dive profiles (via satellite communication) in terms of dive
   performance (dive depth, duration, and dive type) by comparing it with
   the actual dive data (from the retrieved tag) in a loggerhead turtle
   deployed with the SRDL throughout a 1.4-year foraging period. There was
   no significant difference in the maximum dive depth between the
   retrieved and satellite transmission data; however, there was a slight
   but significant difference in the dive duration. The dives from both
   datasets were classified into five types. Inconsistent dive
   classifications occurred in 1.7\% of the data. There was no significant
   difference in the proportion of time spent diving between the retrieved
   and satellite transmission data for each type during the common
   recording period. In monthly scale comparisons, however, a significant
   difference was detected when the amount of data via satellite
   transmission was the smallest. Our results demonstrated that the dive
   data abstracted using BSM almost reconstructed the actual dive profiles
   with certainty in a loggerhead turtle, although slight inconsistencies
   were observed.},

Title = {Moving wildlife tracking forward under forested conditions with the
   SWIFT GPS algorithm},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The remote collection of animal location data has proliferated in recent
   decades, and higher-frequency data are increasingly available with
   battery-saving optimisations such as `snapshot' algorithms that acquire
   GPS satellite data and post-process locations off-board. This is the
   first study to assess the effects of vegetation and topography on the
   fix success rate and location error of global positioning system (GPS)
   devices that use the SWIFT fix algorithm, developed by Lotek. To assess
   fix success rate (FSR-the proportion of successful fixes compared to the
   total number of attempts) and location error (LE), we conducted a
   stationary test at a predominately forested site on the South Island of
   New Zealand. The overall FSR was 83\% (+/- 15.3\% SD), which was
   affected strongly by canopy closure above 90\%. Half of the locations
   were within 8.65 m of the true location, 79.7\% were within 30 m, and
   95\% of locations were within 271 m. When 6 or more satellites were
   used, this reduced to 4.92 m and 18.6 m for 50\% and 95\%, respectively.
   Horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), the number of satellites, and
   canopy closure all influenced location error. To field test the fix
   success rate of SWIFT GPS devices, we deployed them on forest-dwelling
   parrots with 2 and 3-h fix intervals, which showed similar FSR results
   to the stationary test when cavity-nesting individuals were removed (FSR
   mean +/- SD = 81.6 +/- 5.0\%). The devices lasted an average of 147 days
   before depleting the battery, resulting in an average of 1087 successful
   fixes per individual at an average time of 9.38 s to acquire the GPS
   ephemeris, resulting in an average of 3.73 attempted locations per mAh
   of battery for PinPoint 350 devices. Our study provides a baseline for
   fix success rates and location errors under forested conditions that can
   be used for future SWIFT GPS tracking studies.},

Title = {Influence of dense macrophyte vegetation and total gas saturation on the
   performance of acoustic telemetry},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Background Acoustic telemetry is widely used as a method for high
   resolution monitoring of aquatic animal movement to investigate
   relationships between individual animals and their environment. In
   shallow freshwater ecosystem, aquatic macrophytes are common and their
   presence increases habitat complexity and baffles sound propagation.
   These properties may be likely to affect the performance of acoustic
   telemetry, however, to date this issue has received little attention,
   when studying the ecology of movements of fishes in and around the
   important macrophyte habitats. Here, we conducted a range-test study in
   a freshwater riverine ecosystem, with mass development of the aquatic
   macrophyte Juncus bulbosus (L.), to assess how dense macrophytes impact
   detection probability, detection range, and performance of a
   three-dimensional receiver positioning system. Supersaturation of gas
   frequently occurs at the study site as a by-product of upstream
   hydroelectric power generation and gave a unique opportunity to
   investigate how total gas saturation affects the performance of acoustic
   telemetry. We also investigated the influence of environmental
   conditions (i.e., day-of-year, time of day, average water level above J.
   bulbosus) on detection probability together with vertical position of
   transmitters and location inside or outside macrophytes. Results The
   detection probability and range were generally low for transmitters in
   and outside J. bulbosus stands, with mean hourly detection probabilities
   ranging from 1.18 to 5\% and detection ranges between 17.26 m +/- 0.74.
   The interaction between total macrophyte biomass and distance to
   receiver reduced the detection probability and detection range
   substantially. Detection probability further decreased with increasing
   total gas saturation, and transmitters positioned near the sediment and
   close to the surface also had lower detection probabilities compared to
   receivers in the middle of the water column. Finally, the low detection
   probability affected position estimates, where only 23\% of the
   detections could be positioned using the average positioning estimation
   method and positional accuracy and precision were low ranging from 1.48
   to 164.8 m and 0 to 50.1 m, respectively. Conclusions Our findings
   demonstrate the impact of macrophytes and total gas saturation on
   detection probability and range of acoustic transmitters in a shallow
   ecosystem, where tagged fish are unlikely to be detected by receivers or
   positioned. These results emphasise that in situ range testing is
   strongly needed before determining the density and design of receiver
   array when performing acoustic telemetry studies in shallow ecosystems.},

Title = {Diagnosing predated tags in telemetry survival studies of migratory
   fishes in river systems},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Background Acoustic telemetry is a powerful tool for studying fish
   behavior and survival that relies on the assumption that tag detection
   reflects the presence of live study subjects. This assumption is
   violated when tag signals continue to be recorded after consumption by
   predators. When such tag predation is possible, it is necessary for
   researchers to diagnose and remove these non-representative detections.
   Past studies have employed a variety of data-filtering techniques to
   address the issue, ranging from rule-based algorithms that rely on
   expert judgements of behavior and movement capabilities of study
   subjects and their predators to automated pattern-recognition techniques
   using multivariate analyses. We compare four approaches for flagging
   suspicious tracks or detection events: two rule-based expert-opinion
   approaches of differing complexity and two unsupervised
   pattern-recognition approaches with and without data from deliberately
   tagged predators. We compare alternative approaches by applying these
   four filters to a case study of survival estimation of acoustic-tagged
   juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the San Joaquin
   River, California, United States.
   Results Filtering approaches differed in the number and composition of
   tags suspected of being consumed by predators; the largest differences
   occurred between the two broad categories, rule-based versus pattern
   recognition. All methods required some investigator judgement and all
   flagged a small subset (5\%) of suspicious tags that had exceptionally
   long residence times and evidence of upstream transitions; 27\% of tags
   showed evidence of predation based on at least one filter. The complex
   rule-based filter deemed the most tags suspicious (21\%) and the simpler
   pattern-recognition method the fewest (10\%). Reach-specific survival
   estimates from the four filters were mostly within 2\% of the unfiltered
   estimates, but differences up to 11\% were observed.
   Conclusions Sensitivity of survival results to tag predation and
   predator filtering depends on the study setting, spatiotemporal scale of
   inference, and habitat use of predators. Choice of filtering technique
   depends on the data available and knowledge of the study system. We
   recommend that survival studies include clear documentation of filtering
   methods and report on robustness of results to the filtering approach
   selected.},

Title = {Ultra-light photosensor collars to monitor Arctic lemming activity},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Background Studying the anti-predatory behavior of mammals represents an
   important challenge, especially for fossorial small mammals that hide in
   burrows. In the Arctic, such behaviors are critical to the survival of
   lemmings considering that predation risks are high every summer. Because
   detailed information about how lemmings use burrows as hideouts is still
   lacking, we developed a 1.59 g photosensitive collar to record any event
   of a small mammal moving between a dark area (e.g., burrow) and a bright
   area (e.g., outside the burrow). Tests of how collars affected lemming
   behavior were conducted in captivity in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada,
   in November 2019 and field tests were conducted on Bylot Island,
   Nunavut, Canada, in August 2021. Results The device was made of two
   chemical batteries and a printed circuit board (PCB) equipped with a
   photosensor and a real-time clock that recorded amplitude transient
   thresholds of light (lux) continuously. In accordance with ethical use
   of such devices, we verified that no abnormal loss of body mass was
   observed in captive or free-ranging lemmings, and no difference in
   recapture rates were observed between those with and without a collar,
   though we could not test this for periods longer than 108 h.
   Measurements of light intensities revealed consistent patterns with high
   lux levels at mid-day and lowest during the night. Lemmings showed
   clearly defined behavioral patterns alternating between periods outside
   and inside burrows. Despite 24-h daylight in the middle of the summer,
   August nighttime (i.e., 11 PM to 4 AM) lux levels were insufficient for
   amplitude transient thresholds to be reached. Conclusion By taking
   advantage of the long periods of daylight in the Arctic, such technology
   is very promising as it sets new bases for passive recording of
   behavioral parameters and builds on the prospect of further
   miniaturization of batteries and PCBs.},

Title = {Kernel density estimation of conditional distributions to detect
   responses in satellite tag data},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Background As levels of anthropogenic noise in the marine environment
   rise, it is crucial to quantify potential associated effects on marine
   mammals. Yet measuring responses is challenging because most species
   spend the majority of their time submerged. Consequently, much of their
   sub-surface behavior is difficult or impossible to observe and it can be
   difficult to determine if-during or following an exposure to sound-an
   observed dive differs from previously recorded dives. We propose a
   method for initial assessment of potential behavioral responses observed
   during controlled exposure experiments (CEEs), in which animals are
   intentionally exposed to anthropogenic sound sources. To identify
   possible behavioral responses in dive data collected from
   satellite-linked time-depth recorders, and to inform the selection and
   parameters for subsequent individual and population-level response
   analyses, we propose to use kernel density estimates of conditional
   distributions for quantitative comparison of pre- and post-exposure
   behavior. Results We apply the proposed method to nine Cuvier's beaked
   whales (Ziphius cavirostris) exposed to a lower-amplitude simulation of
   Mid-Frequency Active Sonar within the context of a CEE. The exploratory
   procedure provides evidence that exposure to sound causes animals to
   change their diving behavior. Nearly all animals tended to dive deep
   immediately following exposure, potentially indicating avoidance
   behavior. Following the initial deep dive after exposure, the procedure
   provides evidence that animals either avoided deep dives entirely or
   initiated deep dives at unusual times relative to their pre-exposure,
   baseline behavior patterns. The procedure also provides some evidence
   that animals exposed as a group may tend to respond as a group.
   Conclusions The exploratory approach we propose can identify potential
   behavioral responses across a range of diving parameters observed during
   CEEs. The method is particularly useful for analyzing data collected
   from animals for which neither the baseline, unexposed patterns in dive
   behavior nor the potential types or duration of behavioral responses is
   well characterized in the literature. The method is able to be applied
   in settings where little a priori knowledge is known because the
   statistical analyses employ kernel density estimates of conditional
   distributions, which are flexible non-parametric techniques. The kernel
   density estimates allow researchers to initially assess potential
   behavioral responses without making strong, model-based assumptions
   about the data.},

Title = {Using skin temperature and activity profiles to assign chronotype in
   birds},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Chronotypes describe consistent differences between individuals in
   biological time-keeping. They have been linked both with underlying
   variation in the circadian system and fitness. Quantification of
   chronotypes is usually by time of onset, midpoint, or offset of a
   rhythmic behaviour or physiological process. However, diel activity
   patterns respond flexibly to many short-term environmental influences,
   which can make chronotypes hard to identify. In contrast, rhythmic
   patterns in physiological processes, such as body temperature, may
   provide more robust insights into the circadian basis of chronotypes.
   These can be telemetrically recorded from skin-mounted,
   temperature-sensitive transmitters, offering minimally invasive
   opportunities for working on free-ranging animals in the wild.
   Currently, computational methods for deriving chronotype from skin
   temperature require further development, as time series are often noisy
   and incomplete. Here, we investigate such methods using simultaneous
   radio telemetry recordings of activity and skin temperature in a wild
   songbird model (Great Tit Parus major) temporarily kept in outdoor
   aviaries. Our aims were to first develop standardised selection criteria
   to filter noisy time series of skin temperature and activity, to second
   assign chronotype based on the filtered recordings, and to third compare
   chronotype as assigned based on each of the two rhythms. After the
   selection of rhythmic data using periodicity and autocorrelation
   parameters, chronotype estimates (onset and offset) were extracted using
   four different changepoint approaches for skin temperature and one
   approach for activity records. The estimates based on skin temperature
   varied between different approaches but were correlated to each other
   (onset: correlation coefficient r = 0.099-0.841, offset: r =
   0.131-0.906). In contrast, chronotype estimates from skin temperature
   were more weakly correlated to those from activity (onset: r =
   -0.131-0.612, offset: r = -0.040- -0.681). Overall, chronotype estimates
   were less variable and timed later in the day for activity than for skin
   temperature. The distinctions between physiological and behavioural
   chronotypes in this study might reflect differences in underlying
   mechanisms and in responsiveness to external and internal cues. Thus,
   studying each of these rhythms has specific strengths, while parallel
   studies of both could inform broadly on natural variation in biological
   time-keeping, and may allow assessment of how biological rhythms relate
   to changes in the environment.},

Title = {A subdermal tagging technique for juvenile sturgeon using a new
   self-powered acoustic tag},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Background A new technology for a self-powered acoustic tag (SPT) was
   developed for active tracking of juvenile fish, intended to avoid the
   typical battery life constraints associated with active telemetry
   technology. We performed a laboratory study to evaluate a subdermal
   tagging technique for the SPT and effects of the tag on survival, tag
   retention, and growth in juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser
   transmontanus). Results Survival was associated with tag retention.
   White sturgeon implanted with the SPT (n = 30) had 93\% survival and tag
   retention by day 28, 67\% by day 101, and 38\% by day 595 post-tagging.
   Sturgeon implanted with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag only
   (control group) had 96\% survival and tag retention by day 28, and
   through day 101 post-tagging. Fish in the PIT group were repurposed
   after day 101, so no comparisons with this group were made at day 595
   post-tagging. Specific growth rate (SGR) for fork length was a median of
   0.25\% day(-1) by day 28 for the SPT group, which was significantly
   lower than the PIT group (median: 0.42\% day(-1); n = 27). The SPT and
   PIT groups had similar SGR fork length by day 101 post-tagging (0.22 and
   0.25\% day(-1), respectively). SGR weight was also lower for the SPT
   group compared to the PIT group on day 28 (1.39 and 2.11\% day(-1),
   respectively), but the difference again dissipated by day 101 (0.79 and
   0.88\% day(-1), respectively). Conclusion The tagging technique and
   placement of the SPT allowed the tag to remain upright along the flank
   of the sturgeon to ensure maximum battery output of the SPT; however,
   retention rates of the SPT were not ideal. We provided suggestions to
   improve the tagging technique. Suggestions included tagging fish that
   are > 400 mm FL, moving the incision location to extend the cavity and
   create a pocket for the placement of the SPT, and performing a
   quantitative wound-healing evaluation. Future studies are therefore
   recommended to evaluate these suggestions.},

Title = {Ocean depth-temperature profiles for operational oceanography from a
   shark-borne transmitter},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Background Many regions of the ocean are under-sampled in terms of their
   biology and physical structure. Increasingly sophisticated animal-borne
   electronic tags are capable of measuring and transmitting in situ
   environmental data such as ocean temperature-depth profiles. This has
   the potential to significantly augment the volume of data acquired from
   under-sampled regions of the ocean. These data would enhance
   interpretation of animal behavior and distribution and could be used to
   inform oceanographic and meteorological models. Building on results
   obtained from marine mammals and turtles, we present a case study of
   depth-temperature profiles obtained from a tagged tiger shark. Results
   During a 102-day deployment, 1350 geolocations were obtained from a
   shark from waters around Oahu, Hawaii. Of these, 520 were associated
   with depth-temperature profiles-some of which were from depths exceeding
   500 m. Delay between profile creation and transmission to satellite or
   land-based receiver averaged 8.9 h (range: 35 s-43 h, median 6.32 h).
   The profiles were in close agreement with profiles extracted from nearby
   locations in an operational ROMS model. Land-based receivers played a
   significant role in augmenting data throughput obtained via satellites.
   Conclusions Shark-borne transmitters offer a viable option for
   collecting ocean profiles with reporting latencies that make them
   suitable for operational oceanography. They can significantly increase
   sampling frequency (especially subsurface) and sample geographic areas
   that are otherwise difficult to monitor with Lagrangian methods such as
   Argo floats. They sample locations and depths that are important to the
   animal and which in some cases may be biological hotspots. The
   resolution of the data is comparable with that derived from traditional
   platforms. By targeting appropriate species of shark, different areas of
   the ocean could be monitored at significantly higher rates than is
   currently the case.},

Title = {BIOTAS: BIOTelemetry Analysis Software, for the semi-automated removal
   of false positives from radio telemetry data},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Introduction: Radio telemetry, one of the most widely used techniques
   for tracking wildlife and fisheries populations, has a false-positive
   problem. Bias from false-positive detections can affect many important
   derived metrics, such as home range estimation, site occupation,
   survival, and migration timing. False-positive removal processes have
   relied upon simple filters and personal opinion. To overcome these
   shortcomings, we have developed BIOTAS (BIOTelemetry Analysis Software)
   to assist with false-positive identification, removal, and data
   management for large-scale radio telemetry projects.
   Methods: BIOTAS uses a naive Bayes classifier to identify and remove
   false-positive detections from radio telemetry data. The semi-supervised
   classifier uses spurious detections from unknown tags and study tags as
   training data. We tested BIOTAS on four scenarios: wide-band receiver
   with a single Yagi antenna, wide-band receiver that switched between two
   Yagi antennas, wide-band receiver with a single dipole antenna, and
   single-band receiver that switched between five frequencies. BIOTAS has
   a built in a k-fold cross-validation and assesses model quality with
   sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value,
   false-positive rate, and precision-recall area under the curve. BIOTAS
   also assesses concordance with a traditional consecutive detection
   filter using Cohen's kappa.
   Results: Overall BIOTAS performed equally well in all scenarios and was
   able to discriminate between known false-positive detections and valid
   study tag detections with low false-positive rates (< 0.001) as
   determined through crossvalidation, even as receivers switched between
   antennas and frequencies. BIOTAS classified between 94 and 99\% of study
   tag detections as valid.
   Conclusion: As part of a robust data management plan, BIOTAS is able to
   discriminate between detections from study tags and known false
   positives. BIOTAS works with multiple manufacturers and accounts for
   receivers that switch between antennas and frequencies. BIOTAS provides
   the framework for transparent, objective, and repeatable telemetry
   projects for wildlife conservation surveys, and increases the efficiency
   of data processing.},

Title = {Host-Population Microbial Diversity Scaling of Chinese Gut Microbiomes
   in Gout Patients},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gout is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that affects the life
   of tens of millions of people worldwide, and it typically presents as
   gout arthritis, gout stone, or even kidney damage. Research has revealed
   its connection with the gut microbiome, although exact mechanism is
   still unclear. Studies have shown the decline of microbiome diversity in
   gout patients and change of microbiome compositions between the gout
   patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, how diversity changes
   across host individuals at a cohort (population) level has not been
   investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here we apply the
   diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to the classic
   SAR (species-area relationship) and establishes the power-function model
   between microbiome diversity and the number of individuals within
   cohort, to comparatively investigate diversity scaling (changes) of gut
   microbiome in gout patients and healthy controls. The DAR modeling with
   a study involving 83 subjects (41 gout patients) revealed that the
   potential number of microbial species in gout patients is only 70\% of
   that in the healthy control (2790 vs 3900) although the difference may
   not be statistically significant. The other DAR parameters including
   diversity scaling and similarity parameters did not show statistically
   significant differences. We postulate that the high resilience of gut
   microbiome may explain the lack of significant gout-disease effects on
   gut microbial diversity at the population level. The lack of
   statistically significant difference between the gout patients and
   healthy controls at host population (cohort) level is different from the
   previous findings at individual level in the existing literature.},

Title = {Transcriptome Analysis of MYB Genes and Patterns of Anthocyanin
   Accumulation During Seed Development in Wheat},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Plants accumulate key metabolites as a response of biotic/abiotic stress
   conditions. In seed coats, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophylls
   can be found. They have been associated as important antioxidants that
   affect germination. In wheat, anthocyanins can impart the seed coat
   color which have been recognized as health-promoting nutrients.
   Transcription factors act as master regulators of cellular processes.
   Transcription complexes such as MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) regulate the
   expression of multiple target genes in various plant species. In this
   study, the spatiotemporal accumulation of seed coat pigments in
   different developmental stages (10, 20, 30, and 40 days after
   pollination) was analyzed using cryo-cuts. Moreover, the accumulation of
   phenolic, anthocyanin, and chlorophyll contents was quantified, and the
   expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes was evaluated. Finally,
   transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze putative MYB genes
   related to seed coat color, followed by further characterization of
   putative genes. TaTCL2, an MYB gene, was cloned and sequenced. It was
   determined that TaTCL2 contains a SANT domain, which is often present in
   proteins participating in the response to anthocyanin accumulation.
   Moreover, TaTCL2 transcript levels were shown to be influenced by
   anthocyanin accumulation during grain development. Interaction network
   analysis showed interactions with GL2 (HD-ZIP IV), EGL3 (bHLH), and TTG1
   (WD40). The findings of this study elucidate the mechanisms underlying
   color formation in Triticum aestivum L. seed coats.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is associated with bovine papillomatosis, a
   disease that forms benign warts in epithelial tissues, as well as
   malignant lesions. Previous studies have detected a co-infection between
   BPV and other viruses, making it likely that these co-infections could
   influence disease progression. Therefore, this study aimed to identify
   and annotate viral genes in cutaneous papillomatous lesions of cattle.
   Sequences were obtained from the GEO database, and an RNA-seq
   computational pipeline was used to analyze 3 libraries from bovine
   papillomatous lesions. In total, 25 viral families were identified,
   including Poxviridae, Retroviridae, and Herpesviridae. All libraries
   shared similarities in the viruses and genes found. The viral genes
   shared similarities with BPV genes, especially for functions as virion
   entry pathway, malignant progression by apoptosis suppression and immune
   system control. Therefore, this study presents relevant data extending
   the current knowledge regarding the viral microbiome in BPV lesions and
   how other viruses could affect this disease.},

Abstract = {The bacterium Oceanobacillus jordanicus strain GSFE11 is a halotolerant
   endophyte isolated from sterilized roots of Durum wheat (Triticum
   turgidum ssp. Durum) growing in hot and arid environments of Ghor Safi
   area in the Jordan Valley. The draft genome sequence and annotation of
   this plant growth-promoting endophytic bacterium are reported in this
   study. The draft genome sequence of Oceanobacillus jordanicus strain
   GSFE11 has 3 839 208 bp with a G + C content of 39.09\%. A total of 3893
   protein-coding genes and 68 RNA coding genes were predicted. Several
   putative genes that are involved in secretion and delivery systems,
   transport, adhesion, motility, membrane proteins, plant cell wall
   modification, and detoxification were identified, some are
   characteristics of endophytes lifestyle including genes that are
   involved in metabolism of carbohydrate, genes for xylose, fructose and
   chitin utilization, quinone cofactors biosynthesis, genes associated
   with nitrogen, sulfur, phosphate and iron acquisition, in addition to
   genes involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormone auxin. This study
   highlights the importance of using genome analysis and phylogenomic
   analysis to resolve the differences between closely related species,
   such analysis showed Oceanobacillus jordanicus strain GSFE11 to be a new
   species closely related to Oceanobacillus picturae (genome size 3.67
   Mb), Oceanobacillus jordanicus has higher a number of predicted genes
   compared with Oceanobacillus picturae (3961 genes vs 3823 genes).},

Title = {Mononucleotide A-repeats may Play a Regulatory Role in Endothermic
   Housekeeping Genes},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Coding and non-coding short tandem repeats (STRs) facilitate
   a great diversity of phenotypic traits. The imbalance of mononucleotide
   A-repeats around transcription start sites (TSSs) was found in 3
   mammals: H. sapiens, M. musculus, and R. norvegicus. Principal Findings:
   We found that the imbalance pattern originated in some vertebrates. A
   similar pattern was observed in mammals and birds, but not in amphibians
   and reptiles. We proposed that the enriched A-repeats upstream of TSSs
   is a novel hallmark of endotherms or warm-blooded animals. Gene ontology
   analysis indicates that the primary function of upstream A-repeats
   involves metabolism, cellular transportation, and sensory perception
   (smell and chemical stimulus) through housekeeping genes. Conclusions:
   Upstream A-repeats may play a regulatory role in the metabolic process
   of endothermic animals.},

Title = {SPINK5 is a Prognostic Biomarker Associated With the Progression and
   Prognosis of Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Identified by Weighted
   Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is one of the most common types
   of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and is the second most
   prevalent malignancy occurring in the head and neck or respiratory
   tract, with a high incidence and mortality rate. Survival is limited for
   patients with LSCC. To identify more biomarkers associated with the
   prognosis of patients with LSCC, using bioinformatics analysis, this
   study used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LSCC dataset and gene
   expression profiles of GSE59102 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
   Eighty-one differentially co-expressed genes were identified by weighted
   gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Next, 10 hub genes (PPL,
   KRT78, CRNN, PTK7, SCEL, AGRN, SPINK5, AIF1L, EMP1, and PPP1R3C) were
   screened from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Based on
   survival analysis, SPINK5 was significantly correlated with survival
   time in LSCC patients. After verification in the TCGA and HPA databases,
   SPINK5 was selected as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, the GSEA results
   showed that downregulation of SPINK5 gene expression may promote
   tumorigenesis and the development of cancers by the ``BASAL CELL
   CARCINOMA{''} pathway, and it has been implicated in disrupting DNA
   damage and repair pathways. Collectively, SPINK5 may serve as a
   potential prognostic biomarker in LSCC.},

Title = {Transcriptomics of a Greenlandic Snailfish Reveals Exceptionally High
   Expression of Antifreeze Protein Transcripts},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Polar fishes have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that allow them to
   survive in subzero temperatures. We performed deep transcriptomic
   sequencing on a postlarval/juvenile variegated snailfish, Liparis gibbus
   (Actinopterygii: Scorpaeniformes: Cottoidei: Liparidae), living in an
   iceberg habitat (-2 degrees C) in Eastern Greenland and report detection
   of highly expressed transcripts that code for putative AFPs from 2 gene
   families, Type I and LS-12-like proteins (putative Type IV AFPs). The
   transcripts encoding both proteins have expression levels among the top
   <1\% of expressed genes in the fish. The Type I AFP sequence is
   different from a reported Type I AFP from the same species, possibly
   expressed from a different genetic locus. While prior findings from
   related adult sculpins suggest that LS-12-like/Type IV AFPs may not have
   a role in antifreeze protection, our finding of very high relative gene
   expression of the LS-12-like gene suggests that highly active
   transcription of the gene is important to the fish in the iceberg
   habitat and raises the possibility that weak or combinatorial antifreeze
   activity could be beneficial. These findings highlight the physiological
   importance of antifreeze proteins to the survival of fishes living in
   polar habitats.},

Title = {The Prevalence of Pharmacogenomics Variants and Their Clinical Relevance
   Among the Pakistani Population},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Pharmacogenomics (PGx), forming the basis of precision
   medicine, has revolutionized traditional medical practice. Currently,
   drug responses such as drug efficacy, drug dosage, and drug adverse
   reactions can be anticipated based on the genetic makeup of the
   patients. The pharmacogenomic data of Pakistani populations are limited.
   This study investigates the frequencies of pharmacogenetic variants and
   their clinical relevance among ethnic groups in Pakistan. Methods: The
   Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) database was used to extract
   pharmacogenetic variants that are involved in medical conditions with
   high (1A + 1B) to moderate (2A + 2B) clinical evidence. Subsequently,
   the allele frequencies of these variants were searched among multiethnic
   groups of Pakistan (Balochi, Brahui, Burusho, Hazara, Kalash, Pashtun,
   Punjabi, and Sindhi) using the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and ALlele
   FREquency Database (ALFRED). Furthermore, the published Pharmacogenomics
   literature on the Pakistani population was reviewed in PubMed and Google
   Scholar. Results: Our search retrieved (n = 29) pharmacogenetic genes
   and their (n = 44) variants with high to moderate evidence of clinical
   association. These pharmacogenetic variants correspond to
   drug-metabolizing enzymes (n = 22), drug-metabolizing transporters (n =
   8), and PGx gene regulators, etc. (n = 14). We found 5 pharmacogenetic
   variants present at >50\% among 8 ethnic groups of Pakistan. These
   pharmacogenetic variants include CYP2B6 (rs2279345, C; 70\%-86\%),
   CYP3A5 (rs776746, C; 64\%-88\%), FLT3 (rs1933437, T; 54\%-74\%), CETP
   (rs1532624, A; 50\%-70\%), and DPP6 (rs6977820, C; 61\%-86\%) genes that
   are involved in drug response for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
   transplantation, cancer, heart disease, and mental health therapy,
   respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights the frequency of
   important clinical pharmacogenetic variants (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) among
   multi-ethnic Pakistani populations. The high prevalence (>50\%) of
   single nucleotide pharmacogenetic variants may contribute to the drug
   response/diseases outcome. These PGx data could be used as
   pharmacogenetic markers in the selection of appropriate therapeutic
   regimens for specific ethnic groups of Pakistan.},

Title = {BioAlign: An Accurate Global PPI Network Alignment Algorithm},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Motivation: The advancement of high-throughput PPI profiling techniques
   results in generating a large amount of PPI data. The alignment of the
   PPI networks uncovers the relationship between the species that can help
   understand the biological systems. The comparative study reveals the
   conserved biological interactions of the proteins across the species. It
   can also help study the biological pathways and signal networks of the
   cells. Although several network alignment algorithms are developed to
   study and compare the PPI data, the development of the aligner that
   aligns the PPI networks with high biological similarity and coverage is
   still challenging. Results: This paper presents a novel global network
   alignment algorithm, BioAlign, that incorporates a significant amount of
   biological information. Existing studies use global sequence and/or
   3D-structure similarity to align the PPI networks. In contrast, BioAlign
   uses the local sequence similarity, predicted secondary structure
   motifs, and remote homology in addition to global sequence and
   3D-structure similarity. The extra sources of biological information
   help BioAlign to align the proteins with high biological similarity.
   BioAlign produces significantly better results in terms of AFS and
   Coverage (6-32 and 7-34 with respect to MF and BP, respectively) than
   the existing algorithms. BioAlign aligns a much larger number of
   proteins that have high biological similarities as compared to the
   existing aligners. BioAlign helps in studying the functionally similar
   protein pairs across the species.},

Title = {In Silico Identification and Characterization of B12D Family Proteins in
   Viridiplantae},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {B12D family proteins are transmembrane proteins that contain the B12D
   domain involved in membrane trafficking. Plants comprise several members
   of the B12D family, but these members' numbers and specific functions
   are not determined. This study aims to identify and characterize the
   members of B12D protein family in plants. Phytozome database was
   retrieved for B12D proteins from 14 species. The total 66 B12D proteins
   were analyzed in silico for gene structure, motifs, gene expression,
   duplication events, and phylogenetics. In general, B12D proteins are
   between 86 and 98 aa in length, have 2 or 3 exons, and comprise a single
   transmembrane helix. Motif prediction and multiple sequence alignment
   show strong conservation among B12D proteins of 11 flowering plants
   species. Despite that, the phylogenetic tree revealed a distinct cluster
   of 16 B12D proteins that have high conservation across flowering plants.
   Motif prediction revealed 41 aa motif conserved in 58 of the analyzed
   B12D proteins similar to the bZIP motif, confirming that in the
   predicted biological process and molecular function, B12D proteins are
   DNA-binding proteins. Cis-regulatory elements screening in putative B12D
   promoters found various responsive elements for light, abscisic acid,
   methyl jasmonate, cytokinin, drought, and heat. Despite that, there is
   specific elements for cold stress, cell cycle, circadian, auxin,
   salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid in the promoter of a few B12D genes
   indicating for functional diversification for B12D family members. The
   digital expression shows that B12D genes of Glycine max have similar
   expression patterns consistent with their clustering in the phylogenetic
   tree. However, the expression of B12D genes of Hordeum vulgure appears
   inconsistent with their clustering in the tree. Despite the strong
   conservation of the B12D proteins of Viridiplantae, gene association
   analysis, promoter analysis, and digital expression indicate different
   roles for the members of the B12D family during plant developmental
   stages.},

Title = {Stability of scRNA-Seq Analysis Workflows is Susceptible to
   Preprocessing and is Mitigated by Regularized or Supervised Approaches},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statistical methods developed to address various questions
   in single-cell datasets show increased variability to different
   parameter regimes. In order to delineate further the robustness of
   commonly utilized methods for single-cell RNA-Seq. we aimed to
   comprehensively review scRNA-Seq analysis workflows in the setting of
   dimension reduction. clustering, and trajectory inference.
   METHODS: We utilized datasets with temporal single-cell transcriptomics
   profiles from public repositories. Combining multiple methods at each
   level of the workflow, we have performed over 6k analysis and evaluated
   the results of clustering and pseudotime estimation using adjusted rand
   index and rank correlation metrics. We have further integrated neural
   network methods to assess whether models with increased complexity can
   show increased bias/variance trade-off.
   RESULTS: Combinatorial workflows showed that utilizing non-linear
   dimension reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are sensitive to
   initial preprocessing steps hence clustering results on dimension
   reduced space of single-cell datasets should be utilized carefully.
   Similarly. pseudotime estimation methods that depend on previous
   non-linear dimension reduction steps can result in highly variable
   trajectories. In contrast, methods that avoid non-linearity such as WOT
   can result in repeatable inferences of temporal gene expression
   dynamics. Furthermore. imputation methods do not improve clustering or
   trajectory inference results substantially in terms of repeatability. In
   contrast, the selection of the normalization method shows an increased
   effect on downstream analysis where ScTransform reduces variability
   overall.},

Title = {Construction of a Prognostic Nomogram Based on Autophagy-Related Genes
   for Children With Neuroblastoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid malignancy in children. MYCN
   gene amplification is the most relevant genetic alteration in patients
   with NB and is associated with poor prognosis. Autophagy plays specific
   roles in the occurrence, development, and progression of NB. Here, we
   aimed to identify and assess the prognostic effects of autophagy-related
   genes (ARGs) in patients with NB and MYCN gene amplification.
   Differentially expressed ARGs were identified in patients with NB with
   and without MYCN gene amplification, and the ARG expression patterns and
   related clinical data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to
   Generate Effective Treatments database were used as the training cohort.
   Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses were used to
   identify prognostic ARGs associated with event-free survival (EFS), and
   a prognostic risk score model was developed. Model performance was
   assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves. The prognostic ARG mode l was verified
   using the validation cohort dataset, GSE49710. Finally, a nomogram was
   constructed by combining the ARGbased risk score with
   clinicopathological factors. Three ARGs (GABARAPL1, NBR1, and PINK1)
   were selected to build a prognostic risk score model. The EFS in the
   low-risk group was significantly better than that in the high-risk group
   in both the training and validation cohorts. A nomogram incorporating
   the prognostic risk score, age, and International Neuroblastoma Staging
   System stage showed a favorable predictive ability for EFS rates
   according to the area under the ROC curve at 3 years (AUC = 0.787) and 5
   years (AUC = 0.787). The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination and
   calibration. Our risk score model for the 3 ARGs can be used as an
   independent prognostic factor in patients with NB and MYCN gene
   amplification. The model can accurately predict the 3- and 5-year
   survival rates.},

Title = {Screening of Important Markers in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells to
   Predict Female Osteoporosis Risk Using LASSO Regression Algorithm and
   SVM Method},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the patient's
   risk of fracture. We aimed to identify robust marker genes related to
   osteoporosis based on different bioinformatic methods and multiple
   datasets. Methods: Three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
   were utilized for analysis separately. Significantly differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) from comparing high hip and low hip low bone
   mineral density (BMD) groups in the first dataset were identified for
   Gene Ontology (GO), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto
   encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) to investigate the discrepantly
   enriched biological processes between high hip and low hip group. Last
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), SVM model and
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network were performed and
   generated robust marker genes for downstream TF-target and miRNA-target
   prediction. Results: Several DEGs between high hip BMD group and low hip
   BMD group were obtained. And the metabolism-related pathways such as
   metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
   metabolism shown enrichment in these DEGs. Integration with LASSO
   regression analysis, 8 differential expression genes (SH3BP1, NARF,
   ANKRD34B, RNF40, ZNF473, AKT1, SHMT1, and VASH1) in GSE62402 were
   identified as the optimal differential genes combination. Moreover, the
   SVM validation analysis in GSE56814 and GSE56815 datasets showed that
   the characteristic gene combinations presented high diagnostic effects,
   and the model AUC areas for GSE56814 was 0.899 and for GSE56815 was
   0.921. Furthermore, the subcellular localization analysis of the 8 genes
   revealed that 4 proteins were located in the cytoplasm, 3 proteins were
   located in the nucleus, and 1 protein was located in the mitochondria.
   Additionally, the related TFs and miRNAs by performing TF-target and
   miRNA-target prediction for 5 genes (AKT1, SHMT1, ZNF473, RNF40 and
   VASH1) were investigated from PPI network. Conclusion: The optimal
   differential genes combination (SH3BP1, NARF, ANKRD34B, RNF40, ZNF473,
   AKT1, SHMT1, and VASH1) presented high diagnostic effect for
   osteoporosis risk.},

   Breast Cancer Based on exoRBase},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: To construct a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory
   network derived from exosomes of human breast cancer (BC) by using the
   exoRbase database, to explore the possible pathogenesis of BC, and to
   develop new targets for future diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The
   exosomal gene sequencing data of BC patients and normal controls were
   downloaded from the exoRbase database, and the expression profiles of
   exosomal mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA)
   were analyzed by using R language. Use Targetscan and miRanda database
   to jointly predict and differentially express miRNA (microRNA), miRNA
   combined with mRNA. The miRcode database was used to predict the miRNA
   combined with differentially expressed lncRNA, and the starBase database
   was used to predict the miRNA combined with circRNA in the difference
   table. The related mRNA, circRNA, lncRNA, and their corresponding miRNA
   prediction data were imported into Cytoscape software to visualize the
   ceRNA network. Enrichment analysis and visualization of KEGG were
   carried out using KOBAS. Hub gene was determined by Cytohubba plug-in.
   Results: Forty-two differentially expressed mRNA, 43 differentially
   expressed circRNA, and 26 differentially expressed lncRNA were screened
   out. The ceRNA network was constructed by using Cytoscape software,
   including 19 mRNA nodes, 2 lncRNA nodes, 8 circRNA nodes, and 41 miRNA
   nodes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed
   mRNA in the regulatory network mainly enriched the p53 signaling
   pathway. Find the key Hub gene PTEN. Conclusion: The ceRNA regulatory
   network in blood exosomes of BC patients has been successfully
   constructed in this study, which provides an exact target for the
   diagnosis and treatment of BC.},

   studied the low expression level of SDF2L1 in NPC, but the molecular
   mechanism of SDF2L1 in NPC needs further elucidation. To identify
   phosphorylated proteins regulated by SDF2L1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
   (NPC), Label-free Quantitative (LFQ) Proteomics and 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis
   were performed on high metastatic NPC 5-8F cells with overexpression of
   SDF2L1 and empty segment. Western blotting was applied to validate the
   differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPPs). As a result,
   331 DEPPs were identified by proteomics, and PARVA phosphorylation
   (ser8) was validated. The present results suggested that PARVA
   phosphorylation may be a new promising biomarker for predicting NPC and

Title = {Bioinformatics Analysis Identifies Potential Related Genes in the
   Pathogenesis of Intrauterine Fetal Growth Retardation},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) affects approximately
   10\% to 15\% of all pregnancies worldwide. IUGR is not only associated
   with stillbirth and newborn death, but also the delay of cognition in
   childhood and the promotion of metabolic and vascular disorders in
   adulthood. Figuring out the mechanism of IUGR is rather meaningful and
   valuable. Methods: Datasets related to IUGR were searched in the Gene
   Expression Omnibus website. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used
   for normalization. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out
   using the ggpot2 tool. DEGs were used to conduct Gene Ontology (GO)
   terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
   enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis.
   IUGR related genes were searched in the OMIM website to look for the
   intersection with the DEGs. The DEGs were analyzed for tissue-specific
   expression by the online resource BioGPS. The results were displayed
   through volcano map, Venn map, box plot, heat map, and GSEA enrichment
   plots drawn by R language packages. Results: Eleven DEGs were screened
   out of 2 datasets. One hundred ninety-five genes related to IUGR in OMIM
   were retrieved. EGR2 was the only intersection gene that was found in
   both groups. Genes associated with placental tissue expression include
   COL17A1, HSD11B1, and LGALS14. Molecular functions of the DEGs are
   related to the oxidoreductase activity. The following 4 signaling
   pathways, reactome signaling by interleukins, reactome collagen
   degradation, Naba secreted factors, and PID NFAT tfpathway, were
   enriched by GSEA. Two critical modules comprising 5 up-regulated genes
   (LEP, PRL, TAC3, MMP14, and ADAMTS4) and 4 down-regulated genes (TIMP4,
   FOS, CCK, and KISS1) were identified by PPI analysis. Finally, we
   identified 6 genes (PRL, LGALS14, EGR2, TAC3, LEP, and KISS1) that are
   potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of IUGR. Conclusion: The
   candidate down-regulated genes LGALS14 and KISS1, as well as the
   up-regulated genes PRL, EGR2, TAC3, and LEP, were found to be closely
   related to IUGR by bioinformatics analysis. These hub genes are related
   to hypoxia and oxidoreductase activities in placental development. We
   provide useful and novel information to explore the potential mechanism
   of IUGR and make efforts to the prevention of IUGR.},

Title = {Seasonal Diversity of Microeukaryotes in the Han River, Korea Through
   18S rRNA Gene Metabarcoding},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems contain a large diversity of microeukaryotes that
   play important roles in maintaining their structure. Microeukaryote
   communities vary in composition and abundance on the basis of temporal
   and environmental variables and may serve as useful bioindicators of
   environmental changes. In the present study, 18S rRNA metabarcoding was
   employed to investigate the seasonal diversity of microeukaryote
   communities during four seasons in the Han River, Korea. In total, 882
   unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, including
   various diatoms, metazoans (e.g., arthropods and rotifers),
   chlorophytes, and fungi. Although alpha diversity revealed insignificant
   differences based on seasons, beta diversity exhibited a prominent
   variation in the community composition as per seasons. The analysis
   revealed that the diversity of microeukaryotes was primarily driven by
   seasonal changes in the prevailing conditions of environmental water
   temperature and dissolved oxygen. Moreover, potential indicator OTUs
   belonging to diatoms and chlorophytes were associated with seasonal and
   environmental factors. This analysis was a preliminary study that
   established a continuous monitoring system using metabarcoding. This
   approach could be an effective tool to manage the Han River along with
   other freshwater ecosystems in Korea.},

   Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Lymphoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of chronic, non-healing wounds is challenging and
   time-consuming because it can be caused by a variety of etiologies. This
   brief report presents an unusual case of a chronic wound lasting for 10
   months investigated by deep metagenomic sequencing. Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV) was identified in the wound and subsequently validated by in situ
   hybridization. Histopathologic examination eventually revealed that the
   non-healing wound was due to an EBV-associated NK/T cell lymphoma. By
   identifying mutations across the viral genome, the virus was classified
   as Type I EBV and clustered with others of geographic proximity. Our
   results suggest that metagenomic shotgun sequencing can not only rapidly
   and accurately identify the presence of underlying pathogens but also
   provide strain-level resolution for the surveillance of viral
   epidemiology.},

Title = {Investigating the Genomic Background of CRISPR-Cas Genomes for
   CRISPR-Based Antimicrobials},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {CRISPR-Cas systems are an adaptive immunity that protects prokaryotes
   against foreign genetic elements. Genetic templates acquired during past
   infection events enable DNA-interacting enzymes to recognize foreign DNA
   for destruction. Due to the programmability and specificity of these
   genetic templates, CRISPR-Cas systems are potential alternative
   antibiotics that can be engineered to self-target antimicrobial
   resistance genes on the chromosome or plasmid. However, several
   fundamental questions remain to repurpose these tools against
   drug-resistant bacteria. For endogenous CRISPR-Cas self-targeting,
   antimicrobial resistance genes and functional CRISPR-Cas systems have to
   co-occur in the target cell. Furthermore, these tools have to outplay
   DNA repair pathways that respond to the nuclease activities of Cas
   proteins, even for exogenous CRISPR-Cas delivery. Here, we conduct a
   comprehensive survey of CRISPR-Cas genomes. First, we address the
   co-occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems and antimicrobial resistance genes
   in the CRISPR-Cas genomes. We show that the average number of these
   genes varies greatly by the CRISPR-Cas type, and some CRISPR-Cas types
   (IE and IIIA) have over 20 genes per genome. Next, we investigate the
   DNA repair pathways of these CRISPR-Cas genomes, revealing that the
   diversity and frequency of these pathways differ by the CRISPR-Cas type.
   The interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA repair pathways is
   essential for the acquisition of new spacers in CRISPR arrays. We
   conduct simulation studies to demonstrate that the efficiency of these
   DNA repair pathways may be inferred from the time-series patterns in the
   RNA structure of CRISPR repeats. This bioinformatic survey of CRISPR-Cas
   genomes elucidates the necessity to consider multifaceted interactions
   between different genes and systems, to design effective CRISPR-based
   antimicrobials that can specifically target drug-resistant bacteria in
   natural microbial communities.},

   Prognostic Model in Osteosarcoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in
   clinical practice, and currently, the ability to predict prognosis in
   the diagnosis of OS is limited. There is an urgent need to find new
   diagnostic methods and treatment strategies for OS. Material and
   methods: We downloaded the multi-omics data for OS from the TARGET
   database. Prognosis-associated methylation sites were used to identify
   clustered subtypes of OS, and OS was classified into 3 subtypes (C1, C2,
   C3). Survival analysis showed significant differences between the C3
   subtype and the other subtypes. Subsequently, differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) across subtypes were screened and subjected to pathway
   enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 249 DEGs were screened from C3
   subtype to other subtypes. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis showed
   that DEGs were significantly enriched to the hypoxic pathway. Based on
   univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis, 12 genes from the
   hypoxia pathway were further screened and used to construct
   hypoxia-related prognostic model (HRPM). External validation of the HRPM
   was performed on the GSE21257 dataset. Finally, differences in survival
   and immune infiltration between high and low risk score groups were
   compared. Conclusion: In summary, we proposed a hypoxia-associated risk
   model based on a 12-gene expression signature, which is potentially
   valuable for prognostic diagnosis of patients with OS.},

Title = {Computational Structural and Functional Analyses of ORF10 in Novel
   Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Variants to Understand Evolutionary Dynamics},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction: In an effort to combat SARS-CoV-2 through multi-subunit
   vaccine design, during studies using whole genome and immunome, ORF10,
   located at the 3 ` end of the genome, displayed unique features. It
   showed no homology to any known protein in other organisms, including
   SARS-CoV. It was observed that its nucleotide sequence is 100\%
   identical in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sourced worldwide, even in the
   recent-most VoCs and VoIs of B.1.1.529 (Omicron), B.1.617 (Delta),
   B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) lineages, implicating
   its constant nature throughout the evolution of deadly variants. Aim:
   The structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 and the role it may play
   in the viral evolution is yet to be understood clearly. The aim of this
   study is to predict its structure, function, and understand evolutionary
   dynamics on the basis of mutations and likely heightened immune
   responses in the immunopathogenesis of this deadly virus. Methods:
   Sequence analysis, ab-initio structure modeling and an understanding of
   the impact of likely substitutions in key regions of protein was carried
   out. Analyses of viral T cell epitopes and primary anchor residue
   mutations was done to understand the role it may play in the evolution
   as a molecule with likely enhanced immune response and consequent
   immunopathogenesis. Results: Few amino acid substitution mutations are
   observed, most probably due to the ribosomal frameshifting, and these
   mutations may not be detrimental to its functioning. As ORF10 is
   observed to be an expressed protein, ab-initio structure modeling shows
   that it comprises mainly an alpha-helical region and maybe an
   ER-targeted membrane mini-protein. Analyzing the whole proteome, it is
   observed that ORF10 presents amongst the highest number of likely
   promiscuous and immunogenic CTL epitopes, specifically 11 out of 30
   promiscuous ones and 9 out of these 11, immunogenic CTL epitopes.
   Reactive T cells to these epitopes have been uncovered in independent
   studies. Majority of these epitopes are located on the alpha-helix
   region of its structure, and the substitution mutations of primary
   anchor residues in these epitopes do not affect immunogenicity. Its
   conserved nucleotide sequence throughout the evolution and
   diversification of virus into several variants is a puzzle yet to be
   solved. Conclusions: On the basis of its sequence, structure, and
   epitope mapping, it is concluded that it may function like those
   mini-proteins used to boost immune responses in medical applications.
   Due to complete nucleotide sequence conservation even a few years after
   SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced, it poses a unique puzzle to be
   solved, in view of the evolutionary dynamics of variants emerging in the
   populations worldwide.},

   profile of the Zika virus envelope proteins (E) was obtained and since
   the Zika virus polyproteins were also identified with this profile, the
   proteins defined as ``reviewed proteins{''} extracted from the UniProt
   Database were searched for the similar PIM profile. Finally, the
   difference between the PIM profiles of the Zika virus polyproteins and
   their envelope proteins (E) was tested using 2 non-parametric
   statistical tests. Results: It was found and tested that the PIM profile
   is an efficient discriminant that allows obtaining a ``computational
   fingerprint{''} of each Zika virus polyprotein from its envelope protein
   (E). Conclusion: PIM profile represents a computational tool, which can
   be used to effectively discover Zika virus polyproteins from Databases,
   from their envelope proteins (E) sequences.},

   as the Mechanism of Complexity Increase During Progressive Evolution},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The idea of computational processes, which take place in nature, for
   example, DNA computation, is discussed in the literature. DNA
   computation that is going on in the immunoglobulin locus of vertebrates
   shows how the computations in the biological possibility space could
   operate during evolution. We suggest that the origin of evolutionarily
   novel genes and genome evolution constitute the original intrinsic
   computation of the information about new structures in the space of
   unrealized biological possibilities. Due to DNA computation, the
   information about future structures is generated and stored in DNA as
   genetic information. In evolving ontogenies, search algorithms are
   necessary, which can search for information about evolutionary
   innovations and morphological novelties. We believe that such algorithms
   include stochastic gene expression, gene competition, and compatibility
   search at different levels of structural organization. We formulate the
   increase in complexity principle in terms of biological computation and
   hypothesize the possibility of in silico computing of future functions
   of evolutionarily novel genes.},

Title = {Limited dispersal ability and restricted niche characterize
   ?depauperons? in Melastomataceae},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The asymmetric pattern in species richness is a notable feature across
   different lineages and geographic regions. While some lineages have high
   richness, diversity and wide distribution, others have the opposite.
   Despite low rates of diversification, the latter might also be
   phylogenetically isolated. Lineages that accumulate these
   characteristics are known as ``depauperons{''} and explaining their
   existence and persistence through time is still a challenge. The plant
   family Melastomataceae contains both megadiverse lineages (such as the
   tribe Miconieae, with around 1900 species) and groups with few species
   (such as the tribes Eriocnemeae, Lithobieae, and Rupestreeae with 7, 1
   and 2 species, respectively). These three clades are restricted to
   eastern Brazil, where they have been seldom studied. The lack of
   information about their basic biology as well as which processes
   determine their distribution have not been previously studied. Here we
   integrated metrics of dispersal ability, species distribution models
   (SDMs) and natural history data compilation in order to uncover common
   patterns shared by these depauperons in Melastomataceae and raise
   conservation concerns. For all nine species we estimated the dispersal
   ability and generated SDMs in different time-periods (past, present and
   future). Dispersal ability was associated with predicted distribution
   models under future scenarios to evaluate shifts and/or retractions in
   suitable areas. In addition, we compared the climatic tolerances of the
   depauperons with their megadiverse sister tribes via climatic envelopes.
   Overall, our results indicate limited dispersal ability, dependency on
   water for dispersal, and restricted niche as common characteristics for
   all species in the deupauperon tribes Eriocnemeae, Lithobieae and
   Rupestreeae. Our analyses also show that the climatic niche spaces of
   the depauperons are limited and totally included within the niche space
   of its sister tribes. Based on our findings, the level of threat in
   these groups can be potentiated by rapid climate change, mainly due to
   their inability to spread over long distances, restricted niches and
   increased habitat fragmentation. We suggest that future conservational
   actions prioritize these unique taxa in Melastomataceae, especially if a
   phylogenetic diversity perspective is taken into account.},

Title = {A case for studying biotic interactions in epiphyte ecology and
   evolution},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biotic interactions are widely accepted as an important driver of
   ecological and evolutionary patterns, contributing to the structure of
   systems as diverse as tropical tree seedlings, intertidal barnacles, and
   wildflower pollinator networks. Species interactions within a trophic
   level, such as competition and facilitation, can drive patterns of
   community change over time, yielding both fundamental ecological
   theories of succession as well as insight vital to predicting
   biodiversity conservation priorities. One system in which biotic
   interactions are poorly explored is epiphytes, or structurally
   dependent, non-parasitic organisms. This is a topic of broad interest
   because epiphytes-including vascular plants, bryophytes, and
   lichens-exist in practically all terrestrial ecosystems throughout the
   world. From lichens acting as pollution-sensitive indicator species in
   urbanized landscapes, to the multimillion-dollar commercial market for
   horticultural bromeliads, to tropical orchids representing striking
   examples of rapid speciation, epiphytes make substantial contributions
   to theory, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the global economy.
   This review is the first to broadly synthesize the underlying biotic
   interactions important to epiphyte ecology and evolution. We first draw
   from theory to discuss where and when biotic or abiotic processes are
   likely stronger drivers of epiphyte dynamics. We then systematically
   review the literature across the major interaction modes, highlighting
   areas where different groups of epiphytes (e.g., vascular versus
   nonvascular) and ecosystems have contrasting patterns or expectations.
   Throughout, we illustrate where research efforts have focused and where
   large gaps in knowledge exist. Our review is organized around the major
   biotic interactions, rather than the specific organisms interacting with
   the epiphytes, to highlight general processes and set epiphytism within
   the framework of ecological and evolutionary theory. Our review
   encompasses pollination and dispersal, intratrophic facilitation and
   competition, mycorrhizal mutualisms, epiphyte-host interactions,
   parasitism and pathogens, and herbivory, focusing on the impact of these
   interactions on the epiphyte. Finally, we provide a simple conceptual
   framework distilling open questions in the field, expand our findings to
   the community and ecosystem level, and summarize the biodiversity
   conservation implications of ignoring biotic interactions in epiphytes.
   Our synthesis brings together currently disparate literature from
   tropical and temperate systems on vascular and nonvascular plants and
   lichens. We hope our review stimulates further research and inspires
   cross-disciplinary collaboration.},

Title = {The Eurasian badger-generated seed rain drives the natural
   (re)colonization of vacant human-altered areas by a keystone pioneer
   palm},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Seed dispersal is an essential ecological process for plant
   (re)colonization, especially in intensively humanaltered habitats such
   as old-fields (i.e. abandoned farmlands) where seed arrival is often
   limited. Assessment of spatial patterns of mammal-generated seed rain
   and their matching with the spatial distribution of adult plants
   provides essential information on the patterns and pace of the
   (re)colonization processes. For instance, increased seedling survival
   far from adult plants could indicate density-dependent mortality
   (Janzen-Connell) effects whereas increased survival close to adult
   plants could suggest facilitative effects. Here, we characterized during
   two dispersal seasons the spatial distribution of feces from four
   frugivorous mammals and quantified its spatial association with the
   distribution of adult plants of the pioneer Mediterranean dwarf palm
   (Chamaerops humilis) in two old-fields in southwestern Spain. We also
   estimated the dispersal kernels of both emerged and surviving seedlings
   and assessed potential evidence for Janzen-Connell and/or facilitative
   effects. Using a spatially explicit approach, we revealed strong
   differences between study sites in the strength and scale of spatial
   associations between mammal feces with C. humilis seeds and adult dwarf
   palms, being strongly positive at small scales in one site and slightly
   positive at larger scales in the other one. Further, we found some
   evidence of both JanzenConnell and facilitative effects depending on the
   study site. Altogether, our results emphasize the central role as seed
   disperser of the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) in the natural
   (re)colonization of Mediterranean old-fields and the spatial variations
   of the underlying mechanisms and demographic consequences for plant
   populations.},

Abstract = {Grime's CSR classification of functional strategies in terms of
   competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals provides a helpful framework
   for understanding and predicting vegetation responses to environmental
   changes. To evaluate the importance of alternative processes that
   structure plant communities, it is useful to disentangle the community
   functional variation into interspecific and intraspecific components and
   assess their degree of covariation. Few efforts have been made to
   investigate the habitat filtering theory in all the interspecific and
   intraspecific components of a plant community. We hypothesized that
   under intense climatic conditions, such as drought and cold, functional
   diversity would decrease towards the dominance of stress tolerant
   strategies, and that such trends would be reinforced by similar
   variation at the intraspecific level. We investigated the effect of
   climatic variation on functional diversity and on community-weighted
   mean along an elevation gradient in central Italy that ranges from dry
   and warm climatic conditions at lower elevation to cold and moist ones
   at higher elevation. We ran regression models to disentangle the total
   community components for both functional diversity and
   community-weighted mean into interspecific effect, intraspecific effect
   and their covariation along the climatic gradient. Our observations were
   in line with the theory of habitat filtering: we found lower diversity
   of the Grime strategy for species at both warmer and colder climatic
   conditions, with dominance of the stresstolerant strategy. Similarly,
   the intraspecific effect was lower in cold conditions but higher under
   drier conditions, which seems to indicate that different processes act
   at the level of individuals. Given the important intraspecific
   variability observed in this study, it can be proposed that
   investigations of vegetation communities should take the role of
   intraspecific variability into greater consideration.},

Title = {Patterns of introduction, naturalisation, invasion, and impact differ
   between fleshy- and dry-fruited species of Myrtaceae},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent studies on patterns of biological invasions in several plant
   families have confirmed general findings (e.g., taxa with larger native
   range sizes are more likely to become invasive; and taxa with longer
   residence time in new regions are more likely to naturalise) and
   highlighted some context-specific findings relevant for management
   (e.g., resistance to Phytophthora is a pre-requisite for successful
   naturalisation in Proteaceae). We explore these issues for the plant
   family Myrtaceae, specifically by contrasting taxa with fleshy fruits
   with those with dry fruits to develop hypotheses around the role of seed
   dispersal in the invasion process. To this end we: 1) compiled a
   comprehensive list of introduced Myrtaceae; 2) determined the degree of
   establishment of each species in its introduced range; 3) compared the
   distribution of native, introduced, and invasive ranges; 4) assessed
   traits associated with the degree of establishment; and 5) assessed the
   magnitude and types of impacts of invasive Myrtaceae. A slightly higher
   proportion of dry-fruited species have been introduced than
   fleshy-fruited species {[}170 out of 2257 (7.5 \%) vs. 236 out of 3741
   (6.7 \%)], though the difference was not significant. However,
   introduced dry-fruited Myrtaceae have naturalised more frequently than
   fleshy-fruited taxa {[}90 out of 170 (53 \%) vs. 40 out of 236 (17 \%)],
   whereas naturalised dry-fruited taxa have become invasive at a lower
   rate {[}22 out of 90 (24 \%) vs. 18 out of 40 (46 \%)]. Invasions of
   fleshy-fruited taxa seem to be more common on islands. Although
   invasions by fleshy-and dry-fruited species had similar impact
   mechanisms and magnitudes, naturalised fleshy-fruited Myrtaceae are more
   likely to have impacts on islands than dry-fruited confamilials.
   Synthesis Fleshy-and dry-fruited taxa of Myrtaceae differ in rates of
   transition along the invasion continuum and where invasions and impacts
   occur. We speculate that seed dispersal abilities, lack of competitors,
   and the availability of areas suitable for germination might explain
   these differences.},

Title = {A unique diploid-triploid contact zone provides insights into the
   evolutionary mechanisms of cytotype coexistence in flowering rush
   (Butomus umbellatus)},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Polyploidisation is an important evolutionary force in land plants. Due
   to its recurrent incidence, many plant species retain individuals of two
   or more different ploidy levels. However, particular ecological and
   evolutionary mechanisms facilitating intraspecific cytotype coexistence
   have been identified for just a handful of species and cannot yet be
   generalised. Our pilot data have revealed a unique complex of mixed
   diploid-triploid populations of the marshland perennial Butomus
   umbellatus in the Eastern Slovak Lowland (eastern Central Europe).
   Intensive flow-cytometric ploidy screening of 1,230 individuals sampled
   from 72 populations was conducted at both regional and local
   (within-population) scales to assess cytotype distribution patterns.
   Vegetation assessments along with phenotypic comparisons of cytotypes
   directly in the field and later under common garden cultivation served
   to provide insight into mechanisms of cytotype coexistence. Altogether
   42 \% of the sampled populations were mixed-ploidy, pointing to
   unexpectedly high rates of diploid-triploid coexistence. While the
   cytotype distribution was random at the regional scale, significant
   spatial clustering occurred at the local scale. No ecological niche
   differences between the cytotypes were detected. Triploids attained
   greater values of several morphological characters both in the field and
   under cultivation, differences in the shape of inner tepals even show
   potential for cytotype discrimination. Both cytotypes exhibited high and
   comparable investments into clonal traits, reproductive assurance
   provided by asexual reproduction likely plays a key role in cytotype
   coexistence and triploid predominance. The common cytotype coexistence
   in this region seems to be also facilitated by periodical seasonal
   floods promoting transport of vegetative propagules among populations
   (i.e. metapopulation dynamics) and providing long-term continuity of
   favourable sites by recurrent disturbances.},

Abstract = {Among the fascinating and highly specialized vascular plants in the
   hyperarid core of the Chilean and Peruvian Atacama Desert there are few
   Tillandsia species from the bromeliad family (Bromeliaceae). These grow
   epiarenically on bare sand without a functional root system, and in some
   rare cases they build up a monospecific and often the only landscape
   characterizing vegetation type, which is called Tillandsiales or
   Tillandsia loma. Tillandsia landbeckii is the dominating epiarenic
   species in Chile totally dependent on fog serving as the only water
   resource. Herein we elaborate on the hypothesis that migration and
   multiple colonization in concert with putative introgression from other
   Tillandsia species build up the present day phylogeographic distribution
   pattern and may contribute to the evolutionary dynamics and long-term
   success in hyperarid desert systems. Genomic analyses using GBS
   (genotyping-by-sequencing) data from the nuclear and plastid genome were
   conducted at the population level. A genome skimming approach was used
   to generate reference plastome data. The results indicate that both,
   multiple colonization and secondary contact of old gene pools and
   interspecies geneflow, contribute to present-day population genetic
   structure. Local-scale analysis also indicates that these past
   footprints of evolutionary history do contribute to present-day local
   adaptive potential of the species.},

Title = {Robust methods are needed to resolve contradictions in species richness
   curves along ecological gradients},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nonmonotonic changes in species richness along ecological gradients are
   frequently observed in nature. While theories support both symmetric and
   skewed unimodal relationships, related studies usually fit second-order
   polynomials, which assume symmetric relationships. These studies often
   apply various transformations of the predictor variable to reduce the
   effects of outliers or to meet assumptions of normality. We studied
   whether predictor transformation affects the shape of the fitted curves.
   To test the effect of predictor transformation on the shape of the
   fitted curves, we re-analyzed the dataset of a highly-cited global
   analysis on the productivi-ty-species richness relationship without
   performing any data transformations and contrasted the results with
   those of the original analyses that used log-transformed productivity
   data. We found that predictor variable transformation, which was used in
   the original paper, changed the shape of fitted curves in 32 \% of the
   sites as well as the shape of the global relationship compared to the
   use of untransformed data. Therefore, we propose the reconsideration of
   predictor transformation and suggest an alternative approach: the
   piecewise regression. We found that piecewise regression is robust
   against predictor variable transformation. It resulted in much fewer
   inconsistent shape categories between the transformed and untransformed
   cases compared to the original ana -lyses (2 instead of 9). We suggest
   that studies applying untransformed and transformed predictors when
   studying the shape of species richness curves along gradients are not
   directly comparable. Using piecewise regression models may contribute
   toward resolving the ongoing debate on the change in species richness
   along ecological gradients in general, and the productivity-species
   richness relationship in particular.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Campo rupestre and campo de altitude are two highly diverse plant
   formations that are found in montane areas in eastern Brazil. These
   formations are associated with landscapes having different geological
   histories and are part of different phytogeographic domains under
   different climatic conditions. It is unclear however, whether line-ages
   in each area have different diversification dynamics and climatic niche
   evolution. Here we analyze biogeographical history, climatic niche
   evolution and diversification dynamics of the Cambessedesieae
   (Mela-stomataceae), a clade with many endemics in each formation. We use
   a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree alongside carefully curated
   distribution points to estimate ancestral ranges and compare
   diversification dynamics and climatic niche evolution across the group,
   using models of geographical range evolution (BioGeoBEARS),
   diversification dynamics (BAMM, GeoSSE) and trait-evolution (l1ou). Our
   results show that Cambessedesieae is a relatively old (Early Eocene, 48
   Mya) clade in comparison to other lineages of similar distribution. An
   initial split between lineages that are mainly endemic to either
   formation happened earlier, but, surprisingly, these two lineages have
   similar diversification dynamics and climatic niche evolution. Shifts in
   climatic regimes in extant lineages occurred more recently and are not
   associated with changes in diversification rates. Overall, we show that
   lineages endemic to montane areas and having different geological
   histories and in different climatic and phytogeographic contexts can
   have similar diversification patterns.},

Title = {Differential elemental stoichiometry of two Mediterranean evergreen

Abstract = {Leaf nutrient composition and stoichiometry reflect complex interactions
   of the plant with its environment and are useful traits to explore
   ecological processes and relationships. In the present study, the foliar
   elemental compositions of two common Mediterranean woody species, the
   evergreen broad-leaved Quercus ilex and the coniferous Pinus pinaster
   growing in an area of Central Italy known for geochemical and geothermal
   anomalies, were investigated. To assess the site-specific and
   age-dependent pattern of foliar composition and stoichiometry,
   macronutrients (C, N, P, K, Mg, S) and trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd,
   Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, Zn) were determined in leaves and needles
   of three different ages (6-, 12-and 24-month-old) collected from
   metalliferous (geothermal, mining) and rural areas. Leaves of Q. ilex
   showed comparatively high concentrations of micro-nutrients (i.e., Cu,
   Fe and Zn), while needles of P. pinaster accumulated significantly high
   concentrations of potentially toxic elements (i.e., As, Pb and S). No
   significant trend was found in elemental concentrations in relation to
   the age of leaves and needles. Multi-element stoichiometry of P.
   pinaster was driven by the geochemical heterogeneity of the sites,
   suggesting plastic adaptation at the sites with the most selective
   eda-phoclimatic conditions (i.e., patches with nutrient poor and
   metalliferous soils). On the other hand, the content of both nutrients
   and potentially toxic elements in Q. ilex leaves varied little across
   the study area, reflecting stoichiometric stability; this is consistent
   with the ecophysiological features of Q. ilex as a late-successional
   species with a dominant role in the ecosystems of the Mediterranean
   area. Our findings demonstrate the value of foliar stoichiometric traits
   for understanding plant adaptation in a heterogeneous environment and
   also the consequences of biotic interactions during succession.},

Title = {Phylogenetic conservation and shifts of pollination niche in generalist
   epiphytic cacti},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Plant-pollinator interactions are influenced, among other factors, by
   evolutionary history of the organisms. Thus, closely related species are
   expected to interact with similar pollinator assemblages. The aim of
   this study was to examine the evolution of pollination niches in
   neotropical epiphytic cacti. We recorded floral visitors and determined
   the pollination niche of 11 species of Rhipsalis and one species of
   Hatiora by using bipartite modularity, a metric of complex networks that
   is effective to identify pollination niches. Afterwards we explored how
   these niches evolved along the phylogeny of Rhipsalis. We recorded a
   total of 56 insect species belonging to nine functional groups
   pollinating those species of Rhipsalis. The most frequent floral
   visitors were bees. Pollination systems in Rhipsalis broadly combined a
   high phenotypic floral generalization with moderate richness of
   pollinator species and some functional pollinator group specialization.
   Four pollination niches were identified, mainly characterized by
   variations in the frequency of the functional groups of pollinators. The
   closer the species of Rhipsalis were, the more they interacted with the
   same functional groups of pollinators, as indicated by a positive
   phylogenetic signal for pollinating niches. The most likely ancestral
   pollination niche was associated with short tongued bees. From the niche
   defined by small bees at least three shifts occurred towards the niches
   defined by extra-small bees, short-tongued medium bees, and flies.
   Considering the perspective of the evolution of each pollinator group,
   short-tongued bees were conserved along the branches of Rhipsalis
   phylogeny, with niche broadening or shifts associated with other groups
   such as flies, large bees, wasps, beetles and butterflies. Distinct
   generalist pollination niches have evolved in the genus. Shifts in
   pollination niches were related to differences in floral morphology.
   Moreover, the distribution of pollination niches only partially
   corresponded to the infrageneric classification of Rhipsalis. Our
   results support that generalist pollination systems encompass different
   pollinating niches, which may be consistently distributed across clades
   in angiosperm lineages.},

Title = {Placing Brazil's grasslands and savannas on the map of science and
   conservation},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In Brazil, the country with the highest plant species richness in the
   world, biodiverse savannas and grasslands - i. e., grassy ecosystems,
   which occupy 27\% of the country - have historically been neglected in
   conservation and scientific treatments. Reasons for this neglect include
   misconceptions about the characteristics and dynamics of these
   ecosystems, as well as inconsistent or regionally restricted terminology
   that impeded a more adequate communication about Brazil's savannas and
   grasslands, both within the country and internationally. Toward improved
   communication and recognition of Brazil's diversity of ecosystems, we
   present the key drivers that control the main types of grassy ecosystems
   across Brazil (including in regions of the country where forests
   dominate). In doing so, we synthesize the main features of each grassy
   ecosystem in terms of physiognomy and ecological dynamics (e.g.,
   relationships with herbivores and fire). We propose a terminology both
   for major grassland regions and for regionally relevant vegetation
   physiognomies. We also discuss terms associated with human land
   management and restoration of grassy ecosystems. Finally, we suggest key
   research needs to advance our understanding of the ecology and
   conservation values of Brazil's grassy ecosystems. We expect that a
   common and shared terminology and understanding, as proposed here, will
   stimulate more integrative research that will be fundamental to
   developing improved conservation and restoration strategies.},

Title = {Assessment of weed invasion at bait sites in a Central European lower
   montane zone},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effects of wild game feeding on the local environment have been
   widely investigated in northern European countries but have received
   little consideration in Central Europe. Bait sites, that is, places
   where food is set out to entice wild boar for hunting are becoming ever
   more widespread, and they are having an increasing impact on surrounding
   vegetation. The aim of the present study was to assess the extent of
   weed invasion at different bait types. 3 bait sites located in forests,
   3 baits in clearings and 3 baits on unpaved forest roads in the Central
   European lower montane zone, in Hungary. The field work was conducted in
   May and August. Four transects were laid out (at right angles to each
   other) from the centre of each bait, and consisted of 22 one meter
   square quadrats, in which vegetation survey were conducted. The
   application of multivariate statistical methods (PCA) and UPGMA analysis
   to the data collected revealed substantial differences between the bait
   types. The baits in the forest were the least degraded, with a sparse
   understory cover in both surveys. Road baits displayed a notable
   difference, as they varied depending on canopy closure, accessibility
   and exposure. Sites in clearings proved to be the most infected.
   Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the vegetation
   of the periods examined, arable weeds dominated in August. A stress
   gradient was detected along the transects, with the proportion of weeds
   decreasing from the centre, while the natural components of the
   vegetation increased. The effect was more noticeable in clearings,
   probably due to their greater openness. Invasion is typically limited to
   the immediate environment of the bait sites, but valuable patches of
   habitat can also be destroyed, and bait sites may serve as bridgeheads
   for biological invasions.},

Title = {A first phylogenetic hypothesis for the diverse genus Conophytum
   (Ruschieae, Ruschioideae, Aizoaceae) suggests convergent evolution of
   floral syndromes},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pollinator specialisation is one of the major drivers of angiosperm
   diversification in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South
   Africa. Conophytum (Aizoaceae) is a flagship genus for the underexplored
   arid regions of the GCFR (ca. 108 spp.) with 83.9\% of its species
   endemic to this region and has a floral structure that is unique within
   the rapidly diversified Ruschieae (Aizoaceae). Floral traits, together
   with leaf characters divide the genus into 16 sections. We present here
   the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Conophytum, based on molecular
   data. The combined phylogenetic data for six plastid regions (matK,
   rpl16, rps16, trnL-F, trnQ-rps16 and trnS-trnG) were analysed using
   Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony to test the
   evolution of this floral diversity and current sectional classification.
   Conophytum was recovered as monophyletic including the three small
   genera Berrisfordia L.Bolus, Herreanthus Schwantes and Ophthalmophyllum
   Dinter \& Schwantes. Six strongly supported clades were recovered within
   Conophytum: while several of the sections were broadly retrieved within
   these clades, the more morphologically variable sections such as
   Minuscula and Wettsteinia were not supported by our data. The
   distributions of the six clades largely overlap and are generally
   confined to the arid parts of the GCFR within South Africa, with only
   one clade extending into the southern wetter parts. Ancestral character
   reconstructions showed that floral traits evolved multiple times with
   low phylogenetic signal recovered for autumn-and winter-flowering and
   flower type, while the other traits indicated no phylogenetic signal.
   This lack of phylogenetic signal suggests that drivers of diversity in
   Conophytum are possibly linked to adaptation to pollinators, with a high
   rate of inferred pollination shifts observed, i.e. 1.7 shifts per
   species, mirroring that of Lapeirousia (Iridacaeae) in the GCFR. The
   evolution of unique tubular flowers and shift to autumn-flowering were
   recovered as traits indicating strong phylogenetic signal and may have
   enabled Conophytum to exploit a range of pollinators through
   diversification in floral morphologies.},

Title = {Origin, early expansion, domestication and anthropogenic diffusion of
   Cannabis, with emphasis on Europe and the Iberian Peninsula},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cannabis is among the oldest human domesticates and has been subjected
   to intensive artificial (human-medi-ated) selection throughout history
   to create a wide array of varieties and biotypes for diverse uses,
   including fiber, food, biofuel, medicine and drugs. This paper briefly
   reviews the available literature on the taxonomy, evolutionary origin
   and domestication of this plant, as well as its worldwide dispersal, in
   both its wild and cultivated forms. Emphasis is placed on Europe and
   especially on the Iberian Peninsula. Today, it is accepted that Cannabis
   is a monospecific genus with two subspecies, C. sativa subsp. sativa and
   C. sativa subsp. indica, origi-nating in Europe and Asia, respectively,
   by allopatric differentiation after geographic isolation fostered by
   Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Palynological and
   phylogeographic evidence situates the Cannabis ancestor on the NE
   Tibetan Plateau during the mid-Oligocene. The timing and place of
   domestication is still a matter of debate between contrasting views that
   defend single or multiple Neolithic domestication centers sit-uated in
   different parts of the Eurasian supercontinent, notably
   central/southeastern China and the Caucasus region. Recent meta-analyses
   have suggested that wild Cannabis may have already been spread across
   Europe in the Pleistocene, and its domestication could have occurred
   during the European Copper/Bronze ages. According to the available
   reviews and meta-analyses, pre-anthropic dispersal of Cannabis into the
   Iberian Peninsula seems to have occurred only in postglacial times, and
   the earlier signs of cultivation date to the Early Medieval Ages.
   However, the palynological and archeological evidence used to date is
   insufficient for a sound assessment, and the development of thorough
   Iberian databases to address further meta-analysis is essential for more
   robust conclusions. Some clues are provided for these achievements to be
   fulfilled.},

Title = {Biological Flora of Central Europe: Chondrilla chondrilloides (Ard.) H.
   Karst},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Chondrilla chondrilloides (Asteraceae) is a rare and endangered
   early-successional plant species endemic to the Eastern European Alps.
   Its distribution is restricted to near-natural braided rivers and to
   alluvial fans. The species was common along Alpine gravel rivers, but
   has declined markedly due to river regulation and degradation in the
   19th and 20th century, while some recent restoration projects benefit
   the plant. Its population declines were caused by habitat fragmentation
   and destruction as a consequence of extensive hydro-engineering. This
   paper summarises the published material on taxonomy, morphology, habitat
   requirements and distribution of the species. The review is complemented
   by own research data and a phylogenetic assessment of extant and extinct
   populations within the infrageneric context. A summary on location, size
   and structure of the remaining populations in the north-eastern and
   south-eastern Alps is combined with data on seed germination and the
   habitat niche of the species, with a particular focus on differences
   between northern and southern populations. Chondrilla chondrilloides
   forms meta-populations on consolidated gravel bars and older terraces,
   with extinction and recolonisation due to floodplain dynamics; small
   populations quickly recover from few founder individuals. Populations in
   the southern parts of the species' range are larger with bigger plants
   and more reproduction, while germination is very high in all
   populations. Thus, C. chondrilloides has characteristics that allow it
   to respond rapidly to degradation and restoration of its habitats along
   gravel rivers in the Eastern Alps.},

Title = {Inbreeding depression changes with stress response over time in flooded
   Mimulus guttatus},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Inbreeding usually reduces offspring fitness ('inbreeding depression',
   ID), and may affect the plasticity of functional traits involved in the
   response to stress. ID is often found to increase under stress, but
   there are also reports of no effects or even a reduction of ID under
   stress. One reason for this variation that has received little attention
   may be related to different concepts of stress. In particular, the
   magnitude of ID may be unrelated to the effect of an environment on
   fitness (evolutionary stress concept), but increase particularly during
   the `alarm phase' after a stress has been initiated (physiological
   stress concept). We clonally replicated inbred and outbred Mimulus
   guttatus plants, for which ID was known to increase under flooding. We
   exposed the clonal replicates to control and flooding conditions and
   harvested replicates of each genotype after two, six and 11 weeks of
   growth. As functional traits related to stress response we measured
   chlorophyll fluorescence, root mass and the production of stolons and
   adventitious roots. As fitness estimates we measured biomass and flower
   number, and we pollinated a subset of plants and grew a second
   generation of plants under control and flooding conditions to calculate
   multiplicative fitness. Overall, M. guttatus proved to be very
   flooding-tolerant. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was not influenced
   by flooding, but decreased with leaf age and increased after
   fertilization. At the end of the experiment, biomass and flower number
   (F1 generation) as well as multiplicative fitness (including performance
   in the F2 generation) were even higher under flooding than under control
   conditions. Flooding reduced the root mass in the pots, but increased
   the production of stolons and floating roots. Plasticity in these traits
   can be regarded as beneficial, although selection gradient analysis
   failed to identify plasticity in stolon number as adaptive. Only two
   functional traits were influenced by an interaction between flooding and
   inbreeding, early stolon length (suggesting a reduced flooding escape
   response of inbred plants) and root tissue density of floating
   adventitious roots (suggesting a reduced aeration of the roots of inbred
   offspring). ID in fitness-related traits was higher under flooding, but
   its magnitude changed strongly over the course of the experiment. ID
   under flooding was particularly high after two weeks (8 = 0.42 vs. 0.05
   in the control), suggesting sensitivity of inbred plants to the
   initiation of flooding ('alarm phase' of stress response). This effect
   had disappeared after 6 weeks when plants had acclimated to ongoing
   flooding. However, under flooding ID increased again after 11 weeks,
   this time because outbred plants grew much better under flooded than
   control conditions, and the same pattern was found for the
   multiplicative fitness function (8 = 0.68 under flooding vs. 0.36 in the
   control). Our results suggest that ID was higher under flooding, but not
   because this environment was generally more stressful. Instead, at an
   early stage ID increased because inbred offspring was more sensitive to
   the physiological stress after the initiation of flooding ('alarm
   phase'), whereas at a late stage ID increased because outbred offspring
   was more capable of exploiting the favourable flooding conditions. In
   general, our results show that phenotypic plasticity may often be robust
   against the effects of inbreeding.
   Moreover, ID may increase in particular under conditions of
   physiological stress, during which many stress-specific genes are
   expressed, whereas ID may not necessarily increase under constant poor
   conditions that reduce fitness, even if the stress is very strong in the
   evolutionary sense.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine physiological and molecular
   grounds for high adaptation potential of invasive populations of Rosa
   rubiginosa to soil drought. We assume that the invasive populations
   possess specific and effective adaptive mechanisms making them capable
   pioneer and nurse plants in dry environments. By colonizing the land,
   they limit its degradation and initiate revitalization of areas damaged
   by soil droughts. We analyzed plant water status, the photosynthetic
   apparatus activity, carbohydrate and phenolic content, the level of
   non-enzymatic antioxidants and RbcL protein associated with fixation of
   CO2. The research involved native (Northern Hemisphere: Poland, Spain)
   and invasive (Southern Hemisphere: Argentine, New Zealand) pop-ulations.
   Contrary to the native population, the invasive one demonstrated soil
   drought induced specific re-sponses aimed at maintaining high water
   potential in the leaves, greater content of soluble carbohydrates, and
   higher osmotic potential. In the invasive population, the accumulation
   of soluble carbohydrates prevailed over their consumption for the
   synthesis of phenolic compounds. The invasive plants also maintained
   high content of assimilation pigments and showed greater level of
   non-enzymatic antioxidants. Reduced activity of the photo-synthetic
   apparatus was associated both with increased energy amount dissipated
   from PSII and the efficiency with which an electron can move from the
   reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PSI end electron
   ac-ceptors. The study results pave the path for further research on the
   genetic basis of sweet briar response to soil drought in the context of
   progressive steppe formation and desertification.},

Title = {Historical biogeography of Cannabis in the Iberian Peninsula: A
   probabilistic approach using palynological evidence},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The tempo and mode of colonization of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) by
   Cannabis sativa, its further internal spreading and the potential
   cultural and environmental factors involved remain unknown. The
   available continental-wide European meta-analyses using pollen and
   archeological evidence account for only a few IP sites, insufficient for
   a sound assessment. This paper presents a nearly comprehensive database
   of almost 60 IP sites with palynological evidence of Cannabis and
   analyzes the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns. The first scattered
   records of this pollen type date from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic
   (150-12 kyr BP) and would have entered the IP by maritime Mediterranean
   or terrestrial continental pathways, or both. A first burst of
   in-troductions, probably in a cultivated form, would have occurred
   during the Neolithic (7-5 kyr BP) using similar paths. Human
   participation in these Neolithic introductions remains unclear but
   cannot be dismissed. A period of reduced Cannabis arrivals (mostly via
   maritime pathway) occurred between the Chalcolithic and the Roman Epoch
   (4.5-2 kyr BP), when the innermost parts of the IP were colonized (Late
   Bronze). A second, likely anthropogenic, introduction acceleration took
   place in the Middle Ages (1.5 kyr BP onward) using the Medi-terranean
   and the continental pathways. Maximum cultivation and hemp retting
   activity was recorded during the Modern Ages (16th-19th centuries),
   coinciding with the increased demand of hemp fiber to supply the Spanish
   royal navy for imperial expansion and commerce. A potential link between
   Cannabis colonization/introduction bursts and climatic warmings has been
   observed that should be tested with future studies. Regional moisture
   variations seem to be less influential. Further efforts to enhance and
   improve the database used in this study are encouraged. The results of
   this paper should be compared with archeological and historical evidence
   to clarify the role of human migrations and cultural changes in the

Title = {Taxonomic analysis of certain taxa of Epipactis in Slovenia},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The predominantly allogamous Broad-leaved Helleborines (Epipactis
   helleborine) and the predominantly autogamous Narrow-lipped Helleborines
   (Epipactis leptochila) represent two taxonomically complex groups with
   great morphological diversity and close genetic relationships at the
   subspecies level. They are influenced by environment, clinal
   variability, hybridization between allogamous taxa, and in particularly
   by speciation through transitions from allogamy to autogamy. We analysed
   floral traits, genome size and performed molecular analyses (Internal
   transcribed spacer region, ITS; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism,
   AFLP) of several individuals of E. helleborine and E. leptochila
   aggregate from different geographical regions in Slovenia, focusing on
   intermediate traits of E. helleborine subsp. moratoria, E. helleborine
   subsp. leutei and E. leptochila subsp. neglecta. In order to
   successfully distinguish studied taxa, the main attention should be paid
   to the shape of the epichil and the ovary, as well as to the size ratio
   of sepals and petals. Among the microfloral characters, the shape and
   size of the lower margin of the stigma and staminodes are found to be
   supportive. E. neglecta clearly shows intermediate floral
   characteristics between E. leptochila and E. leutei, suggesting that the
   transition to autogamy evolved E. neglecta as an intermediate stage in
   the speciation process, coinciding with the colonisation of forest sites
   with lower light intensity. Analysis of genome size revealed significant
   differences, with E. neglecta having the greatest value. Using molecular
   markers, we were able to determine two main ribotype clusters within the
   E. helleborine group, which were also determined by AFLP analyses. E.
   leutei and E. neglecta formed two clearly defined subclusters within the
   E. leptochila lineage. The results of the presented study suggest that
   combining molecular markers and genome size with information on how
   variation in floral morphology is distributed, using multivariate
   analyses, is the most reliable way to gain improved insight into the
   relationships among the taxa analysed.},

Title = {Evolutionary patterns within the New World Clade Polygala sections
   Clinclinia and Monninopsis (Polygalaceae)},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Members of Polygala sections Clinclinia and Monninopsis, from the New
   World Clade (NWC), inhabit arid to humid habitats along the American
   continent. Although knowledge of these sections is currently incomplete,
   it is crucial for understanding evolutionary and diversification
   patterns in Polygalaceae. Here, we sample new species from the Polygala
   NWC with emphasis on these two sections, providing a comprehensive
   molecular phylogeny based on DNA sequence data from one nuclear (ITS)
   and three chloroplast (trnL-F intergenic spacer, rbcL, and partial
   matK-trnK) loci. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons for the main
   clades in the environmental and geographic spaces using climatic and
   elevation data processed by ordination and species distribution
   modelling (SDM) techniques. In addition, an ancestral state
   reconstruction for the morphological flower traits ``violet spots on
   lateral petals{''} and ``style shape{''} was carried out. The ancestral
   flower of the Polygala NWC was reconstructed as not having violet spots
   on the lateral petals and with a style with superior appendages. Within
   Polygala sect. Monninopsis, we found three distinct lineages. The North
   American clade A1 showed a potential distribution found along the Andes,
   from southern United States to Argentina. The South American P.
   argentinensis was predicted to be found from central Mexico to
   Argentina. The Patagonian P. darwiniana was also predicted to be found
   in northern North America and in the Lower California Peninsula in
   Mexico. Within Polygala sect. Clinclinia, we also found three distinct
   lineages. Clade B1 in addition to its empirical distribution found in
   Chile and Argentina, also showed a potential distribution found in
   Colombia. Clade B2 in addition to its empirical distribution found in
   north and central Argentina, southern Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and
   southern Brazil, also showed a potential distribution in southern Chile,
   southern Argentina, and the South Atlantic Islands. Finally, the
   Argentinian clade B3 was also predicted to be found in central Chile and
   southern Bolivia. An updated synonymic list of the Polygala sects.
   Clinclinia and Monninopsis as treated in this study is also provided.},

Title = {Multiple responses of bryophytes in a chronosequence of burnt areas in
   non-fire prone subtropical cloud forests},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In non-fire prone ecosystems, like some subtropical humid forests, fire
   produces habitat destruction and intensifies land degradation by
   inducing changes in native species composition, soil properties and
   erosive processes. Bryophytes are key components of the Macaronesian
   laurel forests playing an important role in regulating water cycling and
   microclimate. Ecological and taxonomical bryophytes groups have distinct
   ecological and physiological requirements and may respond in a different
   way to the same fire events. Therefore, analysing post fire recovery of
   bryophyte communities represents a key step towards a better
   understanding of forest fire drivers and post fire management. We
   investigated how species richness and composition of different
   ecological and taxonomical bryophyte groups varied in 1158 samples
   within a fire chronosequence from 5 to 57 years in the best-preserved
   laurel forest from Canary Islands (Garajonay National Park) analysing
   communities in terms of differences with comparable surrounding old
   growth unburnt stands. Epiphyte, terricolous and saxicolous bryophytes
   were sampled at each plot and the influence of the time since fire was
   analyzed together with environmental variables (temperature,
   precipitation, mist precipitation and elevation) and forest structure
   variables. Our results indicate that there is no general pattern of post
   fire recolonization, as recolonization varies depending on the
   ecological and phylogenetic groups considered. Climate and forest
   structure play an important role in post-fire recolonization, such that
   time since fire is not the most important variable influencing richness
   and composition. The results increase the understanding of the processes
   that shape compositional patterns in groups with high dispersal
   capacities and high microclimate dependence, such as mosses and
   liverworts.},

Title = {Plant water stress, not termite herbivory, causes Namibia's fairy
   circles},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The fairy circles of Namibia form a remarkable gap pattern in arid
   grassland along the Namib Desert. The origin of the fairy circles is
   subject to an ongoing debate. Solving the mystery of the fairy circles
   (FCs) requires the right timing in fieldwork after rainfall, as the
   newly appearing grasses complete their life cycle within only a few
   weeks. Here we followed the rains along the Namib between 2020 and 2022
   and assessed the cause of the grass death within FCs at different time
   intervals after grass-triggering rainfall. To assess whether termite
   herbivory was the cause, we used grass excavations and observations on
   the roots and shoots. To test if edaphic differences may explain the
   grass death in FCs, we undertook infiltration measurements in 10
   FC-hotspot regions. Finally, we used continuous soil-moisture
   measurements from the dry into the rainy seasons to examine how the
   newly emerging grasses affect the soil-water content in space and time.
   Generally, in study plots that received grass -triggering rainfall most
   recently, the roots of the dead grasses in FCs were in 100 \% of the
   cases undamaged, root-shoot ratios were significantly greater, and the
   roots were as long or even longer as those of the surrounding matrix
   grasses outside of the FCs. This indicates that drought stress caused
   grasses in the FCs to invest resources into roots to reach the
   percolating water. The results also show that the cause of the grass
   death in fairy circles was not induced by termite herbivory. Also, we
   found no systematic differences in the rate of water infiltration
   between FCs and the matrix, hence the plant wilting cannot result from
   quicker percolation within FCs. However, the soil-moisture measurements
   indicate that the matrix grasses strongly depleted the upper soil water
   of the FCs after rainfall, which explains why most grasses cannot
   establish and quickly die in the FCs. The research shows that grass
   death in fairy circles occurs immediately after rainfall due to plant
   water stress but not due to termite activity. Our results conform with
   previous fieldwork, pattern analysis and theoretical modeling,
   suggesting that Namibia's fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation
   phenomenon induced by ecohydrological feedbacks.},

   transitional zone in South America},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recently diverged species may hybridize in their contact zones if
   complete reproductive isolation has not yet emerged. Petunia inflata and
   P. interior are closely related species with a narrow geographic
   distribution in Argentina and southern Brazil. They share morphological
   features, genetic markers, pollinators, and occupy a transitional area
   between the Pampa grasslands and the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Here, we
   used genomic data to verify species boundaries, identify putative
   hybrids, and shed light on their speciation process. We characterized 59
   individuals from allopatric and contact zones using
   genotyping-by-sequencing technology, resulting in a final dataset with
   21,759 neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms used to perform
   structure, demographic, and hybridization analyses. These species belong
   to distinct evolutionary lineages that hybridized after secondary
   contact. A combination of geographic distance, elevation, and climate
   explains the genetic divergence between species. Niche overlap analysis
   revealed that even though these species have overlapping distributions
   and similar habitat preferences, they are more distinct than expected by
   chance, rejecting the niche conservatism hypothesis. Demographic
   analysis suggested that the Pleistocene climatic changes led species to
   diverge but they came into secondary contact during the Holocene. The
   secondary contact led to limited gene flow between species and
   bidirectional introgression. The distribution expansion of these
   species' ancestor to a transitional zone between biomes, associated with
   elevational ranges and habitat fragmentation promoted speciation and
   niche differentiation.},

Title = {Deceiving insects, deceiving taxonomists? Making theoretical sense of
   taxonomic disagreement in the European orchid genus Ophrys},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The orchid genus Ophrys is a textbook example of a taxonomic
   controversy, with the number of species recognised in different
   classifications varying from around 10 to over 350, causing confusion
   among researchers and enthusiasts. Here, we illustrate that there are
   multiple drivers behind that disagreement, representing debates and
   discussions of various nature, and then reflect on strategies to
   mitigate confusion among the users of Ophrys taxonomies, reconciling
   legitimate taxonomic debates with demands for clarity among the broader
   biological community. First, we distil six possible factors explaining
   taxonomic disagreement from general literature on taxonomic
   difficulties, and assess the importance of each of them for the Ophrys
   controversy. We then explore two strategies to reduce confusion among
   the users of the taxonomies in question. On the one hand, we illustrate
   the possibility of constructing a consensus-based reference taxonomy for
   external users, despite the ongoing taxonomic disagreement, and on the
   other hand we explore a `pluralist' alternative, in which different
   classifications are allowed to coexist, but in an orderly manner. Doing
   so, we build a case for the Ophrys systematics community to reflect
   collectively on which strategy to adopt.},

Title = {From continental Asia into the world: Global historical biogeography of
   the saltbush genus Atriplex (Chenopodieae, Chenopodioideae,
   Amaranthaceae)},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Atriplex is the most species-rich genus of Amaranthaceae and one of the
   largest C-4 clades in eudicots. Distributed predominantly in the arid
   subtropical and temperate regions worldwide, many Atriplex species
   dominate the plant communities of harsh and inhospitable inland and
   coastal habitats. Current threats of aridification and salinisation
   increase the ecological and economic value of this highly stress
   tolerant xerophytic genus. We compiled sequence data of approximately 80
   \% (208 spp.) of all currently recognised species and carried out a
   phylogenetic reconstruction using nuclear-encoded internal and external
   transcribed spacers. In addition, time divergence estimation analysis
   and ancestral area reconstruction were carried out to reconstruct the
   worldwide spread of Atriplex. Our results show that Atriplex originated
   in continental Asia during the Oligocene and dispersed from there across
   the world, often via long-distance dispersal from the Aralo-Caspian and
   the Pontic regions, or the floristic province of Turkestan. The highest
   alpha diversity was retrieved from arid habitats of Australia and the
   New World resulting from extensive radiation events of the Late Miocene
   and Pliocene. Most dispersal events took place into the Mediterranean
   region. Atriplex invaded most continents several times independently
   from different regions throughout the continuous cooling trend of the
   Neogene and the Quaternary. Despite limited resolution power of the used
   molecular markers, this study allows for a more comprehensive
   understanding of the evolutionary history of Atriplex and lays the
   foundation for future evolutionary studies of saltbushes.},

Abstract = {Farmland bird populations have declined globally raising concerns over
   habitat loss for a wide range of species. In this study, we explored the
   significance of agroecosystems for birds at different temporal and
   spatial scales along the Cauvery delta region, South India. Our results
   recorded a wide range of 102 species, with passerines and wetland birds
   dominating the landscapes. Among the guild types, omnivores and
   insectivores were the well-represented groups followed by carnivores,
   granivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Species richness and diversity
   were recorded higher during winter which could be associated with the
   maturing phase of rice paddies in the agroecosystem. There were
   significant differences recorded in species diversity and richness
   between the cropping period and the non-cropping periods, thus
   recognizing the high potential of paddy ecosystems in biodiversity
   conservation. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that the
   diversity of birds in the agroecosystem was more influenced by the woody
   vegetation cover, crop cover, and field size; however, bird abundance
   was related to farm activities, plantations, and herbaceous cover
   surrounding the agroecosystem. Fewer generalist species revealed an
   interesting pattern of taxonomic homogenization with monoculture
   cropping patterns that could influence the adaptability and functional
   traits of the other species. The results of the study highlight that
   both HNV and the non-HNV zones attract a rich diversity of birds and the
   conservation of this traditional agricultural belt would aid in the
   conservation of threatened species and biodiversity globally.},

Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {277-288},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ensuring the effectiveness of method in maintaining and recovering the
   productive capacity of degraded soils, e.g., no-till farming, is more
   important than opening new agricultural frontiers. Organic matter
   breakdown is a key ecosystem process with implications on aquatic food
   webs and biogeochemical cycles. Our objective was to quantify the
   standard cellulosic substrate (cotton strips and balsa wood) mass loss
   in no-till soybean and forest areas as control. We use bags of two mesh
   sizes (0.5 mm vs. 10 mm), on soil surface and buried-in-soil (10 cm) for
   30, 70, and 90 days in all three sampling sites: no-till soybean vs.
   adjacent forest vs. forest native. The invertebrate community by pitfall
   collector and soil for chemical characterization was also sampled. The
   high microbial breakdown of balsa wood buried-in-soil was observed in
   no-till soybean systems (+/- 5\% compared to forest), indicating a
   superficial fertilizing effect and negative effect to decomposers. The
   mass loss in balsa wood in soil surface ranges from 15\% (fine mesh in
   the adjacent forest) to 25\% smaller (fine mesh in no-till soybean
   systems) compared to forest native. Microbial breakdown in cotton buried
   was 45\% greater in no-till soybean systems compared to forest native.
   The cotton breakdown by invertebrate activity on soil surface was higher
   in the forest areas compared to no-till soybean (30\% smaller) due to
   the quality and edaphic conditions of the adjacent litter. Finally,
   adjacent forest close to crops may provide important ecosystem services
   for productive systems.},

   underrepresented in this regard. Here, we gather all the known
   information about a wide-spread tropical zooplankton member,
   Ceriodaphnia rigaudi, and add new information from lab and field
   experiments. We determine feeding rate across a range of food
   concentrations and food-dependent population growth rate of C. rigaudi.
   Additionally, we use 16 years of occurrence data from rock pools in
   Jamaica to explore environmental characteristics of the habitat in which
   C. rigaudi live. We compare our data to worldwide records of the species

Title = {A vertebrate, the fence skink, is a common but relatively low-quality
   prey for an invertebrate predator, the redback spider},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many predators feed on a diversity of prey items and the traits of these
   prey can affect their quality for predators. While invertebrate
   predators most often feed on other invertebrates, numerous studies have
   documented spiders and other predatory arthropods feeding on
   vertebrates. The goal of this study was to examine the frequency of
   fence skinks, Cryptoblepharus virgatus, in the diet of redback spiders,
   Latrodectus hasselti, and to measure the amounts and ratio of nutrients
   that spiders extracted from fence skinks compared to representative
   high-quality (i.e., locust) and low-quality (i.e., beetle) arthropod
   prey. In field surveys, fence skinks represented 8\% of individual prey
   items and 17\% of the biomass of prey captured by redback spiders. In
   feeding trials, spiders consumed a lower total dry mass and mass of
   lipid when feeding on skinks relative to both arthropod prey and the
   lowest mass of protein when feeding on beetles. In terms of feeding
   efficiency, spiders were most efficient at extracting dry mass, lipid
   and protein from locusts and least efficient at extracting nutrients
   from skinks (lipid) or skinks and beetles (dry mass and protein). There
   were also differences in trace element consumption between spiders
   feeding on skinks versus locusts. These results suggest that skinks are
   a relatively low-quality prey. The frequency of skinks in the diet of
   these urban redback spiders is likely a consequence of the abundance of
   skinks in this habitat, similar microhabitat selection by spiders and
   skinks, and relatively indiscriminate predation by spiders. Further work
   is needed to examine the relative quality of other vertebrates for
   invertebrates and if other traits such as predator feeding mode affects
   the relative quality of vertebrates as prey.},

Title = {The predatory impacts of invasive European wasps on flies are
   facilitated by carcasses with open wounds},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Carrion is a vital resource in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting
   complex networks of interacting consumer organisms. The insect community
   attending carrion forms a vital part of this food web, but the
   functional roles of insects as scavengers can be altered by invasive
   species via the effects of predation and competition. European wasps
   (Vespula germanica) have invaded many parts of Australia and have been
   documented to directly kill native insect scavengers, especially
   necrophilous flies. Yet, little is known about the factors that
   influence predation rates by European wasps on flies at carcasses. The
   aim of this study was to determine how carcass state and altitude
   influences the occurrence and predatory impacts of wasps on flies. We
   placed 18 kangaroo carcasses along an altitudinal gradient in an
   Australian alpine ecosystem and manipulated half of the carcasses by
   splitting them open to simulate the wounds created by vertebrate
   scavengers present at the time of death. We found that carcasses with
   open wounds exacerbated already severe predation on flies from wasps, as
   well as intense scavenging activity, even though wasp abundance remained
   the same across both treatments. Meanwhile, densities of wasps declined
   and their impact on flies lessened with higher altitude. We suggest that
   the suppressive effect of wasps on flies may interrupt key processes
   triggered by carrion and cause shifts in energy flow through scavenger
   food webs. Further, under climate change, we predict that wasps will
   continue to spread into new areas at altitudes the species currently
   find unhospitable and conclude that carcass management practices must
   recognise the potential threat that wasps pose to ecosystem stability.},

Title = {Single and mixed diets of the toxic Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa
   and Raphidiopsis raciborskii differently affect Daphnia feeding behavior},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria usually dominate phytoplankton in eutrophic water bodies,
   where they form dense monospecific or mixed blooms. Moreover, these
   organisms are an important energy source for aquatic food webs in these
   environments, establishing a direct link with zooplankton. In contrast,
   cyanobacteria can weaken that link by limiting zooplankton grazing
   pressure due to morphological and chemical traits such as the production
   of toxic peptides and alkaloids. Nevertheless, some zooplankton survive
   under CyanoHABs (cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms) and it has been
   related to both physiological tolerance and behavioral mechanisms, the
   last being less explored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of a
   single and mixed diet of different toxin-producing cyanobacteria on the
   feeding behavior of two species of Daphnia. Adult individuals of the
   species Daphnia similis (large) and D. laevis (small) were fed with
   single and mixed cell suspensions of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis
   aeruginosa and Raphidiopsis raciborskii at gradually increased
   proportions (0-90\%) relative to the edible green algae Monoraphidium
   capricornutum. Here, we found a marked decrease in the filtration
   (measured as clearance rate) of D. similis but not for D. laevis as
   cyanobacteria increased in suspension. At the same condition, both
   daphnids displayed a nonselective behavior despite a reduced ingestion
   rate food of edible algae. Our study shows that cyanobacteria may
   directly and indirectly impact Daphnia filtration rate and ability to
   forage for edible food.},

Title = {Increased nutrient availability correlates with increased growth of the
   benthic jellyfish Cassiopea spp.},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Jellyfish are an important but underappreciated food source in marine
   food webs. Human activities influence the abundance of jellyfish,
   potentially affecting marine trophic dynamics. Human activities such as
   nutrient loading may also influence the size structure of jellyfish
   populations, affecting food webs, yet little is known about indirect or
   direct mechanistic pathways driving shifts in size. In this experiment,
   we manipulated nutrient concentrations to test if elevated nutrient
   availability affected growth of the zooxanthellate, benthic jellyfish
   taxa Cassiopea spp. We found that in the nutrient-enriched treatment,
   the estimated body mass of jellyfish increased on average 0.24 +/-
   0.29\% d-1, likely as a result of elevated autotrophic carbon supply.
   Conversely, jellyfish in the ambient nutrient treatment shrank, possibly
   reflecting reduced food availability as a result of the enclosures that
   jellyfish were kept in or effects associated with negative density
   dependence. Our findings suggest that humanderived nutrients may benefit
   these jellyfish taxa and, more broadly, we provide an example of how
   environmental conditions can mediate the size structure of jellyfish
   populations with potential implications for marine food webs.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {The treeline ecosystems in the Caucasus are mainly composed of birch
   (Betuletum) stands. These high-mountain forests encompass pivotal
   ecological functions like climate regulation, water retention, soil
   protection and more. The location of Caucasus birches as part of the
   treeline communities determines its vulnerability to anthropogenic as
   well as natural stressors. Therefore, the natural distribution area of
   birches has been significantly shrunk. Meanwhile, the two contrasting
   tendencies are also observable in the Caucasus, the lowering of the
   natural upper limit of the treeline border as well as the widening of
   the distribution area towards higher elevations. In this research, we
   aimed to model the actual distribution areas of Caucasus birches
   according to the factors and patterns of their present distribution. We
   used the Maxent (Maximum Entropy Model) model based on WorldClim
   bioclimatic variables-mean temperature of warmest quarter, mean
   temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of coldest quarter and
   precipitation of warmest quarter, and 160 study plots (including 100
   field experimental plots). The model demonstrated high predictive power
   AUC = 0.97. The Maxent algorithm showed the potential distribution areas
   of Caucasus birches covering the entire Caucasus region and the climatic
   variables as the main factors contributing to or limiting the
   distribution of birches in the study region. Understanding the
   distribution characteristics of birches in the Caucasus can serve as a
   basis for future research on shifts and changes in treeline forest
   communities occurring as a result of various impacts, e.g. climate
   change.},

Title = {Trophic hierarchy in a marine community revealed by network analysis on
   co-occurrence data},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Network analysis is employed in biodiversity studies to explore the
   possible ecological implications of taxa co-occurrences across time or
   space, but the conceptual robustness of this approach is still under
   debate. Herein, by focusing our attention on a marine pelagic community
   previously described by metabarcoding data gathered over a time-series,
   we explore the usefulness of co-occurrence networks to derive
   information about food web structures. In our effort we studied a
   published co-occurrence network by conducting bibliographic research to
   identify which links were potentially related to ecological
   interactions. Although biologically plausible links were the minority,
   we found that they were enough to construct realistic ecological
   networks. We therefore assembled trophic and non-trophic networks
   including both putatively biological links and those not explainable
   based on the literature; we analyzed these networks separately by
   estimating several indicators chosen among those resulted as informative
   of ecological processes in previous research. In the trophic networks,
   we detected some structural properties and `trophic hierarchies'
   commonly found in food webs with approaches different from co-occurrence
   networks, such as: i) a positive relationship between body size and
   trophic level (this latter defined in terms of network topology, i.e.,
   the arrangement of nodes and links in a network); and ii) realistic
   shifts in the network roles played by co-occurring taxa (i.e., hubs and
   keystone species), which allowed the persistence of hierarchy despite
   environmental variability. Our results reveal the power of applying
   co-occurrence networks in capturing the ecological properties of marine
   communities, plus possible ecological changes occurring under different
   environmental conditions. However, such application potential is deeply
   constrained by the acquiring of fine-scale knowledge of the trophic
   habits of the taxa in the community of reference.},

Title = {Cattle dung in aquatic habitats alters mosquito predatory biocontrol
   dynamics},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic land use changes influence ecosystem functioning and may
   alter trophic interactions. Intensification of free-range pastoral
   farming could promote degradation of aquatic habitats, with nutrient
   inputs adversely affecting water quality and resident communities.
   Reductions in natural enemies (and potentially efficacy thereof) and
   dampening of their interaction strength could promote the proliferation
   of vector mosquitoes, with consequences for disease transmission and
   nuisance biting. This study examined implications of a cattle dung
   eutrophication gradient (T0-T4: 0 g L-1, 1 g L-1, 2 g L-1, 4 g L-1 and 8
   g L-1) on aquatic habitats for trophic and non-trophic interactions by
   two larval mosquito (Culex pipiens) natural enemies (notonectid: Anisops
   sardea; copepod: Lovenula falcifera) using comparative functional
   responses. Copepods generally exhibited lower interaction strength
   compared to notonectids, both as individuals and conspecific pairs.
   Effects of dung pollutants differed among predator groups, with high
   concentrations dampening interaction strengths being observed for
   single/paired copepods and paired notonectids, but not single
   notonectids or heterospecific pairs. Individual predators exhibited Type
   II functional responses, with feeding rates largely similar across dung
   concentrations within species. Non-trophic interactions were
   predominantly negative (i.e., antagonistic) between conspecific pairs
   and scaled unimodally with prey density. Dung pollution intensified
   negative non-trophic interactions in notonectid pairs, whereas
   heterospecific pairs exhibited positive (i.e., synergistic) non-trophic
   interactions at the highest dung concentration. Physico-chemical
   properties indicated that turbidity and pH increased with dung treatment
   concentrations, whereas conductivity and total dissolved solids both
   peaked at 1 g L-1 and 2 g L-1. These results improve understanding of
   mosquito regulation in degraded habitats, indicting effects of
   agricultural pollutants dampen trophic interaction strengths, depending
   on the taxon.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {75-85},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Shrub communities often modify understory soil and vegetation
   characteristics. However, the effect of individual shrubs on the soil
   seed bank (y6SSB) could be variable in grasslands depending on the
   presence of grazing. We examined how grazing influences patch-level
   effects of shrubs on local soil seed bank (SSB) density, species
   richness, and composition. Twenty individuals of Crataegus
   pseudomelanocarpa (dominant woody species in the study area) were
   randomly selected in the degraded ecotone between forest and grassland
   in northern Iran, 10 in grazed and 10 in ungrazed areas. Soil samples
   were collected under shrubs and the space between shrubs and then
   transported to the greenhouse. The seedling emergence method was used to
   estimate SSB density and composition in the greenhouse. In total, 61
   species germinated from the soil samples with 47 species in the grazed
   sites (43 species in shrub, 34 species in open) and 54 species in the
   ungrazed sites (43 species in shrub, 46 species in open). SSB density
   and richness were significantly lower under shrubs compared with outside
   in the ungrazed areas while the converse results were found in the
   grazed areas. Although grazing decreased SSB density and species
   richness, this decrease was less pronounced under the shrubs, indicating
   the nursing roles of shrubs against grazing on seed production by
   herbaceous plants.},

Title = {Association between arthropod densities suggests dominance of top-down
   control of predator-prey food-webs on pear trees during winter},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although winter in the temperate zone is considered to be the period of
   arthropod quiescence, some pests and their natural enemies remain active
   and interact in simplified food-webs. Limited information exists about
   the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating
   arthropod food-webs and their spatio-temporal dynamics during winter.
   This information is essential for the development of effective
   conservation biocontrol methods. We investigated how the pest management
   of pear orchards (integrated {[}IPM] vs organic) and tree location
   within orchards (margin vs centre) influence the association between
   densities of winter-active spiders, insect herbivores and
   winter-inactive predators (spiders, insects) from October to April. We
   installed carboard bands on trunks and branches of pear trees in four
   organic and four IPM orchards to collect bark -dwelling arthropods. We
   then modelled relationships between the densities of four functional
   arthropod groups, namely winter-active spiders, winter-inactive spiders,
   winter-inactive insect predators, and herbivores. In early winter, we
   found a hump-shaped relationship between the densities of winter-active
   spiders and her-bivores. This agrees with the top-down model of the
   ecosystem exploitation hypothesis, predicting that predators are first
   bottom-up limited, then accumulate with prey densities, and exert
   top-down control when they become sufficiently abundant. The densities
   of herbivores strongly declined during winter, a phenomenon which may be
   partly, along with other causes of natural mortality, attributable to
   predation by winter active spiders. The as-sociation between
   winter-active spiders and winter-inactive arthropod predators switched
   from positive to none in organic orchards or even to a negative
   association in IPM orchards. Negative intraguild interactions seem to be
   intensified due to the declining availability of alternative prey.
   Overall, the investigated food-webs seem to be mostly top-down regulated
   during winter, and IPM seems to intensify intraguild interactions.},

Title = {Using stable isotopes to examine movement and prey usage of cormorants
   breeding in the southeastern United States},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Double-crested Cormorant (Nannopterum auritum) numbers have
   significantly increased in North America since the late 1970s. Analyses
   of stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur were conducted on the
   liver and pectoral muscle sampled from cormorants collected on
   Guntersville Reservoir, Alabama to infer whether individuals consumed
   cultured catfish and whether this population was subject to immigration
   during the spring sampling period. Potential food sources were also
   sampled from this system and aquaculture farms in west Alabama.
   Relationships among isotopic values measured in cormorants and prey
   illustrate that birds sampled from Guntersville Reservoir included both
   those that assimilated prey from this system long term and individuals
   that obtained resources elsewhere. Collectively, these results indicate
   that Guntersville Reservoir could be a migratory stopover site for
   cormorants and that these birds likely contribute little damage to
   aquaculture facilities. Management enacted to remediate effects
   associated with nuisance populations should be tailored throughout this
   species range focusing on areas where damage is occurring, and evidence
   supports culpability.},

Title = {Scale of effect matters: Forest cover influences on tropical ant-plant
   ecological networks},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decade, the number of studies dealing with how species
   interaction networks are structured by landscape has increased in the
   literature. However, many studies quantify landscape metrics at one
   single spatial extent, without considering the effects at multiple
   spatial extents. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explicitly
   addressed and discussed the spatial extent at which landscape structure
   best predicts the organization of ecological networks, which is key to
   understanding how ecological interactions are affected by landscape
   modifications. Therefore, two important research questions arise: can
   the spatial scale at which landscape structure best predicts an
   ecological response (i.e., scale of effect) magnify our ability to
   understand ecological networks or can the suboptimal scale just blind
   our view about what really happens? Motivated by these concerns, we used
   ant-plant relationships obtained from 16 landscapes in a human-dominated
   tropical rainforest of Mexico to assess and discuss the spatial extent
   at which forest cover (\%) best predicts ant-plant interaction network
   patterns (i.e., network size, interaction diversity, network
   specialization, and nestedness). In general, we observed that smaller
   scales best predicted the interaction diversity (50 m) and
   specialization (250 m) of ecological networks involving ants and plants,
   which are descriptors associated to abundance and the distribution of
   interactions between plant and ant species. This is possibly because
   ant-plant relationships are being modulated by processes that act at the
   microclimatic level due to the biotic and abiotic conditions that forest
   provides. However, we found that network size and nestedness (i.e.,
   descriptors associated to species detectability and emergent properties)
   were not associated with forest cover at any analyzed spatial extent.
   These findings indicate that the ant-plant ecological network structure
   can be influenced by processes that occur at different spatial extents.
   Moreover, the results presented here have a direct impact on our
   theoretical and empirical understanding of how the landscape structure
   shapes biotic interactions at different spatial extents in highly
   diverse tropical rainforests.},

Title = {Avoidance of invasive prey reduces subsequent consumption of similar
   native prey},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Learned avoidance of invasive species could carry over to ecologically
   similar non-threatening native taxa, altering predator-prey interactions
   and food webs. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is an
   invasive prey of the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. Despite
   potentially lethal outcomes, juvenile fence lizards innately consume
   fire ants; however, they rapidly learn to avoid eating them with
   early-life exposure. Ants comprise a large portion of fence lizards'
   diets and a generalized avoidance of ants could thus reduce their prey
   pool. We tested whether learned avoidance following exposure to invasive
   fire ants would reduce the subsequent consumption of a palatable native
   ant. Lizards that consumed invasive fire ants for five days were less
   likely to subsequently consume native common pyramid ants, Dorymrymex
   bureni, than were lizards that initially consumed these non-threatening
   native ants. Our results suggest that learned avoidance of invasive prey
   can carry-over to avoidance of palatable native prey. The broad
   avoidance of native ants, due to the presence of invasive fire ants,
   could potentially increase native ant populations affecting their
   predators and competitors.},

Title = {Functional diversity in herbivorous fishes on Caribbean reefs: The role
   of macroalgal traits in driving interspecific differences in feeding
   behavior},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding how functional traits drive plant-herbivore interactions
   often illuminates the mechanisms driving niche partitioning and
   functional diversity in this important guild of consumers. On coral
   reefs, a diverse suite of herbivorous fishes is key for controlling
   algal abundance and impacting benthic community dynamics. Here, we focus
   on how algal traits shape complementarity in feeding for a diverse suite
   of large herbivorous fishes on a coral reef in the wider Caribbean. We
   used feeding assays in the field to document feeding patterns of the
   different herbivorous fishes across 50 species of macroalgae. Then, we
   used a suite of macroalgal traits such as dry mass, nutrient content,
   calcification, and chemical defenses to assess how these traits
   influenced patterns of consumption. Algal defenses were the major traits
   determining the overall vulnerability of algae to herbivores, with
   uncalcified algae from undefended genera being consumed 40\% more
   rapidly than algae that were either calcified or chemically defended.
   Nutrient content of algae explained little in patterns of overall
   herbivory. We found significant niche diversification in feeding both
   among and within genera with the three major genera having unique
   feeding patterns on different suites of algae (Acanthurus spp. -red
   macroalgae, Sparisoma spp. -brown and green macroalgae, and Scarus spp.
   -benthic filamentous algae). With respect to how algal traits influenced
   patterns of feeding in individual species, we found that: (1) some
   herbivore species were almost exclusively influenced by avoiding algal
   defenses, (2) some species showed strong interactions between algal
   defenses and nutrient content that determined their feeding, and (3)
   some species (Kyphosus spp., Pomacanthus arcuatus) targeted
   chemically-defended algae with high nutrient content. Our work
   highlights the role that algal traits play in influencing patterns in
   the diversity and redundancy of feeding in herbivorous fishes on coral
   reefs.},

Title = {Food webs supporting fisheries production in estuaries with expanding
   coastal urbanisation},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The prospects that coastal urbanisation propagates in more fish
   production remains untested and thereby a fundamental question for
   managers challenged with approving urban expansion while also protecting
   and conserving habitat resources important for fish production. We
   tested this by collecting giant mud crabs (Scylla serrata) from highly
   urbanised waterways in south-east Queensland, Australia, and report that
   this crab not only occupy urban coastal waterways, but using a Bayesian
   stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) of the potential individual
   autotrophic sources, the range of feasible contributions for autotrophs
   was very broad, limiting the conclusions that could be made directly
   from the modelling. Patterns of contributions from pooled categories of
   autotrophs were clearer; at the site closest to seagrass, the pooled
   enriched autotroph sources contributed 69 to 87\% of crab isotope
   signatures, while at all other sites (beyond approximately 500 m
   distance) it appears that crabs utilise a generalised pool of sources,
   either local or perhaps a mix of local transported sources. Using
   spatial analysis we reveal that the crab isotope values were not
   significantly related to the distance from any of the vegetated habitats
   (mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh). The exception was two sites very
   close to seagrass (< 500 m distance), and not saltmarsh grass which has
   been reported elsewhere, where crabs had the most enriched C value. At
   all other sites (beyond approximately 500 m distance) it appears crabs
   utilise a generalised organic producer pool, either local or perhaps a
   mix of transported sources. Overall, this study provides evidence that
   in an era of coastal urbanisation expansion and loss of natural coastal
   vegetated areas, some fisheries species may have remarkable trophic
   plasticity to the new, engineered, habitat settings.},

   the plant-ungulate-wolf food chain in boreal forests},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global warming has been accelerating as atmospheric CO2 has risen. The
   mean annual temperature in boreal forests has increased by 1.5 degrees C
   or more, which has profound impacts on plants and wildlife. This
   overview explores available literature, identifies current knowledge
   gaps, highlights hypotheses about the cascading effects of global
   warming in a boreal forest food chain, and suggests future research
   directions. Our climate-driven bottom-up trophic interaction hypotheses
   explore climate change effects on boreal plants via five mechanisms:
   nutrient dilution, water stress, wildfires, snow depth, and phenology
   shifts. Ungulates may experience longer foraging time and reduced
   biomass due to less nutritious food resources. As a result, carnivores
   might benefit from increased stationary prey encounter and vulnerable
   individuals, but also need to cope with decreased prey biomass and
   increased energetic expenditure in hunting. We recommend increasing
   research efforts on nutrient dilution of northern plants, range shifts
   in northern herbivores that might lead to competition among them, and
   overall impacts of climate change on wolves.},

Title = {A review of the ecological role of the Neotropical freshwater stingrays
   (Chondrichthyes: Potamotrygoninae)},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The freshwater stingrays of the subfamily Potamotrygoninae occupy a
   variety of habitats in Neotropical rivers, where they feed primarily on
   benthic prey. Prior work on these stingrays have described the
   composition of their diets and feeding habits, but have provided few
   insights into the relationship between prey choice and prey
   availability. Given this, a comprehensive review of the diet and trophic
   interactions in potamotrygonines is needed to help understand the
   ecological role of these stingrays in freshwater environments. In the
   present study, I consulted material published in scientific journals and
   gray literature to compile information on the composition of the diet.
   When possible, I included both qualitative and quantitative parameters,
   the Relative Importance (\%IRI) and Alimentary indices (\%IAi).
   Potamotrygonin stingrays are found in an enormous diversity of habitats,
   and many studies have identified them as mesopredators, with a diet
   composed primarily of mollusks, decapods, insects, and fishes. Although
   few organisms are known to prey on stingrays, they do not appear to be
   apex predators, but rather, mesopredators with a low predation risk.
   Fluctuations in prey availability related to the annual flood pulse of
   the rivers were reflected in dietary overlap in some studies, although
   these findings do not necessarily indicate competition for food. There
   is a clear knowledge gap for most species and populations of freshwater
   stingrays, and this review provides the first systematic insights into
   the variation in the diet and predator-prey interactions of the
   potamotrygonines.},

Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The American beaver (Castor canadensis) has been described as a choosy
   generalist at the species/population scale, yet observational studies
   have shown little variation in diet among individuals. We compared
   isotopic values of delta C-13 or delta N-15 taken from hair of 32
   beaver, representing seven colonies in northern Alabama, USA to
   determine 1) if colonies of beaver show overlap in isotopic niche width
   as a result of the similar use of food resources and 2) if individual
   trophic niche specialization occurs within colonies. Total Trophic Niche
   Width varied across the wetland with the widest being twice the
   narrowest. Each of the five niche ellipses overlapped with >= two other
   wetlands studied. The percentages of observed variance attributed to

   Location Component for delta C-13 were 37\%, 33\%, 30\%; and those for
   delta N-15 were 16\%, 56\%, and 28\%. Dietary nitrogen differentiated
   the trophic niches of individual beavers. Our results revealed that
   colonies across the landscape showed separation in trophic niche,
   lending support that the choosy generalist classification is correct at
   the colony scale. Our results also support individual trophic niche
   specialization within colonies, as seen by the substantial amount
   variation in both delta C-13 (33\%) and delta N-15 (56\%) between
   individuals.},

Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mudskippers (Gobiidae: Oxudercinae), are air-breathing fish, that play
   important roles in the structuring of benthic communities in mangrove
   habitats, serving as important ecosystem engineers. We used stable
   isotopes and the Bayesian mixing model to determine if mangrove provides
   a base of nutritional support to the mudskipper, Periophthalmus waltoni
   in the arid mangrove system of the Persian Gulf. The results showed that
   the species belong to the trophic level of the secondary consumers which
   mostly prey on species with the origin of the resources related to the
   mangroves. The mixing model results showed that all the three sources
   selected contributed to the species diets. Mangrove provided relatively
   high proportion (35.7\%) of organic matter to the fish, followed by
   sediment organic matter (33.7\%), and benthic microalgae (30.6\%). The
   results highlight the fact that other features of food sources (i.e.
   quality, productivity) should be considered in addition to biomass when
   carrying out food web studies.},

Title = {Effect of ant-attendance on the occurrence of intraguild predation},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Parasitoids and predators exploiting similar food resource make
   aphidophagous guilds especially favourable systems for studying
   intraguild predation, but ants as third parties protect aphids against
   their natural enemies and in return obtain carbohydrate-rich honeydew as
   a nutritional resource. A field experiment on the interrelationship
   among aphids, ants and predators/parasitoids was conducted on two plants
   (hoary cress Cardaria draba L. {[}Brassicaceae) and Canada thistle
   Cirsium arvense L. {[}Asteraceae]). Cardaria was infested with the aphid
   Acyrthosiphon gossypii Mordvilko (Homoptera: Aphididae) tended by the
   ant Lasius turcicus Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Cirsium was
   infested with the aphid Brachycaudus cardui L. (Homoptera: Aphididae)
   tended by the ant Crematogaster sordidula Nylander (Hymenoptera:
   Formicidae). The mean number of predators per aphid colony decreased
   significantly when the aphids were tended by ants on both host plants.
   In contrast, the parasitism rate of both aphids decreased significantly
   without the tending ant. Thus ant attendance can affect the occurrence
   and intensity of intraguild predation, and consequently provide enemy
   free space for parasitoids. If a foraging female aphid parasitoid
   succeeds in ovipositing into patches with guarding ants, then its
   offspring could be protected from the risk of intraguild predation.},

Title = {Top-predator removal does not cause trophic cascades in Australian
   rangeland ecosystems},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increased demand for livestock products is exacerbating conflict with
   predators in many parts of the world, fuelling an increase in predation
   management practices in many grazing systems. In Australia, exclusion
   fences are being erected across broad areas to facilitate the sustained
   eradication of dingoes, an apex predator, prompting concern for possible
   cascading effects on extant wildlife populations. We experimentally
   assessed population trends of mammals, reptiles and ground-dwelling
   birds inside and outside of two large, fenced areas over a five-year
   period subsequent to the erection of the fences and the removal of
   dingoes. Wildlife population abundances inside the fences were always
   higher or the same as outside the fences, and all wildlife species
   exhibited similar population trends within each treatment over time. The
   only exception to this was kangaroo populations, which fluctuated widely
   inside fenced areas but remained relatively low and stable outside
   fenced areas. Kangaroos exhibited negative relationships with dingoes,
   although unmeasured variables limited our ability to quantify specific
   causes for kangaroo population trends. Vegetation trends were virtually
   identical between treatments, indicating that wildlife population trends
   are closely linked to vegetation conditions and not predator abundances.
   These applied, experimental results demonstrate that top-predator
   removal does not routinely cause trophic cascades (including
   mesopredator releases) in Australian rangeland ecosystems. We therefore
   encourage exploration of opportunities for targeted threatened species
   recovery in predator-free areas on land used for livestock production.},

Title = {Stable isotopes point to anthropogenic subsidies in northern raccoons at
   the urban-wild interface},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing availability of anthropogenic food affects biological
   communities and can alter food webs at the urban interface. Although
   northern raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to associate with
   anthropogenic environments, little research has been conducted examining
   the differences in raccoon diets across urban-wild gradients. The
   Florida Keys present a unique study system because they vary in levels
   of urbanization interspersed with wildlife refuges and natural habitats.
   We collected hair samples from the tails of road killed raccoons in
   undeveloped natural areas in Key Largo, highly developed areas in Big
   Pine Key, and from individuals caught in a trapping array from natural
   areas on Big Pine Key for analyses of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   ratios. We observed limited variation in 815N ratios across the three
   different raccoon groups, but we did note slightly higher 815N in
   raccoons from natural areas on Big Pine Key, suggesting more predatory
   behavior. However, we observed marked differences in the 813C ratios of
   raccoons from natural areas in Key Largo and Big Pine Key as compared to
   individuals occurring in highly developed parts of Big Pine Key. These
   enriched carbon signatures correspond with human foods derived from corn
   (C4 plants) in the urban raccoons. Our results reveal that raccoons in
   developed areas benefit from the consumption of human-derived subsidies,
   but it might further put them at risk from conflict and vehicular
   strikes.},

Title = {Changes in the diet of the native sea urchin Arbacia dufresnii at
   different scenarios of the Undaria pinnatifida invasion (Patagonia,
   Argentina)},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Undaria pinnatifida is one of the most successful marine invasive
   species worldwide. Since its first detection in Nuevo Gulf (Argentina),
   changes in the species richness and diversity of native algae and
   macrofauna have been reported. Knowledge of the invasive alga-native
   grazer interaction is key to better understand ecosystem dynamics and
   the potential effects of Undaria on local food webs. The aim of this
   study was to compare the diet of the sea urchin Arbacia dufresnii, among
   different scenarios of invasion of Undaria in two northern Patagonian
   gulfs. To this end, we determined the relative contribution of kelp to
   the diet of the sea urchin by comparing the gut content and stable
   isotopes in different tissues of A. dufresnii from sites where the
   invasion of Undaria was advanced, relatively recent, or not recorded.
   Because A. dufresnii has a plastic feeding habit and Undaria represents
   a high input of algal biomass, our hypothesis was that A. dufresnii
   feeds on Undaria and that the contribution of the invasive kelp to the
   diet of the sea urchin will be greater according to the time elapsed
   since invasion. Our results confirmed that A. dufresnii fed on Undaria
   and assimilated in gonads and muscle. The contribution of Undaria to the
   sea urchin diet was related to the stage of invasion. In the site with
   an advanced stage of invasion, A. dufresnii consumed the kelp both in
   spring and summer, when sporophytes were mature and senescent,
   respectively. However, in the recently invaded site, A. dufresnii
   consumed Undaria only in summer, when the kelp was senescent. Arbacia
   dufresnii is an omnivore species with the plasticity to adapt its diet
   to a variety of resources depending on the availability in the
   environment, prioritizing faunal items. This work reinforces the
   importance of complementing gut analysis with stable isotope analysis to
   determine the contribution of items in the diet. Although the impacts of
   an invasive alga on food webs and ecosystem structure are difficult to
   evaluate, performing these analyses in different scenarios may allow
   better understanding the local food web structure and assessing the
   possible ecological consequences over the invaded habitat.},

Title = {Diet of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) on farmlands in Namibia},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although their ecology has been well studied across their range, spotted
   hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) diets, espe-cially within Namibia, are
   understudied when compared to other large African carnivores in southern
   Africa. Large carnivores outside of protected areas often faces
   persecution by farmers as they are often perceived as being livestock
   killers and spotted hyaenas on arid farmlands in Namibia does not escape
   this prejudice. Here we investigated the scat composition of spotted
   hyaenas outside of protected areas on farmlands in south-western parts
   of Namibia. A total of 53 scat samples were collected from which 203
   hair samples were used for identi-fication purposes. Our results
   indicate that 69.46\% of hairs in scat were of wildlife species whilst
   30.54\% of hairs were from domesticated species. The asymptote reached
   also suggested that 53 scat samples were sufficient to describe the
   spotted hyaeans's diet in this particular area. We suspect that an
   outbreak of rabies in the study area as well as anthropogenic food
   sources could have influenced prey consumption. As the majority of prey
   consumed were of wildlife species (such as kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros
   and Hartmann's Mountain zebra Equus zebra hartmannae) it is suggested
   that should the natural prey base be maintained livestock predation
   could be mitigated. We recommend that future researchers investigate the
   diet composition of the only other apex predator in this study area,
   leopards (Panther pardus) which could describe the prey selection and
   dietary overlap between these two large carnivores.},

Title = {Coastal hypoxia reduces trophic resource coupling and alters niche
   characteristics of an ecologically dominant omnivore},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy and biomass move through a variety of trophic pathways in coastal
   ecosystems, with pelagic and benthic pathways often dominating food web
   dynamics. Consumers that couple these pathways play important
   struc-turing roles in these food webs by integrating spatially
   disconnected or asynchronous production pathways. The objective of this
   study was to quantify benthic and pelagic trophic pathway contributions
   to the diet of the mysid Neomysis americana in the Choptank and Patuxent
   rivers (tributaries of Chesapeake Bay) and determine if the relative
   contribution of these two trophic pathways differs between ecosystems
   with different environmental, physical, and watershed features. This
   mysid species undergoes daily vertical migrations throughout the water
   column and it was hypothesized that hypoxia (< 2 mg/L) in deep-water
   habitats of the Patuxent River (but not the Choptank) could reduce the
   importance of the benthic pathway for mysids in the Patuxent River
   relative to the Choptank River. Mysids and trophic resources were
   collected in each river during the summers of 2018 and 2019 and analyzed
   for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition and tissue
   stoichiometry (C:N). Stable -isotope based estimates of benthic trophic
   pathway contribution, trophic position, and isotopic niche area (proxy
   for trophic niche) and C:N composition of N. americana were compared
   within and between tributaries. Overall, mysids in the Patuxent River
   assimilated less benthic material, realized lower trophic positions, and
   had lower C:N ratios (proxy for lipid content) than Choptank River
   mysids. No consistent pattern in trophic niche area was observed
   although niche area (and pelagic trophic pathway contribution) of
   Choptank River mysids increased during a high river discharge event.
   This study provides evidence that hypoxic conditions in the Patuxent
   reduced the strength of benthic-pelagic coupling by N. americana and,
   further, is associated with lower trophic position and a reduced
   stoichiometric marker of lipid storage. In addition to their role as
   omnivorous consumers, N. americana are a dominant prey taxon for many
   predators, underscoring the importance of this species to local food
   webs and the potential for bottom-up effects on the dynamics of coastal
   ecosystems in response to changes in their trophic ecology.},

Title = {Predators affect a plant virus through density and trait-mediated
   indirect effects on vectors},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Biological control programs frequently rely on insect predators to
   control pests that vector plant pathogens in agroecosystems. Predators
   affect vectors by eating them (consumptive effects) and by inducing
   antipredator behaviors (non-consumptive effects), and these interactions
   may affect transmission of vector-borne pathogens. However, it has
   proven difficult to experimentally tease apart the effects of predators
   on vector fitness and behavior as they are often correlated. We
   addressed this problem by assessing how both aphids and an aphid -borne
   pathogen were affected by variable predation risk. Specifically, we
   experimentally manipulated lady -beetle predators' mouthparts to isolate
   consumptive, and non-consumptive, effects of predators on aphid fitness,
   movement, and virus transmission. We show that although lethal predators
   decreased aphid vector abundance, they increased pathogen transmission
   by increasing aphid movement among hosts. Moreover, aphids responded to
   risk of predation by moving to younger plant tissue that was more
   susceptible to the pathogen. Aphids also responded to predator risk
   through compensatory reproduction, which offset direct consumptive
   effects. Our results support predictions of disease models showing
   alterations of vector movement due to predators can have greater effects
   on transmission of pathogens than vector consumption, which should be
   considered when examining natural enemies' role in pathogen dynamics.
   Broadly, our study shows isolating direct and indirect predation effects
   can reveal novel pathways by which predators affect vector-borne
   pathogens.},

Title = {Are seed-dispersing ants elaiosome-limited? An experimental test in a
   Connecticut forest dominated by myrmecochorous plants},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Food-for-dispersal mutualisms are critical sources of energy flow in
   ecological networks. By providing a nutrient -rich reward in the form of
   a fruit or seed to an animal mutualist, plants gain directed dispersal.
   Myrmecochory is one form of animal-mediated seed dispersal in which ants
   are recruited to plant seeds by providing a nutrient rich appendage
   called an elaiosome. It is unclear to what impact nutrients provided by
   elaiosomes have on ants, and whether the mutualism can tolerate
   disruptions to this food source. In the Northeastern U.S. mixed
   deciduous forest ecoregion, a diverse assemblage of herbaceous plants
   are dispersed by Aphaenogaster ants. Since Aphae-nogaster ants gain a
   significant nutrient subsidy from this mutualism, it is predicted that
   loss of these seeds could cause reductions in their population size. To
   test this hypothesis, I performed a long-term removal of elaiosome food
   sources for ants. All seeds were removed by hand from three 50m2 plots,
   each paired with control plots with no removal, and a supplementation
   plot from April to May, from 2010 to 2012. Five years following removal
   treatments, I collected data on coverage of ant-dispersed plants and the
   abundance of seed-dispersing Aphae-nogaster ants. Removal of all sources
   of elaiosomes resulted in modest reductions in the proportional coverage
   of ant-dispersed plants relative to control plots. Ant forager abundance
   was not impacted by the treatments five years after the removal of
   elaiosomes. In sum, Aphaenogaster populations may not always be limited
   by the availability of elaiosomes or myrmecochorous plants produce can
   recover quickly (< 5 years) to provide enough food for these ants. As
   long as surrounding populations of understory forest plants are
   maintained, it appears that both mutualistic ants may rebound from a
   short-term reduction in the production of elaiosomes.},

   limited data on facultative scavengers. Here, we describe a keel-billed
   toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus) sequestering vertebrate carrion-1 m off
   the ground. This observation is the first record of a toucan species
   supplementing their diet with carrion, and expands the list of
   facultative scavengers in the Neotropics, an area where scavenging is
   poorly understood. We caution that vertebrate remains found in
   gut-content analyses for toucans may be from scavenging, and we
   highlight that the consumption of vertebrate carrion by toucans could
   have landscape-level implications in the redistribution and movement of
   carcass nutrients and energy.\& nbsp;},

Title = {Food webs speak of human impact: Using stable isotope-based tools to
   measure ecological consequences of environmental change},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Linking their major biotic and abiotic components, food webs form the
   core of ecosystems, many of which are today exposed to multiple human
   impacts acting at several spatial and temporal scales. A food web
   perspective allows for a quantification of environmental change effects
   on both the structure of biological diversity and the functioning of
   ecosystems. Food web metrics based on stable isotope analysis (SIA)
   represent a promising way for an integrative assessment of these
   responses. While showing high sensitivity to environmental change, they
   are, however, rarely presented and discussed within a systematic
   mechanistic and hypothesis-driven framework. Here we first provide a
   global overview of anthropogenic impact types, their effects on food
   webs and the associated ecological mechanisms. Based on published
   studies from terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, we then
   demonstrate the versatility of SIA-based metrics, allowing for
   quantification of several key food web attributes and applicable across
   a wide range of human-induced impacts such as eutrophication, pollution,
   introduction of exotic species or connectivity interruption. We finally
   propose a guiding framework to make SIA application in the studies of
   anthropogenic impact on food webs more rigorous and enhance its
   potential for producing novel insights.},

Title = {Spatial stream modeling of Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla)
   foraging substrate and aquatic prey in a watershed undergoing shale gas
   development},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We demonstrate the use of spatial stream network models (SSNMs) to
   explore relationships between a semi-aquatic bioindicator songbird,
   Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla), and stream monitoring and
   benthic macroinvertebrate data in an area undergoing shale gas
   development. SSNMs allowed us to account for spatial autocorrelation
   inherent to these environmental data types and stream properties that
   traditional modeling approaches cannot capture to elucidate factors that
   affect waterthrush foraging locations. We monitored waterthrush along
   58.1 km of 1st-and 2nd-order headwater stream tributaries (n = 14) in
   northwestern West Virginia over a two year period (2013-2014), sampled
   benthic macroinvertebrates in waterthrush territories, and collected
   wetted perimeter stream channel and water chemistry data along a 50 m
   fixed point stream grid. Spatial models outperformed traditional
   regression models and made a statistical difference in whether stream
   covariates of interest were considered relatable to waterthrush
   foraging. Waterthrush foraging probability index (FPI) was greater in
   areas where family and genus-level multi-metric indices of biotic stream
   integrity were higher (i.e. WVSCI and GLIMPSS). Waterthrush were found
   foraging both among stream flow connected and unconnected sampled sites
   on relatively further upstream locations where WVSCI and GLIMPSS were
   predicted to be highest. While there was no significant relationship
   found between FPI and shale gas land use on a catchment area scale,
   further information on waterthrush trophic dynamics and bioaccumulation
   of surface contaminants is needed before establishing the extent to
   which waterthrush foraging may be affected by shale gas development.},

   identified 10 species of prey, in addition to unidentified birds and
   small rodents. Small and medium animals were the most frequent prey,
   although wild camelids contributed the greatest proportion of biomass.
   We also recorded the presence of mesopredators and domestic dogs in puma
   scats. Our results suggest that the puma could play a key role in the
   configuration of trophic networks in the RNSAB, and that this can
   contribute considerably to the ecosystem balance.},

Abstract = {Arecaceae (Palmae) is an ecologically and economically important family
   characteristic of the vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions,
   with at least 125 species occurring in the Philippines, most of them
   endemics. We monitored changes in stem density, mortality and
   recruitment of palm populations for 12 years within a 16-ha Forest
   Dynamic Plot located in northern Luzon, the Philippines. We recorded a
   total of 4060 stems, dominated by Pinanga insignis (46\%) and P.
   maculata (34\%), followed by Caryota cumingii (19\%), and a few stems (<
   1\%) of Orania decipiens and Areca whitfordii. Half (51\%) of the
   initially recorded stems in the 2004 census died by the time of the 2016
   census, while 1086 (36\%) additional stems were recorded in the same
   period. Overall palm population declined with the decreasing populations
   of P. insignis and P. maculata due to higher mortality than recruitment
   during the 2004-2010 and 2010-2016 census intervals while C. cumingii
   population increased in the same period. Regarding topographic position,
   the stem density of P. maculata is higher in valleys > midslopes >
   ridges across censuses, higher in valleys and midslopes than ridges for
   C. cumingii across censuses, and higher in midslopes than valleys for P.
   insignis during the 2016 census only. Mortality and recruitment were
   weakly observed along topographic positions between species and across
   censuses. Our result presents how palm population may change within 12
   years with population trends differing between species, indicating the
   importance of palms in understanding the population dynamics of plant
   communities in a fast-changing environment.},

Title = {Effects of Hurricane Dean and tropical storm Karl on the coral reef fish
   assemblage of Banco Chinchorro: temporal changes in rarity, and alpha

Abstract = {The Banco Chinchorro Reef is an area with a high ecological value
   impacted by Hurricane Dean in 2007 and tropical storm Karl in 2010.
   Because these types of meteorological events have recently occurred with
   a higher frequency and intensity, this work evaluated the change in
   taxonomic alpha and beta diversity of reef fish due to these natural
   impacts. We used records of fish and benthic elements obtained before
   and after the impact of these meteors (2007-2011) to analyze the
   following: i) species richness, rarity, and composition; ii) beta
   diversity; iii) taxonomic distinctness; and iv) relationship between
   species composition and benthic habitat. The results showed that
   Hurricane Dean and tropical storm Karl temporarily changed fish
   diversity. This effect was gradual and showed greater variation in 2009
   and 2010. In the same years, we found an increase in species richness
   and rarity that diminished in 2011. There was also an important
   variation in fish species composition, beta diversity, and taxonomic
   distinctness. The variation in fish composition was mainly correlated
   with benthic elements like fleshy macroalgae, foliose coral, and rocky
   substrate. In general, we observed that the fish assemblage of Banco
   Chinchorro is trending toward a condition similar to that found before
   the passage of Hurricane Dean and Storm Karl; this evidence indicates
   that this biological group is resilient and persistent despite strong
   natural impacts. Our results suggest that proper management before and
   after natural impacts could warrant recolonization of reef fish species
   because they depend on the ecosystem's condition.},

Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The icon ectomycorrhizal (EcM) species, Tuber melanosporum, requires
   mycophagy for ascospore dispersal. Isopods are often found within
   fruitbodies and to explore why, Oniscus asellus were presented with T.
   melanosporum as a food source. Fruitbodies were consumed at a rate of
   4.0 mg per isopod, over 24 h. Most of the recovered faecal pellets
   contained ascospores after 12 h. Gut-transit inflicted little mechanical
   damage to ascospores, and the majority were still contained with an
   ascus 30 h post feeding. Further, ascospores were observed in faecal
   pellets 18 days after consumption. Combined, the results suggest a
   previously overlooked role for isopods in EcM spore dispersal. The
   impacts for EcM ecology and the role of isopods in Tuber spp.
   lifecycles, including mating type distribution, is discussed alongside
   the emerging threat of climate change and how such knowledge can inform
   management by custodians of relevant habitat types.},

Title = {Unconventional bird predators are relevant to vertebrate trophic
   relationships? A community science platform helps to answer this
   question.},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Birds stand out among animal predators due their high species diversity
   and ecological flexibility. In a restrictive sense, bird predators
   include species that had vertebrate meat as main food item (conventional
   bird predators). However, insectivores, frugivores and omnivores birds
   occasionally include vertebrates in their diets (unconventional bird
   predators). Here, we use photographs posted in a community science
   platform (wikiaves) to examine the importance of conventional and
   unconventional bird predators to the trophic structure of Neotropical
   vertebrate assemblages. After detailed inspection of 71,285 photographs,
   we built a database of 6553 feeding events from 640 species distributed
   in 32 bird families. Vertebrates are part of the diet of 92 species of
   conventional and 91 species of unconventional bird predators. As
   expected, diets of conventional bird predators are predominantly
   composed of vertebrates (84\% of feeding records, n = 1689), although
   invertebrates were also relevant for diets of owls, hawks and herons. In
   contrast, vertebrates comprised only 8\% of feeding records (n = 358)
   among the unconventional bird predators. The contribution of vertebrates
   to diets of unconventional bird predators was relevant (> 10\% of
   feeding records) in five of 24 analyzed bird families. Fishes, mammals
   and birds are the main preys of conventional predators, whereas
   unconventional predators focusing on ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians
   and reptiles). Unconventional predators expand the diversity of local
   vertebrate predators and consume distinct preys compared to conventional
   predators. Therefore, families of unconventional bird predators must be
   considered relevant to food web analysis of Neotropical vertebrate
   assemblages.},

Title = {Trophic interactions at avian carcasses: Do scavengers feed on vulture
   carrion?},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Scavenging is a pervasive foraging strategy among vertebrates, yet
   researchers have only recently begun to reveal the complex implications
   of scavenging dynamics. Scavenging studies have predominantly used lower
   trophic level (i.e., herbivore) species as carrion bait, and the few
   studies that have used higher trophic level (i.e., carnivore) carrion
   have found these carcass types are generally avoided by vertebrates or
   scavenged by fewer species than similarly sized herbivore carcasses. No
   studies have assessed the fate of carcasses of obligate scavengers. To
   investigate potential differences in scavenging dynamics among avian
   carrion representing different guilds and trophic levels, we conducted
   scavenging trials using 20 replicates of two obligate scavenger species
   (i.e. black vulture, Coragyps atratus; turkey vulture, Cathartes aura)
   and two lower trophic level species, chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus),
   and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Carcass trials were conducted at the
   Savannah River Site, SC, USA, and monitored with remote cameras. We
   hypothesized carcasses of vultures would persist longer and have a
   distinct scavenging community compared to lower trophic level carcasses
   (mallard and chicken). As expected, turkey and black vulture carcasses
   persisted in the environment longer, were less likely to be entirely
   consumed by vertebrate scavengers, and had a different scavenging
   community than mallard and chicken carcasses. These results contribute
   to the growing body of evidence suggesting higher trophic level carrion
   is exploited differently by vertebrate scavengers. Our findings suggest
   nutrients derived from vulture carcasses are likely largely
   reincorporated into lower trophic levels.},

Abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) receivers allow researchers to collect
   location data that provide information about fine-scale animal
   movements. For large carnivores, these data are routinely processed to
   identify clusters of GPS locations which are investigated to validate
   feeding sites, estimate prey species composition and model the
   likelihood of predation events based on characteristics of GPS location
   data within clusters. Although developing predation models entails a
   high level of field effort, researchers are apprehensive in applying
   system-specific models to other systems both spatially and temporally.
   Our objectives were to apply and compare multiple predation models to
   predict and identify feeding events outside of the geographic areas
   where models were developed. Using our multi-model approach, we
   identified feeding sites and estimated kill rates and prey composition
   of mountain lions Puma concolor in southwest Wyoming, USA from 2017 to
   2019. Our approach increased our field efficiency by reducing potential
   field site investigations by 63\%. We provide results of estimated diet
   composition in our study area where mountain lion prey included
   relatively high proportions of pronghorn (12.3\%) and smaller mammals,
   particularly coyotes (7.6\%). We also provide a comparison of the
   predation models developed across unique ecoregions of North America,
   and how they performed when applied to our area. We believe a similar
   approach could be adopted for other large carnivore populations where
   multiple models have been developed to characterize feeding events.},

Title = {Replicating nature's fabric: High information markets and the
   sustainability of global seafood},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Global fisheries and seafood supply chains have remarkable structural
   similarities to nature's food webs, with humans as apex predators,
   allowing us to use ecological concepts to draw connections between
   fisheries man-agement and the stability and resilience of the global
   seafood system. However, misinformation currently pla-gues the global
   seafood market and may be preventing food webs' natural stabilizing
   features from working properly in the seafood system. We argue that
   misinformation blocks transparency throughout the entire supply chain
   and prevents consumers from making informed and potentially stabilizing
   decisions, undermining the sustainability of the global seafood system.
   Here, we first describe how food webs contain a remarkably repeated
   generalist module, characterized by flexible mobile generalist predators
   that adapt to resource variability in space by making rapid and
   ``informed{''} foraging switches. Next, we discuss how the global
   seafood system mimics this structure but opposes the common stabilizing
   mechanism of nature's food webs because it is replete with
   misinformation. We conclude that modern tools combined with proper
   labelling can help create high information markets that allow consumers
   to make rapid and informed decisions. Predators' roles in nature's food
   webs indicate that smart switches in consumer foraging (i.e., demand)
   are critical for global seafood sustainability and the maintenance of
   marine biodiversity.},

Title = {Who feeds on whom in semi-aquatic moss ecosystems?},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Moss patches growing at the interface between terrestrial and limnic
   ecosystems (in the splash-water zone) are colonized by terrestrial,
   semi-aquatic, and aquatic animals. Besides being a refuge, mosses
   provide food resources, such as micro-algae, particulate organic matter,
   and moss tissues themselves. In this study, the standing stocks and
   isotopic signatures of both resources and consumers were measured to
   analyze the trophic channels utilized by moss-dwelling consumers in two
   semi-aquatic moss ecosystems of a stream and a lake. The mean total
   invertebrate abundance (+/- SD) in the lake mosses was 1109.08 +/-
   230.33 ind.10(gmoss)DW(- 1), which was \~{}4-fold higher than in the
   stream (265.37 +/- 184.62 ind.10(gmoss)DW(-1)). We found that moss
   tissues were a fairly minor contributor to the diets of the
   invertebrates; instead the most important resource for invertebrates was
   the epiphytic biofilms growing on them. The moss-dwelling community in
   the lake occupied a larger isotopic space than in the stream, suggesting
   a lower trophic redundancy of the community in the lake. This was
   especially the case for the delta C-13 range, which was 39\% larger in
   the lake than in the stream, where delta C-13 signatures appeared more
   focused. In contrast, the delta N-15 range of the invertebrate community
   associated with mosses was rather large and did not differ substantially
   between stream and lake. Dorylaimid nematodes, predatory dipters and
   water mites showed enriched delta N-15 signatures suggesting they could
   occupy apex positions in moss food webs despite their small body sizes.
   Our results suggested that mosses were not an important food resource,
   but instead their textural complexity enabled a coherent and relatively
   large invertebrate food web composed of detritivores, algivores,
   omnivores, predators, and probably parasites.},

Title = {Trophic structure and biomagnification of cadmium, mercury and selenium
   in brown smooth hound shark (Mustelus henlei) within a trophic web},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Stable isotopic values of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15)
   were used to characterize the trophic structure and biomagnification of
   Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg) and Selenium (Se) in a trophic web of 18 taxa
   namely zooplankton, crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and Mustelus henlei
   shark collected off the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico.
   Isotopic results indicated interspecies variations in the trophic web
   structure with mean d C-13 values of - 20.0\% (zooplankton) < 18.2 \%
   (M. henlei) < 14.1 \% (Thaisella kiosquiformis, mollusk). In general,
   delta N-15 and delta C-13 values increased from primary consumers
   (zooplankton) to predators, following the isotopic patterns of other
   trophic webs. The concentrations of Cd, Hg and Se were relatively less
   in most of the organisms except mollusks that presented high
   concentrations of Cd. The biomagnification factors of the trophic web
   showed biodilution of Cd (Food Web Magnification Factor, FWMFCd = 0.2),
   biomagnification of Hg (FWMFHg = 3.34) and Se (FWMFSe = 1.45)
   respectively. However, the concentrations of Se did not increase
   consistently from the lower trophic levels to the higher ones. This
   study documents the dynamics of a marine trophic structure and
   demonstrates that biodilution/biomagnification processes of metal
   contaminants are largely species specific and are closely related to
   physical - chemical and food web structure.},

Title = {High-throughput sequencing reveals prey diversity overlap between
   sympatric Sulids in the tropical Atlantic},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Seabirds breeding at tropical latitudes suffer an increased pressure to
   forage efficiently, because oligotrophic waters have less abundant and
   more patchily distributed prey. In related species living in sympatry,
   trophic or spatial niche partitioning may emerge as a strategy to
   mitigate increased competition. However, studies using molecular
   methodologies such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test for these
   strategies are still scarce. In this study we used HTS to assess prey
   diversity partitioning on two sulid species living sympatrically in the
   tropical Raso Islet (Cabo Verde). Brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) breed
   in Raso Islet throughout the year while Red-footed boobies (Sula sula)
   occur during molt, from June to October. We compared Brown boobies diet
   prey diversity between the two periods (non-coexistence vs. coexistence
   with Red-footed booby), as well as between both sulids while in
   coexistence. Overall, the diets of all groups were clearly dominated by
   a small number of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), with a
   predominance of flying fish. The diet composition of Brown boobies was
   significantly different between the two time periods, most likely due to
   temporal differences in prey availability or possible competition with
   other seabird species. Brown boobies exploited a wider taxo-nomic range
   of prey, while Red-footed boobies used a subset of Brown boobies' prey
   diversity. Furthermore, we did not find intersexual differences in the
   diet composition of both species. Overall, we did not find evidence that
   prey diversity partitioning occurred, probably due to the parallel
   occurrence of spatial niche partitioning.},

Title = {Habitat complexity mediates spatiotemporal niche partitioning among
   native and invasive seed predators},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Red imported fire ants dominate certain food webs in North America due
   to their omnivorous and aggressive feeding behavior. Structural habitat
   complexity can mediate effects of invasive predators on native insects,
   by either facilitating or tempering antagonistic interactions, with
   potential consequences at lower trophic levels. Along a gradient of
   habitat complexity, we evaluated how refuge affects the activity and
   foraging behavior of fire ants and native invertebrate seed predators
   using video surveillance, and then determined their consumption of
   pigweed seeds in seed removal assays. Fire ants dominated seed predation
   in our system, and structural complexity increased both their activity
   and seed removal, while reducing that of native seed predators. In
   structurally simple habitats with high sun exposure, fire ant activity
   was restricted to the evening when tem-peratures were milder, while
   native seed predators foraged during the heat of the day, possibly to
   avoid antagonistic interactions with fire ants. In relatively shaded,
   structurally complex habitat, the active foraging period for fire ants
   expanded earlier into the heat of the day, and almost totally overlapped
   with that of native seed predators. Our data suggest that structural
   refuge may facilitate antagonism and site/resource domination by fire
   ants.},

Title = {Grasshopper feeding preference affects cascading effects of predators on
   plant biomass in a mixed-grass prairie},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The importance of cascading effects of grasshopper predators on plant
   biomass involving grasshoppers in grassland ecosystems appears variable.
   A constraint of most grasshopper trophic cascade studies to date is that
   they examine responses of a single grasshopper species, while
   grasshopper feeding guilds could affect whether a trophic cascade is
   observed. As grasslands are grass dominated, grass feeding grasshoppers
   generally have stronger impacts on plant biomass than mixed grass and
   forb feeding species indicating that trophic cascades should be observed
   more commonly with grass feeding species. Grasshopper feeding preference
   could have important implications for predicting the outcome of
   grasshopper predator-prey interactions. I conducted similar experiments
   in two years with different grasshopper feeding guilds, grass feeding
   and mixed grass and forb feeding, to examine the importance of cascading
   predator effects at a grass dominated prairie site. For both
   experiments, treatments consisted of invertebrate removal, herbivore
   only, and herbivore plus predator treatments. There was no indication of
   a trophic cascade with high densities of a mixed feeding grasshopper
   species in a year with lower biomass production. Although plant regrowth
   following herbivory can weaken the appearance of trophic cascades, a
   trophic cascade on grass biomass was evident with high densities of a
   grass feeding grasshopper during a year with higher biomass production.
   As a result, plant preference appears to impact the importance of
   cascading effects of predators on plant biomass in this system.},

Title = {Carbon sources supporting macrobenthic crustaceans in tropical eastern
   pacific mangroves},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In tropical mangroves, crustaceans are one of the most relevant
   components in terms of abundance, occurrence, biomass, function, and
   human welfare. Since these organisms are involved in the trophic
   dynamics of mangroves and also, are important fishery resources, the
   study of carbon used by crustaceans in mangrove ecosystems is important
   to understand the food web functioning of mangroves and estuaries, and
   how energy and matter flow through these organisms, via their
   participation in different trophic pathways. We compared the isotopic
   composition (delta C-13/delta N-15) of carbon sources and macrobenthic
   crustacean species of three macrotidal (fringe, internal and external
   riverine) mangroves, located in the central Colombian Pacific, and used
   a Bayesian aproached to evaluate if geomorphology induces differences in
   the isotopic composition and in the relative contribution of primary
   producers to different species of macrobenthic crustaceans. Differences
   were found in the isotopic composition between the three systems, with
   C-13 values generally enriched for the external riverine mangrove,
   indicating a marine influence. The relative contribution of
   microphytobenthos with respect to other primary sources was highest in
   the three mangrove systems, followed by mangrove and seston in the
   internal and external riverine respectively, and macroalgae in fringe
   system. However, differences were found in the contribution of all
   sources depending on the species and type of mangrove but trophic
   pathways of the systems are the same. Our results confirm part of the
   hypothesis of this research, showing that geomorphological configuration
   of the habitat induces significative differences in the isotopic
   composition of primary sources and macrobenthic crustaceans but, the
   carbon utilization patterns of macrobenthic crustaceans show the same
   main trophic pathways (mangroves and microphytobenthos) in all three
   systems, due to the similar availability of carbon sources despite
   geomorphological differences.},

Title = {Effects of urbanization on the trophic niche of the brown anole, a
   widespread invasive lizard},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most dramatic forms of environmental change
   with the potential to alter trophic relationships among organisms in
   cities. In this study, we combine gut-content and stable isotope
   analyses of brown anole diets with field sampling of arthropods to
   assess whether and how urbanization-induced variation of basal resources
   influence trophic niche variation of anole populations inhabiting urban,
   suburban, and natural habitats. We found clear evidence for trophic
   niche variation across the urbanization gradient. Stable isotope
   analyses revealed that urban and suburban anoles had strongly elevated
   813C levels and slightly lower 815N levels compared to anoles from
   natural forests- results consistent with increased reliance on grasses
   across the ur-banization gradient. Isotopic niche widths were also
   greater in urban habitats. However, our analysis of anole diets revealed
   no difference in the diversity of prey consumed-despite urban habitats
   having the highest di-versity of available prey compared to suburban and
   natural forest habitats. Overall, our results suggest that much of the
   observed variation in food web structure results from a shift in the
   diversity of basal resource pools across the urbanization gradient. The
   broader effects of a shift towards grass-dominated food webs in urban
   habitats remains to be understood.},

Journal = {FOOD WEBS},

Abstract = {Surplus killing is a rare behavior in large predators and its
   documentation has been scarce. This phenomenon has been observed mostly
   in carnivores and comprises on the predation of several prey in a short
   period that eventually would not be consumed, this behavior presents a
   challenge to ecological theory because it appears to be a waste of
   energy. Although there are several records of surplus killing behavior
   for the Panthera genus, this behavior has not been reported on free
   roaming jaguar (Panthera onca) populations. Hence, this report describes
   in-situ evidence of surplus killing by jaguars during the arribada
   massive nesting on olive ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea) in Nancite
   beach, Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. This new report has
   interesting implications for food web theory, as it shows that under
   certain circumstances some predators are capable of killing more prey
   than they can consume, showing how strong the hunting instinct can be
   for certain species.},

Title = {Grey wolf feeding habits and their geographical variation in Northwest
   Spain},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study investigates wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences and their
   geographical variation by calculating frequency of occurrence and
   biomass consumption in three areas in the north-western Iberian
   Peninsula that differ in terms of the type and abundance of potential
   prey. Wolf dietary preferences were expected to be related to the
   availability of a species of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus
   atlanticus) and much less to traditional livestock in each habitat. The
   diet of wolves was found to comprise mostly Galician feral horses when
   available, with a low proportion of livestock. The next most consumed
   species were wild boar (Sus scrofa) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). A
   much higher consumption of traditional livestock (84\% biomass) was
   observed in the one study area where there were no feral horses. The
   fact that access to feral horses may help decrease wolf predation on
   other species of livestock which are more economically important and the
   environmental benefits of horses in protecting against forest fires
   suggest that conservation and expansion of this endangered species of
   horses should be encouraged. Strengthening existing populations and
   possibly re-introducing native wild species within the wolf's range may
   be the most environmentally friendly way to reduce economic losses for
   farmers and cattle breeders.},

Title = {Death from below: Sit-and-wait predatory behavior in a burrowing
   crayfish (Lacunicambarus thomai)},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The biology of burrowing crayfishes remains elusive to biologists,
   primarily because these animals spend a majority of their lives within
   the confines of their burrow. Scattered observations of burrowing
   crayfishes have suggested that burrowing crayfish may exhibit a greater
   degree of surface activity than previously thought. Surface behavior may
   be related to social interactions, predator defense, or prey capture.
   But documentation of these behaviors is rare, and few studies have been
   conducted on the predatory behaviors of burrowing crayfishes. Here, we
   report the findings of 24-h video recording surveys conducted on a
   burrowing crayfish species, the Little Brown Mudbug (Lacunicambarus
   thomai). In total, we recorded and watched 633 h of video. We observed
   L. thomai sitting atop their burrow engaging in sit-and-wait predatory
   behavior. This ambush predatory behavior was used on several different
   animal prey items, including spiders (Lycosidae), slugs (Philomycidae),
   and dragonfly nymphs (Aeshnidae). We also we recorded crayfish cutting
   terrestrial vegetation near their burrow entrance and pulling it down
   into their burrow. Additionally, we analyzed the gut contents of 23 L.
   thomai from 4 populations to understand the generality of our foraging
   observations. Indeed, gut content analyses confirmed that all
   populations consumed both animal prey and vegetation. Overall, our
   recordings demonstrate that sit-andwait predatory behavior may be a
   common foraging behavior among burrowing crayfishes. Further, our
   observations highlight the trophic role of burrowing crayfish species
   and emphasizes how these animals forage on both animal and plant
   communities in terrestrial habitats.},

Abstract = {In the light of unprecedented planetary changes in biodiversity,
   real-time and accurate ecosystem and biodiversity assessments are
   becoming increasingly essential for informing policy and sustainable
   development. Biodiversity monitoring is a challenge, especially for
   large areas such as entire continents. Nowadays, spaceborne and airborne
   sensors provide information that incorporate wavelengths that cannot be
   seen nor imagined with the human eye. This is also now accomplished at
   unprecedented spatial resolutions, defined by the pixel size of images,
   achieving less than a meter for some satellite images and just
   millimeters for airborne imagery. Thanks to different modeling
   techniques, it is now possible to study functional diversity changes
   over different spatial and temporal scales. At the heart of this
   unifying framework are the ``spectral species{''}-sets of pixels with a
   similar spectral signal-and their variability over space. The aim of
   this paper is to summarize the power of remote sensing for directly
   estimating plant species diversity, particularly focusing on the
   spectral species concept.},

Abstract = {Variation in bird community composition across habitats may be reflected
   by changes in species' ecological characteristics. By their comparison
   between habitats, we can learn information about the factors underlying
   these changes. With this purpose, we used data from a nation-wide
   breeding bird monitoring scheme surveying birds in 15 habitat types
   sorted into four broad categories (forests, open, urban, and humid
   habitats) in a central European country, Czechia. We considered
   life-history strategy, migration distance, climatic niche position,
   European rarity, and diet niche as species' ecological characteristics
   and compared their mean values across the habitat types. Although
   habitat type explained relatively low proportion of variability in these
   characteristics indicating that birds widely overlap in their habitat
   use, we observed significant differences in ecological characteristics
   between broad habitat categories, as well as between habitat types
   within a given category. For example, urban habitats hosted species with
   generally lower degree of insectivory than forest habitats. Within
   forests, coniferous stands hosted species with colder climatic niche
   than deciduous stands. The greatest differences were observed among
   humid habitat types: species recorded in water bodies were rarer in
   Europe and had slower life-history strategies than species recoded in
   running water. Within the open habitat category, mining areas were the
   most specific habitat with long-migrating and warm-dwelling species. The
   observed patterns can be driven by various factors including
   habitat-specific selection pressures, biogeographic constraints and
   human-induced habitat changes. On their basis, we discuss our findings.},

Title = {Fish community diversity assessment of protected Saraiyaman wetland in

Abstract = {`Saraiyaman' along Gandak River in the Ganges basin is a protected
   natural oxbow lake. In spite of the protection mechanism, it has been
   unrecognised for its habitat services to the fish community by resource
   managers and local dwellers. To investigate fish diversity and habitat
   status of Saraiyaman, exploratory surveys were conducted from April 2017
   to March 2021. The analysis resulted in distribution of 58 fish species
   belonging to 7 orders, 20 families and 40 genera. Cypriniformes was
   found as the most dominant order. Out of 58 species, 7 were evaluated
   under Near Threatened (NT) category. The high value of Shannon diversity
   index (H' = 3.50) highlighted significance of habitat offered by
   Saraiyaman for diverse fish species and its potential to serve as a gene
   pool for conservation of endemic and threatened fish species of the
   Ganga basin. The loss of Saraiyaman's connection from River Gandak,
   increasing encroachment by cropland and climate change have resulted in
   water level reduction, water area shrinkage, eutrophication, infestation
   of aquatic weeds, degradation in habitat condition for fish community,
   decline in fish population, especially vulnerable catfish Wallago attu,
   and lack of quality fish brooders. Hence, under influence of multiple
   stressors, Saraiyaman is leading towards marsh and land afterwards. The
   baseline information generated on habitat and fish diversity status and
   management measures suggested in the present study will help in
   restoration of the function and services of Saraiyaman through existing
   protection mechanism by ensuring the conservation and sustainable
   resource utilisation for achieving the wetland-associated
   CBD-Sustainable Development Goals.},

Abstract = {The different ways in which biodiversity is distributed on Earth have
   always intrigued ecologists, promoting constant research to elucidate
   the causes and mechanisms that guide their spatial patterns. Numerous
   hypotheses have been proposed to explain biodiversity across the world.
   In South American Subtropical Dry forests, a global deforestation
   hotspot, this type of research remains poorly explored. We aimed to
   evaluate the response of forests bird communities to different
   biophysical and environmental factors analyzed simultaneously under
   three major hypotheses in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs) were used to analyze the seasonal richness and relative
   frequency in birds for 27 forest sites scattered through the Dry Chaco,
   Argentina, under the influence of the following predictors: (a) mean
   seasonal temperature, (b) forest biomass, (c) forest primary
   productivity using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and
   (d) landscape heterogeneity. Our results indicate that forest sites with
   high biomass and temperature values and with low landscape heterogeneity
   hold higher bird richness, without any influence of forest productivity.
   The relative frequency was higher in areas with high temperatures and
   high landscape heterogeneity around, although with low values of forest
   productivity. Overall, we highlight that the spatial pattern of bird
   communities in the Argentinean Dry Chaco forests is determined by areas
   with high biomass, high temperatures and mainly low landscape
   transformation in the surroundings. These associations must be
   considered in future decisions on land use for better territory planning
   and the conservation of these important areas for bird diversity.},

Title = {Trophic transfer of microplastics in a model freshwater microcosm; lack
   of a consumer avoidance response},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Microplastics are considered freshwater pollutants of emerging concern.
   Although microplastics have been identified in a range of taxa, only a
   limited number of studies have focussed on the trophic transfer of micro
   plastics. The duckweed Lemna minor can act as a microplastic vector in a
   model freshwater food chain. Here we show for the first time scanning
   electron microscopy images of 1 mu m polystyrene (PS) and 10-45 mu m
   polyethylene (PE) microplastics adsorbed on L. minor surfaces. A feeding
   test and a novel feeding-choice test were designed to investigate
   microplastic transfer from freshwater plants to invertebrates. Both
   tests show that the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni feeds on plant
   biomass irrespective of the presence of microplastics, indicating lack
   of avoidance of microplastics. A number of G. duebeni that were fed L.
   minor with adsorbed PE microplastics had accumulated microplastics in
   their digestive tracts at the end of the tests. Fragmentation of
   microplastics transferred via plant feed and using low concentrations
   was noted for the first time. PE fragments, including particles in the
   nanosized range, were observed in G. duebeni digestive tracts. Yet,
   there was no apparent acute negative effect on G. duebeni weight or
   survival. These findings demonstrate microplastic trophic transfer and
   fragmentation in a freshwater organism. The finding that novel
   nanoplastics are found in the gut does show that biological processes
   are co-determinants of the fate of plastics in the environment and
   emphasise the importance of nanoplastic impact studies.},

Abstract = {This work describes the structure of the assemblage of bivalve mollusks
   (i.e., composition, abundance, density, distribution and species
   diversity) of four representative rocky beaches of Mazatlan bay, Mexico.
   Biological samples were taken in the upper intertidal, lower intertidal
   and shallow subtidal of the beaches together with environmental
   parameters: type of sediment, organic matter, water temperature,
   dissolved oxygen, wave exposure and concentration of chlorophyll a. A
   total of 19,848 individuals distributed in 77 species, 50 genera and 27
   families were recorded. The permutational ANOVA and PERMANOVA indicated
   significant differences in the bivalve assemblage structure among
   environments across studied sites. However, the intertidal (IT) and SS
   environments had different bivalve assemblages. Six species had a broad
   distribution: Acar rostae, Arcopsis solida, Isognomon janus, Saccostrea
   palmula Chama buddiana and Carditamera affinis. Four species had the
   highest density in the IT: Brachidontes semilaevis (196.0 ind m(2)), B.

   aristata (7.1 ind m(2)), B. semilaevis and Acar rostae (3.2 ind m(2)).
   This study shows that exposure to waves was determinant for the bivalve
   distribution that inhabit the intertidal zone. In contrast, chlorophyll
   a and organic material are the variables that best explain the
   distribution of the species in the SS. However, more detailed

Title = {Parasite association in non-volant small mammals in Brazil},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Small mammals not only play an important role in biodiversity, but also
   act as dynamic hosts and reservoirs for a variety of parasites that are
   of public health importance. Furthermore, host-parasite associations are
   driven by complex ecological interactions, and the parasite species
   dynamics are explained by several factors. In this work we aim to verify
   the association between parasitic infections in small Brazilian mammals.
   Here, we carried out a systematic review to verify the distribution of
   parasites in small Brazilian mammals; later we carried out a network
   analysis to assess the host-parasite associations of the results found.
   We found 110 studies that included all groups of parasites. We compiled
   a set of networks with the different groups of parasites (except viruses
   and fungi due to the small number of records). The most widespread host
   species were Akodon cursor, A. montensis, Clyomys laticeps, Didelphis
   albiventris, D. aurita, D. marsupialis, Necromys lasiurus,
   Nectomyssquamipes, Oligoryzomysnigripes, Thaptomys nigrita, and
   Thrichomys fosteri, that occurred in the four networks. All networks had
   modular patterns, except for Helminth's network. A phenomenon known as
   aggregation in parasitology was observed in our review with many
   associations of small mammals and parasites. Furthermore, rodents and
   marsupial species are highly diversified and have the potential to be
   sources of pathogens, directly or indirectly through vectors. Therefore,
   understanding the host-parasite relationship is essential, not only for
   the ecological history of the hosts and/or parasites, but also for its
   importance for public health in disease transmission.},

Abstract = {Numbers of temperate-breeding Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Canada
   geese have greatly increased since the 1980s. Consequently, numbers of
   yearlings, sub-adults and failed breeders undertaking pre-molt migration
   to northern latitudes has also increased, potentially providing
   additional hunting opportunities for Cree hunters living near James Bay,
   Canada. We described movement patterns and habitat use of molt migrant
   Canada geese Brenta canadensis maxima along the east coast of James Bay
   based on nine geese fitted with GSM-GPS devices during 11 northward and
   eight southward migrations between 2015 and 2019. Geese staged for 2.8
   +/- 0.6 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at 3.2 +/- 0.6
   staging sites (mostly tidal flats and salt marshes) from the first week
   of June in spring and 3.8 +/- 1.8 days at 2.0 +/- 0.5 staging sites
   (mostly inland freshwater wetlands, peatlands and tidal flats) from the
   first week of September when returning south. Shallow and deep water
   habitats were used as resting sites during both migrations. In spring,
   molt migrants were mostly harvested in June well after the migration of
   sub-arctic breeding geese whereas in autumn, both subspecies were
   harvested in September. Molt migrant temperate-breeding geese can
   increase harvest opportunities and represent supplementary wildlife food
   for Cree communities. However, the current number of molt migrant geese
   harvested by Cree hunters is not sufficient to significantly impact
   populations of temperate-breeding geese.},

Title = {Hunting suitability model: a new tool for managing wild ungulates},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rising numbers of wild ungulates in human-dominated landscapes of Europe
   can induce negative effects like damages to forests. Therefore,
   effective wildlife management, including harvesting through hunting is
   becoming increasingly important. However, current hunting practices
   often fail to diminish those negative effects, as many ungulate species
   retreat to areas unsuitable for hunting. This predator-avoidance
   behaviour makes it difficult to fulfill the demand of reducing
   population numbers. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative and
   effective wildlife management tools to counteract this problem. Here we
   provide for the first time a hunting suitability model for wild ungulate
   management in mountainous landscapes to visualise hunting suitability
   objectively and realistically. Using red deer as a model species, we
   modelled hunting suitability with high spatial resolution (10 x 10 m),
   based on remote sensing information, field surveys and expert knowledge
   of professional hunters. We analysed spatio-temporal habitat selection
   by radio-collared deer in relation to locations of varying hunting
   suitability. The suitability of various locations regarding hunting
   influenced the spatio-temporal habitat selection by this species,
   consistent with our hypothesis. Red deer avoided areas suitable for
   hunting during daylight hours in the hunting season, but not during the
   night. This species seems to perceive a landscape of heterogeneous
   anthropogenic predation risk, shaped by locations of various hunting
   suitability, as we modelled it. This confirms the empirical realism of
   the model. Concerning wild ungulate management, our hunting suitability
   model provides high-resolution predictions of where species like red
   deer will retreat when perceived anthropogenic predation risk increases.
   The model also yields useful insights regarding the hunting suitability
   of particular locations, which is valuable information especially for
   non-locals. Furthermore, the model can serve as planning tool to inform
   decisions about where particular hunting strategies can be performed
   most efficiently to manage wild ungulates and therefore minimize
   human-wildlife conflicts.},

Abstract = {Ants are present in almost all terrestrial environments and are
   considered indicators of environmental quality. Areas such as the
   Brazilian savannah have been suffering from intense degradation in the
   last decades. This work aims to describe the composition of the ant
   community in Cerrado fragments in urban areas and test how the size and
   type of fragment affect this composition. The study was carried out in
   four Cerrado fragments located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,
   Brazilian Center-West: two state parks and two private natural heritage
   reserves. The collections were carried out using 675 pitfall traps for
   72 h, and environmental variables were measured in each plot. Overall,
   84 ant species were recorded, including five new species for the state.
   There was a significant difference in species richness and community
   composition between fragments, and environmental variables significantly
   affected community composition. Variation in habitat structure may have
   been due to vertical stratification of the vegetation, elements of
   understory formation, and the contribution of leaf litter formation.
   Local, regional, and landscape aspects are significant for the
   maintenance of local ant biodiversity in cities. However, variation and
   quality of habitat within the fragments are also preponderant factors in
   this regard.},

Abstract = {Interactions shape the existence, abundance, and dynamics of species in
   an ecological community. Using ecological niche modelling and temporal
   analysis, we investigated the spatio-temporal partitioning of three
   sympatric mongooses within the Western Ghats, India: ruddy mongoose
   (Urva smithii), stripe-necked mongoose (Urva vitticollis), and brown
   mongoose (Urva fusca). We attempted to determine the distribution of
   sympatric mongooses in a larger area, such as the Western Ghats, how
   they would coexist, and how they would be active. We used data from
   camera traps, direct sighting reports, and published literature
   occurrence records. For niche models, we used environment variables like
   climate, elevation, land cover, forest cover, tree density, highways,
   streams, and global human footprint. The temporal pattern was estimated
   using the time data from camera traps. Mongoose distribution was found
   to be primarily influenced by precipitation and elevation, with a
   considerable response to water bodies. The brown mongoose is nocturnal,
   whereas the other two are diurnal with non-identical activity peaks that
   correspond to sympatric adjustments. The brown and stripe-necked
   mongooses have a higher level of highly suitable niche overlap than the
   ruddy mongoose. It is possible that the sympatric temporal adjustment
   evolved as a result of speciation. The study consolidates baseline
   information on spatio-temporal partitioning of less studied mongooses
   which may be useful in understanding the complex community ecology of
   the Western Ghats landscape from a conservation point of view.},

Abstract = {Extreme environmental conditions like high salinity and temperature are
   continuously affecting fertile lands and trigger an ecological
   imbalance, thereby inducing indigenous microbial communities for
   adaptation to such extreme environments. Present study relates with the
   isolation and characterization of halo-thermotolerant bacteria (HTTB)
   from hyper-saline areas of districts Kashmore and Khairpur, Sindh,
   Pakistan. The isolated bacteria were initially screened for their
   tolerance to elevated salt concentrations and extreme temperature
   ranges. Out of twenty-six bacterial isolates, six bacteria from district
   Kashmore (60\%) and thirteen bacterial isolates from district Khairpur
   (81.25\%) tolerated NaCl concentration up to 15-17\% (w/v), and grown
   efficiently when incubated in the temperature ranges 55-65 degrees C.
   The principle component and multivariate cluster analyses revealed three
   different clusters of HTTB bacteria based on their tolerance and spatial
   distribution. In general, the hyper-saline environments of district
   Kashmore harbored more HTTB than Khairpur, but individually there was
   extreme halotolerance and thermotolerance among Khairpur isolates.
   Finally, the PCR-based molecular typing of 16S rRNA genes revealed,
   majority of the isolates were identified to be various strains of genus
   Bacillus, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. aerius, B.
   vallismortis, B. aquimaris and B. flexus. Only one bacterial strain,
   i.e., KJ1WB, was identified as Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. These HTTB
   bacterial strains may extend significant potential for future
   applications like environmental, biotechnological and enormous
   industrial due to their valuable enzymatic profiles and metabolite
   repositories.},

Abstract = {The high exploitation of marine fisheries resources for their economic
   value along with climate change in recent decades is threatening the
   regeneration of these resources. Available data on the state of fish
   stocks and the trophic organization and functioning of these aquatic
   environments are currently in insufficient. Considering this situation,
   we aim in this study to improve the knowledge and information available
   on the functioning of Mogador marine protected area (MPA), one of the
   marine ecosystems in the Moroccan Atlantic coasts which was established
   to support the conservation of the local fisheries. An Ecopath model is
   applied for this Mogador MPA which is represented by 27 functional
   groups including 18 fishes, which are grouped based on many criteria
   mainly their size and commercial importance in the fisheries of the
   study region. A series of indicator for the food web are identified
   through model statistics and web analysis. The results obtained show
   relatively high ecotrophic efficiency with a transfer efficiency close
   to10\%, indicating a good degree of stability. Analysis of mixed trophic
   impact shows significant top-down control of the food web in this
   system. This study highlights the potential benefits of using an
   ecotrophic model to assess the effects of fishing on stocks.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Moose Alces alces are among the many species that are vulnerable to both
   direct and indirect effects of climate change. Habitat selection is one
   framework to assist investigators in disentangling the various factors
   (including weather) that ultimately dictate how animals respond to their
   environment. We investigated patterns of winter habitat selection by
   adult female moose in southwestern Montana, USA during 2007-2010, and
   how that selection was affected by snow (quantified by snow water
   equivalent) and winter temperatures. We used data from GPS collars and a
   suite of environmental covariates to quantify winter habitat selection
   at both study area (2nd order) and home range (3rd order) spatial scales
   using resource selection functions. Moose strongly selected for the
   willow (Salix spp.) cover type, and against grassland cover. Moose use
   of conifer cover at the home range scale increased when either amount of
   snow or ambient temperature was higher, although the latter only during
   periods of the day when conifer patches were likely to have been cooler
   than cover types lacking a canopy. Wildlife conservation and management
   naturally focuses on preferred habitats, particularly those that fulfill
   essentially all foraging requirements. However, habitats used
   preferentially under stressful weather conditions, even if used rarely
   overall, can also form a critical part of a species' overall needs.},

Title = {The effect of body size on co-occurrence patterns within an African
   carnivore guild},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Intraguild interactions among mammalian carnivores are important in
   shaping carnivore guild composition. Competing species may inhabit
   different areas and/or being active during different times to reduce the
   risk of aggressive interactions, but the role of body size in intraguild
   interactions within carnivore guilds remains largely unknown. We
   determined spatial and temporal co-occurrence of small, medium-sized and
   large carnivores of the carnivore guild in central Tuli, Botswana: lion
   Panthera leo, leopard Panthera pardus, spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta,
   brown hyena Parahyaena brunnea, black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas,
   bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis, African wildcat Felis sylvestris
   lybica, African civet Civettictis civetta, honey badger Mellivora
   capensis and small-spotted genet Genetta genetta. We used camera trap
   data over a two-year period and quantified the degree of temporal and
   spatial overlap by comparing activity patterns and calculating Pianka's
   index respectively. Our results showed that temporal overlap in activity
   between all carnivore species was high, but complete overlap was
   possibly reduced by differences in peak activity periods. In addition,
   low to moderate levels of spatial overlap were found between the
   different carnivore species, supporting the idea that small carnivore
   species inhabit different areas than large species to reduce the risk of
   interference competition. Due to the possible strong competition amongst
   sympatric carnivores there is a need for more knowledge on co-existence
   patterns for successful management and conservation of carnivore
   species, for example when carnivore species are (re)introduced in an
   area.},

Title = {Snow limits polecat Mustela putorius distribution in Sweden},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many species show range expansions or contractions due to climate change
   induced changes in habitat suitability. In cold climates, many species
   that are limited by snow are showing range expansions due to reduced
   winter severity. The European polecat Mustela putorius occurs over large
   parts of Europe with its northern range limit in southern Fennoscandia.
   However, it is to date unknown what factors limit polecat distribution.
   We thus investigated whether climate or land-use variables are more
   important in determining the habitat suitability for polecats in Sweden.
   We hypothesized that 1) climatic factors, especially the yearly number
   of snow days, drive habitat suitability for polecats, and that, 2) as
   the number of snow days is predicted to decline in the near future,
   habitat suitability in northern Sweden will increase. We used a
   combination of sightings data and a selection of national maps of
   environmental factors to test these hypotheses using Maxent models. We
   also used maps of future climate predictions (2021-2050 and 2063-2098)
   to predict future habitat suitability. The number of snow days was the
   most important factor, negatively determining habitat suitability for
   polecats, as expected. Consequently, the predictions showed an increase
   in suitable habitat both in the current distribution range and in
   northern Sweden, especially along the coast of the Baltic Sea. Our
   results suggest that the polecat distribution is limited by snow and
   that reduced snow cover will likely result in a northward range
   expansion. However, the exact mechanisms for how snow limits polecats
   are still poorly understood. The potential range expansion might result
   in a population increase of the Scandinavian polecat population, in
   contrast to many populations elsewhere in Europe, where numbers are
   declining. Due to polecat predation, the expansion of the species might
   have cascading effects on other wildlife populations.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 1980 and 1981, eight and nine individual sika deer Cervus nippon were
   reintroduced in southern Hokkaido, Japan, respectively, to address
   population declines in this species during 1900s. As recent population
   growth has led to human-wildlife conflicts, this study investigated the
   responses of sika deer to resource availability and geomorphic factors
   during the summer and winter seasons in southern Hokkaido. Global
   positioning system-collared data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used
   to assess the home range patterns and habitat selection of 14 female
   sika deer located in Mount Esan and Shiriuchi. The core home range size
   was defined using a 50\% kernel density estimation that indicated a
   larger home range in winter than summer for all deer. Habitat selection
   was assessed using generalized linear mixed models. The results showed
   variation in habitat selection between resident deer of Mount Esan and
   Shiriuchi, as well as migratory deer in Shiriuchi during summer.
   Resident deer in Mount Esan and Shriuchi preferred areas closer to crops
   during summer. Interaction effects revealed that migratory deer utilized
   natural grassland close to forest edge habitat in Shiriuchi. By
   contrast, resident deer in Shiriuchi selected forest edge habitat and
   natural grasslands close to crops. In winter, low elevation was the most
   important habitat factor for all deer across the study area. Thus, sika
   deer habitat selection depends on resource availability in summer and
   topographic factors in the winter.},

Abstract = {Peripheral populations of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus at the trailing
   edge of their range are likely to be at risk of population declines and
   potential extirpation from continued climate and habitat change.
   Accurate estimates of abundance and distribution are needed for
   peripheral populations to inform management decisions. We show that
   ruffed grouse density at the southern periphery of their range is much
   lower than in areas farther north. We surveyed the abundance of drumming
   male grouse across northern Georgia during the springs of 2020-2021 by
   performing roadside point counts at 634 survey points. We used
   hierarchical distance sampling models to predict grouse abundance across
   north Georgia and model spatial variation in density. We estimated
   population size to be 2671 ruffed grouse in Georgia (95\% confidence
   interval 678-11 084). Mean grouse density was 0.003 drumming males/ha
   (SD = 0.006), with the highest density centered in the high-elevation
   mountains. Uncertainty around abundance estimates was high, in part due
   to low precision when estimating availability. Low detectability and
   precision are likely to be common issues when surveying low-abundance
   populations, as often occurs at range peripheries. We suggest that
   abundance estimation could be improved by integrating alternate methods,
   such as automated recording units, into existing monitoring protocols.},

Title = {Prairie dogs, cattle subsidies and alternative prey: seasonal and
   spatial variation in coyote diet in a temperate grassland},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As the dominant predator on North America's grasslands, coyotes Canis
   latrans have a large influence on biodiversity, both on working ranches
   and in protected parks. Ground squirrel (sciurid) species and livestock
   carrion are often abundant on grasslands worldwide and have the
   potential to influence a predator's consumption of alternative prey. We
   collected 1321 scats in four seasons over two years in and adjacent to
   Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, to test the hypothesis that
   seasonal and spatial variation in consumption of sciurid prey and cattle
   Bos taurus carrion influenced coyote consumption of alternative prey.
   Sciurid (black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus and Richardson's
   ground squirrel Urocitellus richardsonii) remains were common from
   spring to fall and had a strong inverse relationship with deer (mule
   deer Odocoileus hemionus and white-tailed deer O. virginianus), which
   were most common in winter scats. Cattle remains were most common during
   spring, fall and winter, and occurred in 10.6\% of scats annually.
   Biomass estimates suggest that cattle was the highest ranked food on
   cattle grazing land year-round, and the 2nd ranked food, after deer,
   during winter on the portion of the park from which cattle were
   excluded. Closer proximity of scats to a prairie dog colony increased
   the likelihood of prairie dog remains throughout the year and reduced
   the likelihood of cattle remains in scats from spring to fall, but not
   during winter. Individual differences in foraging and ranging behavior
   may explain the spatial distribution of prairie dog versus cattle in
   scats. Further work is needed to determine whether sciurid prey, deer,
   or livestock carrion support large predator populations on grassland
   habitats to a level that may negatively affect coexisting prey species,
   including species at risk.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Installing conservation fences to prohibit feral animal access to
   wetlands can become a barrier for non-target species of interest. We
   collected 161 turtles (Chelodina rugosa, Emydura subglobosa worrelli,
   Myuchelys latisternum) from twenty floodplain and riverine wetlands
   during post-wet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December)
   surveys (2015-2018) in northern Australia. Wetlands were fenced (150 x
   150 mm square, 1.05 m high wire mesh) or unfenced around the wet
   perimeter. Ninety-seven percent of individuals caught in either fenced
   or unfenced wetlands had a shell carapace width greater than mesh width,
   of these 44 (46\%) were captured inside fenced wetlands, while 50 were
   caught in unfenced wetlands. The remaining 35 turtles were smaller than
   150 mm and would likely pass easily through fence mesh. Sixty-five
   turtles partook in a fencing manipulative experiment. Turtles with
   carapace widths wider than mesh often successfully escaped through
   fences by lifting one side of their shell and passing diagonally through
   the mesh. In a second experiment where a piece of vertical wire (1500 x
   300 mm) was removed, turtles located `gates' after prospecting and
   fitting through meshing areas that were too small to pass. Ninety-two
   percent of turtles were able to locate and pass through gates, while 8\%
   failed to locate a gate after 2 h. Gates applied every 4 m showed an
   83\% passage rate, every 2 m was 91\%, and every 1 m was 100\%. Combing
   field and manipulative experiments revealed that large turtles will
   prospect and move along a fence until they find suitable passage, which
   has important consequences when considering that gates could be easily
   retrofitted to existing sites, as well in new fencing programs, which
   has enormous positive conservation benefits for turtles in an already
   challenging and changing floodplain environment.},

Abstract = {Carrion of wild ungulates is an important resource for microbes,
   invertebrates and vertebrates, and affects local plant communities and
   soils. Most wild ungulates in central Europe, however, are intensely
   hunted and removed from the ecosystem, thus not available as carrion.
   This study explores the use of evisceration residues as a resource by
   necrophagous insects in a temperate mountainous forest in Germany. We
   experimentally compared the relative abundance of necrophagous insects
   between sites of caged roe deer carcasses and evisceration residues of
   roe deer using pitfall-traps. While evisceration residues were used by
   necrophagous insects, significantly more individuals were sampled at
   entire deer carcasses; when corrected for biomass, however, no
   significant difference in abundance for Coleoptera groups was found.
   Overall, evisceration residues were used earlier and for a shorter
   period than entire deer carcasses. Leaving evisceration residues on site
   where game animals are obtained might help maintain specialized
   necrophagous insect communities, although their ecological role cannot
   completely replace that of whole carcasses of wild ruminants.},

Abstract = {Sex differences in large mammals with sexual dimorphism are important
   ecological and evolutionary issues and key factors for wildlife
   management. To examine the potential use of drone (unmanned aerial

   monitoring of deer, we conducted UAV surveys at night in a sparse forest
   located on the distribution periphery of sika deer Cervus nippon and
   wild boar Sus scrofa local populations during summer and winter. Of the
   163 thermal infrared images of large mammals detected, 132 (81.0\%) and
   16 (9.8\%) were identified for deer and wild boar, respectively. In
   addition, velvet antlers of deer were visually recognized during summer,
   and 92\% of the detected deer were antlered. This biased sex ratio would
   be a characteristic in the distribution periphery of local deer
   populations. Therefore, monitoring abundance and sex ratio using thermal
   infrared sensors on UAVs can improve deer management especially in the
   distribution periphery of local populations.},

Title = {The roles of climate and alternative prey in explaining 142 years of
   declining willow ptarmigan hunting yield},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Long time series are important because they extend back to an era when
   animal populations were less influenced by habitat loss and climate
   change. Annual fluctuations in harvest yields are good proxies for large
   changes in population size and may reveal underlying ecological
   processes. From a variety of sources, we built a 142-year long time
   series representing the mean daily catch (CPUE) of willow ptarmigan
   Lagopus lagopus in southeastern Norway. CPUE decreased over the 142
   years, from approximately 35 birds shot per day in early years to around
   two in the last years. There were three periods in the time series: a
   first period with 3-5 year cycles of high peaks and low troughs
   (1872-1900), a short second period with similarly high peaks, variable
   depth of troughs and variable cyclicity (1901-1916), and a third long
   period with much lower peaks and faded cycles (1917-2013). Yearly
   variation in CPUE was best explained by an interacting effect of small
   rodent peak years and period, with a reduced positive effect of rodents
   in the last period, and a positive effect of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation index in spring and early summer. None of the weather
   variables with significant time trends explained any variation in CPUE
   and we could therefore not attribute the decline in CPUE directly to
   climate change. We postulate that a long-term dampening of the amplitude
   in small rodent cycles combined with an increase in red fox numbers,
   have increased predation on alternative prey like ptarmigan, and
   prevented the populations from reaching their earlier peaks. Even though
   the present population of willow ptarmigan is only a fraction of what it
   was in former days, we recommend light hunting to motivate for
   monitoring and to keep public attention on the bird.},

Title = {Understanding distribution and occupancy of Himalayan monal in
   Uttarkashi district, Uttarakhand for conservation and management
   planning},

Abstract = {Himalayan monal is a conservation priority species in its entire
   distribution range because of its declining population due to various
   anthropogenic threats. However, the information on its distribution and
   abundance is lacking, which is vital for conservation and management
   planning. Hence, the present study has assessed the abundance and
   occupancy of Himalayan monal in Uttarkashi district (Uttarakhand).
   Camera traps and conventional sign surveys were used for documenting the
   species during 2018-2019. We deployed a total of 69 camera traps (2819
   trap nights) and surveyed 54 trails (650 km), representing the entire
   habitat and topographic variability of the landscape. The single-season
   occupancy framework was used to understand the distribution and
   occupancy of Himalayan monal in the Uttarkashi district. The top model
   suggests that the occupancy probability of Himalayan monal was
   positively influenced (beta = 27.52 SE +/- 16.25) by landscape slope and
   was negatively influenced by Reserve Forest (RF) (beta = -8.14 SE +/-
   4.99). The observed naive occupancy of Himalayan monal was 0.69 in the
   study area, which was slightly lower than the estimated occupancy.
   However, in the null model, the site occupancy estimated was found to be
   0.82 +/- 0.08 with a detection probability of 0.23 +/- 0.03. The overall
   abundance of monal was estimated to be 171.58 +/- 10.2 individuals in
   the study area with an average density of 0.62 km(-2). The activity
   pattern analysis indicates that Himalayan monal remains very active
   between 6:00 and 12:00 h and slightly less active during mid-day hours
   when humans are most active 11:30-16:30 h in its habitat. The present
   study is a first attempt to estimate occupancy and abundance of monal in
   non-protected areas (PA) using both the camera traps and sign surveys.
   We found that Himalayan monal is abundant outside the PAs, which is a
   good indication of its long-term viability. We also identified areas for
   conservation and management prioritization in Uttarkashi.},

Title = {Does prey scarcity increase the risk of wolf attacks on domestic dogs?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gray wolf Canis lupus predation on domestic dogs Canis familiaris is a
   considerable wolf-human conflict issue in several regions of Europe and
   North America but it has not been well documented in the scientific
   literature. Livestock depredations by wolves may be related to the
   abundance of wild prey. Regardless of the presumed motivations of wolves
   for attacking dogs (likely due to interference competition and
   predation), the abundance of wild prey populations may also influence
   the risk of wolf attacks on dogs. We examined whether the annual number
   of fatal attacks by wolves on dogs was related to the abundance of
   primary prey, including wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus
   capreolus in Estonia, as well as the abundance of moose Alces alces in
   Finland. Statistical models resulted in significant negative
   relationships, thus providing evidence that the risk of attacks in both
   house yards (Estonia) and hunting situations (Finland) was highest when
   the density of wild prey was low. Wild ungulates cause damage to
   agriculture and forestry, but they seem to mitigate conflicts between
   wolves and humans; therefore, it is necessary to develop a holistic,
   multispecies management approach in which the importance of wild
   ungulates for large carnivore conservation is addressed.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in resource selection by subadult golden eagles in
   the Great Basin Desert},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos are a long-lived and wide-ranging
   species believed to be stable or in slight decline across North America.
   Golden eagles have an extended subadult stage (4-5 years) that is
   critical to maintaining recruitment into the breeding population and
   population viability. Compared to adult golden eagles, the ecology of
   subadult golden eagles (hereafter, subadults) has received little
   attention. We investigated patterns of resource selection for subadults
   in the Great Basin Desert of the western United States during summer and
   winter, 2013-2019. We monitored 46 subadults with GPS transmitters and
   related locations (n =99 037) with predictors hypothesized to influence
   seasonal patterns of space use with mixed-effects logistic regression.
   Subadults selected for ridges and upper slopes in summer and winter, but
   higher elevations in summer. Subadults showed weak selection for lower
   ridge density in summer, which was likely facilitated by selection for
   areas with greater thermal wind current potential. In contrast,
   subadults showed strong selection for higher ridge density in winter.
   Subadults selected areas further from roads in summer and closer to
   roads and electrical transmission lines in winter, which may be related
   to winter scavenging of road-killed ungulates. Resource selection
   functions suggested subadults selected for shrublands and woodlands in
   both seasons, but odds ratios revealed that during winter subadults
   avoided shrublands and increased selection of woodlands relative to
   summer. Subadults selected for areas with infrequent fires in both
   seasons; areas with frequent fires were avoided in summer but selected
   for in winter. Seasonal changes in resource selection suggested that
   subadults used woodlands more than expected, potentially reflecting
   spatial partitioning by subadults to lower-quality habitats to minimize
   competition with breeding adults during winter when energetic demands
   for thermoregulation were presumably higher and prey more limited.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are under multiple stressors and it is crucial to
   find methods to better describe, manage, and sustain aquatic ecosystems.
   Ecosystem modelling has become an important tool in integrating trophic
   relationships into food webs, assessing important nodes using network
   analysis, and making predictions via simulations. Fortunately, several
   modelling techniques exist, but the question is which approach is
   relevant and applicable when? In this study, we compare three modelling
   frameworks (Ecopath, Loop Analysis in R, STELLA software) using a case
   study of a small aquatic network (8 nodes). The choice of framework
   depends on the research question and data availability. We approach this
   topic from a methodological aspect by describing the data requirements
   and by comparing the applicability and limitations of each modelling
   approach. Each modelling framework has its specific focus, but some
   functionalities and outcomes can be compared. The predictions of Loop
   Analysis as compared to Ecopath's Mixed Trophic Impact plot are in good
   agreement at the top and bottom trophic levels, but the middle trophic
   levels are less similar. This suggests that further comparisons are
   needed of networks of varying resolution and size. Generally, when data
   are limiting, Loop Analysis can provide qualitative predictions, while
   the other two methods provide quantitative results, yet rely on more
   data.},

Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {An increasing number of studies have investigated spatial and temporal
   patterns in species richness and assemblage composition in mountain
   ecosystems along altitudinal gradients. Small mammals have been
   successfully used as indicators of environmental health and as proxies
   of biodiversity. However, information about the composition and
   distribution of species assemblages in the mosaic of habitat and rocky
   landform types at a high altitude is still lacking for most of the
   mountain regions. Through the use of live traps and camera trapping, we
   described the small mammal community living above the treeline of the
   Western Dolomites (Italian Alps), investigating the species richness,
   abundance of individuals and community composition in relation to
   topographic, micrometeorological, mesohabitat, and biological
   correlates. A total of five species and 50 individuals were sampled,
   analysed, and released. At the extremes of the analysed altitudinal
   range (i.e. 1900 vs 2900 m a.s.l.), community composition was completely
   different and species richness was related to elevation, steepness, and
   vegetation cover. At the same time, the taxonomic distinctness of
   ground-dwelling arthropods (namely carabid beetles and spiders), a proxy
   of habitat complexity, showed higher values in areas with a greater
   small mammal species richness. We found a positive effect of steepness
   and rocky landform type ``carsism{''} on the number of captured
   individuals, showing the importance of the availability of shelters and
   underground burrows for the sampled species. As a confirmation of the
   altitudinal shift for these species in relation to the ongoing climate
   change, we detected a negative impact of sub-surface ground temperature
   on small mammal abundance during the monitoring period. In conclusion,
   small mammals represent an excellent model for understanding the
   evolutionary processes of ecosystems, population dynamics under changing
   environmental conditions, and habitat vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Mammals' resting sites (dens) are important features of their ecology.
   Eurasian otter Lutra lutra resting sites are strictly protected by UK
   and European legislation and are ostensibly identified from associated
   field-signs. This legislation is difficult to apply given the poor
   understanding of resting sites coupled with the lack of evidence
   supporting a field-sign signature. We aimed to use camera-trap data to
   identify resting sites, investigate whether field-signs differed between
   resting and non-resting sites and describe behaviours recorded on
   camera-traps that are associated with resting. An evidence-based
   approach to identifying resting sites of Eurasian otter Lutra lutra from
   camera-trap and field-sign data camera-trap data showed that otters
   frequently visited potential resting sites, characterised by a very
   short time within the structure (often < 4 min). Resting sites were
   characterised by longer durations (often hours) during the daytime and
   night-time. Based on these data, six of our 26 sites were identified as
   resting sites. Modelling suggested that no single field-sign had a clear
   association with resting sites. However, we found a hitherto
   unrecognised distinction between otter latrines (defecation sites) and
   spraint (scent-marking) sites, and that camera-trap observations of
   latrine behaviour and bedding collection were exclusive to resting
   sites. As bedding and latrines are not always visible, presence of
   either indicates a resting site but no interpretation can be drawn from
   their absence, so camera-trapping would be recommended to identify
   resting site status. Data simulations found that camera-trapping for 38
   d in winter, followed by 38 d in spring, was the optimal approach for a
   95\% chance of detecting a rest across all resting sites. Ours is the
   first study to identify standards and expectations for surveys using
   camera-trap and field-signs at Eurasian otter resting sites. Our novel
   account of their resting activity facilitates better interpretation of
   legislation.},

Title = {Comparing the effectiveness of camera trapping, driven transects and ad
   hoc records for surveying nocturnal mammals against a known species
   assemblage},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Management and conservation rely on surveys to determine which species
   are present but some species, such as nocturnal mammals, can be very
   difficult to detect. Camera trapping, driven transects, and ad hoc
   records are well-established nocturnal survey methods, but their
   detection effectiveness has not been tested against known species
   presence. We tested the effectiveness of these methods with a known
   assemblage of nocturnal African mammals. We compared camera traps placed
   at targeted and random locations, driven transects, and informal ad hoc
   records against one another and the 20 predominately nocturnal medium-
   and large-sized mammals known to be on site. Species-specific detection
   patterns, detection curves for each method, and detection effort
   required per species, were compared to determine the effectiveness of
   each method. Each of the methods detected at least 60\% of known
   nocturnal mammal species over a 20-month period: driven transects and ad
   hoc records were the most successful (16/20 80\%), followed by targeted
   camera traps (15/20 75\%) and random camera traps (12/20 60\%).
   Jaccard's Coefficients of Community Similarity peaked at 0.78, showing
   notable differences in the communities sampled with different methods.
   There was considerable variation in effort required to detect each
   species for each method, and the number of species detected with
   specific levels of effort was also highly variable between methods. We
   suggest that mixing methods, using different camera placement including
   use of random locations, and incorporating cost-neutral ad hoc records
   into formal survey efforts can all greatly increase the overall
   effectiveness and efficiency of species detection.},

Abstract = {Agricultural management has a great influence on biodiversity and its
   services in agroecosystems. In Europe, a relevant proportion of
   biodiversity is dependent on low-input agriculture. To assess the
   effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, in this study we
   surveyed the communities of arable plants, diurnal flying insects, and
   pollinators in three conventional and in two organic fields of a
   traditional Elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) crop of the
   Valdichiana area, in Tuscany (central Italy). The sampling was carried
   out twice during the season: in spring, during crop growing, and in
   summer, after crop harvesting. We assessed the effects of the different
   agricultural management on the richness and composition (species
   occurrence and abundance) of the three communities using univariate and
   multivariate analyses. Concerning our specific case study, only plant
   species richness was significantly higher in organic fields (15.7 +/-
   2.7 species per plot), compared to conventional ones (5.4 +/- 2.3
   species per plot). Regarding community composition, only pollinators
   showed a marginally significant difference between conventional and
   organic fields. Conversely, the effect of specific fields significantly
   explained differences in composition of all the investigated groups
   (plants, total insects, and pollinators). The results suggest that, in
   our case study, the emerged differences in diversity of the investigated
   communities were mainly attributable to environmental and management
   factors related to single fields, more than to organic or conventional
   farming. Such evidence could be partly due to the very local scale of
   the study, to the heterogeneity of the surveyed fields, and to the
   reduced number of surveyed fields. Further investigation is therefore
   needed.},

Abstract = {The comprehension of the ecological structure and the functioning of
   natural and/or impacted lotic ecosystems is the purpose of most studies
   concerning rivers and streams. This study aimed to investigate the main
   factors influencing the zooplankton community organization in nine
   impacted tropical streams of three different sub-basins of the Cinzas
   River basin, Parana state, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that
   macro-factors such as productivity, current velocity, habitat structure,
   and stream order and stretches (headwater, middle and mouth), are the
   main factors structuring the zooplankton community in tropical streams.
   Zooplankton was represented by 101 taxa, mainly testate amoebae,
   followed by rotifers, cladocerans and copepods. Results showed that the
   greatest differences in physical and chemical characteristics and those
   related to zooplankton community structure were observed among the three
   sub-basins studied. However, we found that these differences were not
   related to the environmental heterogeneity, but were rather influenced
   mainly by spatial factors related to stochasticity in the structuring of
   planktonic communities. Thus, our results suggest that connectivity
   between environments within the same sub-basin, associated with random
   processes driven by dispersal, may determine the existence or not of
   spatial patterns, among stream order or stretches, and temporal
   patterns, between seasons, in the community attributes here analyzed.},

Abstract = {The present study described the spatial patterns of the medusae
   assemblages in the southern Gulf of Mexico during the dry season of 2016
   (May-June). The assemblages, defined based on Bray-Curtis similarity
   index, were described in terms of species composition, abundances,
   diversity, dominance, and the hydro-biological characterization of each
   of them. A total of 42 species were identified (40 Hydrozoa and 2
   Scyphozoa), of which, 21.43\% correspond to holoplanktonic specimens and
   78.57\% were meroplanktonic. The hydromedusae species Aglaura hemistoma
   (Trachymedusae) and Liriope tetraphylla (Limnomedusae) were the most
   frequent and abundant, accounting for 63.51\% of the total abundances.
   Three groups of sampling stations with faunal affinity were identified,
   which showed different hydrological intervals and abundances of
   zooplankton groups (food availability), suggesting the existence of
   three communities composed of medusae species with affinity to the
   environmental parameters of each assemblage. With this regional
   characterization, A. hemistoma was the dominant species in the Yucatan
   shelf, L. tetraphylla in southern Campeche Bank, while L. tetraphylla
   and Nausithoe punctata (Coronatae) were dominant in the Veracruz shelf
   and the oceanic zone of the study area. The dominance of L. tetraphylla
   and A. hemistoma can be understood as the result of different adaptive
   aspects, such as the plasticity of the holoplanktonic condition of these
   species, the different feeding strategies, and trophic spectrum, which
   allows them to adapt to environmental variability in each one of these
   regions (e.g., high temperatures, salinities) and feed of a particular
   food source without competing among them.},

Title = {Migration chronology and movements of adult American black ducks Anas
   rubripes wintering in Nova Scotia, Canada},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {American black ducks, native to eastern North America, have been the
   focus of significant international conservation and management programs.
   The combined USA and Canadian population has traditionally been managed
   as a single population; however black duck demographics may vary by
   region. To help understand potential regional differences in black
   ducks, we used satellite telemetry to assess migratory chronology and
   movements of black ducks wintering near Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada,
   near the northern limits of their wintering range where numbers are
   increasing. Wintering black ducks from Nova Scotia did not leave the
   Atlantic Flyway and included both longer-distance migrants (similar to
   1500 km north) and locally-breeding individuals. None of our tracked
   ducks travelled south of Nova Scotia during any part of the annual
   cycle, indicating a population segment that never leaves Canada and is
   subject solely to Canadian harvest pressures. Band recovery data
   revealed that a small portion (2.4\%) of black ducks originally banded
   during winter in Nova Scotia were recovered south along the east coast
   of the USA, indicating that some of these black ducks are subject to
   international harvest pressures. Our results show that there are
   differences in annual black duck movements even within a small part of
   their range, adding to the growing evidence that black duck populations
   show fine-scale temporal and spatial structure. This structure will need
   to be considered in future interprovincial and international harvest
   management plans of this important species.},

Title = {Efficacy of spotlights and thermal cameras to detect lions Panthera leo
   and spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta depends on species and management

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {Accurate abundance estimates can contribute to effective management of
   large carnivore populations. Lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta
   crocuta populations are frequently estimated at night by eliciting their
   approach using broadcasted vocalizations. Spotlights are typically used
   to observe these species on approach but can disturb animals and
   adversely affect counts. We compared the efficacy of spotlight with red
   filters and forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal monocular to
   enumerate lions and spotted hyenas in Serengeti National Park (SNP;
   non-hunted area) and Maswa Game Reserve (MGR; hunted area), Tanzania,
   during 2015-2017. We established 119 call-in sites in SNP and 20 in MGR
   and conducted repeated call-ins at 1-2 week intervals. During call-ins
   we conducted systematic paired counts using both devices. We assessed
   the influence of device order, species, hunting regime and land cover on
   species counts. We found that FLIR was more efficacious for counting
   hyenas in MGR and spotlight for counting lions in SNP. We found evidence
   for temporary artificial light disturbance in MGR, as counts were higher
   when FLIR was used as the second device. Habitat type within 200 m of
   call-in sites did not influence device performances. Greater spotlight
   efficacy in SNP is a likely consequence of lower perceived risk and less
   anthropogenic disturbance compared to MGR. To improve accuracy of counts
   and subsequent population estimates for lions and spotted hyenas, we
   recommend consideration of variation in device efficacy, based on
   species surveyed and management regime.},

Title = {Knowledge, attitude and practice of the local people towards

   southern Ethiopia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Local people knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) have played an
   important role in human-wildlife coexistence and have received increased
   attention in biodiversity conservation. However, studies on the KAP of
   local people towards human-carnivore coexistence (HCC) are scarce,
   species-specific or limited to the protected areas. Therefore, we
   investigated the local people KAP towards carnivore coexistence with
   humans, the problem of livestock and mitigation practices in a
   human-dominated landscape of southern Ethiopia. We collected the data
   from 352 households interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and
   photographic sampling. The respondents mentioned 13 carnivores
   coexisting with local people belonging to six families. Eighty-five
   percent of the respondents perceived carnivores as problematic species
   and expressed a negative attitude towards them, primarily due to the
   damage they caused to their livestock. Respondents who had better
   knowledge of carnivores also showed a positive attitude towards
   carnivores. The cluster analysis showed that the spotted hyena, serval,
   leopard, common genet and black-backed jackal were grouped under a
   high-threat cluster. Chickens and goats were the most threatened
   livestock reported by respondents. The main predation control methods
   reported were guarding and fencing for larger livestock and keeping
   chickens indoors during the night. The regression models predicted that
   males and literate respondents had better knowledge of carnivores than
   females and illiterates. The respondents who owned more livestock
   experienced more damage to livestock, and females showed a negative
   attitude towards carnivores. Although the study area is the critical
   conservation value of the 13 carnivore species, livestock predation by
   carnivores, the local people's negative attitude towards carnivores and
   lethal predation control methods practiced by local people were
   affecting HCC in the area. The findings call for conservation actions
   such as conservation education to raise awareness and develop a positive
   attitude and non-lethal predation mitigation measures to promote HCC in
   consultation with the local community.},

Title = {A hierarchical dependent double-observer method for estimating waterfowl
   breeding pairs abundance from helicopters},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We applied a dependent double-observer method for helicopter surveys and
   developed a hierarchical Bayesian model as a means to adjust counts of
   waterfowl for incomplete detection. We conducted our study using 52
   plots in Labrador, Canada. A designated pair of primary observers
   reported counts and location of all waterfowl flocks that they detected
   to a pair of secondary observers, including details regarding the
   species, age and sex of observed birds. Secondary observers then
   reported any additional flocks observed by them but missed by the
   primary observers. The pairs of observers alternated between primary and
   secondary roles during the course of the survey, as well as position
   (front or back) within the helicopter. We used hierarchical Bayesian
   models to estimate detection probabilities of waterfowl flocks, as well
   as derive species-specific detection-corrected abundance and sex
   composition estimates of flocks. The hierarchical model output allowed
   us to derive estimates of indicated breeding pairs for each species in
   the survey area corrected for incomplete detection. Observers seated in
   the back of the helicopter had higher detection probabilities (0.89;
   90\% Bayesian credible intervals {[}BCI] = 0.82-0.95) than those in the
   front (0.74; 90\% BCI = 0.66-0.83), and observer experience had a
   limited effect on detection. Total crew detection probabilities ranged
   between 0.99 (90\% BCI = 0.97-1.00) and 0.97(90\% BCI = 0.94-0.99),
   depending on the individual observers' position and role in the
   helicopter. Detection probabilities were higher for sea ducks and diving
   ducks and lower for dabbling ducks. Observers generally missed less than
   5\% of the total indicated pairs for all species. We recommend that
   detection in helicopter surveys be measured to control for observer
   turnover, observer experience and aircraft-related differences in
   visibility.},

Title = {Occupancy modeling of habitat use by white-tailed deer after more than a
   decade of exclusion in the boreal forest},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce
   the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of
   desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), selective
   browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir -
   white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce
   forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca 10-12 years in
   clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist
   in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and
   food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use
   exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial
   configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic
   cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging
   from 3.1 to 11.2 km(2) (n = 25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer
   were reduced for 10-12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models
   that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while
   simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection
   probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased
   by 19\% when forage resources, represented by the cover of Cornus
   canadensis, increased from 0 to 100\%. None of the other variables
   (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance
   between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the
   use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of
   exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest
   management that improves food production during summer should help
   maintain or increase habitat use by deer.},

Title = {Past, present and future of chamois science},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The chamois Rupicapra spp. is the most abundant mountain ungulate of
   Europe and the Near East, where it occurs as two species, the northern
   chamois R. rupicapra and the southern chamois R. pyrenaica. Here, we
   provide a state-of-the-art overview of research trends and the most
   challenging issues in chamois research and conservation, focusing on
   taxonomy and systematics, genetics, life history, ecology and behavior,
   physiology and disease, management and conservation. Research on
   Rupicapra has a longstanding history and has contributed substantially
   to the biological and ecological knowledge of mountain ungulates.
   Although the number of publications on this genus has markedly increased
   over the past two decades, major differences persist with respect to
   knowledge of species and subspecies, with research mostly focusing on
   the Alpine chamois R. r. rupicapra and, to a lesser extent, the Pyrenean
   chamois R. p. pyrenaica. In addition, a scarcity of replicate studies of
   populations of different subspecies and/or geographic areas limits the
   advancement of chamois science. Since environmental heterogeneity
   impacts behavioral, physiological and life history traits, understanding
   the underlying processes would be of great value from both an
   evolutionary and conservation/management standpoint, especially in the
   light of ongoing climatic change. Substantial contributions to this
   challenge may derive from a quantitative assessment of reproductive
   success, investigation of fine-scale foraging patterns, and a
   mechanistic understanding of disease outbreak and resilience. For
   improving conservation status, resolving taxonomic disputes, identifying
   subspecies hybridization, assessing the impact of hunting and
   establishing reliable methods of abundance estimation are of primary
   concern. Despite being one of the most well-known mountain ungulates,
   substantial field efforts to collect paleontological, behavioral,
   ecological, morphological, physiological and genetic data on different
   populations and subspecies are still needed to ensure a successful
   future for chamois research and conservation.},

Title = {Revisiting discrepancies between stochastic agent-based and

Abstract = {Predicting which species will present (or absent) across geographical
   regions, and where, remains one of the important issues in ecology. From
   a methodical viewpoint, one of the concerns in examining species
   presence-absence across an environmental gradient is about the
   robustness of model-based predictions, which are given by distinct
   modelling frameworks used. Generally, different complexities and
   ecological factors are incorporated into such models, e.g. abiotic
   environments, spatial dispersal process, and stochasticity. Motivated by
   these ecological issues, we revisit a single-species logistic growth
   problem by employing stochastic agent-based model (ABM) and
   deterministic system and extend these frameworks to incorporate the
   effects of spatially changing environments. We observe that our ABM,
   which is formulated using random walk theory and birth-death process,
   demonstrates important qualitative behaviours that are consistent with
   the underlying theories of stochastic process. The results of ABM with
   large population sizes also agree with those of the deterministic
   equation. However, some discrepancies are observed when the population
   size is small. The ABM densities seem to underestimate the deterministic
   solutions, which illustrate the effects of stochasticity on small
   populations with some individuals may go extinct simply by chance. To
   quantify the underestimation of ABM as opposed to deterministic
   predictions, we employ certain probabilistic techniques: while the means
   of quasistationary probabilities distribution appear to give a
   counterintuitive prediction particularly near the edge of species
   ranges, the expected values given by state probabilities distribution
   are in agreement with the ABM densities observed for small population
   sizes across spatial locations. These salient observations depict
   emergent behaviours of stochastic ABM, which can contribute to
   additional insights on the dynamics of ecological species. It also shows
   how such small-scale interactions coupled with local dispersal and
   spatial phenomena occurring at a microscopic level can affect
   macroscopic-level dynamics. As such, comparing and contrasting the
   dynamics of different models can help in understanding the generality of
   ecological results and may offer important insights into the robustness
   of model-based predictions of species presence-absence.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh shelters a very rich and diverse avifauna. Anthropogenic
   activities have a global impact on avifauna, particularly in Bangladesh,
   where human disturbances and unplanned urbanization can lead to the
   decline of this particular taxon. A direct observation-based study was
   conducted to investigate the avian community structure in Daudkandi
   Upazila, Bangladesh. We used the line transect method at 65 sampling
   grids to assess the avifauna from May 2019 to March 2020. We evaluated
   the bird assemblage structures by alpha diversity and beta diversity.
   Ninety-six species of bird belonging to thirteen orders were recorded.
   We found the rural study site to be more diverse (H ` = 3.835) and
   evenly distributed (J ` = 0.88) than urban and semi-urban sites. ANOSIM
   test also showed that the rural avian community differed significantly
   from other two communities (R = 0.1603; P = 0.0001). We calculated
   dispersion patterns of birds and found clumped pattern to be more common
   (83 species) in the study area. This study discovered some anthropogenic
   activities, in addition to human intrusions, that may have reduced avian
   diversity in urban and semi-urban habitats. Our findings indicated the
   need for immediate conservation efforts to protect a large number of
   breeding residents and winter migratory birds in the study area.},

Title = {Interactions between Metisa plana, its hyperparasitoids and primary
   parasitoids from good agriculture practices (GAP) and non-gap oil palm
   plantations},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {23},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The bagworm species, Metisa plana (Lepidoptera: Psychidae), is a major
   oil palm pest. The existence of M. plana parasitoids is reliant on the
   presence of the host (M. plana) and food supplies. However, no detailed
   information on their food web has been studied as a model system for
   community ecology, specifically in the oil palm ecosystem. Therefore, in
   this study, we have listed two main objectives: (1) to determine the
   diversity of M. plana parasitoids from Good Agriculture Practices (GAP)
   and non-GAP plantations and (2) to investigate the relationships between
   hyperparasitism and primary parasitism. The parasitoid samplings were
   conducted at six oil palm plantations throughout Peninsular Malaysia. A
   total of 1199 hymenopteran parasitoid specimens belonging to 16 species
   under 8 families were successfully collected by using malaise traps for
   12 months. Based on the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), the
   diversity of the parasitoids was significantly higher (t = 3.840, p <
   0.05) in the GAP plantations compared to the non-GAP plantations. The
   ratio for hyperparasitoids to primary parasitoids is as follows:
   32.19\%: 67.81\%. Interestingly, the analysis indicated a strong
   negative correlation between the hyperparasitoids and the primary
   parasitoids (R = - 0.807, R-2 = 0.6509, p < 0.05) collected from the GAP

Title = {Taxonomic distinctiveness and phylogenetic variability of amphibians and
   reptiles in the cloud forest of Mexico},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The cloud forest shows a great diversity of groups and has been
   considered as centers of high richness and endemism, throughout Asia,
   Africa and mainly in the Americas. To determine the specific and
   phylogenetic richness as well as the association in the composition of
   species of amphibians and reptiles in this environment in Mexico, using
   databases we analyzed species richness, taxonomic distinctiveness and
   phylogenetic species variability and richness of amphibians and reptiles
   in 13 regions containing cloud forest in Mexico, and the similarity
   among the regions. The results show high species richness of both groups
   (231 amphibians and 310 reptiles) respect another environment in Mexico,
   mainly in the southern of Mexico in Northern Mountains of Oaxaca,
   Coastal Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre of Chiapas. Regarding
   taxonomic distinctiveness in amphibians, the Basins of Ocosingo, High
   Huasteca of Hidalgo and Central Veracruz regions presented
   representatives values from regional diversity, while in reptiles these
   values were from regions Basins of Ocosingo, Central Veracruz and
   Northern Mountains of Oaxaca. The regions Northern Mountains of Oaxaca,
   Coastal Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre of Chiapas showed the
   highest values of phylogenetic species richness. In amphibians, the
   regions Upper Balsas Basin and Eastern Sierra Madre showed the highest
   values of phylogenetic species variability, and in reptiles was for
   regions Northern Mountains and Central Highlands of Chiapas, Eastern
   Sierra Madre, High Huasteca of Hidalgo and Central Veracruz. In both
   groups, the similarity analysis showed a high relationship between the
   southeastern regions of Mexico than the rest of regions. The analyzed
   cloud forest regions present different values of species richness and
   taxonomic distinctiveness, highlighting the regions of southern of
   Mexico. These results help us to propose areas for conservation of both
   groups, and so, to conserve the species richness, taxonomy and
   phylogenetic diversity in this environment, providing key elements for
   conservation planners.},

Title = {Community structure of fish larvae in different biotopes of a
   neotropical river},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is one of the major sources of compositional
   dissimilarity among fish in different biotopes. The availability and
   distribution of refuge, food, and habitats for breeding are determinants
   of the presence of fish species with different life histories, and
   understanding how this composition is organized along an environmental
   gradient is important for the protection of fish spawning sites and
   preservation of conditions that favor the dispersion and growth of their
   larvae. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate how the ichthyoplankton
   community is structured in different biotopes (river, lake, and
   transitional) of a fluvial system and to determine the factors involved
   in the structuring process. We conducted sampling in the lower Ivinhema
   River, upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, during two consecutive
   reproductive periods between 2010 and 2012. Larvae of long-distance
   migratory species were more related to the river biotope, while the
   non-migratory or short-distance migrators were more associated with
   transitional and lake biotopes. Therefore, our results indicate that the
   hydrodynamic conditions of the river, especially the flow velocity, as
   well as the parental reproductive guild, influence the distribution
   patterns of the ichthyoplankton community.},

Title = {Is time partitioning the currency of coexistence for a grassland canid
   community?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Habitat and diet preferences are often considered major aspects of
   niches differentiation among species; however, partitioning of habitat
   and resource use temporally is often overlooked in modeling coexistence.
   The plasticity of temporal activity patterns of individuals may
   influence the species' response to selective forces and long-term
   persistence. Temporal avoidance may be a mechanism by which subordinate
   species can reduce the likelihood of direct competition with dominant
   sympatric species. Here, we examine temporal activity patterns of three
   canid species (swift fox Vulpes velox, red fox Vulpes vulpes and coyote
   Canis latrans) to determine how temporal activity patterns and activity
   overlap varies among species. We found that all species presented
   seasonal differences in activity patterns. When activity patterns were
   compared among species, the estimates of activity overlap in the spring
   season (i.e. breeding and pup-rearing periods) were higher than the
   activity patterns in the fall (i.e. juvenile dispersal and
   pair-formation periods); however, activity pattern overlap among species
   was significant only during the fall. Overall, these patterns revealed a
   close temporal overlap between swift fox (subordinate species) and both
   red fox and coyote (dominant species), which provides insight into
   conditions under which time partitioning may not be as clear as
   predicted, and other mechanisms may facilitate species coexistence.
   Considering swift fox population decline and distribution contraction
   across the North American grasslands, investigating temporal activity
   patterns of the canid species may reveal the implications of altering
   such patterns for individual animals, populations and ecosystems.},

Title = {The effect of a ban on the use of lead ammunition for waterfowl hunting
   on duck and goose crippling rates in Illinois},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Globally, there is increasing effort to transition away from the use of
   lead ammunition to mitigate its known risks to wildlife and human
   health. Whenever this transition is stated hunters frequently cite
   concerns about the effectiveness of non-lead ammunition, how it will
   result in greater crippling rates, and associated animal welfare costs.
   This area has been little studied, but recent studies have found no
   differences in crippling rates using lead and steel ammunition. Using
   segmented linear regression we evaluated 37 years of waterfowl harvest
   data in Illinois, United States, overlapping the transition to non-lead
   shot for waterfowl hunting in order to assess how crippling rates
   changed following the ban. The average crippling rate prior to the lead
   shot ban was 23\% for both ducks and geese and reduced to an average of
   15\% and 11\% for ducks and geese (respectively) following the ban. In
   addition, the annual trend in the proportion of ducks and geese crippled
   reversed following the ban, from a significant annually increasing to a
   significant annually decreasing trend. We offer hypotheses on
   behavioural and technological changes which may explain these changes
   and predict that crippling losses will not increase in Europe following
   a ban on the use of lead ammunition over wetlands in 2023.},

Title = {Analysis of mammal mesopredator scat samples indicates significant
   predation on the endangered Hungarian meadow viper (Vipera ursinii
   rakosiensis)},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Animal populations are regulated by multiple factors, e.g. resource
   availability, diseases and predators. However, these factors can be
   significantly influenced by anthropogenic effects (e.g. biological
   invasions, mesopredator release) and either subserve populations or push
   them towards local extinction. The Hungarian meadow viper Vipera ursinii
   rakosiensis is an endangered reptile, with only a few surviving
   populations following recent alterations and fragmentation of their
   habitats. In Hungary, all documented populations are located within
   nature conservation areas. Significant practical conservation efforts
   have been made, including habitat reconstruction and development, as
   well as ex situ breeding and reintroductions. Nevertheless, the
   estimated overall population size of Hungarian meadow viper remains very
   low, and the impact of conservation interventions is practically
   immeasurable according to low densities. It is hypothesized that
   predation is the main factor interfering with conservation efforts of
   the vipers. Here, we analysed the diet of two mammalian predators
   (European badger and red fox) in a Hungarian meadow viper habitat. We
   found a high prevalence of viper remains in the processed faecal
   samples, indicating that a high number of individuals vipers are subject
   to predation even within a short period of time. We conclude that
   effective predator control might be necessary to increase the impact of
   standard conservation measures (e.g. habitat development, ex situ
   breeding and reintroduction) that target the restoration of Hungarian
   meadow viper populations.},

Title = {Recent estimate of Asian elephants in Borneo reveals a smaller
   population},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Asian elephants occurring in northern Borneo form a geographically
   isolated and genetically distinct population. Of this, the subpopulation
   of Central Sabah holds the greatest opportunity for long-term survival,
   due to a relatively large population size and occurrence over a vast,
   contiguous and protected habitat. We surveyed this subpopulation in 2015
   using advanced methods to obtain a population size estimate. We used the
   distance-sampling framework and laid out transects following a
   stratified random design for counting elephant dung piles; measured dung
   decay following the `retrospective' method; and used Bayesian analysis
   to estimate dung decay rate and dung pile density. Thus, we estimated a
   posterior mean dung decay rate of 212 days (95\% BCI: 133-319), an
   overall elephant density of 0.07 per km(2) (95\% BCI: 0.03-0.11) and a
   population size of 387 elephants (95\% BCI: 169-621). These estimates
   were far lower than the population size of 1132 individuals and density
   of 1.18 per km(2) estimated in 2008. It is unlikely that there has been
   a steep population decline, as there were no drastic land-use changes
   between 2008 and 2015, nor were there other identifiable causes for a
   population decline. Therefore, it appears that the methodological and
   analytical flaws in the previous estimate are the most plausible reason
   for this observed difference. Given that the new estimate suggests a
   much smaller population, it is prudent and precautionary to use the new
   estimate as the basis for all policy decisions and conservation actions
   for elephants in Sabah.},

Title = {Season rather than habitat affects lynx survival and risk of mortality
   in the human-dominated landscape of southern Sweden},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {Landscapes are mosaics of habitat associated with different risks and
   resources, including human activities, which can affect individual
   survival in wildlife. Different relationships between habitat
   characteristics and human-caused and natural mortality can result in
   attractive sinks. We used individual-based data from 97 Eurasian lynx
   Lynx lynx monitored for 160 exposure-years to link adult survival and
   the risk of mortality to home range habitat characteristics in the
   human-dominated landscape of southern Sweden. Human-caused mortality
   (i.e. legal hunting, poaching and vehicle accidents) dominated mortality
   causes (24 out of 37 deaths). We did not detect any strong effects of
   habitat characterises explaining the variation in mortality risk in
   lynx. Although the density of roe deer affects several aspects of lynx
   ecology, we could not detect any effects of roe deer density on lynx
   survival, probably because roe deer density was sufficiently high in our
   study area. Instead, seasonal variation was the main factor influencing
   mortality in lynx. Mortality was highest during the hunting season for
   lynx (16 February-31 March), as well as during autumn and winter,
   probably because lynx poaching occurs opportunistically during the
   hunting season for moose and roe deer. We did not find any indication
   that human activity created attractive sinks for lynx, since there were
   no contrasting patterns between human-caused and natural mortality in
   terms of habitat characteristics. One explanation for the limited
   influence of the home range characteristics may be that lynx in our
   study died from multiple causes. Therefore, it is less likely that one
   or a few habitat characteristics could explain the risk of mortality at
   the home range scale. There is strong evidence that lynx can coexist
   with humans in multi-use and human-dominated landscapes, even without
   large protected areas, if the management regimes are favourable.},

Abstract = {Habitat quality and parasite assembly influence wildlife health, and
   they are key indicators of health and survivability of wildlife
   populations. To investigate the potential ecological relationships among
   habitat type, food nutrients, parasites and hormones in wild boar Sus
   scrofa, we collected samples of wild boar feces and available plants in
   their habitat by line transects during winter. Along transects, we
   identified the composition of plants foraged by wild boar and measured
   the content of nutrients in available plants to estimate nutrient
   intake. We also quantified parasites and hormones in wild boar fecal
   samples. We compared food nutrients among different forest types and
   explored possible relationships among estimated nutrient intake,
   parasites and hormones. We found coniferous forest had positive effects
   on estimated fat intake and negative effects on estimated protein and
   fiber intake by wild boar. Furthermore, we revealed that estimated fat
   intake was negatively correlated with Metastrongylus elongatus parasites
   and positively correlated with triiodothyronine (T3). In contrast,
   estimated protein intake was positively correlated with M. elongatus and
   negatively correlated with T3. Finally, we found negative relationships
   between T3 concentrations and loads of Ascaris suum parasites and
   between cortisol (COR) and loads of Trichuris suis parasites. These
   insights on ecological relationships help identify potential dietary
   parameters in winter that could help predict and manage parasite and
   hormone responses for wild boar population recovery.},

Title = {Long-term trends of reproductive success of black grouse Lyrurus tetrix
   in the southern Swiss Alps in relation to changes in climate and habitat},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Breeding success of an Alpine black grouse Lyrurus tetrix population in
   southern Switzerland was monitored from 1981 to 2020. This long-term
   dataset allows exploring relationships of reproductive rates with
   climate and habitat, which have shown marked changes during this period.
   Over the 40 years, the average elevation of black grouse breeding sites
   increased by around 100 m in central/southern Ticino but showed only a
   slight increase in northern Ticino, where black grouse occur at higher
   elevations. Average reproductive rates in northern Ticino remained
   constant throughout the study period but declined in central/southern
   Ticino. Relationships between reproductive success and weather as well
   as habitat variables were analysed with a multiple regression model.
   Temperature during the early chick-rearing phase and the time of
   egg-laying was positively correlated with reproductive rate.
   Correlations between reproductive rates and precipitation were less
   clear, and only small proportions of the variance in reproductive rates
   could be explained by precipitation. Brush forest explained the greatest
   amount of variation in reproductive rate (6.2\%). Forest, alpine
   agricultural areas and unproductive vegetation all showed a positive
   relationship with reproductive rate, but the proportion of the variance
   explained was small. Year (5.1\%) and its interaction with region
   (2.3\%) explained considerable amounts of the variance. While in
   northern Ticino reproductive success did not show a negative trend when
   correcting for weather and habitat changes, there remained a negative
   trend over the years in central/southern Ticino. Despite the positive
   correlations of reproductive rate with temperature, increasing
   temperatures do not appear to have improved reproductive success, likely
   as a result of habitat changes that forced black grouse towards higher
   elevations. Changes in reproductive success were limited to the southern
   region, indicating deteriorating conditions at the edge of the
   distribution range.},

Title = {Allegheny woodrat occupancy across western Virginia, United States},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Allegheny woodrat Neotoma magister, a rock outcrop habitat
   specialist, has suffered drastic reductions in geographic range over the
   past 40 years. Previous research has examined habitat characteristics at
   varying spatial scales, but none have used occupancy modeling to examine
   trends over time. Therefore, we used presence/absence data from live
   trapping to assess environmental variables likely to influence Allegheny
   woodrat occupancy and detection patterns at a regional scale across
   western Virginia, USA, from 2009 to 2011. We observed a shift in
   occupancy and detection rates across years with a peak in 2009, a
   decline in 2010 and apparent recovery in 2011. We found significant
   isolation by distance effect influencing woodrat occupancy across the
   region, with occupancy linked to sites in closer proximity to other
   occupied locations. Occupancy increased in oak and hickory forests,
   suggesting woodrat occurrence increases in forest types with a higher
   abundance of hard and soft mast-producing species. We found variable
   effects of elevation over time, with higher occupancy at higher
   elevations in 2009 but at lower elevations in 2010, which may be
   explained by variation in winter severity and mast abundance across
   years. Allegheny woodrat management should include activities to promote
   and retain mast-producing species at higher elevations to offset
   potential subpopulation contractions during harsh winters.},

   length},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wildlife management attempts to balance consumptive and non-consumptive
   values to manage hunting opportunities, considering population
   resilience. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus are particularly
   sensitive to harvest. Using data from 33 792 mountain goats harvested in
   British Columbia (BC), Canada, between 1977 and 2019, we performed
   Bayesian regressions to examine the effect of regulations (limited entry
   hunting (LEH) or general open season (GOS)) on yearly harvest and
   harvest sex ratios. We also investigated temporal trends and the effect
   of licensed hunter residency (resident in British Columbia, or not) on
   harvest sex ratios. We then examined how horn length of harvested
   mountain goats was influenced by sex, year of harvest, age and mountain
   range. The more restrictive LEH regulations generally reduced harvest of
   mountain goats. The annual proportion of males harvested appeared
   independent of regulation and increased over time. Non-resident hunters
   harvested a greater proportion of males compared to resident hunters.
   The combined length of the first and second horn growth increments
   decreased slightly with age at harvest for males but increased for
   females, suggesting a possible very weak hunter selection for males with
   rapid early horn growth and possibly against lactating females. Our
   study supports LEH regulations and hunter education to distinguish sex
   and age as key tools for mountain goat harvest management. Similar tools
   could be considered to manage other ungulates that are sensitive to
   harvest.},

Abstract = {How is cycling culture defined? Because the word ``culture{''} brings
   with it deep complexities, there is a need to understand varying
   contexts in looking for suitable strategies toward the advancement of
   cycling culture. The stage for cycling culture is the landscape where
   cycling infrastructure can be properly provided. With development, an
   influential element would be economic capacity. The paper explores the
   influence of the economic development divide by comparing cyclist
   perception between developed and developing countries, namely Taiwan and
   the Philippines. An online survey between 122 Taiwanese and 111 Filipino
   cyclists was conducted to find out the landscape needs of people to
   consider cycling transport based on affordances in the landscape. The
   variables selected were based on landscape elements for cycling as a
   commuting activity. The data were processed through factor analysis to
   reveal latent landscape needs to profile cycling needs. Two factors were
   identified as `environmental' and `civil facilities.' The factor
   loadings were then compared based on the nationalities which revealed
   that the bike riding motivation were different with relating to the
   context of their respective environment and similar with the basic

Abstract = {Loss of biodiversity comprehends not only the extinction of individual
   species, but also the loss of the ecological interactions among them.
   Survival of species, continuation of ecosystem functioning in nature,
   and ecosystem services to humans depend on the maintenance of
   well-functioning networks of species interactions (e.g. plant-pollinator
   networks and food webs). Analyses of ecological networks often rely on
   biased and incomplete survey data, especially in species-rich areas,
   such as the tropics. We used a network inference method to reconstruct
   pollination data compiled from a large tropical rainforest habitat
   extent. To gain insight into the characteristics of plant-pollinator
   interactions across the region, we combined the reconstructed
   pollination network with species distribution modelling to obtain local
   pollination networks throughout the area. We explored how global network
   properties relate to natural forest cover and land cover heterogeneity.
   We found that some network properties (the sum and evenness of link
   weights, connectance and nestedness) are positively correlated with
   forest cover, indicating that networks in sites with more natural
   habitat have greater diversity of interactions. Modularity was not
   related to forest cover, but seemed to reflect habitat heterogeneity,
   due to the broad spatial scale of the study. We believe that the

   data in a reliable way and allow us to better understand and protect
   networks of species interactions in high biodiversity regions of the

Abstract = {Tea tree is an economically important crop. The rapid and efficient
   mapping of the distribution and dynamic changes in tea plantations
   informs decision making for government departments. It also plays an
   important role in rational tea planting and environmental governance.
   This study used the 10 m Sentinel-2 image data to map the spatial
   distribution of tea plantations in Yingde City, China. In this article,
   we analyzed the differences in vegetation and texture characteristics
   between the new and mature tea plantations. We found that the texture
   features of the new and mature tea plantations were significantly
   different in contrast, which can be used as an index for tea plantation
   extraction. Moreover, we selected machine learning classifiers,
   including support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF) method,
   which were utilized to extract the preliminary classification to
   complete spatial distribution mapping of tea plantations. The overall
   accuracy of SVM and RF was 90.79\% and 89.42\%, respectively, and the
   kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.86, respectively. SVM had the highest
   overall accuracy in terms of tea plantation distribution at the regional
   scale. These results demonstrate that: (1) separating tea plantations
   into mature and new tea plantations, taking into account vegetation and
   texture features such as soil brightness index and contrast, will help
   improve the accuracy of tea plantation classification and (2) using
   multi-period images combined with machine learning classification
   methods can improve the efficiency and accuracy of tea plantation
   identification.},

Abstract = {Anthropized environments are associated with loss of biodiversity and
   have been listed as sites with low species richness for various
   biological groups. In this study, anuran amphibian species richness,
   community composition, and taxonomic and functional richness are
   analyzed for a highly anthropized region of central Mexico, the state of
   Queretaro, Mexico. A literature and database review found 25 species of
   anurans recorded in 13 types of environments varying from conserved to
   anthropized ones. Non-irrigated agricultural environments with annual
   seasonal harvests, such as submontane scrubland and low deciduous
   forest, presented the greatest species richness. Environments that had
   been transformed into crop fields, induced grassland and urban areas
   showed a greater similarity in their species composition compared to
   temperate environments without strong modification, i.e., montane cloud
   forest, pine-oak forest and oak-pine forest. The environments that
   presented a lower number of species also presented higher values of
   taxonomic diversity than those that presented the greatest species
   richness. The study showed that anthropized environments can maintain a
   different species composition than conserved environments, and maintain
   greater species and functional richness. This being so, further studies
   evaluating population density, endemism and conservation status of the
   species are necessary to evaluate anthropic effect on amphibian
   communities and other biological groups in the state of Queretaro and in
   other regions of Mexico.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria blooms occur frequently in lakes and reservoirs worldwide
   and the blooms are often accompanied by changes in the taste and odor of
   the water caused by cyanobacterial metabolites, such as geosmin. The
   amount of geosmin in drinking water in Japan is limited legally and
   requires regular monitoring. The approaches for detecting geosmin are
   generally based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which
   requires experienced personnel or sophisticated instrumentation. Here,
   we applied a TaqMan probe method for detecting geosmin-producing
   cyanobacteria, Anabaena (Dolichospermum) spp. in a Japanese reservoir.
   Quantitative PCR amplification using the methods which targeted geosmin
   synthase gene, worked successfully and the DNA concentrations may
   correspond with both the number of Anabaena spp. cells and the geosmin
   concentration. The tests of suitable glass microfiber filters for
   monitoring Anabaena spp. revealed that the samples filtered through GF/D
   (particle retention size 2.7 mu m) yielded significantly higher
   concentrations of Anabaena DNA compared with the samples filtered
   through the GF/F and GF/A.},

Abstract = {Paddy fields are essential habitats for frogs. We evaluated the impacts
   of both farmland consolidation including agricultural road improvement
   and farmland abandonment on the two Rana species using a model
   incorporating spatial autocorrelation. A sampling unit consists of
   several paddy fields that share a ditch and are isolated from other
   blocks by roads or other land covers. We surveyed 619 blocks in an area
   of about 1000 km(2) from the plain to the mountains of Toyota City in
   central Japan. Among them, 124 blocks included at least a flooded paddy
   field where frogs could lay eggs. R. ornativentris and R. japonica bred
   in 50 and 25 blocks, respectively. We constructed models to explain the
   presence/absence of two species by GLM (non-spatial model) and
   hierarchical Bayesian model with INLA (spatial model) that includes
   spatial autocorrelation as a random effect. Explanatory variables of the
   local scale were the altitude, location of the paddy field (yatsuda
   (valley bottom paddy fields) or non-yatsuda), farmland consolidated or
   not consolidated, and under cultivation or abandoned. Those of the
   landscape scale were areas of forest and paddy fields, and road density
   in 14 circles with different radius from 50 to 2000 m. Both species'
   distribution had significant spatial autocorrelation. The spatial model
   had a higher discriminative ability than the non-spatial model. Farmland
   consolidation and the forest area in the 400 m radius had a positive
   effect on R. ornativentris. Altitude and road density in the 50 m radius
   had negative effects, cultivation had a positive effect, and farmland
   consolidation and yatsuda had no or negative effects on R. japonica. R.
   ornativentris was threatened by farmland abandonment, but the
   urbanization and/or farmland consolidation threatened R. japonica.},

Abstract = {We examined the effects of artificial gap creation on the
   diversification of simplified stand structures in an abandoned coppice.
   A study plot was placed in a 49-year-old evergreen coppice, and two
   canopy gaps of ca. 100 m(2) were artificially created by logging in
   December 1992. In 2015-2016 (22-23 years after gap creation), stand
   structure was resurveyed and compared between a gap-treated plot (PT)
   and control plot (PC). PT was separated into gap (G), gap edge (GE), and
   forest interior (FI) parts, and their structures were compared. G and
   GE, where recruitment of new stems/individuals was expected, had no
   increase in small stems in 2015 and 2016, showing a mono-modal height
   distribution pattern in PT similar to PC. Species number also showed no
   difference between PT and PC, demonstrating a large proportion of
   species common to PT and PC. No species specific to G and GE was found.
   In PT, resprouted stems recovered their individual heights during the
   study period, resulting in a re-simplified local structure and canopy
   closure. From these results, we concluded that artificial gap creation
   in the studied stand was insufficient to diversify the stand structure
   at a mid-term (20 years) scale, and that repeated cutting and/or control
   of the resprouted stem density is required for diversification of
   abandoned coppices.},

Abstract = {Diversity gradients are observed for various groups of organisms. For
   fishes in streams, the water-energy, productivity, and temporal
   heterogeneity hypotheses can explain richness patterns. The relationship
   between species diversity and the variables that represent these
   hypotheses is generally linear and stationary, that is, the effect of
   each of those variables is constant throughout a geographically defined
   area. But the assumption of spatial stationarity has not yet been tested
   on a great number of diversity gradients. Therefore, we aimed to
   quantify the spatial stationarity in the relationships between fish
   species richness in small stream (653 streams) located throughout
   Brazil, and the water-energy, productivity, and temporal heterogeneity
   hypotheses using a geographically weighted regression-GWR. There was a
   conspicuous absence of spatial stationarity in fish species richness.
   Furthermore, water-energy dynamics represented a possible metabolic
   restriction acting on the community structuring of fish species richness
   in streams. This mechanism separated the fish fauna into two regions:
   (i) The Amazonian region, characterized by a stable climate and
   populations that are less resistant to climatic variation; and (ii) The
   central region, featured by greater ranges of temperature and fish
   populations that are resistant to climatic variation.},

Abstract = {Whether environmental DNA (eDNA) testing methods are effective for
   semi-aquatic organisms that spend time both in rivers and on land
   remains unclear. We designed a species-specific primer-probe set for the
   semi-aquatic Japanese water shrew, Chimarrogale platycephala, an
   endangered top predator species for which limited ecological information
   is available. The designed primer-probe set was used to determine the
   effective sampling time for detecting eDNA from this species in running
   water. Hourly water sampling was conducted for 25 h in the autumn of
   2020. Water sampling and camera trapping were conducted in the two
   streams in which feces had been observed on stream rocks. No C.
   platycephala activity was captured by the camera traps at any sampling
   point during the investigation. However, eDNA was mainly detected at
   night in both streams and twice during the daytime in one stream; the
   eDNA detection periods differed between streams (21:00-23:00 vs.
   1:00-8:00 and daytime). These results demonstrate that eDNA testing
   methods are effective for detecting small semi-aquatic mammals. However,
   the sampling time affected the results, and eDNA was mostly detected at
   night, possibly because of the nocturnal activity of the species.
   Therefore, the sampling time should be adjusted to match the activity
   period of a species to improve the efficiency of eDNA testing for
   semi-aquatic organisms.},

Title = {Live capture and handling of Taiwanese leopard cats Prionailurus
   bengalensis: an evaluation of trap designs and capture protocol},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Behavioural and ecological studies often require capture and handling of
   animals for marking or collaring. Cage traps, in various designs, are
   commonly used for live-capture of small mammals. Apart from costs and
   practicality, trap designs need to balance trap success and safety for
   the trapped animal. Inevitably, trapping and handling causes stress for
   the animals involved and can even result in injury or mortality. To
   optimise trap methods, it is important to share experiences. In this
   study, we describe our trapping and handling protocol for leopard cat,
   an elusive small felid which can be challenging to trap. We determine
   which factors influence trap success and compare three custom made cage
   trap designs: aviary-, box- and side-traps. We found that trap chance
   was affected by trap design, location and seasonality but, despite being
   causes of leopard cat mortality, not by human or domestic dog presence.
   The side-trap provided the best tradeoff between trap success and
   safety, and was economic and easy to handle. Sacrificing live-bait was
   unnecessary to successfully trap leopard cats. More male than female
   leopard cats visited the traps, resulting in a sex-bias in trapped
   individuals. Due to a long response time, especially when continuous
   trap monitoring was absent, the time between leopard cat capture and
   release was > 10 h (mean +/- SE = 16:18 +/- 01:57 h). We therefore
   recommend to always use remote continuous monitoring devices when
   trapping animals. Although not related to drug dosage, recovery time was
   negatively related to the distance leopard cats moved after release,
   whereas total time between capture and release was not. To minimize
   exposure to human and domestic dog related threats, we released leopard
   cats after nightfall within their natural 18:00-06:00 h activity time,
   and only released individuals once fully responsive, which took > 4 h.},

Title = {Influence of water level management on vegetation and bird use of
   restored wetlands in the Montezuma Wetlands Complex},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Active water management of wetlands promotes seed and tuber production
   to feed migrating waterfowl, but few assessments exist to determine how
   management actions influence wetland structure, vegetation and bird
   response throughout the year. We identified effects of full water
   drawdown, partial water drawdown and passive wetlands (no active
   dewatering during the growing season) on plant communities and bird
   abundance in wetlands of the Montezuma Wetlands Complex, New York,
   May-October 2016-2018 and February-April 2017-2019. We detected few
   differences in the plant community during June, but during September we
   detected greater vegetative forage quality index for waterfowl, annual
   plant cover and seed density in full and partial drawdowns than passive
   wetlands. Bird abundance was greater in June-July in passive wetlands
   and greater in September-October in full drawdowns. During spring
   migration, duck densities were greater in full and partial drawdowns.
   Our results indicate that wetland managers should use a mix of full
   drawdowns and passive wetlands to provide habitat for the greatest
   diversity and number of birds throughout the year.},

Abstract = {Colony composition and behavioral characteristics of the myrmicine ant,

   floor. All queenright colonies (N = 42) were monogynous with one dealate
   queen. The average colony size in worker number was 140.5 +/- SD 94.9.
   Under laboratory conditions, workers and larvae fed on both fresh and
   dried insect preys. The workers used a kind of tool to transport diluted
   sugar water to the nest chamber. They dropped pine needles and trashes
   into the diluted sugar water and then transported the food-soaked
   materials back into the nest chamber, where nest members then sucked on
   the materials inside the nest chamber. Trophic eggs were laid by the
   workers, the majority of which were given to the larvae. The queens also
   fed on trophic eggs as well as insect preys. The workers under an orphan
   condition laid reproductive eggs that grew up to be males.},

Abstract = {Control and prevention of invasive alien species (IAS) are important
   issues for the environmental management of dam reservoirs. Recently,
   environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has been used for monitoring IAS in
   aquatic ecosystems. In this study, as a simple and user-friendly eDNA
   method for monitoring IAS, we developed an eDNA chip analysis for
   monitoring three IAS, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, smallmouth
   bass Micropterus dolomieu and bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, in
   dam reservoirs. The eDNA chip analysis using each IAS-specific primer
   and probe only amplified and detected the target species. The developed
   eDNA chip detected three IAS from water samples collected in five dam
   reservoirs, indicating that eDNA chip analysis can be used as a
   monitoring tool for IAS. However, IAS were not detected by the eDNA chip
   at some survey sites where the qPCR assays showed low eDNA
   concentrations, indicating a lower sensitivity of the eDNA chip at low
   eDNA concentrations. For the establishment of an eDNA chip for
   biomonitoring, some challenges faced by other techniques like qPCR and
   metabarcoding remain, such as sensitivity at low target concentrations
   and ``real-time{''} detections in the field and further improvement of
   performance in eDNA chip will be required.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the influence of soil variables (pH, total
   potassium (TK), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), total
   phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), cation exchange capacity ,
   soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (Moisture), subsurface
   temperature (TEMP), and metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn)) on
   the distribution patterns of earthworm ecological categories, diversity,
   and species composition in Hebei Province, North China. In total, 535
   earthworms were collected from 18 sites, and belonged to three families,
   six genera, and ten species. Drawida gisti (17.9 inds m(-2), 37.8\%) and
   Amynthas hupeiensis (9.3 inds m(-2), 39.5\%) were the dominant species.
   The Co-inertia analysis ranking results among the soil factors and
   earthworms indicated that SOC and AK enhanced the earthworm density (R =
   0.76{*}{*}, p < 0.01; R = 0.77{*}{*}, p < 0.01). The distribution
   patterns of epigeic and endogeic species appeared to follow an opposite
   trend to soil variables (SOC, K, and Moisture) under different
   agricultural management practices. Anecic species differed considerably
   from the other ecotypes, and were unaffected by the soil properties
   (except for TEMP) and metals. The redundancy analysis results showed
   that the abovementioned dominant species (D. gisti and A. hupeiensis)
   belong to ecological groups with different propensities for the soil
   factors (K, P, and SOC). Overall, the soil metal (Cd and Pb)
   concentrations were not the dominant regressors for the earthworm
   assemblage. Soil properties (K and SOC) were the main factors affecting
   earthworm density, category, and species dominance in the study areas.},

Title = {The effect of woody plants on the understory soil parameters is
   different between grazed and ungrazed areas},
Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Facilitative role of woody plants often modifies understory soil
   parameters. However, the effect of individual shrubs on soil qualitative
   parameters could be variable in the grasslands depending on the presence
   of grazing, and little is known about how facilitative interactions
   between woody plants and soil change with grazing. Therefore, in this
   study, we compared the conservative role of woody plant species on soil
   between grazed and ungrazed areas. Soil samples were collected beneath
   (patch) and outside (interpatch) of the canopy of Crataegus
   pseudomelanicarpa in grazed and ungrazed areas in the autumn. The
   content of total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), particulate organic
   matter (POM), moisture and soil aggregate stability were compared
   between patch and interpatch in both grazed and ungrazed areas.
   Generally, the results showed that the main effects of the woody species
   were significant on the soil parameters (p < 0.05). The presence of the
   woody species in both grazed and ungrazed areas improved the values of
   all understory soil qualitative parameters. However, soil parameters
   such as POM, TC and TN were significantly higher in the patch (24.43
   gr/kg, 1.53\% and 0.20\%, respectively) than in interpatch (15.41 gr/kg,
   1.35 and 0.14\%, respectively) in the grazed area, while in the ungrazed
   area, these differences were less pronounced or not significant between
   patch (26.00 gr/kg, 1.43 and 0.18\%, respectively) and interpatch (19.10
   gr/kg, 1.43 and 0.15\%, respectively). We conclude that the nursing role
   of woody plants on soil in the degraded grasslands is more important
   when associated with grazing and should be considered in the restoration
   projects.},

Abstract = {Mutualistic interactions between plants and birds entail benefits for
   both organisms. While the birds obtain a nutritional resource when
   feeding on fruit, for example, the plant species benefits from having
   its seeds dispersed away from the mother-plant. Campinarana ecosystems
   grow on the white-sand substrates found irregularly within the Amazon
   basin. We conducted the present study in an enclave of campinarana in
   the municipality of Mancio Lima, in the western extreme of the Brazilian
   state of Acre. We used mist-nets to capture birds, from which we also
   collected fecal samples. The seeds encountered in these samples were
   identified and used to establish a bird-plant interaction network,
   through which we analyzed the connectance, nestedness, centrality
   analysis, and robustness of the interactions. We recorded 69 of the 648
   possible interactions, in which 12 bird species interacted with 54 plant
   taxa, with intermediate connectance (C = 10.65\%) and non-significant
   nestedness (N = 11.36; p = 0.1). The bird-plant interaction network of
   the campinarana enclave sampled in the present study had a random
   robustness of R-r = 0.52 and robustness of the degree of connectivity of
   R-d = 0.15. Based on its centrality analysis and robustness, black
   manakin, Xenopipo atronitens, was the most central bird species,
   responsible for the maintenance of the stability and structure of the
   interaction network. Given these findings, and its disproportionate
   mutualistic interactions with the plant taxa, in comparison with the
   other local frugivorous bird species, we consider X. atronitens to be a
   keystone species in this white-sand vegetation ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan
   implemented the College Students-in-Residence Rural Community
   Competition Program in 2011 in Taiwan. The program provides incentives
   through competition, encourages young students to travel to rural

   funding, human and material resources for counselling and coordination.
   The program brings students with expert knowledge and new ideas to rural
   communities. Thus far, most research on the benefits of the program has
   been based on the results of quantitative questionnaire surveys.
   However, these do not provide insight into the experiences of individual
   participants in the program. Therefore, this study adopted a responsive
   evaluation approach to qualitative policy evaluation and conducted
   in-depth interviews to learn about the participants' understanding of
   and views on the program through accounts of their participation
   experiences and impressions. The results of this study can help to
   address the shortcomings of current quantitative policy evaluations and

Abstract = {The lack of space in cities has favoured the development of vertical
   gardens in indoor and outdoor environments. For an adequate development
   and appearance of the plants in these living walls, it is necessary to
   provide nutrients (usually by means of fertigation). One of the main
   limitations is the difficulty in obtaining a uniform distribution of
   nutrients, especially in felt systems. The objective of this research
   was to identify whether the distribution of nutrients (particularly iron
   and phosphorous) applied by fertigation in a felt living wall depended
   on the species used and the location of the plants in height. Three
   modules of a Fytotextile (R) felt-based living wall were used, each
   module containing three columns of different species: Soleirolia
   soleirolii, Philodendron hederaceum, and Nephrolepis exaltata.
   Fertigation was applied using a Hoagland-Arnon solution for 4 months.
   Measurements of leaf area, normalised difference vegetation index
   (NDVI), chlorophyll meter readings (CMR), fresh and dry weight, and P
   and Fe concentration were carried out for each of the plants. Comparing
   variables within the same species at different heights showed no
   significant differences in the variables. This means that the
   distribution of nutrients along the living wall (especially in height)
   was uniform. It is important to note that these results could vary for
   other types of living walls or for other configurations of the
   fertigation system.},

Abstract = {The physical modification of habitat by the rodents can create patches
   with altered species richness relative to adjacent, unmodified habitats.
   The majority of studies found a positive correlation between engineering
   patches and animal species richness/diversity/abundance. In this paper,
   we show occupancy of wheatear (Oenanthe isabellina) in engineering
   patches created by Mongolian marmot (Marmota sibirica) and no
   engineering in different habitat types of the arid steppe ecosystem. We
   surveyed 123 sites for Isabelline wheatear in Hustai National Park,
   Mongolia in 2016. We used a model selection approach to evaluate the
   effect of marmot burrows and other potential variables on occupancy
   probability. We detected Isabelline wheatear in 46.34\% of the surveys
   (171 of 369). Our top model indicated that occupancy was strongly
   influenced by marmot burrows. The estimated wheatear occupancy was 0.95
   at a burrow site and 0.64 at a non-burrow site. Detection was a function
   of temperature and highest around 24.6 oC. Our results indicate that
   Isabelline wheatear distribution is strongly influenced by marmots as
   burrows presumably provide it with important habitat resources. The loss
   of marmots will probably have direct effects on the distribution of the
   breeding bird and the ecosystem processes they support. Our study
   provides one of the few examples of the role of marmots in influencing
   breeding birds and supports the notion of marmots as a keystone species.},

Title = {A phylogenetic investigation of the taxonomically problematic Eucalyptus
   odorata complex (E. section Adnataria series Subbuxeales): evidence for
   extensive interspecific gene flow and reticulate evolution},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {403-435},
Abstract = {To investigate the relationships among species in the taxonomically
   problematic Eucalyptus odorata species complex, we generated molecular
   data using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   (ddRADseq) and Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArTseq). These
   data were analysed utilising principal-component analysis (PCA),
   phylogenetic networks, phylogeny reconstruction and hybridisation tests.
   Twelve species that are variously recognised in the complex were sampled
   from across their ranges, along with co-occurring members of E. section
   Adnataria, to allow for patterns of hybridisation and gene flow to be
   identified. Despite the large genetic datasets generated, many
   relationships within the E. odorata complex were poorly resolved, and
   few species were monophyletic, likely owing to both biological factors
   including recent speciation and extensive hybridisation and
   introgression, and potential over-splitting of taxa. We show that
   multiple taxa with limited distributions are the result of reticulate
   evolutionary events and that typical Eucalyptus viridis R.T.Baker and
   the possibly con-specific E. aenea K.D.Hill are sister to the rest of
   the complex. The remaining species appeared to represent a discontinuous
   crescent-shaped cline running from the Flinders Ranges to the
   south-western slopes region of New South Wales, with limited support for
   an east-west split in this cline across the Murray River Basin.
   Eucalytpus viridis var. latiuscula Blakely, which is not closely related
   to the typical variety of this species in our data, may represent a
   northern extension to this cline.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Pages = {127-179},
Abstract = {Morphological and single-nucleotide polymorphism data support splitting
   Pultenaea glabra Benth. into eight species, including one in Victoria,
   and seven in eastern and northern New South Wales. Six species are newly
   described, five of which are, like P. glabra, narrow-range endemics
   within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and adjacent
   sandstone landforms of the Great Dividing Range. The recognition of six
   new species from what was broadly P. glabra has implications for
   conservation management, including for P. glabra itself, which has a
   smaller distribution and more precise habitat requirements than
   previously thought. One of the new species, P. percussa, is known by a
   single 1971 gathering only. The occurrence of several narrow-range Blue
   Mountains endemic Pultenaea species may be explained by the combination
   of edaphic diversity and topographic complexity, which could act in
   concert to promote divergences among small, allopatric populations.
   Hybrids between P. glabra and P. flexilis Sm. are documented for the
   first time; however, limited evidence for introgression between the two
   species was observed. The following new taxa are described: Pultenaea
   aculeata M.A.M.Renner, P.H.Weston \& S.Clarke, Pultenaea percussa

Abstract = {Although some authors previously questioned the circumscription of
   Nicotiana benthamiana, it has never been treated taxonomically as more
   than a single widespread, variable species. A recent study employing
   phylogenetic and population genetic analyses has demonstrated that N.
   benthamiana comprises five species that are geographically and
   morphologically distinct. Here, we describe four new species in the N.
   benthamiana complex, namely, N. bilybara M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N.
   candelabra M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N. rupestris M.W.Chase \& Christenh.
   and N. scopulorum M.W.Chase \& Christenh., and illustrate all five. We
   provide descriptions, a diagnostic key and a table of morphological
   characters distinguishing these closely related species. The major
   morphological feature that distinguishes N. benthamiana from the other
   four species is its petiolate leaves that become sessile only near the
   apex of the inflorescence; N. candelabra is distinct in its bifacial
   branching, N. bilybara in its commonly winged petiole with an auriculate
   base, N. rupestris in the leafy apices of its calyx lobes, and N.
   scopulorum is the least morphologically divergent species, conforming
   most closely to the general description of the N. benthamiana species

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Pages = {437-468},
Abstract = {A prevailing hypothesis of microbial biogeography holds that all species
   are ubiquitous, but this may lead to fitting Pacific specimens into
   European taxa on the basis of light microscopy. There is now evidence of
   regional endemicity in freshwater diatoms in Australia and recent
   studies have shown large diversity in the Guam marine Licmophora flora.
   The aim was to compare Australian samples with Guam Licmophora spp.,
   especially their girdle bands. Valves and girdle bands from samples
   collected from Australia and Micronesia were described from observations
   made via light and scanning-electron microscopy. Of the nine species
   present in Australian samples, six were previously undescribed. Species
   with unusual characters included Licmophora insolita Lobban \&
   Emm.S.Santos sp. nov. with a novel location for the apical rimoportula
   and a Tharngan strip on the valvocopula; Licmophora ballerina Lobban \&
   S.Blanco sp. nov., with distinctive 3rd and 4th pleurae; and the
   licmosphenioid Licmophora johnwestii Lobban \& Emm.S.Santos sp. nov.
   Specimens resembling Licmophora debilis (Katz.) Grunow and L abbreviata
   C.Agardh, described from Europe, occurred in Great Barrier Reef samples.
   The study brings the Guam flora to 20 novel v. 2 matching
   Atlantic-European taxa. The proportion of new to known species in
   Australian and Guam samples suggests regional endemicity, at least being
   broadly different from European Licmophora floras.},

Title = {Three new tribes in Myrtaceae and reassessment of Kanieae},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-295},
Abstract = {The current tribal classification of Myrtaceae was based on analysis of
   the plastid matK coding region within the trnK intron. The phylogenetic
   position of the genera Cloezia and Xanthomyrtus was poorly supported,
   and the original sequence for Kania, the type genus of the tribe
   Kanieae, was rather poor. To clarify relationships, we sequenced plastid
   psbA-trnH and an extended portion of the trnK intron, including the
   spacer regions flanking matK, and nuclear ribosomal ITS and ETS regions
   for representative species across the tribes, including denser sampling
   of the three genera of interest. Analyses of these extended datasets
   show a strong relationship between Kania and the tribe Metrosidereae but
   not with other genera presently assigned to the Kanieae. The
   relationship between Kania and the tribe Metrosidereae is strongly
   correlated with morphological features recently documented in
   Metrosideros fossils. Consequently, a new tribe, Tristaniopsideae
   PeterG.Wilson, is described to accommodate most genera presently
   assigned to Kanieae. Furthermore, the morphological divergence and
   genetic distance shown by Cloezia and Xanthomyrtus are here considered
   as justifying their recognition as the tribes Cloezieae Peter G.Wilson
   and Xanthomyrteae Peter G.Wilson. Recognition of these tribes brings to
   four the number of tribes absent from present-day mainland Australia.
   Prior to this study, Metrosidereae was the only tribe in subfamily
   Myrtoideae that was absent from mainland Australia.},

Abstract = {Understandings of fish spawning are important for the effective riverine
   ecosystem and fisheries resources management. Application of
   environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis would allow fish spawning evaluation
   at a high temporal and spatial resolution due to its less-labor
   intensive property, compared to the conventional collection methods.
   However, the relative performance of the two eDNA-based methods used to
   evaluate fish spawning, pre and post comparisons of eDNA concentrations
   and nuclear DNA to mitochondrial DNA ratio, has not been compared in the
   field. We evaluated whether spawning events of Ayu Plecoglossus
   altivelis could be identified from day (pre-spawning) to night
   (post-spawning) changes in eDNA concentrations using nuclear DNA (RAG1,
   nuDNA) and nuDNA/mitochondrial DNA ratio in comparison to the
   conventional mitochondrial DNA (cyt b, mtDNA). In addition, the relative
   sensitivity of nuDNA concentrations in spawning evaluation was compared
   with mtDNA concentrations. Water samples were collected biweekly in the
   lower Takatsu River, western Japan, between early October and early
   December 2020, covering the spawning season of the fish species.
   Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) showed that Ayu spawning
   could be detected by nuDNA concentrations likewise by mtDNA
   concentrations, while nuDNA/mtDNA ratio could not detect spawning
   earlier in the spawning season. GLS models showed that the day-to-night
   increase in the eDNA concentrations was more profound for nuDNA than for
   mtDNA during the main spawning period of the fish. Our findings insist
   that the application of nuDNA concentrations better serves as a tool for
   evaluating Ayu spawning intensity in eDNA analysis.},

Abstract = {Roads and traffic have various negative ecological and environmental
   consequences on wildlife. Their impacts on animal populations are not
   limited to deaths. The main goal of the study is to analyze the spatial
   patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) at the Ankara-Kirikkale
   highway. More specifically, we identified the road- and
   landscape-related features that may promote the WVC likelihood and
   locate the WVC hotspots. The hotspots of WVC were generated by CrimeStat
   3 software. Variables related to the WVC locations were statistically
   analyzed, and then, they were modelled with logit regression approach. A
   total of 76 medium and large mammal were recorded from five species. The
   number of high-, medium-, and low-density clusters in the hotspots map
   that contains all the accidents are one, two, and four, respectively.
   For all species, the model shows that the probability of a fatal
   accident increases as the speed limit increases and the road slope
   decreases. To spatially identify where these events are concentrated
   provides valuable information for reducing the accidents and creating
   the correct strategies to ensure the safe migratory movements of wild
   animals.},

Abstract = {Urban greenspaces are public spaces, fulfilling multiple city functions,
   such as improvement of public health. They are also ecosystems which
   provide biodiversity as part of the green infrastructure. To evaluate
   greenspaces as ecosystems, seventeen urban greenspaces in Yokohama,
   Japan, were selected to conduct surveys of flora and construct a
   vegetation table. The present study investigated the number of woody
   plant species; their growth form (tree, shrub, or liana); the ratio of
   evergreen to deciduous plants; and whether plant species were native,
   exotic, wild, or planted. The greenspaces were compared with the control
   area, Enkaizan, a suburban greenspace within Yokohama and representative
   of Satoyama (a traditional landscape model with sustainable living
   space). The comparison used cluster analysis to match the correlation of
   identified species in each greenspace and split them into four groups:
   (1) natural, (2) quasi-natural, (3) quasi-artificial, and (4)
   artificial. The study found the natural greenspace group to have an
   intact hierarchical forest structure with trees, shrubs, and lianas;
   whereas artificial greenspaces missed either tree or shrub layers and
   had few lianas. The more artificial greenspaces had higher proportions
   of exotic and evergreen species.},

Abstract = {Rhodeus atremius suigensis is an extremely endangered bitterling fish,
   designated as one of the Nationally Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
   Flora by the Ministry of Environment of Japan. To prevent its
   extinction, effective ecological survey methods are necessary in order
   to guide habitat management. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis
   has proven useful for detection and censusing of endangered aquatic
   species that are difficult to locate and capture. In this study, we
   developed and evaluated a semi-quantitative system to track R. a.
   suigensis using eDNA. We designed primers and a fluorescent probe
   specific to the mitochondrial gene for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1
   (ND-1) of R. a. suigensis for quantitative real-time PCR. We first
   confirmed the utility of this analysis in aquarium experiments, before
   performing field surveys. We sampled water for eDNA analysis and set
   fish traps at 48 points in an agricultural channel in the Ashida River
   basin, inhabited by R. a. suigensis, and examined the relationship
   between fish occurrence and eDNA concentration. The concentration was
   correlated with the distance downstream from the point where specimens
   of R. a. suigensis were captured, indicating that the eDNA concentration
   reflects distribution and abundance of R. a. suigensis. These results
   not only demonstrate the reliability of this method, but also suggest
   its feasibility for conservation measures.},

Abstract = {Invasive aquatic plants can have various ecological impacts on river
   ecosystems. It is important to identify the spatial positions of the
   invasive aquatic plant sources in a mainstem-tributary network to
   understand the distributions and prioritize the removal areas of
   invasive aquatic plants. This study used environmental DNA (eDNA)
   analyses to identify the potential sources (invasive macrophyte patches
   that persist throughout seasons in a river segment and can provide the
   plant fragments to the downstream) of Egeria densa, an invasive aquatic
   macrophyte, in a riverine network. We monitored the seasonal changes
   (March, July, August, and October) of eDNA concentrations of E. densa in
   tributaries with their associated mainstem sites (total 16 x 2 = 32
   sites) in the Gonokawa River, Japan in 2021 and identified the potential
   sources of the target species based on the spatial abundance patterns
   and persistence in the riverine network. Our results indicated that the
   eDNA concentrations of E. densa have decreased in the mainstem from
   March to October, whereas the eDNA concentrations in the tributary sites
   had opposite temporal patterns possibly because the artificial tributary
   sites could be less affected by the flood event. In addition, certain
   mainstem segments and tributaries had higher eDNA concentrations and
   persistence of E. densa than other locations and could be potential
   sources of the invasive macrophyte in the system. Our study helps to
   identify and remove the potential sources of invasive macrophytes and
   prevent the further spread in riverine systems.},

Abstract = {To help upscale ecological restoration of degraded lands, landscape
   factors and longer time scales should be considered when assessing
   restoration efforts. We evaluated the impact of initial restoration
   intervention, landscape composition, and elapsed time since the
   restoration began on the long-term progress of Pannonic sand grassland
   restoration. Treatments (seeding, mowing, and carbon amendment) were
   implemented for 6-7 years and monitoring lasted up to 23 years after the
   first treatment applications in eight experimental blocks belonging to
   three field experiments. The abundance of target/neophyte species, and
   distance from primary grasslands and plantations (as major source of
   target/neophyte species) were estimated in 500 m landscape buffers
   around each block to characterize landscape composition. Restoration
   progress was calculated as the difference between the relative cover of
   target/neophyte species in treatment and control plots. Restoration
   intervention and neophyte abundance in the landscape had a significant
   effect on the restoration progress, but time did not. Seeding had the
   highest positive effect on target species and also prevented invasion by
   neophyte species. Higher abundance of neophytes in the landscape and the
   proximity to plantations increased the cover of neophytes in treatment
   plots. We conclude that restoration interventions may have a greater
   impact on restoration progress in the longer term than landscape factors
   or elapsed time. Seeding proved to be the best method in restoring sand
   grasslands by both favoring target species and controlling invasion.
   From the landscape factors, the abundance of neophyte species and
   distance to plantations should be considered when prioritizing areas and
   efforts for restoration.},

Abstract = {Golden everlasting paper daisies in the genus Xerochrysum Tzvelev are
   iconic Australian native plants grown worldwide. The X. bracteatum
   species complex has been regarded as taxonomically confusing and in need

   analyses to delimit species, detect common ancestry among populations,
   and identify putative hybrids in the genus Xerochrysum (Asteraceae:
   Gnaphalieae). Multiple lines of evidence provided strong support for the
   recognition of new taxa. Here we describe the following 11 new species:

Abstract = {Atmospheric heavy metal deposition is widely occurring due to
   anthropogenic effects such as industrial activities and motor vehicles.
   As a result, it has increased significantly and reached a level that
   threatens human health and the environment. Among these deposition
   factors, it is of great importance to monitor the atmospheric
   concentrations of heavy metals that do not easily degrade in nature,
   tend to bioaccumulate, and can be toxic even at low concentration
   levels. Biomonitoring is one of the most impressive passive methods in
   determining the change of heavy metal concentrations in the atmosphere.
   This study investigates the effect of anthropogenic emission sources in
   urban areas using tree rings as a biomonitor. Cedrus atlantica was
   selected, because it is generally preferred in parks, roadside and
   landscape design. Samples were collected from parks near the road,
   densely populated, and close to the small-scale industry in Kastamonu,
   Turkiye. Atmospheric deposition of Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) in organs
   were analyzed based on years and directions. Their accumulation in the
   outer bark was determined to be quite high (Cd value is 2226.2 ppb and
   Pb value is 38201.1 ppb) compared to other organs. As a result, the
   traffic density and industrial emissions affect the Pb and Cd
   concentrations. This study will provide beneficial information for
   atmospheric heavy metal deposition in landscape plants.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {At present, the focus on greenway construction in China is shifting from
   production protection and environment beautification to ecological
   protection and leisure and recreation. The ways in which to explore a
   comprehensive and efficient ecological health functional greenway plant
   landscape model are of particular importance for greenway construction
   and community belt park management. In the present study, nine landscape
   configuration patterns of three green space structure types
   (trees-shrubs-grass, trees-grass, and shrubs-grass) in typical community
   demonstrative belt park greenways in Changchun Fitness Park in Beijing
   were selected as the study objects on which to perform quantitative
   study and evaluation of the single and comprehensive effects of six core
   ecological health factors, namely green space landscape beauty degree,
   negative air ions, human comfort, PM2.5, and bacteria and noise
   reduction. The results show that the ecological health care effects of
   the greenways differ due to various community structures. The score
   range of the plant landscape beauty of spatial composition groups is -
   1.333 to 0.932, the highest value of air negative ions released in
   summer reaches 1176 cm(-3), and the reduction rate of PM2.5
   concentration is 1.94-12.21\%. The greenways have a strong effect on
   improving human comfort in spring, summer and autumn. The temperature
   difference inside and outside the green spaces is as high as 3 celcius,
   the humidification is about 20\%, the net noise attenuation rate is
   0.10-11.36\%, and the bacteria reduction rate reaches up to 50-60\%. The
   comprehensive index method was used to evaluate the six-core health
   factor system, the range of the comprehensive index of ecological health
   function of the three types of green space structures was
   2.3187-10.3334, and the overall order was trees-shrubs-grass >
   trees-grass > shrubs-grass. The three landscape configuration patterns
   that were screened with better ecological health care effects can be
   used for the construction of the urban community belt park greenways.},

Abstract = {Statistical analyses of two morphological datasets, including 190 newly
   measured specimens, showed that individuals of Myosotis (Boraginaceae)
   from Te Waipounamu / South Island, Aotearoa, New Zealand, identified a
   priori with three different informal tag names, belong to the
   bracteate-prostrate group, are morphologically distinct from each other
   and from other species, and merit scientific description. Myosotis
   hikuwai Meudt, Prebble \& G.M.Rogers is known from one location near
   Wanaka (Otago), has an unusual erect, spring annual habit, and is most
   similar to M. brevis and M. glauca, with which it is sympatric. Myosotis
   venticola Meudt \& Prebble comprises plants that were sometimes
   previously identified as M. cheesemanii from certain ranges in Otago and
   southern Canterbury, but with retrorse trichomes present on the abaxial
   and adaxial side of the rosette leaves. Myosotis ultramafica Meudt,
   Prebble \& Rance comprises individuals from ultramafic sites in certain
   ranges in Southland, and is most similar to M. cheesemanii and M.
   lyallii. We recommend that all three new species are listed as
   Threatened under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In
   addition to descriptions and illustrations, the three new species are
   also included in a revised key to the nineteen species of southern
   hemisphere bracteate-prostrate Myosotis.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {395-402},
Abstract = {Crinum flaccidum Herb. is widespread across southern and eastern
   Australia, but suffers from taxonomic uncertainty. This ambiguity is in
   part due to widespread hybridisation in the genus, but also
   morphological variability within and among populations. Morphological
   and molecular analyses of the complex using 24 morphological characters
   and 59 chloroplast coding and non-coding regions (similar to 50 000 bp)
   provided support for the separation of C. flaccidum from C. luteolum
   Traub \& L.S.Hannibal ex Traub, with the latter representing populations
   from the Flinders Ranges and Lake Eyre Basin. Within Crinum flaccidum,
   there was greater inferred genetic structure at the population level for
   New South Wales flood plain accessions, compared with South Australian
   populations from along the Murray River. The greater structure of the
   South Australian populations is theorised to be attributed to lower
   seed-dispersal rates leading to lower gene flow.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {A new genus, Simonachne E.J.Thomps. is described and Ancistrachne
   maidenii (A.A.Ham.) Vickery is transferred to it as Simonachne maidenii
   (A.A.Ham.) E.J.Thomps. The new subtribe Cleistochloinae E.J.Thomps. is
   described and is composed of four genera, Calyptochloa, Cleistochloa,
   Dimorphochloa and Simonachne, united by distinctive morphology that is
   associated with reproductive dimorphism. Phenetic analyses were used to
   examine the similarities of taxa and to test the consistency of results
   with variation in analysis inputs. Input variations included the dataset
   in terms of composition of the samples and morphological characters, and
   the cluster analysis algorithms, viz. classification, ordination and
   association measure. A baseline dataset was used for comparison of
   results and comprised 24 samples and 161 characters relating to anatomy,
   micro- and macromorphology of spikelets, leaves and fertile culms. Three
   major clusters were resolved, Cleistochloinae ('the cleistogamy group'),
   Neurachninae in its original sense, and a cluster referred to as the
   `paniculate inflorescence group' composed of Ancistrachne s.s.,
   Entolasia and Panicum s.s. The results were congruent with a recent
   phylogenetic study that showed that Ancistrachne s.l., Cleistochloa s.l.
   and Dimorphochloa s.l. were not monophyletic. The process provided an
   array of morphological characters for descriptions of species and for
   distinguishing taxa at multiple ranks in natural groups, components of
   alpha and beta taxonomy respectively.},

Abstract = {Alien species management can be improved by understanding the population
   genetic structure of alien species that affect native ecosystems. In
   this study, we analyzed the spatial genetic structure of nutria
   (Myocastor coypus), an invasive rodent species in the Yodo River system
   in Japan, to improve efficiency of management strategies. We performed
   genetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13
   microsatellite DNA loci from nutria captured at two locations: the
   Katsura River and Shirokita Cove, in the upper and lower reaches of the
   Yodo River system, respectively. Three mtDNA haplotypes (N1, N2, and N3)
   were identified within the Yodo River system, and the same haplotype
   (N1) was dominant in both the Katsura River and Shirokita Cove
   populations. Microsatellite variation was low in both populations. The
   upstream Katsura River population consisted of a single genetic
   population, whereas the downstream Shirokita Cove population showed a
   genetic subdivision likely caused by genetic drift. These results
   suggest that the Yodo River system populations may have originated from
   the single ancestral populations. Habitat disruptions, such as severe
   flood events, may have caused the genetic drift observed in these
   populations and result in the genetic subdivision within a single river
   system. Additionally, microsatellite DNA analysis showed that in
   Shirokita Cove, there was significant isolation-by-distance in female
   nutria and dispersal occurred over relatively short distances.
   Therefore, when influence of flooding and migration on population
   dynamics are considered, a combination of localized intensive trapping
   and extensive monitoring may be necessary to control nutria density.},

Title = {Productivity of sago palms on smallholder plantations after rewetting in

Abstract = {Sustainable land use through rewetting is becoming increasingly
   important in drained peatlands. We assessed the recovery of productivity
   of smallholder paludiculture using sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) in a
   rewetted peatland on Tebing Tinggi Island, Riau Province, Indonesia,
   which had been drained and burned in 2014. Stand structure and
   productivity of sago palms in smallholder plantations were measured in
   December 2016, November 2017, and March 2020. The sago stands were
   divided into three stands structure groups (pre-harvest stands, mid- to
   post-harvest stands, and growing period stands) according to gaps in the
   harvesting cycle, which were distributed in a mosaic pattern. Only those
   sago palms that had reached their maximum size were harvested, and as a
   result the mosaic pattern varied over time (spatial variation). The
   estimated harvest trunk height after rewetting was 8.9 +/- 1.5 m (mean
   +/- SD), which was not significantly different from that before drainage
   (9.7 +/- 0.4 m). The average annual yield of sago was 26.8 trunks
   ha(-1), and there was large annual variation. Annual yield of
   paludiculture conducted after rewetting recovered to the same yield as
   that before drainage (26.0 trunks ha(-1)). Such size distribution
   patterns and large fluctuations in yield are characteristic of
   semi-traditional smallholder sago cultivation. Despite fluctuations in
   annual yield, harvesting only suitable individuals allows sago palms to
   be supplied every year. The findings obtained in this study will
   contribute to national and regional efforts to initiate paludiculture
   using sago palms.},

Abstract = {We clarified the landscape-scale habitat selection of Japanese squirrels
   during winter in heavy snowfall areas in northeastern Japan. In this
   study, we examined the importance of evergreen coniferous plantations as
   habitats for Japanese squirrels. We searched for Japanese squirrel
   footprints in the snow along the 37 survey routes, from January 8 to
   March 8, 2020. We analyzed the relationships between the occurrence of
   Japanese squirrels based on footprints and environmental factors (i.e.,
   the proportion of surrounding broad-leaved forest, Cupressaceae forest,
   and Pinaceae forest; distance from broad-leaved forest, Cupressaceae
   forest, Pinaceae forest, and water bodies, and elevation) using a
   generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). The results showed a high
   probability of footprint occurrence in areas close to Cupressaceae and
   Pinaceae forests and a low probability of footprint occurrence in areas
   with a high proportion of Cupressaceae forests. This study suggests that
   Cupressaceae plantations play a part in the function of habitats, such
   as refuge, resting and nesting environments, and protection from wind
   and snow, for Japanese squirrels during winter in snowy areas. However,
   the landscape, which is dominated by cedar plantations in the
   surrounding area, was considered unsuitable owing to the lack of food
   resources. Thus, for Japanese squirrels, a forest environment with
   multifaceted functions, including coniferous plantations and food
   resources such as walnut and pine trees, would be beneficial.},

Title = {Effects of host tree size on the species richness and abundance of

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {This study clarified the effects of host tree size on the numbers of
   epiphyte species and individuals on a tree, based on observation of 122
   species and 2,162 individuals of epiphytes on 430 target trees in a
   Bornean primary lowland dipterocarp forest. We analyzed relationships of
   the diameter at breast height (DBH) of target host trees with the
   probability of epiphyte presence, number of epiphyte species on each
   target tree (species richness), number of epiphyte individuals on each
   target host tree (abundance), and cumulative number of epiphyte species.
   The probability of epiphyte presence was estimated by a generalized
   linear model (GLM) with a logistic distribution to be higher than 50\%
   on trees with DBH >40 cm. A GLM with a quasi-Poisson distribution showed
   that both species richness and epiphyte abundance increased
   exponentially with DBH. The most rapid increase was found for trees with
   DBH >40 cm. Also, about half of all epiphyte species recorded in this
   study were only found on trees with DBH >60 cm. These results suggest
   that in lowland tropical rainforests in the Southeast Asian tropics,
   large trees play an important role in maintaining the species diversity
   of epiphyte assemblages by providing them with habitats. Meanwhile,
   several epiphyte species were found only trees with DBH <= 40 cm,
   suggesting that the small trees also provide essential habitats with
   such epiphyte species. Primary forests with various sizes of trees are
   necessary for conservation of the epiphyte assemblages.},

Abstract = {In cool-temperate regions of Japan, riparian forests tend to have high
   tree species richness, but it is unknown if this trend is consistent in
   warm-temperate regions. Here, we assessed tree species richness and
   forest structure in three topographic units reflecting the ridge to
   valley gradient (slope crests and upper and lower slopes) in a mature
   broadleaf evergreen forest in southwest Japan. We established a 0.59-ha
   valley bottom plot that was primarily comprised of a lower slope unit,
   then surveyed and mapped all living trees with a diameter at breast
   height > 5 cm. Resulting compositional and species richness data were
   compared to those from an adjacent permanent plot that included the
   slope crest and upper slope units, provided by the Japanese Ministry of
   the Environment. In the valley bottom, debris flow terraces had the
   highest tree density and served as important habitat for broadleaf
   deciduous trees. Tree species compositions were broadly similar in that
   nearly all species were found in each topographic unit. However, there
   were obvious differences in species densities among topographic units,
   with the lowest densities found in the lower slope unit. Species-area
   curves indicated that tree species richness was lowest in the lower
   slope unit. Species-individual curves indicated that all three units had
   very similar total species richness. Even when forbs were included,
   understory species richness in the lower slope unit remained low. Our
   results suggest that unlike broadleaf deciduous cool-temperate forests,
   broadleaf evergreen riparian forests in warm-temperate regions may not
   necessarily relate to greater species richness.},

Title = {Durations of virtual exposure to built and natural landscapes impact

Abstract = {Exposure to natural landscapes can benefit human health. However,
   several knowledge gaps remain regarding the impacts of duration and
   cultural differences on the health benefits of nature. If these gaps are
   filled, designers and planners can better design landscapes for stress
   recovery. This study examined the effects of durations of virtual
   exposure to the built and natural environments across three countries
   using an experimental design. Two-hundred and seventy people from USA,
   Taiwan, and Thailand were induced with an acute stressor and then
   randomly assigned to watch 360 degrees videos of urban or natural
   landscapes for 1, 5, or 15 min. Self-reported stress recovery data were
   collected before and after the exposure. The results suggested that
   gender and duration of exposure to virtual natural landscapes impacted
   stress recovery. Female participants recovered from stress more when
   exposed to the virtual natural landscapes than urban landscapes. Among
   those participants who were exposed to virtual natural landscapes, 5 min
   of exposure resulted in greater stress recovery than shorter or longer
   durations of exposure. Perceived familiarity did not influence the
   extent of stress recovery. These findings support previous research on
   how nature exposure is related to stress recovery and varies by dosage,
   leading to better understanding toward landscape design. Future studies
   should explore other measures of stress, different landscape designs,
   participants' immersion, and levels of control in simulated nature
   scenes.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {33-41},
Abstract = {There is a high expectation for forest ecosystems to provide several
   ecosystem services simultaneously. In this study, positive relationships
   between the amount of carbon stock in coarse woody debris (CWD) and the
   diversity of polypore fungi were examined in six primary stands and 19
   secondary stands with different stand ages (12-81 years) of tropical
   rain forests in Malaysia. We recorded the size and number of each of the
   CWD pieces in which at least one fruiting body of 21 target polypore
   species appeared in each plot. The average amount of carbon stock in the
   CWD pieces was estimated to be 48.8 Mg ha(-1 )in primary forests and
   12.3 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forests. The diversity of polypore species
   increased with the amount of carbon stock in CWD when data from primary
   and secondary forest were combined. Among secondary forests, the carbon
   stock of CWD increased with stand age, but diversity of polypore species
   varied greatly among stands of similar ages and the carbon stock of CWD,
   and hence did not significantly increase with stand age or the carbon
   stock of CWD. According to our findings, primary forests are critically
   important for the conservation of biodiversity and carbon stock, and old
   secondary forests with higher carbon stock in CWD have a potential to
   sustain a high level of diversity of polypore fungi.},

Abstract = {Philotheca sect. Erionema includes 14 species from eastern Australia and
   one from south-western Australia. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis
   of the section, including samples of all species, using sequences of the
   ITS and ETS regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results were broadly
   congruent with a previous analysis based on morphological and flavonoid
   data. The analysis is consistent with the monophyly of the section and
   supports the monophyly of six species represented by multiple samples.
   Philotheca verrucosa (A. Rich.) Paul G. Wilson was resolved as
   paraphyletic with respect to P. freyciana Rozefelds but with poor
   support. Philotheca glasshousiensis, P. myoporoides and P. myoporoides
   subsp. myoporoides were clearly polyphyletic, including separate
   geographic clades and the classification of each of these taxa requires
   revision. In particular, disjunct northern populations of P.
   glasshousiensis probably represent a distinct species, the five
   subspecies of P. myoporoides could be treated as separate species and at
   least two other distinct groups that are currently included under the
   circumscription of subsp. myoporoides could be treated as species. The
   phylogeny revealed deeply divergent, geographically overlapping clades
   in eastern Australia and substantial distances (up to 900 km) between
   sister taxa. We infer that biogeography of the group has been shaped
   largely by vicariant differentiation of taxa.},

Abstract = {Paddy ecosystems are among the most biodiversity-rich ecosystems, but
   they can be degraded by field consolidation or the abandonment of rice
   cultivation. Snakes are the top predators in paddy ecosystems;
   therefore, understanding the distribution of snakes is important for the
   conservation of paddy biodiversity. Traditionally, surveys of snakes
   have been primarily conducted by sighting and trapping, but such methods
   require encountering snakes during surveys and require expertise in
   species identification. In this study, we developed environmental DNA
   (eDNA) detection assays for snakes as a method for surveying a wide area
   relatively easily. We designed species-specific assays for three common
   snake species in Japanese paddy ecosystems: Elaphe quadrivirgata,
   Rhabdophis tigrinus, and Gloydius blomhoffii. After confirming the
   detection of target species DNA from the rearing environment, the assays
   were applied to field samples. Eighty-seven and 51 samples were
   collected from paddy fields, reservoirs, and ditches in summer and
   autumn, respectively. We collected eDNA samples from eight traditional
   paddy areas that had not been consolidated, eight consolidated paddy
   areas, and two abandoned paddy areas in southeastern Hyogo Prefecture,
   Japan. We attempted to detect the DNA of the three target species in
   these samples using our eDNA assays and succeeded in identifying the DNA
   of R. tigrinus and G. blomhoffii in three areas and one area,
   respectively. Statistical analysis suggested that land-use type affected
   the detection of R. tigrinus eDNA. This study is the first attempt to
   survey snakes in paddy ecosystems using eDNA analysis and will
   contribute to the development of paddy ecosystem monitoring.},

Abstract = {An interim hierarchical classification (i.e. biogeographical
   regionalisation or area taxonomy) of the world's terrestrial regions is
   provided, following the work of Morrone published in Australian
   Systematic Botany in 2015. Area names are listed according to the
   International Code of Area Nomenclature so as to synonymise redundant
   names. The interim global terrestrial regionalisation to the subregion
   level recognises 3 kingdoms, 2 subkingdoms, 8 regions, 21 subregions and
   5 transition zones. No new names are proposed for the regions; however,
   Lydekker's Line is renamed Illiger's Line. We note that some regions
   still require area classification at the subregion level, particularly
   the Palearctic, Ethiopian and Oriental regions. Henceforth, the
   following interim global regionalisation may be used as a template for
   further revisions and additions of new areas in the future.},

Abstract = {Monospecific Rhizophora spp. trees have been planted for several decades
   in the Philippines to offset heavy mangrove deforestation resulting
   mainly from aquaculture pond construction. The reforested mangrove
   studies are required for evaluating their ecological roles. We surveyed
   the forest structure, biomass, and net primary production (NPP) at an
   18-year-old R. mucronata plantation site (PL) and a secondary natural
   mangrove site (NM) at Batan Bay Estuary, Philippines. The survey showed
   that PL had a>8,000 ha(-1) tree density, 351.6 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and
   73.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP, exceeding the values at NM (670 ha(-1 )tree
   density, 130.7 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and 22.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP). The
   low biomass quantity in NM was due to the residual effects of a typhoon
   in November 2013; however, the NPP showed a quick recovery which implies
   the disturbance-adapted characteristics of pioneer species such as
   Avicennia marina and Sonneratia alba. At PL, the biomass and NPP were
   large, though it has been known that monospecific Rhizophora spp.
   plantation has been vulnerable to the risk of stand destruction due to
   strong typhoons. We concluded that the A. marina and S. alba, which
   dominated as natural mangrove stand, are suitable for mangrove
   reforestation because it quick recovered even after the typhoon impacts.},

Title = {Further food for thought: higher tropical mountains revisited once again},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {43-57},
Abstract = {D.H. Janzen argued that tropical mountains, for their heights, pose
   greater migration barriers than temperate mountains owing to lower
   temperature seasonality, and consequent greater niche and ecosystem
   specialization. These result in distinct altitudinal zonation under
   hardly varying temperature lapse rates. The Asian Far East alone
   provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis owing to latitudinal
   continuity of evergreen forests from equator to warm temperate zone.
   With data from four mountains, we find Janzen's hypothesis broadly
   correct. The primary and most consistent mediator of forest zonation and
   therefore species' habitat specificity is soil, itself indirectly
   mediated by climate. But declining habitat niche specificity does not
   proceed north along a continuum, instead in a series of latitudinal
   steps initiated by quite sudden habitat changes. Tropical montane
   forests are altitudinally floristically and structurally zoned by
   factors only indirectly mediated by temperature. Equatorial forests
   experience continuously wet climates and a frost line at c.4100 m. North
   of 8 degrees N, temperature and rainfall seasonality increases and
   winter air frosts descend to c.2000 m. Upper montane forest becomes
   truncated, while lower montane forest continues to the frost line which
   remains constant in moist climates. The margin of the wet tropics is
   pushed north to 27 degrees N by the Himalaya. Annual frost at c.2000 m
   here marks a narrow ecotone between tropical lower montane forest and
   warm temperate evergreen lucidophyll forest, a formation unique to east
   Asia. In equably moist South China, the lowland tropical-warm temperate
   ('subtropical') margin returns to the Tropic of Cancer and appears to be
   narrow at all altitudes. The temperate forests exhibit less distinct and
   inconsistent altitudinal zonation, instead manifesting an altitudinal
   floristic and structural continuum mediated by winter frost frequency
   and intensity.},

Abstract = {As climate warming progresses, it becomes necessary to study the effects
   of water temperature on the basin-scale dynamic distribution of riverine
   fish. This study examined the spatiotemporal distribution of
   Plecoglossus altivelis using the environmental DNA approach and its
   relationship with water temperature from summer growth to autumn
   spawning periods in the Nagara River basin, central Japan. The overall
   results of the spatiotemporal distribution of P. altivelis were
   consistent with the known life history: a wide-range distribution in the
   basin during summer and aggregation in the middle mainstem during
   autumn. Additionally, this study found three intriguing distribution
   patterns depending on water temperature. During summer (August), the
   warmest period, P. altivelis was distributed in the upper mainstem, one
   tributary, and the mainstem downstream of the tributary confluences in
   relation to the relatively colder water (< 25 degrees C). During early
   autumn (September-early October), it spread widely in the middle and
   upper mainstem without the constraint of the upper limit of water
   temperature. During late autumn (late October-November), it steadily
   aggregated to the middle mainstem because of downstream migration for
   spawning at water temperatures below 20 degrees C. This study suggests
   the importance of river connectivity for P. altivelis migration to
   suitable habitats during its freshwater life stages, upper mainstem and
   tributaries as summer growth habitats, and cooling effects of
   tributaries on the mainstem during mid-summer.},

Abstract = {Open green spaces have significant contributions to the city, urban
   residents and ecosystem. However, these contributions could not be fully
   reflected on the urban space due to rapid urbanization. Furthermore,
   studies on this reflection have focused only on a specific function of
   open green spaces without a holistic approach. Also, there is no common
   framework for the definition, classification and standardization of open
   green spaces or a comprehensive analysis of these domains. The present
   study aimed to propose a guideline that included five criteria to serve
   as a baseline to plan open green space systems. In the study, open green
   spaces and the city were considered as a subsystem of the landscape.
   Thus, open green space objectives and strategies were proposed based on
   the landscape functions, urban character and urbanization level (urban
   density). Furthermore, the study reconsidered the definition and
   classification of open green spaces and recommended standards. These
   standards were categorized in two groups based on recreational standards
   and natural disasters. Thus, the open green spaces were analyzed based
   on qualitative, quantitative, connectivity and location selection
   criteria with a holistic approach and a multi-dimensional framework was
   developed based on ecological, recreational and disaster criteria.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal and geographic variations in the green moisture content and

   models for three bamboo species (Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C.,
   Bambusa maculata Widjaja, and Gigantochloa atter (Hassk) Kurz ex Munro)
   naturally grown in four locations in Lombok Island, Indonesia. The mean
   green moisture contents and basic densities were 74.2\% and 0.69 g

   80.3 \% and 0.65 g cm(-3) for G. atter, respectively. No significant
   differences in green moisture content and basic density were found among
   the species. A significant negative correlation between basic density
   and green moisture content was found in all three species. Based on the
   results of model selections for longitudinal variations, the green
   moisture content decreased with an increase in the culm height in all
   three species, and basic density tended to increase from the base to the
   top of the culm. Relatively large geographical variation was found in
   the green moisture content and basic density of G. atter. although the
   main reasons for variation of these properties were individual culm in

Volume = {18},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {389-395},

Abstract = {The elevational changes in vegetation are related to the changes in
   environmental factors, such as temperature. Evergreen conifers Abies
   veitchii and A. mariesii dominate the subalpine zone between 1600 and
   2000 m and between 2000 and 2500 m above sea level (a.s.l.),
   respectively, in central Japan. This study examined why their dominating
   elevations are separated by investigating the temperature-photosynthesis
   relationship at high and low elevations (1600 m and 2300 m a.s.l.). This
   study tested two hypotheses: (1) the optimal temperature (T-opt) for the
   maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max) is lower in individuals grown at
   high elevation than at low elevation, and A. mariesii has lower T-opt
   than A. veitchii at each elevation; and (2) P-max of individuals grown
   at low elevation is greater in A. veitchii than in A. mariesii, while
   that of individuals grown at high elevation is greater in A. mariesii
   than in A. veitchii. Saplings of the two conifers were sampled at high
   and low elevations. The photosynthetic rate was measured at the
   laboratory. Contrary to the hypotheses, both species had the same T-opt
   at two elevations, and P-max was greater in A. veitchii than in A.
   mariesii, irrespective of the elevation where the individuals grew. The
   elevational distribution of the two species could not be explained by
   the temperature-photosynthesis relationship. Therefore, factors other
   than the temperature-photosynthesis relationship are important to
   understand the elevational separation of the two species.},

Abstract = {In the context of climate variation and land use/cover change (LUCC),
   terrestrial ecosystem has substantially changed over the past few
   decades, which can be reflected by the variations in net primary
   productivity (NPP). The Tumen River Basin (TTRB), the center of
   Northeast Asia, was selected as the study site. On the basis of
   long-term series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data
   sets accompanied with a developed product of meteorological data, the
   optimized Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model and other common
   statistical methods as well as the approach of transition matrix were
   utilized to reveal the spatio-temporal changes of NPP and the effects of
   climate variation and LUCC on NPP from 1982 to 2012 in TTRB. The results
   indicated that throughout the past 31 years NPP exhibited a general
   upward trend on both spatial and temporal levels whereas the spatial
   downward trend accounting for 38\% of the area and obvious fluctuations
   in the temporal trend plot of NPP variability collectively connoted the
   partial degradation of ecosystem in TTRB. The correlation analysis
   between NPP and climatic factors at spatial and temporal scales revealed
   that temperature affected local NPP greater than precipitation. The
   quantitative evaluation for the impact of LUCC on NPP underscored that
   national ecological policies were largely effective in the restoration
   of ecosystem. The more prominent role of climate variation on NPP than
   LUCC indicated that the new ecological strategy should pay more
   attention to the relations between NPP and climatic variables.
   Simultaneously, assistant measures should be added to form a holistic
   management scheme for the ecosystem in TTRB.},

Abstract = {Eremophila R.Br. comprises at least 238 species endemic to Australia,
   with many more having not yet been formally described. Three putative
   new taxa, namely, E. sp. Hamersley Range (K. Walker KW 136), E. sp.
   Calvert Range (A. A. Burbidge 738) and E. sp. Rudall River (P. G. Wilson
   10512), were segregated from a broadly defined E. tietkensii F.Muell. \&
   Tate by J. Hurter at the Western Australian Herbarium in 2012. Both E.
   sp. Hamersley Range and E. sp. Rudall River are listed as being of
   conservation concern in Western Australia, the former occurring in the
   Pilbara region in areas of prospective interest for mining development.
   We sought to determine whether these phrase-named entities should be
   formally described as new species, using multivariate analyses of
   morphometric and molecular data derived from specimens in the Western
   Australia Herbarium. Eremophila sp. Ruda!! River could not be adequately
   separated from E. tietkensii by either morphological or molecular data,
   and is here included within that species. By contrast, E. sp. Hamersley
   Range and E. sp. Calvert Range are clearly morphologically and
   genetically distinct. We thus describe them here as the new species E.
   naaykensii A.L.Curtis \& K.R.Thiele and E. hurteri A.L.Curtis \&
   K.R.Thiele. The recognition of these taxa will help inform their
   conservation prioritisation and subsequent management.},

Abstract = {Underuse, instead of overuse, is a potential threat to biodiversity in
   semi-natural areas, particularly in East Asia. Due to serious
   depopulation and aging trends in East Asia, including Japan, few people
   are being involved in managing green areas and conserving biodiversity.
   Depending on specific events and age groups that contribute to the
   experience, knowledge, and preferences of citizens, green area
   management and biodiversity conservation activities can be effectively
   conducted through strong collaborations between various stakeholders and
   generations. We aimed to understand the differences in the perceptions
   of citizens, belonging to different generations in the metropolitan
   Nagoya City, towards the Satoyama areas in Japan through an online
   survey. The status of Satoyama areas is reflected by the rare species of
   endangered category II in the Act on Conservation of Endangered Species
   of Wild Fauna and Flora. Analyzing the perceptions revealed gaps in the
   experience, knowledge, and preference between different age groups for
   various management and conservation activities. In addition to the
   intergenerational gaps, gaps between different household income levels
   and the duration of the activities were identified. The results
   indicated that reflecting upon the diverse interests among citizens and
   addressing the causes of the differences is necessary by integrating the
   differences for consensus building among different stakeholders
   belonging to different age and socio-economic groups.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the resilience of agricultural
   landscapes and associated ecosystem services at multiple scales (a farm
   and landscape) in Kyrenia Region of Northern Cyprus. In doing so, the
   key objectives of the study were (a) to design a conceptual framework
   for identifying the key linkages between the resilience of the
   agricultural landscape and farming systems, (b) to determine the major
   suitable resilience assessment principles and relevant indicators for
   both systems, and (c) to measure the resilience of the systems as well
   as to assess their cross-scale linkages. The suitable resilience
   assessment indicators for both systems were developed by reviewing the
   relevant literature. Two social valuation techniques (e.g. a
   multiple-choice questionnaire) were employed to assess the resilience of
   both systems. The participants rated the resilience of the systems and
   their components on a 1-5 scale. The results showed that the ecological
   resilience of the farming system is medium with 3.23 points. The
   resilience of the agricultural landscape system was evaluated within the
   context of three dimensions: agro-ecosystem, the agricultural, and human
   systems. Their resilience was found to be low and ranged between 2.40
   and 2.90 points. The system's resilience was estimated to be low with
   2.68 points. The outcomes of this study are significant in terms of
   helping policy-makers and resource managers to better understand the
   cross-scale linkages between the resilience of the agricultural
   landscape and farming systems to achieve the sustainability of natural
   resources, food production, and community livelihoods in Kyrenia Region
   and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {For the sustainable management of coastal pine forests as green
   infrastructure, the condition of coastal pine forests, including the
   effects of storm surge flooding, must be assessed, and the resulting
   information should be presented to the management entity. Low-altitude
   remote sensing (LARS) using vegetation indices is considered to be an
   effective tool for the rapid assessment of the condition of coastal pine
   forests. This study aims to demonstrate that the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to assess changes in the condition
   of coastal pine forests following a storm surge flooding through the
   analysis of the relationship between the NDVI calculated by LARS and the
   condition of trees surveyed in the field. The study site was a coastal
   pine forest in Osato Matsubara, Kaiyo Town, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan.
   In this forest, a lot of the trees died due to a storm surge flooding
   caused by a typhoon in October 2019. Trees within the study area were
   surveyed to assess their vitality. Vegetation indices were calculated by
   LARS. In the area without storm surge flooding, 90\% of the trees had a
   vitality level of 5 (healthy), whereas in the area with storm surge
   flooding, 67\% had a vitality level of 1 (completely dead). The NDVI was
   low in the area with storm surge flooding, indicating that tree
   mortality due to storm surge flooding can be evaluated by NDVI.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are important multifunctional systems that provide various
   ecological services for animal populations, particularly with regard to
   regulation and support. The biodiversity of wetlands is threatened by
   human activities that cause habitat fragmentation and destruction. The
   international community needs to make efforts to measure habitat quality
   and recognize the value of biodiversity. This study aimed to evaluate
   the value of Nannophya koreana habitat restoration in the Mujechineup
   wetland. First, through a literature review, this study estimated the
   expected ecosystem service value of the Mujechineup wetland compared to
   existing wetlands. The Mujechineup wetland's ecosystem service value
   ranged from a minimum of \$109,296.00 (SD \$32,752.00) to a maximum of
   \$679,457.14 (SD \$4,611,730.90). Second, we quantified the habitat
   quality of the Mujechineup wetland in Ulsan for biodiversity
   measurements using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and
   tradeoffs (InVEST). The analysis showed that there was a difference in
   the quality of the habitat depending on the spatial unit. Samdong-myeon
   was processed for 2 min with a mean value of 0.094. Ulju-gun was
   processed for 1 h 14 min with a mean value of 0.146. In addition, as a
   result of the field survey, the ratio of Hemiptera, Odonata and
   Coleoptera (HOC) groups in the Mujechineup wetland where Nannophya
   koreana lives was more than 50\%, but the ratio of predators was
   approximately 10\% on average. Third, this study investigated the
   willingness to pay to restore the habitat of Nannophya koreana, which
   lives in the Mujechineup wetland. The average amount that people would
   be willing to pay annually for the restoration of the Mujechineup
   wetland was \$33,652. The study found that awareness of the importance
   of Nannophya koreana and the need for restoration of its habitat
   environment was high. These findings can be used to recognize the value
   of the Mujechineup wetland as a habitat for Nannophya koreana and to
   communicate its importance.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in coastal urbanization profoundly impacts various
   environmental components and significantly transforms coastal ecosystems
   to the degree they lose their integrity. Coastal zones are facing
   increasing pressure from socio-economic development and climate change.
   Sustainable coastal planning and management must understand better how
   humans changing the physical environment of coastal areas to present a
   rational and comprehensive direction for development. The purpose of
   this research is to systematically review, with the following aims: (1)
   describe scientific debates on anthropogenic activities on the coastal
   landscape; (2) systematically identify the landscape structure of the
   changing coastal ecosystem; and (3) discuss the consequences of the
   change. Research articles from the database are systematically mapped
   and reviewed to summarize the state of current evidence-based
   information related to the characters and effects of change. The 114
   articles selected indicate that there are numerous adverse actions and
   consequences of anthropogenic landscape change. Humans significantly
   influence the structure of the coastal ecosystem. Consequently, the
   functions of the coastal ecosystem are altered and degraded. This review
   proposed spatial planning guidelines to maintain or restore the
   ecological integrity of coastal development, especially where only small
   portions of formerly intact coastal ecosystems remain.},

Abstract = {The tsunami mitigation strategies are shifting from single to multiple
   defense systems in recent times. In this study, the mitigation effects
   of continuous and discontinuous emergent coastal forest were
   investigated experimentally focused mainly on energy reduction of the
   inundating tsunami current under subcritical flow conditions. To improve
   the effectiveness of the coastal forest, a layer of short submerged
   trees with the varying condition of porosity (P-r = 98\%, 95\%, 91\%,
   and 79\%) was coupled/incorporated and tested with the tall emergent
   trees. The results revealed that the forest in discontinuous placement
   effectively produced resistance to the flow by notably increasing the
   backwater rise in the upstream and reducing the energy of the tsunami
   current in the downstream region, rather than a continuous forest belt.
   The incorporation of short submerged tree layer within an emergent tall
   tree forest further increased the flow resistance by causing a large
   water level difference between the upstream and downstream regions of
   the forest, which consequently resulted in a significant amount of
   energy loss i.e. 30-50\% higher, in comparison to that of single layered
   emergent tree configuration. Moreover, the critical zone of high shear
   stress and large turbulence hydraulic jump formation zone was observed
   to significantly move in the further downstream region for discontinuous
   and layered tree forest configurations, that could possibly save the
   direct collision of water with the ground just behind the forest. The
   outcomes predicted by the statistical analysis approach also showed a
   strong inverse correlation between the energy dissipation of flow and
   forest porosity.},

Abstract = {Regarding planting plans for urban residential green spaces, essential
   issues associated with tree plantings, such as the species ratio,
   density, and cost, have been independently addressed. However, it is
   necessary to explore these issues in an integrated manner for more
   comprehensive and efficient planting plans. This study addresses a
   tree-selection optimization problem incorporating variables for planting
   planning in a mathematical model. Three scenarios are evaluated:
   minimizing costs, maximizing CO2 absorption, and maximizing species
   diversity. The proposed optimal tree selection model is applied to a
   park in an apartment complex. Based on the case study, optimal tree
   species are selected very efficiently to satisfy various objective
   functions. The suggested approach and optimal solutions of this study
   will be helpful in tree planting planning for urban community parks and
   serve as practical guidelines for decision-makers for comprehensive
   urban tree plans, residential land development, and urban planning.},

Abstract = {Spyridium Fenzl is a genus of similar to 45 species endemic to
   south-western and south-eastern Australia. This study provides the most
   comprehensive phylogenies of Spyridium to date, analysing both entire
   chloroplast genomes and the nuclear ribosomal array (185-5.8S-26S).
   There was substantial incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear
   phylogenies, creating phylogenetic uncertainty, but some clear
   relationships and biogeographic patterns could be established. Analyses
   support the monophyly of Spyridium, identifying an early east-west split
   at the base of the nuclear phylogeny and deep divergences of New South
   Wales and Tasmanian endemic clades. We also found evidence of more
   recent dispersal events between eastern and western Australia and
   between Tasmania and the mainland. Eleven taxa were found to be
   monophyletic in the nrDNA phylogeny and two were clearly polyphyletic
   (S. eriocephalum Fenzl and S. phylicoides Reissek). Although the
   polyphyly of S. eriocephalum correlates with the two varieties,
   suggesting distinct taxa, further research is required on S.

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in a communal grazing system
   provides pastoralists with a range of grazing sites to select for their
   livestock. When fencing spatially constrains herds, there is reduced
   access to ecological heterogeneity, which may have a negative impact on
   livestock and the grazing resource. This study investigated temporal and
   spatial changes in stocking densities and distribution within the six
   major vegetation types of the Leliefontein pastoral area in Namaqualand,
   South Africa. This semi-arid, biodiverse area of about 2000 km(2)
   supports a spatially-constrained mobile pastoral system based on small
   stock production. Over the data period from 1999 to 2006, the location
   of 256 small stock herds, their temporal occupancy and herd size were
   used to determine stocking densities within the daily grazing radius of
   herds. These grazing radii were overlaid using GIS to produce stocking
   density distributions over the landscape. The density and location of
   herds were unevenly distributed when assessed monthly and annually.
   Parts of the study area were consistently overstocked whereas others
   remained ungrazed. We argue that the recommendation of fixed stocking
   rates within this variable environment is inappropriate because forage
   availability and quality fluctuate within and between years and within
   drought cycles. We conclude that development interventions should rather
   focus on reducing stocking densities during and after drought periods.
   This would benefit pastoralists through reduced livestock mortalities
   and the vegetation would recover more quickly from the impacts of
   drought.},

Abstract = {Variation in breeding systems between species of the same taxonomic
   group complicates the consistent application of species concepts, and
   perhaps even the logically consistent circumscription of species.
   Several genera of arid-zone ephemerals in the Angianthus clade
   (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae: Gnaphaliinae) contain both outcrossing and
   non-outcrossing species. The latter are recognised by producing an order
   of magnitude fewer pollen grains per anther and an often reduced number
   of corolla lobes, and they are frequently more widespread than are the
   former. In its current taxonomy, the genus Pogonolepis comprises an
   otherwise morphologically indistinguishable pair of one outcrossing and
   one non-outcrossing species. I generated sequence capture data to test
   the genetic segregation of P. stricta and P. muelleriana and the utility
   of sequence capture data for species circumscription and diagnostics.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed the two species to form two specimen
   clades, supporting the current taxonomy. Contrary to expectations,
   non-outcrossing P. muelleriana exhibited lower gene concordance, in line
   with values expected from recombination, as well as higher
   heterozygosity than its outcrossing sister species. More research on the
   breeding system and population structure of the two species may be
   required to explain these results.},

   taxon, M. ``Volcanic Plateau{''}. In this case, niche-modelling data
   mostly do not aid species delimitation, but morphological and genetic
   data provide evidence for recognising the following three species within
   the group: M. brevis and M. glauca (both endemic to New Zealand), and an
   enlarged M. antarctica (native to New Zealand, Campbell Island and
   Chile). Myosotis antarctica is here circumscribed to include M.
   antarctica sens. strict., M. drucei and M. pygmaea. The following two
   allopatric subspecies of M. antarctica are recognised on the basis of
   minor morphological differences: subsp. antarctica (formerly M.
   antarctica from Campbell Island and Chile, M. drucei and M. ``Volcanic
   Plateau{''}) and subsp. traillii Kirk (formerly known by New Zealand
   botanists as M. pygmaea Colenso, an illegitimate name). For all three
   species, which are considered Threatened or At Risk, most of their
   genetic variation is partitioned between rather than within populations,
   meaning that conserving as many populations as possible should be the
   priority to minimise risk of extinction.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {129-135},
Abstract = {Australia's largest land carnivore, the dingo, has been targeted by
   control programs in many agricultural landscapes since European
   settlement because of the judgement that dingoes cause costs to
   producers through the killing of livestock. As Australian pastoralists,
   we challenge the assumption that dingoes will only cause costs to
   producers. Based on our personal experiences and from research, we
   provide an alternative view, namely that in certain circumstances, there
   are major economic and ecological benefits of maintaining dingoes in
   grazing landscapes by controlling the unmanaged grazing pressure. As
   cattle producers, we have obtained significant financial gains for our
   family businesses, and environmental benefits on our properties by
   maintaining dingoes. Dingoes greatly reduce high-density populations of
   larger kangaroo species and some feral animals, especially goats. Such
   unmanaged grazing is persistently identified as a major factor in
   landscape degradation across large areas of Australian rangelands. The
   Australian pastoral industry as a whole, and the government departments
   that support it, need to evaluate, consider and discuss the economic and
   ecological benefits as well as the costs of maintaining dingoes in
   Australian pastoral landscapes.},

Abstract = {Beef producers in the mulga lands of south-western Queensland and
   north-western New South Wales, Australia, face the challenges of
   inherently low productivity and profitability, exacerbated by widespread
   pasture degradation and high climate and market variability. Our
   objective was to use the farm-management economics framework to assess
   the ability of management strategies and investment options to improve
   profitability and build the overall resilience of beef cattle properties
   in the mulga lands. Options were assessed for a hypothetical,
   representative beef cattle property in south-western Queensland (20 000
   ha; initial stocking rate 600 adult equivalents). Firstly, strategies
   were assessed for their ability to improve profitability when operated
   as a beef business. Secondly, two alternative investment options were
   assessed: (1) conversion to rangeland meat goat production; and (2)
   conversion to carbon farming through carbon sequestration. Herd and
   economic modelling software were used to conduct property-level, partial
   discounted cash-flow budgets to assess each strategy over a 30-year
   investment period. Results indicated very limited potential to improve
   the profitability and resilience of an existing beef cattle enterprise
   in the mulga lands. However, full or partial conversion to rangeland
   meat goat production or carbon farming improved property-level returns
   and viability.},

Title = {Loss of grassland ecosystem service values based on potential vegetation
   in China},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {363-375},
Abstract = {Grassland resources in China have diverse categories and span extensive
   areas. Existing studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services
   in China at different scales, but there are few reports on the potential
   loss of grassland ecosystem services in China. On the basis of the
   class-level compatibility of the two existing grassland classification
   systems, this study separately estimated the ecosystem service valves
   (ESVs) of Chinese potential grassland ecosystems (Comprehensive
   Sequential Classification System, CSCS) and existing grassland
   ecosystems (Vegetation Habitatology Classification System, VHCS). In
   addition, we also calculated the loss of ESVs between the two grassland
   classification systems and further analysed the reasons for the loss.
   The results are as follows: (1) the total amount of ESVs provided by the
   existing grassland in China was 64 929.87 x 10(8) Ren Min Bi (RMB) per
   year, in which lowland meadow and alpine meadow provide higher ESVs than
   the other 16 grassland classes; (2) the total ESV of Chinese potential
   grasslands was 83 632.88 x 10(8) RMB per year, of which IE29 (frigid
   temperate humid tundra, alpine meadow) and IF36 (frigid perhumid rain
   tundra, alpine meadow) contributed most to the total ESV (16.9\%); (3)
   the ESVs of grassland in China decreased by 18 703.01 x 10(8) RMB per
   year compared with the potential value; the ESV loss mainly occurred in
   areas where the original grassland decreased and the secondary grassland
   increased; and (4) anthropogenic disturbances such as grazing, felling
   and indiscriminate cultivation and climate change are the main reasons
   for loss of ESV owing to grassland degradation.},

Title = {Predicted effects of simulated ambient warming and moisture on forage
   nutrient quality and community composition in Mongolian an arid
   grassland},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {159-164},
Abstract = {Sustainable forage and livestock production in grazed grasslands are
   threatened by global climatic change. In this study, we examined how
   forage quality at the species and community levels in Mongolian drylands
   might be affected by warming and additional moisture. Four different
   treatments, a control, open-top chambers (OTCs) only, OTCs with heaters,
   and OTCs with additional watering, were set up in the field, and air and
   soil temperature and soil moisture were monitored. A vegetation survey
   was conducted and plants were harvested during summer, 1 and 2 years
   after experimental treatments were established. The harvested plant
   samples were separated into a dominant species (Stipa) or `other
   species', and analysed to determine acid detergent fibre (ADF) and in
   vitro dry-matter digestibility (IVDMD). ADF was measured with the
   detergent method and the digestibility with the pepsin-cellulase assay.
   Overall, the warming treatments alone (OTC and OTC with heater)
   increased ADF 10\% and 5\% more than did the control at the species and
   community levels respectively, and decreased digestibility 12\% and 11\%
   below the control at the community level. Changes in plant nutritional
   value may have occurred as a result of changes in plant structure for
   some or all the plant species monitored, and an indirect effect of the
   shift in botanical species composition owing to warming. Unlike moist
   grassland, grass nutrition in arid grasslands was sensitive to
   treatments associated with the predicted effects of global warming as
   the results of changes in plant nutrition. It is therefore highly
   possible that Mongolian livestock production will be negatively affected
   as a result of ongoing global warming.},

Abstract = {Ornamental grasses are often used in gardens to improve biodiversity and
   as additional aesthetical resources. However, their use in green roofs
   (GR) and living walls (LW) is not so widespread and it has not been
   studied extensively. The aim of this work is to assess the performance
   of seven grass species (Imperata cylindrica `Red Baron', Acorus
   gramineus, Stipa tenuissima `Pony Fails', Carex flagellifera `Bronzita',
   Carex oshimensis `Evergold', Uncinia rubra `Everflame' and Miscanthus
   sinensis) for their use in GR and LW. The growth of the plants was
   evaluated (i.e. biomass production, dimensions), as well as their visual
   quality and survival. C. flagellifera and C. oshimensis showed coverage
   levels greater than 75\% and good visual quality, while A. gramineus
   reached 55-60\%. I. cylindrica and M. sinensis showed coverages slightly
   below 50\% in the LW, however, both performed well in the GR, though
   with a lower visual quality. U. rubra did not develop well, reaching the
   lowest coverage (below 45\%) but maintaining a high visual quality. S.
   tenuissima also attained low coverage in the LW and presented high
   mortality, especially in the GR. In LW, C. oshimensis stood out in
   flowering, while S. tenuissima showed the highest flowering rate in GR.
   The species should be selected considering their characteristics and
   performance in order to achieve a correct appearance and development.
   Interspecific interactions are especially important in LW, as species
   with upward growth should be placed above species with fallen leaves,
   not below.},

Abstract = {The pond smelt Hypomesus nipponensis and Japanese icefish Salangichthys
   microdon are economically important fishery resources in Japan. The
   catching of these fish species has decreased owing to environmental
   pollution and habitat loss caused by human impacts. We developed
   species-specific primer-probe sets to detect and quantify environmental
   DNA (eDNA) in these fish species. The primer-probe sets were specific to
   each target species with the detection limits of two (H. nipponensis)
   and one (S. microdon) copies per reaction, sufficient for eDNA analysis
   in the field. Using these assays, the eDNA was detected with a high
   probability (100\% and 86\% for H. nipponensis and S. microdon,
   respectively) at the sites where each fish species was captured by a
   cast net survey in the Hirata-Funagawa River (one of the inflowing
   rivers of Lake Shinji, Shimane Prefecture, Japan), where it was
   frequently detected without cast net capture. The eDNA was detected in
   S. microdon a little earlier than in H. nipponensis, and the eDNA
   concentrations of both species gradually decreased after peaking in July
   and reached negligible levels by October. The utility of the assays for
   estimating the seasonal appearances/disappearances of both species in
   this river was demonstrated. The species-specific primer-probe sets of
   the eDNA-based method represent a potentially useful monitoring tool
   that requires minimal labor and time and could be useful for managing H.
   nipponensis and S. microdon fisheries in the future.},

Abstract = {Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) of rangeland ecosystems is
   driven by interactions among multiple environmental factors. This study
   aimed to model the combined effects of precipitation, elevation, and
   soil conditions on ANPP variation along an elevation gradient. Ground
   surveys and vegetation sampling were conducted in 2016 through 26
   sampling sites along two elevation profiles in the rangelands of
   Moghan-Sabalan, Ardabil Province, Iran. At each sampling site, the ANPP
   of each plant functional type (PFT; grasses, forbs, and shrubs) was
   measured, and soil samples were taken from 0-15 to 15-30 cm depth.
   Regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to
   investigate the factors affecting both total and PFT ANPP. Soil
   variables were the best predictors of grass (R-2 = 0.51), forb (R-2 =
   0.61), shrub (R-2 = 0.71), and total (R-2 = 0.76) ANPP. The SEM
   interpretation suggested that precipitation is the most important direct
   driver of ANPP with R-2 values of 0.20 (Total), 0.30 (Shrubs), 0.26
   (Grasses), and 0.10 (Forbs). Whereas soil factors were good predictors
   in the regression models, the SEM models demonstrated that soil factors
   were generally unimportant compared with climate, likely owing to the
   close links between soil-forming factors and climate. The results make
   it possible to estimate annual ANPP combined with climate forecasts and
   leads to more accurate estimates of future grazing capacity by policy
   makers and stakeholders.},

Title = {The impact of tree removal on standing grass biomass, seedling
   establishment and growth of woody species},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-32},
Abstract = {The removal of trees in rangelands can create gaps and lead to increased
   grass production that could suppress subsequent tree seedling
   establishment and growth. However, gaps can also enhance the growth of
   remaining trees. We conducted a field experiment at two savanna sites
   with different soil texture and woody species. We used 24 plots at each
   site to determine the effect of tree-removal intensities (0\%, 10\%,
   20\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%) on grass production, tree-seedling
   establishment and growth, and growth of the remaining large trees. Site
   I was on previously cultivated severely-eroded clay-dominated soils,
   encroached by a monospecific stand of Vachellia tortilis. Site 2 had
   never been cultivated, and was on sandy soils with several woody
   species. At Site 1, 75 and 100\% tree removal significantly reduced
   standing grass biomass towards the end of the first growing season, with
   no differences towards the end of the second season. At Site 2, tree
   removal significantly increased standing grass biomass. There was no
   significant effect of tree removal on tree seedling establishment at
   Site 1, but at Site 2 tree removal had a significantly negative effect
   on overall tree seedling establishment. At both sites, there were no
   significant differences in tree seedling growth. Moderate (50\%) to high
   (75\%) removal of trees had a positive effect on the growth of remaining
   large trees at both study sites. We found that tree seedling
   establishment could be affected by the level of grass biomass following
   tree removal, but other factors including soil erosion are also
   important considerations. Reduced tree competition facilitates growth of
   remaining large trees. An implication of these findings is that,
   regardless of the substantial costs of woody plant control, the recovery
   of key ecosystem services such as an increased forage production may not
   be realised. However, we recognise that this may be system-specific.},

Title = {An objective prioritisation method for agriculture RD\&E},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {149-158},
Abstract = {We aimed to develop and test a relatively objective method for rapidly
   and accurately assessing the priority for research of interventions
   tendered as potential solutions to a prevailing problem in agriculture.
   In this test, our method aimed to direct research of evidenced-based
   strategies to ameliorate consistently high rates of foetal and calf loss
   experienced in northern Australia's beef herd. Detailed reviews of
   factors affecting foetal and calf loss and potential solutions were
   conducted. A simple economic analysis, based on rating management
   interventions for their impact on earnings before interest and tax, was
   then developed to enable rapid simultaneous business-impact comparison
   of multiple options. If the outcome value for an option is negative, it
   suggests that the option is less profitable than is prevailing practice,
   if approximately zero, it suggests that the option is very marginal, and
   more positive values suggest a higher potential benefit. The values
   obtained were further analysed by rating for incidence and
   researchability to derive research priority. This sequence of activities
   was conducted by peers representing a broad spectrum of beef business
   (managing an estimated 0.4 million cattle), science and agribusiness
   representatives from across northern Australia. A sensitivity analysis
   demonstrated that the method was robust in ranking both business impact
   and research priority. Ten foetal and calf-loss minimisation
   interventions were rated by producer and agribusiness representatives
   and the project team as a high priority for business. Four of these were
   excluded because of low incidence or low researchability, leaving six
   rated as having highest priority for research. Informal feedback from
   many participants indicated high satisfaction with the proposed method.
   The conclusion was that this method, with suggested variations,
   successfully discriminated priority for a large range of potential
   interventions for calf loss research, development and extension (RD\&E).
   The method described could readily supplant commonly used more
   subjective methods and be used to assess priority for RD\&E of other
   issues for multiple agricultural commodities, as well as simply for
   rapid assessment of management options within a production enterprise.},

Title = {Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of understorey biomass in
   semi-arid woodlands of south-eastern Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-59},
Abstract = {When managing grazing pressure for conservation, understanding forage
   dynamics is essential. In south-eastern Australia, ongoing grazing is
   inhibiting regeneration in several semi-arid woodland communities.
   Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest, 1817)) have
   been identified as a key component of total grazing pressure. They are
   thought to switch from grass to lower-quality browse, including tree
   seedlings, when grass biomass falls below 400 kg ha(-1). One static
   threshold may not adequately capture the spatial and temporal hazard
   associated with kangaroo grazing, and this study aimed to explore how
   grassy biomass varies across a case-study landscape. Understorey biomass
   and species composition data were collected in the field on seven
   occasions between December 2016 and May 2019. We used Generalised Linear
   Mixed Models (GLMMs) to describe the influence of environmental and
   herbivory variables on total (live and dead) understorey, live
   understorey, and grass (live and dead) biomass. Canopy cover showed the
   strongest influence on understorey biomass, with more biomass found in
   open sites than in woodland. Understorey biomass levels were lowest in
   summer and autumn. Grass biomass, in particular, fell below the 400 kg
   ha(-1) forage-switch threshold in wooded areas during this time. We
   anticipate that an increased understanding of understorey biomass
   dynamics will inform managers as to when and where to focus management
   efforts to promote regeneration and sustained recovery of these
   semi-arid woodlands. Results of this study suggest that conducting
   management efforts before the summer/autumn decline in understorey
   biomass, particularly in woodlands, is critical in reducing the browsing
   risk to seedlings.},

   south-western China (e.g. Loess Plateau, Qinling-Huaihe belt, Nanling
   Mountains, Jiangnan hills, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Tarim Basin). From
   the 2030s to the 2080s, SRPV exhibited characteristics of expansion and
   migration to the north under RCP scenarios. The distributed area of SRPV
   increased with increased radiation emission intensity. These results
   both further expand the research on potential vegetation using the CSCS,

Title = {Microbial nutrient limitation in tropical forest soils determined using
   the V-T model contradicts the traditional view that C is the major
   limiting element},

Abstract = {Traditionally, microbial activity in tropical forest soils has been
   thought to be limited predominantly by carbon (C) availability,
   prompting investigations of whether phosphorus (P) is a stronger
   limiting factor (next to C) than other nutrients. However, a recently
   developed enzyme vector model has sometimes shown that P or nitrogen
   (N), but not C, is the predominant limiting factor, likely due to biased
   C vs. N vs. P limitation thresholds. In the latest update of this
   approach (the V-T model) this problem was addressed by revising the
   threshold, or balance point, that represents the enzymatic ratio at
   which microbial metabolism is not limited by nutrients. However, it
   remains unclear whether results obtained using the V-T model are
   consistent with the traditional view that C is the predominant limiting
   element for soil microbial activity. In this short note, I analyzed the
   microbial resource limitations of tropical forest soils using the V-T
   model approach based on previously published global data, and discussed
   the consistency of the results with the traditional view. The V-T model
   results showed that up to 78 \% of the data indicated that P, and not C,
   was the limiting element, contradicting the traditional view. This
   finding may have been the result of a bias in the balance point toward C
   limitation (i.e., the balance point, or threshold, used for determining
   microbial nutrient limitation is under C-limited condition, rather than
   under no nutrient limitation), resulting in underestimation of C
   limitation. The present study suggest that the V-T model requires
   further improvement; however, the traditional view of C limitation of
   soil microbial activity is also poorly supported, and further direct
   observation is needed.},

Abstract = {A new Rafflesia population was found in Naha Jaley, Sarawak. in 2012.
   This study aimed to identify this Rafflesia species and investigate its
   bud growth. First, we described the flower characteristics and compared
   them with Rafflesia keithii and R. tucm-mudae, which are candidate
   species for the flower. Also, we investigated the phylogenetic position
   of this Refflesia within Rafflesiaceae using DNA analysis. To estimate
   bud growth curve, we observed bud development from April 2013 to
   November 2013 in the field. Based on morphological comparisons and
   phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed the newly discovered population of
   the Rafflesia at Naha Jaley was R. turn-mudae, which is the new locality
   of the species at the most Eastern side of the known distribution for
   this species. The results indicated that absolute growth rate was
   greater in larger buds. We also estimated that it took a year to bloom
   from the initial bud stage. The mortality in one of our sites was very
   high, with more than 80 \% of buds dead prior to flower opening. This
   flower would be vulnerable to extinction due to their extraordinary
   characteristics and anthropogenetic effects. Finally. we discussed how
   Rafflesia populations in Naha Jaley can be conserved both in-situ and
   ex-situ.},

Abstract = {Woody plant encroachment threatens herbaceous plant productivity in many
   rangelands globally. We evaluated the impact of bush clearing on grass
   tiller, leaf and biomass production, and tuft sizes in the Kgomo-kgomo
   and Makapaanstad rangelands in North-West Province, South Africa. In
   each rangeland, the number of tillers and leaves, tuft sizes and biomass
   of eight dominant grass species were recorded in bush-cleared and
   uncleared treatments. The treatment and species interacted significantly
   (P < 0.001) for tiller and leaf production and tuft sizes. Bush clearing
   increased tiller production of bunch grasses but not stoloniferous
   grasses. At Kgomo-kgomo, bunch grasses (Panicum maximum (Jacq.) and
   Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy] had three to six times more
   tillers and leaves per plant in the cleared than uncleared treatment. At
   Makapaanstad, only annual bunch grasses {[}Brachiaria eruciformis
   (Sibth. \& Sm.) Griseb and Tragus berteronianus (Schult.)] attained
   twice as many tillers and leaves per plant in the cleared compared to
   uncleared treatment. Biomass was 1776 +/- 159 and 696 +/- 159 g m(-2) in
   cleared and uncleared treatments respectively at Kgomo-kgomo and 1358
   +/- 258 and 1089 +/- 258 g m(-2) at Makapaanstad. The tufts of bunch
   grasses were nearly twice as large in the cleared compared with the
   uncleared treatment at Kgomo-kgomo, whereas only stoloniferous grass
   tufts increased at Makapaanstad. Overall, bush clearing improved grass
   productivity and performance, but the responses varied by species.},

Title = {Assessing the long-term impact of land-use and land-cover changes on
   soil erosion in Ethiopia's Chemoga Basin using the RUSLE model},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {461-475},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil erosion is one of the primary causes of environmental degradation
   worldwide. The Chemoga Basin-the highlands region in northwestern
   Ethiopia-has experienced accelerated soil erosion due to changes in
   land-use and land-cover (LULC) in recent decades. The Revised Universal
   Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used to quantify the impact of LULC
   changes on soil loss in the study area. Satellite images from 1987 and
   2017 were used to characterize the spatial patterns of LULC changes. All
   RUSLE factors were mapped on a 30 m x 30 m grid to reflect the natural
   and environmental conditions of the study area. An expansion of
   agricultural lands occurred between 1987 and 2017, while the area of
   natural vegetation cover such as woodlands and grasslands declined.
   Forest cover has recovered in recent years as a result of afforestation
   and eucalyptus plantations. Reflecting LULC changes, the total soil loss
   in the study area was estimated at 2,087,894 t year(-1) in 1987, which
   increased to 2,112,093 t year(-1) in 2017. Agricultural lands accounted
   for 89.3\% and 90.1\% of the total soil loss in 1987 and 2017,
   respectively. The results showed that slope gradient and elevation are
   important factors in agricultural land conversion, and thereby influence
   soil erosion. An understanding of the impact of LULC changes on soil
   erosion potential is crucial for establishing government policy and
   action plans to conserve natural resources in erosion-prone areas of the
   Ethiopian highlands.},

Abstract = {The decline of freshwater flora due to alteration, reclamation and
   trophic perturbation of lowland wetlands is among the most relevant
   issues in biological conservation. The contribution of heavily modified
   water bodies (HMWBs) in preserving plant diversity is notable, but the
   underlying ecological mechanisms are not completely explored. To
   contribute to this debate and expand the knowledge on the role of HMWBs
   in maintaining wetland biodiversity in overexploited agroecosystems, a
   canal network of about 1150 km (SE Po valley, N-Italy) was analysed to
   study the geographical patterns of riparian flora and plant communities,
   and their land use and hydrochemical drivers. A systematic sampling
   procedure was adopted by randomly selecting 96 transects (10 m(2)) along
   79 drainage canals. Additionally, 22 transects were sampled for water
   quality evaluation. Flora was characterised based on species richness
   and presence of threatened, alien and invasive species. We also studied
   the contribution of land use and water quality in explaining plant
   richness and composition. Slope and aspect of canals do not
   significantly affect plant species composition, whereas the << proximity
   to protected areas >> seems to have a negative influence. Both
   threatened and alien plants richness decrease approaching protected
   areas. Among land use types, only agro-zootechnical settlements
   influence plant species composition, favoring nitrophilous species, as
   demonstrated by water parameters (the spatial patterns of nitrophilous
   species mirrored the progressive worsening of canal waters). This work
   confirms the key role of HMWBs in sustaining plant species diversity in
   oversimplified landscapes, highlighting complex regulation mechanisms
   that need further investigations.},

Abstract = {The spread of alien aquatic plants can disrupt freshwater ecosystems.
   Species distribution models are useful tools for managing biological
   invasions. This study uses MaxEnt models incorporating land cover and
   meteorological data to predict areas in the Kanto region that are at
   high risk of invasion by three alien aquatic plants (water speedwell,
   Veronica anagallis-aquatica, parrot's feather Myriophyllum aquaticum,
   and Senegal tea plant Gymnocoronis spilanthoides). The Kanto region
   encompasses the Tokyo metropolitan area and Kanto plain, which is the
   largest plain in Japan. The potential invasion risk map shows lowland
   alluvial zones, especially along rivers that are at high risk of
   invasion by the three alien aquatic plants. The top three highest
   environmental variables were where the areas of rivers and lakes, Kira's
   warmth index and building areas contributed toward the models. The
   results of the MaxEnt models are consistent with the habitat preferences
   of the three aquatic plant species; they typically inhabit slow-running
   or stagnant waters and are tolerant of eutrophication. The risk of
   invasion by V. anagallis-aquatica upstream tended to be higher than by
   M. aquaticum or G. spilanthoides because V. anagallis-aquatica can adapt
   to a lotic environment.},

Abstract = {Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict.
   They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of
   rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing
   excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and
   environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to
   pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and
   intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these
   competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland
   grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is
   largely under the control of the people who manage the business.
   However, there are significant external influences that can impede
   progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this
   paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional
   experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental
   sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing
   enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial
   and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry,
   and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially
   antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude
   with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve
   (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Diet quality, liveweight change and responses to N supplements by cattle

Abstract = {Experiments during 4 years examined the diets selected, growth, and
   responses to N supplements by Bos indicus-cross steers grazing
   summer-rainfall semi-arid C4 Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) rangelands
   at a site in north-western Queensland, Australia. Paddock groups of
   steers were not supplemented (T-NIL), or were fed a non-protein N
   (T-NPN) or a cottonseed meal (T-CSM) supplement. In Experiment 1, young
   and older steers were measured during the late dry season (LDS) and the
   rainy season (RS), while steers in Experiments 2-4 were measured through
   the annual cycle. Because of severe drought the measurements during
   Experiment 3 annual cycle were limited to T-NIL steers. Pasture
   availability and species composition were measured twice annually. Diet
   was measured at 1-2 week intervals using near infrared spectroscopy of
   faeces (F.NIRS). Annual rainfalls (1 July-30 June) were 42-68\% of the
   long-term average (471 mm), and the seasonal break ranged from 17
   December to 3 March. There was wide variation in pasture, diet (crude
   protein (CP), DM digestibility (DMD), the CP to metabolisable energy
   (CP/ME) ratio) and steer liveweight change (LWC) within and between
   annual cycles. High diet quality and steer liveweight (LW) gain during
   the RS declined progressively through the transition season (TS) and
   early dry season (EDS), and often the first part of the LDS. Steers
   commenced losing LW as the LDS progressed. In Experiments 1 and 2 where
   forbs comprised <= 15 g/kg of the pasture sward, steers selected
   strongly for forbs so that they comprised 117-236 g/kg of the diet.
   However, in Experiments 3 and 4 where forbs comprised substantial
   proportions of the pasture (173-397 g/kg), there were comparable
   proportions in the diet (300-396 g/kg). With appropriate stocking rates
   the annual steer LW gains were acceptable (121-220 kg) despite the low
   rainfall. The N supplements had no effect on steer LW during the TS and
   the EDS, but usually reduced steer LW loss by 20-30 kg during the LDS.
   Thus during low rainfall years in Mitchell grass pastures there were
   substantial LW responses by steers to N supplements towards the end of
   the dry season when the diet contained c. c. <7.0 g CP/MJ ME.},

Title = {Some soil factors constraining buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.)
   seedling growth rate across a range of acid red Kandosols in Queensland,
   Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {77-95},
Abstract = {Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) has passionate grazing industry
   advocates and biodiversity conservation detractors around the world due
   to its ability to readily establish and spread on certain soil types. A
   more detailed understanding of what soil factors influence the success
   of seedling establishment will offer guidance to anyone wishing to
   either encourage or discourage buffel grass establishment in a
   particular area. Twenty soils from land types where buffel grass had a
   varied history of successful establishment and persistence in south
   western Queensland, Australia were assessed in a pot trial for their
   influence on early seedling growth rate of buffel grass. Some currently
   had buffel grass growing there. Aspects of the chemistry of each soil
   were compared against the rate of seedling growth of buffel grass cv.
   Biloela that was sown with or without a phosphate coating on the seed.
   Available soil phosphorus had a major influence on seedling growth in
   the absence of a phosphate fertiliser coating, but levels of other
   factors such as exchangeable aluminium and calcium were also critical.
   Several multiple regression equations with differing soil parameters
   included proved equally good at predicting buffel seedling growth but
   they did not greatly improve on the strong correlation with available
   soil phosphorus. This seemed due to the interchangeability amongst soil
   pH, cation exchange capacity and degree of clay as controlling factors,
   over and above available phosphorus. Thus, where available soil
   phosphorus is marginal for rapid buffel seedling growth, soil pH,
   exchangeable aluminium and total exchangeable cation levels could have
   similar importance in determining whether buffel grass colonised or
   failed to gain a foothold in that area.},

Title = {Prospects for sustainable use of the pastoral areas of Australia's
   southern rangelands: a synthesis},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {185-209},
Abstract = {There is growing recognition of the need to achieve land use across the
   southern Australian rangelands that accommodates changing societal
   preferences and ensures the capacity of future generations to satisfy
   their own preferences. This paper considers the prospects for
   sustainable use of the pastoral lands based either on continued grazing
   or emerging, alternative land uses. After an overview of the southern
   rangelands environment, the status of the pastoral industry, its
   environmental impacts, and key issues for pastoral management, we
   propose four principles and 19 associated guidelines for sustainable
   pastoralism. Although some continued withdrawal of land from pastoralism
   is anticipated, we expect that pastoralism will continue throughout much
   of the region currently grazed, particularly in the higher rainfall
   environments in the east. Within these areas, sustainable pastoral land
   use should be achievable by the application of four broad management
   principles, as follows: (1) manage grazing within a risk management
   framework based on the concept of tactical grazing, (2) develop
   infrastructure to allow best management of both domestic and
   non-domestic grazing pressure, (3) incorporate management of invasive
   native scrub, where required, into overall, ongoing property management
   and (4) manage grazing to enhance biodiversity conservation at landscape
   scale. Application of these principles and guidelines will require the
   development of appropriate policy settings, particularly in relation to
   kangaroo management, climate change, and natural resource governance,
   together with innovative approaches to research, development and
   extension. Policy development will also be required if the new industry
   of carbon sequestration is to deliver socio-ecological benefits without
   perverse outcomes. Other emerging industries based on renewable energy
   or ecosystem services appear to have considerable potential, with little
   risk of adverse ecological consequences.},

Title = {Social-identity dynamics in rural communities: a motive for resistance
   to change},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {299-307},
Abstract = {This research found that rural social resistance to change and newcomers
   can be explained in part by the influence of social-set membership.
   Eighty-nine interviews were conducted in two Australian inland rural
   communities with population <2000 and analysed with a recognised
   cultural dynamics framework. This found attachment to local social
   identity, social hierarchy and cultural norms that represented social
   power. Established residents defended the status quo when valued facets
   of social identity were perceived to be threatened, resisting efforts to
   introduce change. Persons representing a challenge to established local
   identity norms could be socially undermined and censured to preserve the
   power of dominant social sets, defending their preferred narratives and
   norms. Understanding social identity influences can explain rural
   communities' tendency to conservatism, why newcomers and new ideas are
   often derided, ignored or attacked. It can explain the motives for
   negative social capital and suggests social identity as a factor in
   small town newcomer business failure, and resistance to new knowledge
   transfer and practice adoption. Welcome and induction to local social
   codes is critical to newcomer integration. Outsiders and newcomers may
   meet discretely with like-minded or similar persons to safely fulfil
   social needs or influence as a social minority, providing support to
   their own unique group. Where residents cannot find inclusion, they may
   disengage. Understanding social identity can provide insights for
   community leaders, development practitioners, extension officers and
   newcomers struggling to serve and innovate in rural and rangelands
   communities.},

Pages = {339-352},
Abstract = {To protect the grassland ecosystem's security, and coordinate the
   utilisation of grassland resources, explicitly estimating the response
   of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of 10 grassland groups to future
   climate change is necessary. Based on the Comprehensive and Sequential
   Classification System (CSCS) and modified Carnegie Ames Stanford
   Approach (CASA) model, in conjunction with four Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the response of
   China's grassland NPP to climate change was simulated and estimated.
   Results showed that: (1) the simulation accuracy of modified CASA model
   (R-2 = 0.65) is 34\% higher than that of CASA model, indicating that the
   modified CASA was suitable for estimating grassland NPP in China; (2)
   annual mean NPP and total NPP (2001-18) were 138.4 g C m(-2) year(-1)
   and 495.7 T g C, respectively; compared with the period 2001 18, NPP
   during the 2050 under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 were
   predicted with increases of 34.8\%, 35.9\%, 34.9\% and 35.8\%,
   respectively; and (3) from the present-day to the 2050, the NPP of Warm
   desert exhibited the largest increase (73.2-76.3\%), while that of
   Tundra and alpine grassland the smallest (1.3-1.6\%). These differences
   in NPP increase likely lead to differences in grassland carrying
   capacity. To respond to the impact of future climate change on
   grassland, grassland classification management strategies according to
   different groups should be implemented as grassland NPP changes
   differently in different grassland groups.},

Title = {Breaking the wildfire cycle: progressive fire management can shift fire
   regimes and improve ecosystem condition. A case study from a large
   conservation reserve in northern Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},

Volume = {44},

Pages = {279-288},
Abstract = {Extensive late dry season fires in northern Australia have long been
   considered detrimental to biodiversity conservation, pastoral production
   and other cultural and landscape values. Fire management programs in
   these landscapes typically aim to shift the fire regime from wildfires
   occurring predominately in the late dry season (LDS), when they tend to
   be extensive and destructive, to prescribed burns in the early dry
   season (EDS), when fires are generally smaller and less intensive. The
   intent is to create heterogeneity in vegetation age classes, reduce the
   scale of LDS fires and, in doing so, retain long-unburnt vegetation, a
   critical asset for biodiversity in a flammable landscape. Boodjamulla
   National Park, in Queensland's Gulf Country, experienced a cycle of
   large LDS wildfires every 5 years for most of its history as a pastoral
   property and park until a progressive EDS burning program was
   introduced. Although there is limited information for defining the ideal
   fire regime for spinifex (Triodia spp.) rangelands, this program has
   improved a range of spatial metrics which the Queensland Parks and
   Wildlife Service (QPWS) believes can only benefit biodiversity; these
   include decreased annual and LDS area burnt; a greater number of small
   burnt patches; shorter distances between recently burnt and long-unburnt

Abstract = {Rangelands are some of the most widely distributed ecosystems on Earth,
   covering similar to 20\% of the land surface area. As an important part
   of terrestrial ecosystems, accurate rangeland classification plays a
   crucial role in carbon cycling, biodiversity conservation and forage
   production. The Comprehensive Sequential Classification System of
   Rangeland (CSCSR), a well accepted rangeland classification system, has
   attracted global attention and has undergone further development. This
   paper reviews the origin and development of the CSCSR and its
   application in the fields of climate change, rangeland and livestock
   production, even rangeland ecosystem services in detail.},

Abstract = {Trunk biomass in a forest is necessary information for good forest
   management. The trunk biomass is usually calculated by an allometric
   formula using trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (TH)
   as non-destructive input values. To confirm the measurement errors of a
   backpack LiDAR system in forest inventory, DBH and TH values obtained by
   the LiDAR system were compared with conventional survey data from
   Japanese plantation forests. Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and
   Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) form large plantation forests in
   Japan. The backpack LiDAR system was used in five plots of these
   species-dominated forests (20 m x 20 m for each plot). The tree
   detection rates were 100\% in all plots. The relative RMSEs of the DBH
   and TH estimations ranged from 6.8 to 10.0\% and 5.4-10.1\%,
   respectively. The negative biases indicated underestimation of DBH and
   TH. The DBH and TH results of the present study were close to those
   obtained using the backpack LiDAR approach in previous studies. The
   paper demonstrated a fully automated solution for measuring DBH and TH
   using the backpack LiDAR system. The solution showed that the system has
   a distinct capability as an efficient and practical tool for forest
   inventory and management.},

Abstract = {Seagrasses are among the most important ecosystems of continental and
   island coastal waters globally. Analyses of the species diversity,
   structure, and distribution mapping of seagrass communities provide a
   scientific basis for seagrass conservation and development and
   protection of the marine environment. The application of remote sensing,
   especially using very high-resolution remote sensing data, in mapping
   seagrass distribution confers high accuracy and detailed results. The
   distribution of seagrass communities and benthic biomes typical of Nam
   Yet Island, Truong Sa Archipelago, Vietnam was mapped using object-based
   classification of Pleiades satellite imagery with four spectral bands
   (red, blue, green, and near-infrared) and the Green-Blue Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index, combined with handheld positioning devices
   (total field samples 100, overall accuracy 91\%, kappa coefficient =
   0.88). Besides, by sampling and measurement in the field, two seagrass
   species, Thalassia hemprichii and Halophila ovalis were identified with
   the same structure, density, and biomass in the northern and southern
   parts of the island. The application of high-resolution remote sensing
   images combined with field surveys contributes to improving the accuracy
   of seagrass distribution maps as well as benthic biome ones for shallow
   sea areas. Establishing a seagrass distribution map and assessing the
   diversity of seagrass is the basis for the conservation and development
   of the current seagrass community at Nam Yet Island.},

Title = {Weak negative responses of spider diversity to short-term `kraaling'},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-75},
Abstract = {The influence of short-duration, concentrated kraaling (enclosure) has
   been documented for plants, wildlife, and macro-invertebrates. However,
   limited information is available on its impact on ground-dwelling
   spiders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of
   short-duration kraaling, time since cattle removal, and microhabitat
   variables on spider assemblages in Matabeleland North Province,
   Zimbabwe. We used a matched-pair and space for time design (inside vs
   outside previously kraaled inclusions) across 11 sites, using four
   cattle herds (H-1, H-6, H-7 and H-Nguni). Spiders were sampled in the
   early and late rainy season with pitfall traps left open for 14-day
   sampling periods and emptied twice in each period. We captured 634
   spiders, comprising 63 species in 44 genera and 18 families. The most
   abundant family was Lycosidae (37\%; 16 spp.), followed by Gnaphosidae
   (15\%; 10 spp.) and Salticidae (14.5\%; 7 spp.). Generalised linear
   mixed models showed that generic richness was greater in sites with more
   bare ground. However, this effect was reversed in previously kraaled
   sites, and was particularly evident for spider abundance that responded
   negatively relative to unkraaled sites. Furthermore, with a U-shaped
   recovery, generic richness increased with time since kraaling.
   Model-based multivariate models showed that short-duration kraaling had
   a significant impact on spider assemblage structure, but this impact was
   relatively small compared with the effect of seasonality. Most of the
   species that made significant contributions to this multivariate
   response were less abundant in kraaled sites. Spider diversity,
   therefore, had a weak negative response to short-term kraaling. However,
   these impacts should also be assessed at broader scales, including areas
   where cattle go to graze during the day.},

Title = {Response of species abundance distribution pattern of alpine meadow
   community to sampling scales},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-24},
Abstract = {To analyse the variation of species abundance distribution (SAD)
   patterns with scale, and consider its formation mechanism and ecological
   process in alpine meadow in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China,
   study areas were established, nine permanent plots were randomly
   selected, and 72 quadrats were investigated. Four diversity indices were
   selected, including species richness, the Margalef, Shannon-Wiener and
   Simpson indices and relative importance values to quantify community
   assembly and biodiversity. Species accumulation curves were used to
   describe the SADs of the alpine meadow, and three model types used to
   fit the SADs. The results showed the following: (I) the Cyperaceae
   families were the respective dominance family in alpine meadow in the
   eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China; (2) at sampling scales from 0.25
   to 2 m(2), the total species richness and diversity indices increased;
   (3) total SADs were scale-dependent; the statistical model could not fit
   the SADs; the neutral theory model could explain SADs patterns at
   smaller spatial scales (0.25-I m(2)), and the niche process gradually
   replaced the neutral process in importance and became the main mechanism
   for determining SADs with the increase of sampling scales (1.25-2 m(2));
   (4) for common species, the niche model (geometric series model) could
   fit the SAD of common species at different sampling scales, which
   indicates that the niche process is the main mechanism to determine the
   SAD of common species; and (5) for rare species, with the change of
   sampling scale, the fitting model of rare species is different, which
   indicates that the SAD of rare species is affected by a variety of
   uncertain factors. In general, niche differentiation processes had a
   major effect on the biodiversity patterns of alpine meadow in
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

   Compensation and Award Policy in China: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Since implementation of its first phase, the Grassland Ecological
   Compensation and Award Policy (GECAP; 2011-2015) has significantly
   influenced participants' livelihoods in China.
   Willingness-to-participate (WTP) is an important component of successful
   policy implementation. The effects of influential factors on herders'
   WTP have received considerable research effort, although no systematic
   literature review or quantitative analysis has been conducted to provide
   evidence-based policy insights. Focusing on 3405 observations extracted
   from 13 empirical studies, this research conducted a meta-analysis and
   aggregated the effects of factors affecting Chinese herders' WTP in the
   GECAP. The study also analysed the heterogeneity in influential factors
   and its sources. Factors increasing herders' WTP included a higher
   formal education level, a higher farm income from raising livestock,
   access to larger grassland area, improved grassland condition, and
   better policy understanding. The cumulative effects of the number of
   livestock and grassland area on herders' WTP had increased since the
   policy was implemented. We examined publication bias that may arise from
   research with favourable results being more likely to be published and
   found that publication bias was statistically insignificant for the
   selected case studies. However, we found significant heterogeneity in
   household income and number of livestock. The sources of heterogeneity
   included regional differences, publication year, and sampling method.
   Future policy modification and formulation should better incentivise
   active participation of herders by targeting specific pastoral regions
   and herder groups at certain income levels and/or herd size.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of above-ground biomass in semi-arid rangelands},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-175},
Abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB), as a key biophysical and functional
   parameter of rangeland ecosystems, plays an important role in ecosystem
   carbon (C) stocks. The aim of this study was to explore the important
   environmental drivers of AGB in an arid rangeland by using structural
   equation modelling (SEM). Vegetation and soil (physical and chemical
   properties) were sampled using randomised-systematic methods within
   sampling plots. The topographic (elevation, slope, aspect, hillshade
   (i.e. a technique for showing the topographical shape of hills and
   mountains to indicate relative slopes and mountain ridges)) and climatic
   (mean temperature (MT), mean precipitation (MP), actual
   evapo-transpiration (AET) and land-surface temperature (LST)) properties
   were extrapolated using a raster-based digital elevation-model (DEM)
   map, and their values extracted at each sampling plot. SEM was then
   applied to assess the direct and indirect impacts of environmental
   factors on AGB. The AGB was directly affected by soil (41\%, P< 0.05)
   and climatic properties (34\%, P< 0.05). The effect of topographical
   factors on AGB was non-significant (P> 0.05). However, climatic
   properties were directly affected by topographical properties, with a
   path coefficient of 34\%. Among soil properties, nitrogen, phosphorus
   and potassium concentrations, silt content and soil pH were the key
   factors affecting AGB. Climatic variables (MT, MP) were equally
   effective in explaining the climate latent variable (with loading
   factors of -0.97 and 0.99 respectively) and AGB changes. This study
   highlighted the importance of soil and climatic properties in AGB

Abstract = {This study was conducted to explore bird species diversity and
   conservation challenges in Lake Arekit located in the Guraghe Zone of
   Ethiopia. Point counts along the shoreline of the lake were employed to
   identify and record birds. Potential threats to the lake were identified
   through field observation and via key informant interviews. A total
   number of 56 bird species belonging to 23 families, and 11 orders were
   observed. One species, the Blue winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) was
   endemic, three species were near-endemic, and five species were
   vulnerable in their conservation status. A significantly higher number
   of species (i.e., 47) was recorded in the dry season than in the wet
   season (i.e., 24). The relative abundance of birds was also
   significantly higher during the dry season (t = 2.23, P > 0.05). The
   study also showed that Lake Arekit is under severe threats including
   urbanization with unwise waste disposals, siltation, and intensive
   agricultural expansion. Therefore, urgent stakeholder actions are
   required to save this lake and thereby the vast array of its
   biodiversity particularly the birds.},

Title = {Does a bacterial infection lead to a nutritional deficiency in foraging
   Allenby's gerbils?},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Bacterial infections can have both direct (physiological) and indirect
   (ecological) costs for their hosts. The direct costs of infection may
   include nutritional deficiencies, which reduce body condition over time,
   and result in the hosts modifying their foraging behaviour to compensate
   for any losses. Allenby's gerbils are commonly infected with the
   Mycoplasma haemomuris-like bacteria, which may induce choline (essential
   vitamin) and arginine (amino acid) deficiencies. Gerbils should
   therefore alter their behaviour to make up for any shortfalls in
   nutrient production and retention. We tested two predictions. 1)
   infected gerbils would compensate for nutrient losses by spending more
   time foraging in patches, including, during riskier periods of owl
   presence, and in riskier open microhabitats. Furthermore, infected
   gerbils would preferentially forage from patches supplemented with
   choline and arginine enriched food over control food. 2) Alternatively,
   if infection did not create a nutrient deficiency, then infected
   individuals would display a similar pattern of patch use to uninfected
   individuals, and harvest similar amounts of food from supplemented and
   control patches. Our findings supported the second prediction. There was
   no observed difference in foraging behaviour between infected and
   uninfected individuals. Moreover, infected gerbils did not selectively
   forage more intensively from food patches enriched with either choline
   or arginine seed over the control patches. These results suggest that
   this bacteria-gerbil interaction does not result in a nutrient
   deficiency as observed for other Mycoplasma-rodent systems.},

Abstract = {The discovery of magnetosome and magnetotaxis in its most simple form in
   the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) had created the tremendous impetus.
   MTB, spanning multiple phyla, are distributed worldwide, and they form
   the organelles called magnetosomes for biomineralization. Eight
   phylotypes of MTB belong to Alphaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae. MTB
   show preference for specific redox and oxygen concentration. Magnetosome
   chains function as the internal compass needle and align the bacterial
   cells passively along the local geomagnetic field (GMF). The nature of
   magnetosomes produced by MTB and their phylogeny suggest that
   bullet-shaped magnetites appeared about 3.2 billion years ago with the
   first magnetosomes. All MTB contains ten genes in conserved mamAB operon
   for magnetosome chain synthesis of which nine genes are conserved in
   greigite-producing MTB. Many candidate genes identify the aero-, redox-,
   and perhaps phototaxis. Among the prokaryotes, the MTB possess the
   highest number of O-2-binding proteins. Magnetofossils serve as an
   indicator of oxygen and redox levels of the ancient environments. Most
   descendants of ancestral MTB lost the magnetosome genes in the course of
   evolution. Environmental conditions initially favored the evolution of
   MTB and expansion of magnetosome-formation genes. Subsequent changes in
   atmospheric oxygen concentration have led to changes in the ecology of
   MTB, loss of magnetosome genes, and evolution of nonMTB.},

Abstract = {Citizen Science involves people as part of a scientific enquiry.
   However, in an age of great environmental changes, citizens are faced
   with degradation that affects ecosystem structure and function. Their
   role as drivers of change can be also relevant for biodiversity
   conservation. As in Citizen Science, where the citizens, properly
   trained, can initiate a widespread and fine-grained knowledge process,
   it is also possible to start a Citizen Management process, where
   citizens, adequately trained in problem solving, can change the state of
   an environmental system, with positive effects on the latter and on
   themselves. To prepare citizens for the acquisition of a problem solving
   and management paradigms, a quick meeting carried out with citizens by a
   senior manager as facilitator can be an opportunity to explain some
   basic steps: introducing them to the concept of `problem', the
   definition of a project team and SMART objectives, the use of creativity
   during brainstorming, choosing an approach to the decision-making
   process and defining a strategy (actions, times, roles, resources,
   monitoring, and adaptation). According to the Hill and Westbrook's SWOT
   approach, we suggest a list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
   threats that characterize the Citizen Management approach.},

Abstract = {Messor arenarius (Fabricius) is a harvester ant species, which is mainly
   distributed in deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. Ants of this
   species dig their nests in loess or sandy soils. In Israel, this ants'
   species is distributed in the Negev Desert and in sandy soils along the
   Mediterranean Coastal Plain. In this work, 12 sites of natural habitats
   in the Northern Coastal Plain of Israel were surveyed for surface
   activity of M. arenarius ants. These ants were found in 3 out of these
   12 natural habitats. Two of these sites where M. arenarius ants were
   found were subjected to disturbance, caused by development works during
   the period of this survey. It is concluded, that the populations of M.
   arenarius in the Northern Mediterranean Coastal Plain of Israel are
   endangered. It is also concluded, that the presence of either Artemisia
   monosperma or Retama raetam bushes in certain habitats in the Northern
   Coastal Plain of Israel, are not necessary or sufficient conditions for
   presence of M. arenarius in these same habitats.},

Abstract = {Green roofs are expected to contribute to higher biodiversity in urban
   surroundings. Typically, green roofs have been designed with low plant
   diversity. However, plant diversity can be enhanced by controlling
   resource availability and creating distinct niches. Here we hypothesize
   that by using different drainage heights during the short plant-growing
   season in a semi-arid green roof system we can create distinct niches
   and plant communities. Our experiment took place at the University of
   Haifa, north Israel. We tested three different heights of drainage
   outlet: 10 cm under the surface of the substrate (Low), 1 cm under the
   surface of the substrate (Medium) and 3 cm above the surface of the
   substrate (High) on plant species-composition in green-roof gardens.
   Grasses cover was higher in High and Medium drainages while forbs cover
   was higher in Low drainage. Species richness was the highest in Low
   drainage while diversity indices showed the opposite trend. We conclude
   that by changing the height of the drainage we can create different
   niches and change species composition in a short time period of one
   growing season. This way we can create more diverse green roof
   communities and enhance biodiversity in urban areas, particularly in
   semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play an important ecological role in arid
   and semi-arid ecosystems. So far, most studies on BSCs have focused on
   deserts, while rarely examining the successional process of BSCs in
   artificial/restored grassland. This study aimed to explore the natural
   succession and characteristics of BSCs during the recovery process of an
   artificial grassland in the Source Zone of the Yellow River. Six sites
   in two grassland types, i.e. one healthy alpine meadow and five
   artificial grasslands, were selected in Maqin county, Qinghai Province.
   These artificial grasslands have been established for varying growth
   periods ranging from 1 to 18 years. We examined vegetation
   characteristics in relation to BSC types, BSC coverage and thickness at
   these six sites. Mosses appeared at the early stage of the natural
   succession of the grassland, and lichens and visible algal crusts
   followed. The dominant moss species was Barbula unguiculate. BSC
   coverage increased significantly with recovery period. BSC thickness
   increased initially in the early stage of recovery but decreased after
   14 years of recovery. At an appropriate level (0 similar to 30\%), an
   increase in litter coverage can increase BSCs thickness, but excessive
   litter (> 30\%) can reduce BSCs coverage (P < 0.05). Therefore, an
   increase in the total coverage of vegetation and maintenance of a
   suitable litter coverage (< 30\%) are important to promote the
   establishment and succession of BSCs in recovered grasslands.},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormone levels vary within a forager based upon
   environmental stressors such as illumination and riskier habitats, and a
   forager's response to environmental variables depends upon its
   glucocorticoid levels. 1-sere, we report on a laboratory experiment in
   which we manipulated cortisol in Allenbyi's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni
   allenbyi) to test the relationship between cortisol and behavior. We
   then quantified the resulting blood cortisol levels and feeding behavior
   in gerbils. Thirty gerbils were injected with 21-day slow-release
   cortisol pellets drawn from 5 different dosages. We quantified the
   physiological response to pellet implantation in gerbils by measuring
   cortisol level in blood serum using ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
   Assay). We fed gerbils daily by mixing millet seeds into the sand inside
   rodent cages and measured the remaining seeds the following day to
   quantify feeding efforts. Some evidence supports that subcutaneous
   supplementation of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the gerbils led to higher
   blood serum levels. Cortisol levels varied according to time period of
   measurement. Gerbils that received lower dosages consumed most of the
   food presented to them when compared to those receiving the highest
   doses. In this manner, we delineate a pattern on cortisol hormone level
   variation over time following dosing and consequences in feeding
   behavior.},

Title = {Experimental size- and sex-specific predation on dung flies by amphibian

Abstract = {Because predator-prey interactions in nature are multifarious, linking
   phenomenological predation rates to underlying behavioral or ecological
   mechanisms is challenging. Size- and sex-specific predation has been
   implicated as a major selective force keeping animals small, directing
   the evolution of body size and sexual size dimorphism. We experimentally
   assessed predation by 4 amphibian and 3 arthropod species (bug, fly,
   spider) on 3 species of dung flies with similar ecology but contrasting
   body sizes, sexual size dimorphism, and coloration. Predators were
   offered a size range of male and/or female individuals of one prey
   species. As expected based on optimal foraging theory, some anurans
   (Bufo bufo) preferred larger prey individuals, others (Bombina
   variagata, Rana esculenta) showed no preference. Small juvenile Rana
   temporaria metamorphs preferred small prey, as did all arthropod
   predators, a pattern that may be explained by gape limitation or larger
   prey escaping better. Presumably more mobile males were not preyed upon
   more frequently or faster than cryptic females, even when conspicuously
   colored. Contrary to expectation, predation rates on flies in mixed
   groups facilitating mating activity were not higher, nor was predation
   generally sex-specific, hence contributing little to sexual dimorphism.
   We conclude that the size-selectivity of predators, and hence the
   viability selection pattern exerted on their prey, depends foremost on
   the relative body sizes of the two in a continuous fashion, in addition
   to any specific prey defense mechanisms. Therefore, the mechanistic
   study of predation requires integration of both the predator and prey
   perspectives, and phenomenological field studies of predation remain
   indispensable.},

Abstract = {Quality seedlings are vital to the success of any reforestation project.
   This can be attained and improved by employing nursery management
   practices like root pruning. This study was carried out to determine the
   effect of root pruning on root growth potential and growth of kamagong
   seedlings. Three-month-old seedlings were obtained from the Learning
   Laboratory for Forestry and Agroforestry, College of Forestry and
   Natural Resources, University of the Philippines - Los Banos, where
   treatments non-root pruned and root pruned were applied to seedlings
   repotted in larger polybags. After 80 days, root pruning did not
   significantly affect height and root collar diameter growth. Shoot dry
   mass, root collar diameter, root length, total tree dry mass, sturdiness
   quotient, seedling mortality were consistent in between treatments.
   Non-root pruned seedlings yielded significantly higher root volume and
   root dry mass while root pruned seedlings have significantly higher
   shoot height, root: shoot ratio, and seedling quality index. Attainment
   of moderate Root Growth Potential (RGP) based on root length and root
   volume was influenced by root pruning. Expressions of RGP were
   positively and significantly correlated to root dry mass, sturdiness
   quotient and seedling quality index. In conclusion, root pruning of this
   critically endangered species increases its quality as planting stock.},

Abstract = {The Haynei is one of seven species aggregates (clusters of species
   having similar flower morphology) recognized in section Oncocyclus of
   genus Iris. This aggregate, characterized by dark-colored flowers, is
   represented by six species in Israel and adjacent Jordan. There is,
   however, no knowledge of the genetic relationship of these species
   making verification of their taxonomic status impossible. We
   investigated genetic variation in this group using analysis of whole
   chloroplast genomes and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP).
   We also used species distribution modeling (SDM) to predict species
   ranges under current climatic conditions. We found some population
   groups within the currently recognized species of section Oncocyclus to
   represent dramatically different genetic entities which devaluates a
   general trend of merging many previously recognized species of section
   Oncocyclus based on their flower morphology. Despite the importance of
   homoploid hybridization in this group's evolution and some apparently
   sporadically happening inter-specific gene flow, the main evolutionary
   forces in Oncocyclus appear to be vicariance and spatial isolation. Our
   findings suggest that some of the currently recognized species in
   section Oncocyclus need revision. A revision must be based on genetic
   analyses allowing the reconstruction of ancestry and recognition of the
   importance of vicariance and spatial isolation in the evolution of this
   group. The implications of the present findings for conservation are
   discussed.},

   percentages. The best conditions to reach the highest instantaneous
   growth rate (r) in E. dilatata were 25 degrees C fed with N. oculata (1
   x 106 cells/mL) while the lowest r value was registered with C. vulgaris
   with both temperatures. In the mean generation time and age at first
   reproduction, the Ea was higher at 20 degrees C, where Q10 values < 1
   indicate that these rates decrease with increasing the temperature. We
   found an exception to the temperature-size rule when rotifer was fed C.
   vulgaris at 25 degrees C. Moreover, the rotifer fed with S. obliquus
   reached the maximum size. Our hypothesis is that when temperature
   increase 5 degrees C, the rotifer may shorten its embryonic development,
   thereby increasing r and net reproduction rate.},

Abstract = {Species diversity-productivity relationship is often, but not always,
   scale dependent. We hypothesize that the arrangement of environmental
   heterogeneity along a rainfall gradient, as a surrogate for
   productivity, determines whether scale dependence of beetle diversity at
   our sandy sites exists. We chose seven geographically distant landscapes
   (360 kms from south to north) within a mean annual rainfall range of
   30-585mm, each having six clusters of five uniformly distributed pitfall
   traps (within a range of 0.24 km(2)). Vegetation and physical variables
   were measured within each landscape and its clusters to characterize
   both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We used species diversity of
   each cluster and the accumulative species diversity in a landscape as
   local and regional diversity, respectively. Between-clusters
   dissimilarity in diversity reflected the turnover of species within a
   landscape. We used environmental measures in each cluster and at the
   entire landscape to indicate local and regional heterogeneity,
   respectively, and changes between transects to characterize the
   within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity. Beetle diversity and
   productivity showed a unimodal pattern at both spatial scales, with a
   peak at intermediate productivity of ca. 300 mm. Envirorunental
   heterogeneity increased with productivity both at the local and at the
   landscape scales, but within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity
   did not change with productivity. Between-clusters dissimilarity in
   diversity was higher at intermediate productivity, explaining the
   unimodal pattern at the landscape scale. We suggest that the scale
   independence in our study results from the equal distribution of
   environmental heterogeneity within a landscape. We propose that the
   exploration of the diversity-productivity relationship across scales
   should consider the way heterogeneity is distributed along the
   productivity gradient.},

Abstract = {Analysis of water source and moisture transfer characteristics of desert
   plants is of great significance for ecological restoration in arid
   areas. In this study, the water source utilized by the desert plant,
   Haloxylon ammodendron, was analysed using the stable isotope technique,
   and the water transportation characteristics were obtained based on the
   proportional heat balance method under different weather conditions. The
   results showed that (1) before raining, the moisture of H. ammodendron
   mainly relied on groundwater (the average contribution rate was 34.14\%)
   and on soil water located at a depth of 120-180cm (the average
   contribution rate was 29.87\%). After the rain, H. ammodendron mainly
   absorbed soil water from a depth of 60-120cm (the average contribution
   rate was 33.19\%) and groundwater (the average contribution rate was
   30.67\%); (2) the stem flow of H. ammodendron showed an obvious diurnal
   variation, showing a ``midday rest{''} phenomenon. The stem flow showed
   a peak value, and in sunny days, it was similar to 2 fold higher than
   that in cloudy days. (3) The stem flow rate of H. ammodendron varied
   regularly overtime as follows: August > July > September > June > May,
   and the meteorological factors affecting its stem flow were solar
   radiation (0.826) > atmospheric temperature (0.598) > humidity (-0.573).
   The results provide basic support for the ecological conservation of the
   desert plant H. ammodendron, while also having important implications
   for ecological restoration in arid regions.},

Abstract = {Understanding complex morphological shape differences has been
   revolutionized by the marriage of three-dimensional morphometric
   techniques and micro-computed tomography scanning. In animals, a major
   focus of this work has been the vertebrates, particularly the axial
   skeleton, while shape diversity in arthropods, by comparison, is less
   well explored. For example, the chelicerae (fanged, jaw-like mouthpart
   appendages) of spiders exhibit a wide degree of variation and may be
   expected to differ across the diversity of spider sizes and hunting
   strategies (e.g., active hunters versus relying on a web to intercept
   and capture prey) as well as in comparison to other structures on the
   same organism. We characterize and quantify the shapes of the carapace
   and chelicerae of 40 spiders across the spider tree of life and look for
   differences based on how those spiders attain their prey and whether
   their shapes coevolved or are modular. We found evidence for differences
   in cheliceral shape and related structures in spiders with different
   predation strategies as well as evidence for both integration and
   modularity in those structures. This suggests different pressures on the
   chelicerae including but not limited to predation mode. Furthermore,
   while differences in the structures were observed, they still must work
   in concert.},

Abstract = {The depletion of the natural environment and earth-wide natural
   resources have led to the increasing demand for green products. This has
   made young consumers carry on the green, and as a result, it affects the
   organization's bottom line in building a positive image and goodwill
   message. This research explored the facet to investigate while applying
   some constructs from the Ajzen's existing theory of planned behaviour
   (TPB) model with additional construct. 250 viable responses were applied
   and path modelling using SmartPLS 3.0 analyses was used to establish the
   model proposed. The results indicate that among the TPB constructs,
   perceived behavioural control (PBC), green perceived attitude (GPA), and
   other contextual constructs influence pro-environmental behaviour (PEB)
   positively. Looking at the relative importance of constructs, perceived
   green culture (PGC) followed by (GPA) had a stronger impact on PEB. The
   study provides evidence that young green consumers exhibit great concern
   towards environment, through model supportability and the inclusion of
   additional constructs which was supported in the TPB providing insight,
   and holding a sense of responsibility in the consumption pattern for a
   peaceful future. The obtained results can promote scientific progress in
   the respective research area and policy implications.},

Abstract = {The Late Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex was recently split into
   three species based on the premise that variation in the T. rex hypodigm
   is exceptional, indicating cryptic species and ``robust{''} and
   ``gracile{''} morphs. The morphs are based on proportional ratios
   throughout the skeleton. The species are claimed to be stratigraphically
   separate, with an early robust species followed by robust and gracile
   descendants. There are problems with the hypothesis: the taxon diagnoses
   are based on two features that overlap between the species; several
   skulls cannot be identified based on the diagnoses; proportional
   comparisons between Tyrannosaurus and other theropods are based on
   incomparable samples; the tooth data are problematic; the stratigraphic
   framework divides the Hell Creek Formation into thirds, without the
   stratigraphic position of each specimen, or independent age control
   showing the subdivisions are coeval over the entire geographic area;
   previous work found variation in T. rex, but it cannot be parsed into
   discrete categories. We tested for ``gracile{''} and ``robust{''} morphs
   by analyzing the femoral and tooth ratios that were published in the
   multiple species study using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The
   results found that each set of ratios are explained by one cluster,
   showing that dimorphism is not supported. We tested for exceptional
   variation of the femoral ratio of Tyrannosaurus; we calculated the mean
   intraspecific robusticity for 112 species of living birds and 4 nonavian
   theropods. The results showed that the absolute variation in
   Tyrannosaurus is unexceptional and it does not indicate cryptic
   diversity. We conclude that ``T. regina{''} and ``T. imperator{''} are
   subjective junior synonyms of T. rex.},

Abstract = {Radical shifts in reproductive systems result in radical changes in

   Caenorhabditis elegans constitutes one of rare model systems where such
   shifts can be experimentally induced, providing an opportunity for
   studying the evolution of reproductive phenotypes in real time.
   Evolutionary history of predominantly selfing reproduction in has led to
   degeneration of traits involved outcrossing, making it inefficient.
   Here, we introduced obligatory outcrossing into isogenic lines of C.
   elegans and allowed replicate populations to evolve under the new
   reproductive system. We predicted that they should evolve higher
   outcrossing efficiency, leading to increased fitness relative to
   unevolved ancestors. To test this prediction, we assayed fitness of both
   ancestral and evolved outcrossing populations. To control for the
   potentially confounding effect of adaptation to laboratory conditions,
   we also assayed populations with wild-type (selfing) reproductive
   system. In five experimental blocks, we measured competitive fitness of
   12 evolved populations (6 outcrossing, 6 selfing) after ca. 95
   generations of evolution, along with their respective ancestors. On
   average, we found that fitness increased by 0.72 SD (+/- 0.3 CI) in
   outcrossing and by 0.52 (+/- 0.35 CI) in selfing populations, suggesting
   further adaptation to laboratory conditions in both types. Contrary to
   predictions, fitness increase was not significantly higher in
   outcrossing populations, suggesting no detectable adaptation to the
   changed reproductive system. Importantly, the results for individual
   populations varied strongly between experimental blocks, in some cases
   even differing in effect direction. This emphasises the importance of
   experimental replication in avoiding reporting false findings.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the developmental sequence variability provides data linking
   the ontogeny and phylogeny of the investigated objects. Here, we present
   a study of cranial ossifications sequence variability in the
   polyphyletic group of Cyprininae Barbus sensu lato (Cypriniformes,
   Teleostei). We analyzed the intra- and interspecific variability,
   compared sequences of closely related and phylogenetically distant
   species, reconstructed an alleged ancestral sequence, and assessed the
   sequence variations' evolutionary validity. As the results, we revealed
   that the observed sequence alterations occur due to intrinsic, likely
   genetic or epigenetic factors. The skull ossifications, as well as skull
   regions, differ in the variability level. The ossifications appearing at
   the intermediate phase and skull regions composing splanchnocranium are
   most variable. In contrast, the structures emerging at the early and
   late phases of skull development and regions of neurocranium are less
   variable. The majority of sequence alterations are non-adaptive and
   selectively neutral. Increase in their number accompanying the
   transition from intra- to interspecific and intergeneric levels
   resembles the accumulation of the selectively neutral genetic variations
   accompanying the increase of phylogenetic distance. Reconstructions of
   phylogenetic relationships between investigated species obtained with
   the analyses of sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses using
   parsimony (PAUP) are consistent with the phylogenies based on molecular
   data and thus demonstrate the potential of sequence analysis for
   phylogenetic inference.},

Abstract = {As hosts constitute the resource for parasites, an adaptive radiation in
   a host can drive one in a parasite. In Lake Tanganyika, the
   diversification of cichlids has often led to a diversification of their
   Cichlidogyrus monogeneans. Hitherto, Cichlidogyrus nshomboi was known
   only from Boulengerochromis microlepis, the sole member of
   Boulengerochromini. Surprisingly, we retrieved this monogenean from
   Perissodus microlepis, P. straeleni and Haplotaxodon microlepis,
   belonging to Perissodini. We sequenced the nuclear 18S, 28S, ITS1 rDNA,
   and the mitochondrial COI genes and studied the morphology of the male
   copulatory organ (MCO) and the anchors of the attachment organ. This
   confirmed the conspecificity of the specimens. The occurrence of C.
   nshomboi on unrelated host lineages could be explained by inheritance
   from a common ancestor, or by host-switching. We further investigated
   the genetic and morphological variation across taxonomic (host tribes
   and species) and geographical scales. Results revealed divergence in
   ITS1 and COI between parasites infecting different tribes, which could
   indicate incipient speciation. Additionally, morphological
   differentiation in the shape and size of anchors was found between these
   groups, which could be attributed to phenotypic plasticity or to
   adaptation. Monogeneans from large-bodied B. microlepis had
   significantly larger anchors, whereas only two of the four measurements
   differed for the MCO. Unexpectedly, no morphological variation was
   observed between specimens infecting different species of Perissodini
   from nearby localities. However, differences were found between C.
   nshomboi infecting P. microlepis from different parts of the lake, which
   could be linked to the population genetic structure of the host.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have long posited that secondary sexual
   characters experiencing positive directional selection should be
   positively allometric. Support for this hypothesis, however, is limited
   and appears to hold under a specific set of conditions. An alternative
   hypothesis argues that different forms of sexual selection can produce
   similar patterns of allometry, and vice versa, depending on the net
   effect of sexual selection and viability selection. We currently lack a
   general understanding of how particular patterns of allometry emerge
   from particular sexual selection regimes. Here, I empirically examine
   whether patterns of static allometry exhibited by leg and wing traits in
   female and male Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) align with the form
   of sexual selection underlying them. Contrary to expectation, I found
   that patterns of allometry did not universally align with their regime
   of sexual selection. Despite the direction and strength of sexual
   selection differing between the sexes, I found that all traits were
   negatively allometric with the exception of tibia width in males, which
   was isometric. Patterns of allometry for tibia length and wing traits
   were sexually dimorphic under some conditions and the slopes for wing
   traits were steeper in mated than in unmated males. My results support
   the hypothesis that different sexual selection regimes can produce
   similar patterns of static allometry and suggest that viability
   selection on these traits might be stronger than sexual selection and
   could thus be responsible for shaping their patterns of static
   allometry.},

Abstract = {The study of trait evolution in modular animals is more complicated than
   that in solitary animals, because a single genotype of a modular colony
   can express an enormous range of phenotypic variation. Furthermore,
   traits can occur either at the module level or at the colony level.
   However, it is unclear how the traits at the colony level evolve. We
   test whether colony-level aggregate traits, defined as the summary
   statistics of a phenotypic distribution, can evolve. To quantify this
   evolutionary potential, we use parent-offspring pairs in two sister
   species of the bryozoan Stylopoma, grown and bred in a common garden
   breeding experiment. We find that the medians of phenotypic
   distributions are evolvable between generations of colonies. We also
   find that the structure of this evolutionary potential differs between
   these two species. Ancestral species align more closely with the
   direction of species divergence than the descendent species. This result
   indicates that aggregate trait evolvability can itself evolve.},

Title = {Phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae: origin, structure, diversification, and
   systematic relevance},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Background Phloem wedges furrowing the wood are one of the most
   notorious, widespread types of cambial variants in Angiosperms. Many
   lianas in Malpighiaceae show these variations in the arrangement of the
   secondary tissues. Here we explore their ontogeny, structure, and
   evolution in Malpighiaceae, where phloem wedges appeared multiple times,
   showing how they have contributed to the anatomical diversification of
   the family. Using a broad sampling with 143 species from 50 genera,
   covering all major lineages in Malpighiaceae, we crossed data from
   ontogeny, stem anatomy, and phylogenetic comparative methods to
   determine ontogenetic trajectories, final anatomical architectures, and
   evolution within the most recent phylogeny for the family. Results
   Phloem wedges appeared exclusively in lianas and disappeared in shrub
   lineages nested within liana lineages. At the onset of development, the
   vascular cambium is regular, producing secondary tissues homogeneously
   across its girth, but soon, portions of the cambium in between the leaf
   insertions switch their activity producing less wood and more phloem,
   initially generating phloem arcs, which progress into phloem wedges. In
   the formation of these wedges, two ontogenetic trajectories were found,
   one that maintains the continuity of the cambium, and another where the
   cambium gets dissected. Phloem wedges frequently remain as the main
   cambial variant in several lineages, while in others there are
   additional steps toward more complex cambial variants, such as fissured
   stems, or included phloem wedges, the latter a novel type of interxylary
   phloem first described for the family. Conclusions Phloem wedges evolved
   exclusively in lianas, with two different ontogenies explaining the 10
   independent origins of phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae. The presence of
   phloem wedges has favored the evolution of even more complex cambial
   variants such as fissured stems and interxylary phloem.},

Title = {Heterochrony and repurposing in the evolution of gymnosperm seed
   dispersal units},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Background Plant dispersal units, or diaspores, allow the colonization
   of new environments expanding geographic range and promoting gene flow.
   Two broad categories of diaspores found in seed plants are dry and
   fleshy, associated with abiotic and biotic dispersal agents,
   respectively. Anatomy and developmental genetics of fleshy angiosperm
   fruits is advanced in contrast to the knowledge gap for analogous fleshy
   structures in gymnosperm diaspores. Improved understanding of the
   structural basis of modified accessory organs that aid in seed dispersal
   will enable future work on the underlying genetics, contributing to
   hypotheses on the origin of angiosperm fruits. To generate a structural
   framework for the development and evolution of gymnosperm fleshy
   diaspores, we studied the anatomy and histochemistry of Ephedra
   (Gnetales) seed cone bracts, the modified leaves surrounding the
   reproductive organs. We took an ontogenetic approach, comparing and
   contrasting the anatomy and histology of fleshy and papery-winged seed
   cone bracts, and their respective pollen cone bracts and leaves in four
   species from the South American clade. Results Seed bract fleshiness in
   Ephedra derives from mucilage accumulated in chlorenchyma cells, also
   found in the reduced young leaves before they reach their mature, dry
   stage. Cellulosic fibers, an infrequent cell type in gymnosperms, were
   found in Ephedra, where they presumably function as a source of
   supplementary apoplastic water in fleshy seed cone bracts. Papery-winged
   bract development more closely resembles that of leaves, with
   chlorenchyma mucilage cells turning into tanniniferous cells early on,
   and hyaline margins further extending into ``wings{''}. Conclusions We
   propose an evolutionary developmental model whereby fleshy and
   papery-winged bracts develop from an early-stage anatomy shared with
   leaves that differs at the pollination stage. The ancestral fleshy bract
   state may represent a novel differentiation program built upon young
   leaf anatomy, while the derived dry, papery-winged state is likely built
   upon an existing differentiation pattern found in mature vegetative
   leaves. This model for the evolution of cone bract morphology in South
   American Ephedra hence involves a novel differentiation program
   repurposed from leaves combined with changes in the timing of leaf
   differentiation, or heterochrony, that can further be tested in other
   gymnosperms with fleshy diaspores.},

Title = {Duplication and expression patterns of CYCLOIDEA-like genes in
   Campanulaceae},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Background CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like transcription factors pattern floral
   symmetry in most angiosperms. In core eudicots, two duplications led to
   three clades of CYC-like genes: CYC1, CYC2, and CYC3, with orthologs of
   the CYC2 clade restricting expression dorsally in bilaterally
   symmetrical flowers. Limited data from CYC3 suggest that they also play
   a role in flower symmetry in some asterids. We examine the evolution of
   these genes in Campanulaceae, a group that contains broad transitions
   between radial and bilateral floral symmetry and 180 degrees
   resupination (turning upside-down by twisting pedicle). Results We
   identify here all three paralogous CYC-like clades across Campanulaceae.
   Similar to other core eudicots, we show that CamCYC2 duplicated near the
   time of the divergence of the bilaterally symmetrical and resupinate
   Lobelioideae. However, in non-resupinate, bilaterally symmetrical
   Cyphioideae, CamCYC2 appears to have been lost and CamCYC3 duplicated,
   suggesting a novel genetic basis for bilateral symmetry in Cyphioideae.
   We additionally, utilized qRT-PCR to examine the correlation between
   CYC-like gene expression and shifts in flower morphology in four species
   of Lobelioideae. As expected, CamCYC2 gene expression was dorsoventrally
   restricted in bilateral symmetrical flowers. However, because
   Lobelioideae have resupinate flowers, both CamCYC2A and CamCYC2B are
   highly expressed in the finally positioned ventral petal lobes,
   corresponding to the adaxial side of the flower relative to meristem
   orientation. Conclusions Our sequences across Campanulaceae of all three
   of these paralogous groups suggests that radially symmetrical
   Campanuloideae duplicated CYC1, Lobelioideae duplicated CYC2 and lost
   CYC3 early in their divergence, and that Cyphioideae lost CYC2 and
   duplicated CYC3. This suggests a dynamic pattern of duplication and loss
   of major floral patterning genes in this group and highlights the first
   case of a loss of CYC2 in a bilaterally symmetrical group. We illustrate
   here that CYC expression is conserved along the dorsoventral axis of the
   flower even as it turns upside-down, suggesting that at least late CYC
   expression is not regulated by extrinsic factors such as gravity. We
   additionally show that while the pattern of dorsoventral expression of
   each paralog remains the same, CamCYC2A is more dominant in species with
   shorter relative finally positioned dorsal lobes, and CamCYC2B is more
   dominant in species with long dorsal lobes.},

Title = {Evolution and expression of LEAFY genes in ferns and lycophytes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factors are present in algae
   and across land plants. The available expression and functional data of
   these genes in embryophytes suggest that LFY genes control a plethora of
   processes including the first zygotic cell division in bryophytes, shoot
   cell divisions of the gametophyte and sporophyte in ferns, cone
   differentiation in gymnosperms and floral meristem identity in flowering
   plants. However, their putative plesiomorphic role in plant reproductive
   transition in vascular plants remains untested. Results We perform
   Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses for the LFY gene lineage
   in embryophytes with expanded sampling in lycophytes and ferns. We
   recover the previously identified seed plant duplication that results in
   LEAFY and NEEDLY paralogs. In addition, we recover multiple
   species-specific duplications in ferns and lycophytes and large-scale
   duplications possibly correlated with the occurrence of whole genome
   duplication (WGD) events in Equisetales and Salviniales. To test
   putative roles in diverse ferns and lycophytes we perform LFY expression
   analyses in Adiantum raddianum, Equisetum giganteum and Selaginella
   moellendorffii. Our results show that LFY genes are active in vegetative
   and reproductive tissues, with higher expression in early fertile
   developmental stages and during sporangia differentiation. Conclusions
   Our data point to previously unrecognized roles of LFY genes in
   sporangia differentiation in lycophytes and ferns and suggests that
   functions linked to reproductive structure development are not exclusive
   to seed plant LFY homologs.},

Title = {Brachiopod and mollusc biomineralisation is a conserved process that was
   lost in the phoronid-bryozoan stem lineage},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background Brachiopods and molluscs are lophotrochozoans with hard
   external shells which are often believed to have evolved convergently.
   While palaeontological data indicate that both groups are descended from
   biomineralising Cambrian ancestors, the closest relatives of
   brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, are mineralised to a much lower
   extent and are comparatively poorly represented in the Palaeozoic fossil
   record. Although brachiopod and mollusc shells are structurally
   analogous, genomic and proteomic evidence indicates that their formation
   involves a complement of conserved, orthologous genes. Here, we study a
   set of genes comprised of 3 homeodomain transcription factors, one
   signalling molecule and 6 structural proteins which are implicated in
   mollusc and brachiopod shell formation, search for their orthologs in
   transcriptomes or genomes of brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, and
   present expression patterns of 8 of the genes in postmetamorphic
   juveniles of the rhynchonelliform brachiopod T. transversa. Results
   Transcriptome and genome searches for the 10 target genes in the
   brachiopods Terebratalia transversa, Lingula anatina, Novocrania
   anomala, the bryozoans Bugula neritina and Membranipora membranacea, and
   the phoronids Phoronis australis and Phoronopsis harmeri resulted in the
   recovery of orthologs of the majority of the genes in all taxa. While
   the full complement of genes was present in all brachiopods with a
   single exception in L. anatina, a bloc of four genes could consistently
   not be retrieved from bryozoans and phoronids. The genes engrailed,
   distal-less, ferritin, perlucin, sp1 and sp2 were shown to be expressed
   in the biomineralising mantle margin of T. transversa juveniles.
   Conclusions The gene expression patterns we recovered indicate that
   while mineralised shells in brachiopods and molluscs are structurally
   analogous, their formation builds on a homologous process that involves
   a conserved complement of orthologous genes. Losses of some of the genes
   related to biomineralisation in bryozoans and phoronids indicate that
   loss of the capacity to form mineralised structures occurred already in
   the phoronid-bryozoan stem group and supports the idea that mineralised
   skeletons evolved secondarily in some of the bryozoan subclades.},

Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Water fleas of the genus Daphnia have been a model system for hundreds
   of years and is among the best studied ecological model organisms to
   date. Daphnia are planktonic crustaceans with a cyclic parthenogenetic
   life-cycle. They have a nearly worldwide distribution, inhabiting
   standing fresh- and brackish water bodies, from small temporary pools to
   large lakes. Their predominantly asexual reproduction allows for the
   study of phenotypes excluding genetic variation, enabling us to separate
   genetic from non-genetic effects. Daphnia are often used in studies
   related to ecotoxicology, predator-induced defence, host-parasite
   interactions, phenotypic plasticity and, increasingly, in evolutionary
   genomics. The most commonly studied species are Daphnia magna and D.
   pulex, for which a rapidly increasing number of genetic and genomic
   tools are available. Here, I review current research topics, where the
   Daphnia model system plays a critical role.},

Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Fossils constitute the principal repository of data that allow for
   independent tests of hypotheses of biological evolution derived from
   observations of the extant biota. Traditionally, transformational series
   of structure, consisting of sequences of fossils of the same lineage
   through time, have been employed to reconstruct and interpret
   morphological evolution. More recently, a move toward an updated
   paradigm was fueled by the deliberate integration of developmental
   thinking in the inclusion of fossils in reconstruction of morphological
   evolution. The vehicle for this is provided by structural
   fingerprints-recognizable morphological and anatomical structures
   generated by (and reflective of) the deployment of specific genes and
   regulatory pathways during development. Furthermore, because the
   regulation of plant development is both modular and hierarchical in
   nature, combining structural fingerprints recognized in the fossil
   record with our understanding of the developmental regulation of those
   structures produces a powerful tool for understanding plant evolution.
   This is particularly true when the systematic distribution of specific
   developmental regulatory mechanisms and modules is viewed within an
   evolutionary (paleo-evo-devo) framework. Here, we discuss several
   advances in understanding the processes and patterns of evolution,
   achieved by tracking structural fingerprints with their underlying
   regulatory modules across lineages, living and fossil: the role of polar
   auxin regulation in the cellular patterning of secondary xylem and the
   parallel evolution of arborescence in lycophytes and seed plants; the
   morphology and life history of early polysporangiophytes and
   tracheophytes; the role of modularity in the parallel evolution of
   leaves in euphyllophytes; leaf meristematic activity and the parallel
   evolution of venation patterns among euphyllophytes; mosaic deployment
   of regulatory modules and the diverse modes of secondary growth of
   euphyllophytes; modularity and hierarchy in developmental regulation and
   the evolution of equisetalean reproductive morphology. More generally,
   inclusion of plant fossils in the evo-devo paradigm has informed
   discussions on the evolution of growth patterns and growth responses,
   sporophyte body plans and their homology, sequences of character
   evolution, and the evolution of reproductive systems.},

Title = {The diversity and evolution of electric organs in Neotropical
   knifefishes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The Gymnotiformes, also known as the South American or Neotropical
   knifefishes, include the strongly electric Electrophorus electricus and
   many other weakly electric species. These fish possess specialised
   electric organs that are able to release electric discharges into the
   water, for electrolocation and communication, and sometimes for
   predation and defence. All Gymnotiform species possess a myogenic
   electric organ (mEO) derived from the muscle tissue, and members of the
   Apteronotidae family uniquely possess a neurogenic electric organ (nEOs)
   derived from the nervous tissue. A mEO may consist of `Type A'
   electrocytes that develop within the tail muscle (for example, in
   Apteronotus leptorhynchus), or `Type B' electrocytes that develop below
   the tail muscle (for example, in Brachyhypopomus gauderio). In this
   review, we discuss the diversity in the anatomy, electric discharge and
   development of electric organs found in different Gymnotiform species,
   as well as the ecological and environmental factors that have likely
   contributed to this diversity. We then describe various hypotheses
   regarding the evolution of electric organs, and discuss the potential
   evolutionary origin of the nEO: a pair of nerve cords that are located
   on either side of the aorta in B. gauderio, and which may have expanded
   and developed into a nEO in the Apteronotidae family during its
   evolution from a common ancestral species. Finally, we compare potential
   Gymnotiform phylogenies and their supporting evidence.},

Title = {Adenylate cyclase A amplification and functional diversification during
   Polyspondylium pallidum development},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: In Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddis), adenylate cyclase A
   (ACA) critically generates the cAMP oscillations that coordinate
   aggregation and morphogenesis. Unlike group 4 species like Ddis, other
   groups do not use extracellular cAMP to aggregate. However, deletion of
   cAMP receptors (cARs) or extracellular phosphodiesterase (PdsA) in
   Polyspondylium pallidum (Ppal, group 2) blocks fruiting body formation,
   suggesting that cAMP oscillations ancestrally control post-aggregative
   morphogenesis. In group 2, the acaA gene underwent several duplications.
   We deleted the three Ppal aca genes to identify roles for either gene
   and tested whether Ppal shows transient cAMP-induced cAMP accumulation,
   which underpins oscillatory cAMP signalling.
   Results: In contrast to Ddis, pre-aggregative Ppal cells did not produce
   a pulse of cAMP upon stimulation with the cAR agonist 2'H-cAMP, but
   acquired this ability after aggregation. Deletion of Ppal aca1, aca2 and
   aca3 yielded different phenotypes. aca1(-) cells showed relatively thin
   stalks, aca2(-) showed delayed secondary sorogen formation and aca3(-)
   formed less aggregation centers. The aca1(-)aca2(-) and aca1(-)aca3(-)
   mutants combined individual defects, while aca2(-)aca3(-) and
   aca1(-)aca3(-)aca2(-) additionally showed > 24 h delay in aggregation,
   with only few aggregates with fragmenting streams being formed. The
   fragments developed into small fruiting bodies with stalk and spore
   cells. Aggregation was restored in aca2(-) aca3(-) and aca1(-) aca3(-)
   aca2(-) by 2.5 mM 8Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeant activator of
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Like Ddis, Ppal sorogens also
   express the adenylate cyclases ACR and ACG. We found that prior to
   aggregation, Ddis aca(-)/ACG cells produced a pulse of cAMP upon
   stimulation with 2'H-cAMP, indicating that cAMP oscillations may not be
   dependent on ACA alone.
   Conclusions: The three Ppal replicates of acaA perform different roles
   in stalk morphogenesis, secondary branch formation and aggregation, but
   act together to enable development by activating PKA. While even an
   aca1(-) aca3(-) aca2(-) mutant still forms (some) fruiting bodies,
   suggesting little need for ACA-induced cAMP oscillations in this
   process, we found that ACG also mediated transient cAMP-induced cAMP
   accumulation. It, therefore, remains likely that post-aggregative Ppal
   morphogenesis is organized by cAMP oscillations, favouring a previously
   proposed model, where cAR-regulated cAMP hydrolysis rather than its
   synthesis dominates oscillatory behaviour.},

Abstract = {Hybridization is a widespread phenomenon in animals, and hybrid
   heterosis/breakdown could be key processes determining the evolutionary
   dynamics of hybrids. Indeed, hybrids are not consistently disadvantaged
   compared to the parental lineages, as was historically assumed. Multiple
   processes could lead to performance differences between parental
   lineages and their hybrids. Despite many studies evaluated the
   performance of hybrids, a quantitative synthesis is required to assess
   the general pattern. Here we used meta-analytic and meta-regression
   approaches to quantify the fitness differences between parental lineages
   and their hybrids, and to identify possible processes that could lead to
   these differences. Specifically, we tested biological and methodological
   parameters that could determine differences in performance between
   hybrids and parental lineages. Hybrid performance was extremely variable
   across studies, being often significantly higher or lower compared to
   the mean performance of their parents. Nevertheless, the averaged hybrid
   performance was similar to the fitness of parental lineages, with
   differences across studies related to how performance was assessed.
   Genetic divergence between parental lineages, and the approach used to
   identify hybrids were the parameters most strongly related to variation
   in hybrid performance. Performance was lower for hybrids between
   distantly related lineages. Furthermore, study settings and the use of
   imprecise approaches for hybrid identification (e.g. morphology-based)
   can bias assessments of performance. Studies performed on wild
   populations and using genetic approaches for hybrid identification
   detected more often a decreased hybrid performance, compared to
   laboratory studies. We highlight the importance of appropriate settings
   for a realistic understanding of the evolutionary impacts of
   hybridization.},

Title = {Comparisons of cell proliferation and cell death from tornaria larva to
   juvenile worm in the hemichordate Schizocardium californicum},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Background There are a wide range of developmental strategies in animal
   phyla, but most insights into adult body plan formation come from
   direct-developing species. For indirect-developing species, there are
   distinct larval and adult body plans that are linked together by
   metamorphosis. Some outstanding questions in the development of
   indirect-developing organisms include the extent to which larval tissue
   undergoes cell death during the process of metamorphosis and when and
   where the tissue that will give rise to the adult originates. How do the
   processes of cell division and cell death redesign the body plans of
   indirect developers? In this study, we present patterns of cell
   proliferation and cell death during larval body plan development,
   metamorphosis, and adult body plan formation, in the hemichordate
   Schizocardium californium (Cameron and Perez in Zootaxa 3569:79-88,
   2012) to answer these questions. Results We identified distinct patterns
   of cell proliferation between larval and adult body plan formation of S.
   californicum. We found that some adult tissues proliferate during the
   late larval phase prior to the start of overt metamorphosis. In
   addition, using an irradiation and transcriptomic approach, we describe
   a genetic signature of proliferative cells that is shared across the
   life history states, as well as markers that are unique to larval or
   juvenile states. Finally, we observed that cell death is minimal in
   larval stages but begins with the onset of metamorphosis. Conclusions
   Cell proliferation during the development of S. californicum has
   distinct patterns in the formation of larval and adult body plans.
   However, cell death is very limited in larvae and begins during the
   onset of metamorphosis and into early juvenile development in specific
   domains. The populations of cells that proliferated and gave rise to the
   larvae and juveniles have a genetic signature that suggested a
   heterogeneous pool of proliferative progenitors, rather than a set-aside
   population of pluripotent cells. Taken together, we propose that the
   gradual morphological transformation of S. californicum is mirrored at
   the cellular level and may be more representative of the development
   strategies that characterize metamorphosis in many metazoan animals.},

Title = {Characterizing Hox genes in mayflies (Ephemeroptera), with Hexagenia
   limbata as a new mayfly model},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Background Hox genes are key regulators of appendage development in the
   insect body plan. The body plan of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) nymphs differs
   due to the presence of abdominal appendages called gills. Despite
   mayflies' phylogenetic position in Paleoptera and novel morphology
   amongst insects, little is known of their developmental genetics, such
   as the appendage-regulating Hox genes. To address this issue we present
   an annotated, early instar transcriptome and embryonic expression
   profiles for Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and Abdominal A proteins in
   the mayfly Hexagenia limbata, identify putative Hox protein sequences in
   the mayflies H. limbata, Cloeon dipterum, and Ephemera danica, and
   describe the genomic organization of the Hox gene cluster in E. danica.
   Results Transcriptomic sequencing of early instar H. limbata nymphs
   yielded a high-quality assembly of 83,795 contigs, of which 22,975 were
   annotated against Folsomia candida, Nilaparvata lugens, Zootermopsis
   nevadensis and UniRef90 protein databases. Homeodomain protein phylogeny
   and peptide annotations identified coding sequences for eight of the ten
   canonical Hox genes (excluding zerknullt/Hox3 and fushi tarazu) in H.
   limbata and C. dipterum, and all ten in E. danica. Mayfly Hox protein
   sequences and embryonic expression patterns of Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A
   appear highly conserved with those seen in other non-holometabolan
   insects. Similarly, the genomic organization of the Hox cluster in E.
   danica resembles that seen in most insects. Conclusions We present
   evidence that mayfly Hox peptide sequences and the embryonic expression
   patterns for Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A are extensively conserved with other
   insects, as is organization of the mayfly Hox gene cluster. The protein
   data suggest mayfly Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A play appendage promoting and
   repressing roles during embryogenesis in the thorax and abdomen,
   respectively, as in other insects. The identified expression of eight
   Hox genes, including Ubx and abd-A, in early instar nymphs further
   indicates a post-embryonic role, possibly in gill development. These
   data provide a basis for H. limbata as a complementary Ephemeridae model
   to the growing repertoire of mayfly model species and molecular
   techniques.},

Title = {Fleshy or dry: transcriptome analyses reveal the genetic mechanisms
   underlying bract development in Ephedra},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background Gnetales have a key phylogenetic position in the evolution of
   seed plants. Among the Gnetales, there is an extraordinary morphological
   diversity of seeds, the genus Ephedra, in particular, exhibits fleshy,
   coriaceous or winged (dry) seeds. Despite this striking diversity, its
   underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the
   limited studies in gymnosperms. Expanding the genomic and developmental
   data from gymnosperms contributes to a better understanding of seed
   evolution and development. Results We performed transcriptome analyses
   on different plant tissues of two Ephedra species with different seed
   morphologies. Anatomical observations in early developing ovules, show
   that differences in the seed morphologies are established early in their
   development. The transcriptomic analyses in dry-seeded Ephedra
   californica and fleshy-seeded Ephedra antisyphilitica, allowed us to
   identify the major differences between the differentially expressed
   genes in these species. We detected several genes known to be involved
   in fruit ripening as upregulated in the fleshy seed of Ephedra
   antisyphilitica. Conclusions This study allowed us to determine the
   differentially expressed genes involved in seed development of two
   Ephedra species. Furthermore, the results of this study of seeds with
   the enigmatic morphology in Ephedra californica and Ephedra
   antisyphilitica, allowed us to corroborate the hypothesis which suggest

Title = {Surface Representation and Morphometric Analysis Based on Discrete
   Cosine Transform},

Abstract = {Fourier series are usually employed to describe closed or open, 2D or 3D
   outlines of biological samples. Landmark-based morphometric methods are
   widely used in the analysis of 3D surfaces. There are few investigations
   on the representation and morphometric analysis of 3D biological sample
   surfaces with methods relating to Fourier series. In this paper, we
   firstly extend discrete cosine transform (DCT), a Fourier-related method
   classically used to describe 2D open curves, but here to 3D surfaces.
   Surfaces are transformed into 3D curves with a path connecting all
   points. The path can be determined manually by an analyst or by
   algorithms. Before being represented with DCT, non-shape effects should
   be eliminated. A strategy to improve the selection of coefficients to
   approximate surfaces is also presented. As a result, the mathematical
   homology of the coefficients is preserved while fast convergence of the
   approximation is ensured. Three 3D surface examples are transformed into
   3D curves and represented with DCT. The first example is four groups of
   120 simulated surfaces generated with equations, and the other two
   examples are 3D surfaces extracted from aligned 3D human skulls with
   four types of diagnoses of coronal craniosynostosis. Principal component
   analysis, one-way analysis of similarity, and one-way permutational
   multivariate analysis of variance are utilized to analyze the
   coefficients obtained. The results of statistical analyses suggest that
   DCT is an effective and stable tool in describing 3D surfaces.},

Title = {The red flour beetle T. castaneum: elaborate genetic toolkit and
   unbiased large scale RNAi screening to study insect biology and
   evolution},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum has emerged as an important
   insect model system for a variety of topics. With respect to studying
   gene function, it is second only to the vinegar fly D. melanogaster. The
   RNAi response in T. castaneum is exceptionally strong and systemic, and
   it appears to target all cell types and processes. Uniquely for emerging
   model organisms, T. castaneum offers the opportunity of performing time-
   and cost-efficient large-scale RNAi screening, based on commercially
   available dsRNAs targeting all genes, which are simply injected into the
   body cavity. Well established transgenic and genome editing approaches
   are met by ease of husbandry and a relatively short generation time.
   Consequently, a number of transgenic tools like UAS/Gal4, Cre/Lox,
   imaging lines and enhancer trap lines are already available. T.
   castaneum has been a genetic experimental system for decades and now has
   become a workhorse for molecular and reverse genetics as well as in vivo
   imaging. Many aspects of development and general biology are more
   insect-typical in this beetle compared to D. melanogaster. Thus,
   studying beetle orthologs of well-described fly genes has allowed
   macro-evolutionary comparisons in developmental processes such as axis
   formation, body segmentation, and appendage, head and brain development.
   Transgenic approaches have opened new ways for in vivo imaging.
   Moreover, this emerging model system is the first choice for research on
   processes that are not represented in the fly, or are difficult to study
   there, e.g. extraembryonic tissues, cryptonephridial organs, stink gland
   function, or dsRNA-based pesticides.},

Title = {Distal-less and spalt are distal organisers of pierid wing patterns},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Two genes, Distal-less (Dll) and spalt (sal), are known to be involved
   in establishing nymphalid butterfly wing patterns. They function in
   several ways: in the differentiation of the eyespot's central signalling
   cells, or foci; in the differentiation of the surrounding black disc; in
   overall scale melanisation (Dll); and in elaborating marginal patterns,
   such as parafocal elements. However, little is known about the functions
   of these genes in the development of wing patterns in other butterfly
   families. Here, we study the expression and function of Dll and sal in
   the development of spots and other melanic wing patterns of the Indian
   cabbage white, Pieris canidia, a pierid butterfly. In P. canidia, both
   Dll and Sal proteins are expressed in the scale-building cells at the
   wing tips, in chevron patterns along the pupal wing margins, and in
   areas of future scale melanisation. Additionally, Sal alone is expressed
   in the future black spots. CRISPR knockouts of Dll and sal showed that
   each gene is required for the development of melanic wing pattern
   elements, and repressing pteridine granule formation, in the areas where
   they are expressed. We conclude that both genes likely play ancestral
   roles in organising distal butterfly wing patterns, across pierid and
   nymphalid butterflies, but are unlikely to be differentiating signalling
   centres in pierids black spots. The genetic and developmental mechanisms
   that set up the location of spots and eyespots are likely distinct in
   each lineage.},

Abstract = {Background Understanding the relationship between macroevolutionary
   diversity and variation in organism development is an important goal of
   evolutionary biology. Variation in the morphology of several plant and
   animal lineages is attributed to pedomorphosis, a case of heterochrony,
   where an ancestral juvenile shape is retained in an adult descendant.
   Pedomorphosis facilitated morphological adaptation in different plant
   lineages, but its cellular and molecular basis needs further
   exploration. Plant development differs from animal development in that
   cells are enclosed by cell walls and do not migrate. Moreover, in many
   plant lineages, the differentiated epidermis of leaves, and leaf-derived
   structures, such as petals, limits organ growth. We, therefore, proposed
   that pedomorphosis in leaves, and in leaf-derived structures, results
   from delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to
   reproductive maturity. This idea was explored for petal evolution, given
   the importance of corolla morphology for angiosperm reproductive
   success. Results By comparing cell morphology and transcriptional
   profiles between 5 mm flower buds and mature flowers of an entomophile
   and an ornitophile Loasoideae species (a lineage that experienced
   transitions from bee- to hummingbird-pollination), we show that
   evolution of pedomorphic petals of the ornithophile species likely
   involved delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to
   flower maturity. We also found that developmental mechanisms other than
   pedomorphosis might have contributed to evolution of corolla morphology.
   Conclusions Our results highlight a need for considering alternatives to
   the flower-centric perspective when studying the origin of variation in
   flower morphology, as this can be generated by developmental processes
   that are also shared with leaves.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Pages = {424-432},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Claws are the most common attachment mechanism in vertebrates. The
   comparative anatomy and morphology of claws has been studied mainly in
   reptiles and birds. However, as far as we know, studies focusing on
   turtles' claws are lacking. Turtles occupy a wide range of habitats,
   from aquatic to terrestrial, and vary in form and behavior, being an
   ideal model organism for ecomorphological studies. We performed
   qualitative and quantitative analyses to find a relationship between
   morphological variation and both ecological factors and phylogenetic
   constraints that could have driven the evolution of turtles' claws. The
   claws of 35 adult turtle and tortoise specimens of 12 species of
   testudines with different locomotor modes were compared. Our data show
   several convergence traits in claw shape, with convergence being
   reinforced by the low phylogenetic signal exhibited by most characters.
   We propose that claw morphology in turtles is mainly associated with
   some mechanical functions, such as freshwater-swimming, bottom-walking
   and tearing of prey.},

Title = {A CYC-RAD-DIV-DRIF interaction likely pre-dates the origin of floral
   monosymmetry in Lamiales},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background An outstanding question in evolutionary biology is how
   genetic interactions defining novel traits evolve. They may evolve
   either by de novo assembly of previously non-interacting genes or by en
   bloc co-option of interactions from other functions. We tested these
   hypotheses in the context of a novel phenotype-Lamiales flower
   monosymmetry-defined by a developmental program that relies on
   regulatory interaction among CYCLOIDEA, RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF
   gene products. In Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon), representing Lamiales,
   we tested whether components of this program likely function beyond
   their previously known role in petal and stamen development. In Solanum
   lycopersicum (tomato), representing Solanales which diverged from
   Lamiales before the origin of Lamiales floral monosymmetry, we
   additionally tested for regulatory interactions in this program. Results
   We found that RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF are expressed in snapdragon
   ovaries and developing fruit, similar to their homologs during tomato
   fruit development. In addition, we found that a tomato CYCLOIDEA
   ortholog positively regulates a tomato RADIALIS ortholog. Conclusion Our
   results provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that the
   developmental program defining floral monosymmetry in Lamiales was
   co-opted en bloc from a function in carpel development. This expands our
   understanding of novel trait evolution facilitated by co-option of

Title = {ES-sim-GLM, a Multiple Regression Trait-Dependent Diversification
   Approach},

Abstract = {Identifying the role of quantitative variables on speciation rates is
   among the main purposes of trait-dependent diversification methods.
   ES-sim, a recent simulation-based approach that relies on Pearson's
   correlations, allows testing trait-dependent diversification for single
   regression models. Here, we modified this approach to include
   generalized linear models and two independent variables. To examine the
   effects of multiple traits on speciation we modified ES-sim and
   integrated generalized linear models instead of Pearson's correlations.
   We named the new approach as ES-sim-GLM. We further evaluated how this
   modified method performs in both single and multiple regression
   modelling. For this, we analyzed the relationship of speciation rates
   with geographic range size and snout-to-vent length in 216 species from
   the family Liolaemidae, a South American radiation of Andean lizards.
   Based on simulations, ES-sim-GLM for single regression models shows high
   power, low false discovery rates and is robust to incomplete taxon
   sampling. ES-sim-GLM for multiple regression models shows lower power
   but also low false-discovery rates. Both remained computationally
   efficient. Using Liolaemidae data, we found that larger species but with
   smaller species geographic range sizes were associated with higher
   speciation rates. To the best of our knowledge, no study as addressed
   these relationships in this clade. Our results provide new insights on
   macroevolutionary methods that should be relevant to all organisms and
   facilitate future studies that aim to understand diversification
   patterns across the Tree of Life.},

Title = {Linking the evolution of development of stem vascular system in
   Nyctaginaceae and its correlation to habit and species diversification},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background Alternative patterns of secondary growth in stems of
   Nyctaginaceae is present in all growth habits of the family and have
   been known for a long time. However, the interpretation of types of
   cambial variants have been controversial, given that different authors
   have given them different developmental interpretations. The different
   growth habits coupled with an enormous stem anatomical diversity offers
   the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of complex
   developments, to address how these anatomies shifted within habits, and
   how the acquisition of novel cambial variants and habit transitions
   impacted the diversification of the family. Methods We integrated
   developmental data with a phylogenetic framework to investigate the
   diversity and evolution of stem anatomy in Nyctaginaceae using
   phylogenetic comparative methods, reconstructing ancestral states, and
   examining whether anatomical shifts correspond to species
   diversification rate shifts in the family. Results Two types of cambial
   variants, interxylary phloem and successive cambia, were recorded in
   Nyctaginaceae, which result from four different ontogenies. These
   ontogenetic trajectories depart from two distinct primary vascular
   structures (regular or polycyclic eustele) yet, they contain shared
   developmental stages which generate stem morphologies with deconstructed
   boundaries of morphological categories (continuum morphology). Unlike
   our a priori hypotheses, interxylary phloem is reconstructed as the
   ancestral character for the family, with three ontogenies characterized
   as successive cambia evolving in few taxa. Cambial variants are not
   contingent on habits, and their transitions are independent from species
   diversification. Conclusions Our findings suggest that multiple
   developmental mechanisms, such as heterochrony and heterotopy, generate
   the transitions between interxylary phloem and successive cambia.
   Intermediate between these two extremes are present in Nyctaginaceae,
   suggesting a continuum morphology across the family as a generator of
   anatomical diversity.},

Title = {The Predictable Complexity of Evolutionary Allometry},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Allometry has been a paradigm of constraints, including intrinsic
   constraints on the evolvability of allometry, as a source of
   developmental and genetic constraints on the evolution of form, and of
   functional constraints, maintaining functional equivalence as body size
   evolves. Yet, allometry may be the simplest case of varied constraints,
   and of morphological integration, even though allometry itself is not
   simple. Evolutionary allometry may be especially complex because it
   depends not only on developmental origins of allometry and determinants
   of allometric variation but also on the evolutionary dynamics of size
   and shape. It should also depend on the ecological opportunity for
   size-dependent ecomorphological specialization. We predict that lineages
   that converge in those would exhibit similar evolutionary allometries
   but otherwise, evolutionary allometries would be heterogeneous.
   Countering this expectation are familiar craniofacial evolutionary
   allometries, often ascribed to developmental bias. To test both those
   hypotheses, we compare evolutionary allometries of mandibles across
   lineages of squirrels and evolutionary to growth allometries. As
   expected, lineages that converge on size-dependent specializations
   exhibit similar evolutionary allometries, but otherwise their
   allometries are no more similar than expected by chance. Growth
   allometries of squirrels (and a cricetid rodent) slightly resemble the
   evolutionary allometry of one lineage, but growth allometries of species
   from other lineages are orthogonal to their own lineages' evolutionary
   allometry. We would expect that craniofacial allometries that are not
   brain-driven would, like mandibular evolutionary allometries, be
   predictable only from size-dependent ecological specializations.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Evolvability is best addressed from a multi-level, macroevolutionary
   perspective through a comparative approach that tests for among-clade
   differences in phenotypic diversification in response to an opportunity,
   such as encountered after a mass extinction, entering a new adaptive
   zone, or entering a new geographic area. Analyzing the dynamics of
   clades under similar environmental conditions can (partially) factor out
   shared external drivers to recognize intrinsic differences in
   evolvability, aiming for a macroevolutionary analog of a common-garden
   experiment. Analyses will be most powerful when integrating
   neontological and paleontological data: determining differences among
   extant populations that can be hypothesized to generate large-scale,
   long-term contrasts in evolvability among clades; or observing
   large-scale differences among clade histories that can by hypothesized
   to reflect contrasts in genetics and development observed directly in
   extant populations. However, many comparative analyses can be
   informative on their own, as explored in this overview. Differences in
   clade-level evolvability can be visualized in diversity-disparity plots,
   which can quantify positive and negative departures of phenotypic
   productivity from stochastic expectations scaled to taxonomic
   diversification. Factors that evidently can promote evolvability include
   modularity-when selection aligns with modular structure or with
   morphological integration patterns; pronounced ontogenetic changes in
   morphology, as in allometry or multiphase life cycles; genome size; and
   a variety of evolutionary novelties, which can also be evaluated using
   macroevolutionary lags between the acquisition of a trait and phenotypic
   diversification, and dead-clade-walking patterns that may signal a loss
   of evolvability when extrinsic factors can be excluded. High speciation
   rates may indirectly foster phenotypic evolvability, and vice versa.
   Mechanisms are controversial, but clade evolvability may be higher in
   the Cambrian, and possibly early in the history of clades at other
   times; in the tropics; and, for marine organisms, in shallow-water
   disturbed habitats.},

Abstract = {To study the hindlimb connectivity patterns of aquatic birds, we
   compared the musculoskeletal multi-networks of non-divers (Numididae and
   Anatidae), wing-propelled divers (Alcidae and Sphenicidae), and
   foot-propelled divers (Anhingidae, Phalacrocoracidae, Podicipedidae, and
   Gaviidae). Anatomical multi-networks are undirected multigraphs where
   bones and muscles were considered as nodes and the physical junctions
   between them as links. From each network we calculated different
   parameters, performed a principal component analysis and constructed a
   phylomorphospace. Our results show that both phylogenetic history and
   locomotor habits contributed to shape the musculoskeletal hindlimb
   connectivity of aquatic birds. Wing-propelled divers have complex and
   dense networks and are separated from the rest of birds, with penguins
   tightly clustered together. Non-divers and foot-propelled divers have
   loose networks and are clustered together, except for Podicipedidae and
   Gaviidae that are clustered together but separated from the rest. We
   also compared the networks of extant and fossil diving taxa and observed
   that complete muscular reconstructions can be compared with extant taxa,
   which is useful in order to include paleontological information in
   analyses of musculoskeletal disparity. These results encourage the
   exploration of the musculoskeletal connectivity patterns in other
   locomotor modules and taxa of different habits, in order to explore the
   relative contribution of ecology and phylogeny in the evolution of the
   connectivity of the musculoskeletal system, and to asses some
   generalities about the connectivity of musculoskeletal system in highly
   specialized taxa.},

Abstract = {Quantitative genetics is a powerful tool for predicting phenotypic
   evolution on a microevolutionary scale. This predictive power primarily
   comes from the Lande equation (Delta(z) over bar = G beta), a
   multivariate expansion of the breeder's equation, where phenotypic
   change (Delta(z) over bar) is predicted from the genetic covariances (G)
   and selection (beta). Typically restricted to generational change,
   evolutionary biologists have proposed that quantitative genetics could
   bridge micro- and macroevolutionary patterns if predictions were
   expanded to longer timescales. While mathematically possible, making
   quantitative genetic predictions across generations or species is
   contentiously debated, principally in assuming long-term stability of
   the G-matrix. Here we tested stability at a macroevolutionary timescale
   by conducting full- and half-sib breeding programs in two species of
   sigmodontine rodents from South America, the leaf-eared mice Phyllotis
   vaccarum and P. darwini and estimated the G-matrices for eight pelvic
   traits. To expand our phylogenetic breadth, we incorporated two
   additional G-matrices measured for the same traits from Kohn \&
   Atchley's 1988 study of the murine rodents Mus musculus and Rattus
   norvegicus. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework and four separate
   metrics of matrix divergence or similarity, we found no significant
   association between evolutionary divergence among species G-matrices and
   time, supporting the assumption of stability for at least some
   structures. However, the phylogenetic sample size is necessarily small.
   We suggest that small fluctuations in covariance structure can occur
   rapidly, but underlying developmental regulation prevents significant
   divergence at macroevolutionary scales, analogous to an
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck pattern. Expanded taxonomic sampling will be needed
   to test this suggestion.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary trends (ETs) are traditionally defined as substantial
   changes in the state of traits through time produced by a persistent
   condition of directional evolution. ETs might also include directional
   responses to ecological, climatic or biological gradients and represent
   the primary evolutionary pattern at high taxonomic levels and over
   long-time scales. The absence of a well-supported operative definition
   of ETs blurred the definition of conceptual differences between ETs and
   other key concepts in evolution such as convergence, parallel evolution,
   and divergence. Also, it prevented the formulation of modern guidelines
   for studying ETs and evolutionary dynamics related to them. In
   phenotypic evolution, the theory of morphodynamics states that the
   interplay between evolutionary factors such as phylogeny, evo-devo
   constraints, environment, and biological function determines
   morphological evolution. After introducing a new operative definition,
   here we provide a morphodynamics-based framework for studying phenotypic
   ETs, discussing how understanding the impact of these factors on ETs
   improves the explanation of links between biological patterns and
   processes underpinning directional evolution. We envisage that adopting
   a quantitative, pattern-based, and multifactorial approach will pave the
   way to new potential applications for this field of evolutionary
   biology. In this framework, by exploiting the catalysing effect of
   climate change on evolution, research on ETs induced by global change
   might represent an ideal arena for validating hypotheses about the
   predictability of evolution.},

Title = {The Role of Vicariance and Paleoclimatic Shifts in the Diversification

   Floodplains},

Abstract = {Wetlands are present in different parts of the globe, holding a
   significant portion of the local biodiversity, and have been under the
   constant influence of climatic changes worldwide on different time
   scales. Investigations with a phylogeographic approach have revealed the
   role of Quaternary climatic shifts on a global scale, favoring constant
   changes in the amplitude of floodplains and affecting the evolutionary
   history of multi-taxa. This pattern was observed in the Amazonian biota,
   but due to the complex geological history, some of these models alone
   are insufficient, especially in widespread species that live in specific
   regions of the biome. Herein, we investigated the species delimitation
   and biogeographic history of the semi-aquatic lizard Uranoscodon
   superciliosus (U. superciliosus), widely distributed in Amazonian
   floodplains, a habitat that was for a long time considered a corridor to
   gene flow. Our results support a high genetic diversity with five
   well-supported lineages within U. superciliosus: North of the Amazon
   River, East Xingu, Solimoes, Purus, and Tapajos-Madeira, with the basal
   split within this group in the Miocene and others in the
   Plio-Pleistocene. These results corroborated a mixture of distinct
   processes that shaped the diversity of U. superciliosus with rivers as
   vicariant barriers and the already known role of paleoclimatic shifts
   during the Quaternary promoting diversification. Among tetrapods, our
   work is one of the first to describe the genetic structure in a
   widespread taxon along river-edge environments, thus supporting both
   patterns of diversification with the compartmentalized lineages along
   different Amazonian rivers (floodplains) and also the more common
   pattern found in upland forest species, with main rivers acting as
   vicariant barriers and playing a role in allopatric speciation.},

Title = {Body Plan Identity: A Mechanistic Model},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-141},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A body plan is a stable configuration of characters for a major
   taxonomic group, such as chordates or arthropods. Despite widespread
   casual reliance on the concept for guiding comparisons within and
   between groups, the nature of body plans as well as the biological
   causes underlying their evolution have remained elusive. This paper
   proposes an abstract mechanistic model of body plan identity. We
   hypothesize that body plans are an evolutionary phenomenon that only
   applies to a relatively small subset of major clades, rather than being
   associated with each and every so-called ``phylum.{''} Body plans arise
   in evolution by stepwise accretion, and require a level of developmental
   complexity that is only found in some animal clades. Further, we suggest
   that, parallel to the developmental mechanisms controlling character
   identity, there are ``body plan identity mechanisms{''} (BpIMs) that
   maintain entire configurations of characters while possessing a
   mechanistic architecture that is itself stable and traceable through
   evolutionary change. These BpIMs, we suggest, are entrenched
   intercellular signaling networks operating between transient embryonic
   structures that are destined to differentiate into distinct
   individualized characters. The activity of a BpIM results in a transient
   long-range integration of the embryo that is highly sensitive to genetic
   and environmental perturbations, and that can be detected
   morphologically as a conserved phylotypic stage. This model is
   illustrated with detailed interpretations of the notochord signaling
   system and the segment polarity network as candidate BpIMs in
   vertebrates and arthropods, respectively. We conclude by contrasting the
   proposed developmental-mechanistic conception of body plans with the
   phylogenetic notion of ground plans, and sketch the general outlines of
   an empirical research program on body plan evolution.},

Title = {Dimensions of Morphological Integration},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {342-372},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over several generations of evolutionary and developmental biologists,
   ever since Olson and Miller's pioneering work of the 1950's, the concept
   of ``morphological integration{''} as applied to Gaussian
   representations N(mu, Sigma) of morphometric data has been a focus
   equally of methodological innovation and methodological perplexity.
   Reanalysis of a century-old example from Sewall Wright shows how some
   fallacies of distance analysis by correlations can be avoided by careful
   matching of the distance rosters involved to a different multivariate
   approach, factor analysis. I reinterpret his example by restoring the
   information (means and variances) ignored by the correlation matrix,
   while confirming what Wright called ``special size factors{''} by a
   different technique, inspection of the concentration matrix Sigma(-1).
   In geometric morphometrics (GMM), data accrue instead as Cartesian
   coordinates of labelled points; nevertheless, just as in the Wright
   example, statistical manipulations do better when they reconsider the
   normalizations that went into the generation of those coordinates. Here
   information about both mu and Sigma, the means and the
   variances/covariances, can be preserved via the Boas coordinates
   (Procrustes shape coordinates without the size adjustment) that protect
   the role of size per se as an essential explanatory factor while
   permitting the analyst to acknowledge the realities of animal anatomy
   and its trajectories over time or size in the course of an analysis. A
   descriptive quantity for this purpose is suggested, the correlation of
   vectorized mu against the first eigenvector of Sigma for the Boas
   coordinates. The paper reanalyzes two GMM data sets from this point of
   view. In one, the classic Vilmann rodent neurocranial growth data, a
   description of integration can be aligned with the purposes of
   evolutionary and developmental biology by a graphical exegesis based
   mainly in the loadings of the first Boas principal component. There
   results a multiplicity of morphometric patterns, some homogeneous and
   others characterized by gradients. In the other, a Vienna data set
   comprising human midsagittal skull sections mostly sampled along curves,
   a further integrated feature emerges, thickening of the calvaria, that
   requires a reparametrization and a modified thin plate spline graphic
   distinct from the digitized configurations per se. This new GMM protocol
   fulfills the original thrust of Olson \& Miller's (Evolution 5:325-338,
   1951) ``rho F-groups,{''} the alignment of statistical and biological
   explanatory guidance, while respecting the enormously greater range of
   morphological descriptors afforded by well-designed
   landmark/semilandmark configurations.},

   Research into the development of these diseases is highly influenced by
   our understanding of the evolutionary roots of metabolic functioning,
   thereby considering that chronic non-communicable diseases arise from an
   evolutionary mismatch. However, the lens has been mostly directed toward
   energy availability and metabolism, but away from our closest
   environmental factor, the gut microbiota. Thus, this paper proposes a
   narrative thread that places symbiosis in an evolutionary perspective,
   expanding the traditional framework of humans' adaptation to their food
   environment.},

Title = {The Evolution of Brain Size in Ectothermic Tetrapods: Large Brain Mass
   Trades-Off with Lifespan in Reptiles},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The evolution of brain size is constrained by the trade-off between the
   energetic costs allocated towards its maintenance and the cognitive
   advantages that come with a larger brain, leading to a paradox. The
   cognitive benefits of larger brains (e.g., high behavioural flexibility)
   mitigate extrinsic mortality factors, which may indirectly select for
   slower ageing that prolongs lifespan ({''}cognitive buffer
   hypothesis{''}). However, substantial energetic costs imposed by the
   maintenance of neural tissue is expected to compromise the energetic
   budget of large-brained organisms, and their investment in somatic
   maintenance and repair, thus accelerating ageing that shortens lifespan
   (the ``disposable soma theory{''}). The relationship between lifespan
   and brain size has mostly been investigated in birds and mammals. Thus,
   whether these trade-offs express across ectothermic vertebrates remains
   to be addressed on a large-scale. Our study presents the first
   large-scale analysis of the brain size-lifespan relationship in
   ectothermic tetrapods (amphibians and reptiles). Using a dataset
   spanning 265 species, we performed phylogenetic linear models to
   investigate the predicted trade-off between variation in brain size and
   longevity. Our findings revealed a negative relationship between brain
   size and lifespan across reptiles, whereas no association was observed
   across amphibians. Thus, the relationship between life history and brain
   evolution in ectotherms does not follow the general pattern found across
   other vertebrates. Among ectotherms, the high metabolic cost of
   producing neural tissue seems to transcend the cognitive benefits of
   evolving a larger brain. Consequently, our findings suggest that natural
   selection favours optimization of the energetic economy over the
   fitness-advantages that cognitive benefits may offer.},

Title = {The Tyrant Lizard King, Queen and Emperor: Multiple Lines of

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {All skeletal specimens of the North American dinosaur Tyrannosaurus and
   a number of trace fossils have been attributed to the single species: T.
   rex. Although an unusual degree of variation in skeletal robustness
   among specimens and variability in anterior dentary tooth form have been
   noted, the possibility of sibling species within the genus Tyrannosaurus
   has never been tested in depth in both anatomical and stratigraphic
   terms. New analysis, based on a dataset of over three dozen specimens,
   finds that Tyrannosaurus specimens exhibit such a remarkable degree of
   proportional variations, distributed at different stratigraphic levels,
   that the pattern favors multiple species at least partly separated by
   time; ontogenetic and sexual causes being less consistent with the data.
   Variation in dentary incisiform counts correlate with skeletal
   robusticity and also appear to change over time. Based on the current
   evidence, three morphotypes are demonstrated, and two additional species
   of Tyrannosaurus are diagnosed and named. One robust species with two
   small incisors in each dentary appears to have been present initially,
   followed by two contemporaneous species (one robust and another gracile)
   both of which had one small incisor in each dentary, suggesting both
   anagenesis and cladogenesis occurred. The geological/geographic forces
   underlying the evolution of multiple Tyrannosaurus species are examined.
   A discussion of the issues involving the recognition and designation of
   multiple morphotypes/species within dinosaur genera is included.},

Title = {Assessing the Levels of Functional Adaptation: Finite Element Analysis
   Reveals Species, Hybrid, and Sexual Variation in the Biomechanics of
   African Cichlid Mandibles},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-220},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To understand how adaptive divergence emerges it is essential to examine
   the function of phenotypic traits along a continuum. For vertebrates,
   the mandible provides a key link with foraging and other important
   activities which has made it highly relevant for investigations of
   biomechanical change. Variation in mandible shape is known to correspond
   with ecology but its function is often only investigated between
   distinct species. However, for such divergence to occur and be
   maintained selection likely draws from many sources of biomechanical
   variation. African cichlids represent an exemplar model for
   understanding how such processes unfold with mandible variation existing
   between species, sexes, and is likely generated in nature by the
   potential for hybridization. We explored such mandible variation through
   a finite element modelling approach and predicted that hybrids and
   females would have reduced functional capabilities, the former in line
   with disruptive selection and the latter due to potential trade-offs
   incurred by maternal mouthbrooding in Malawian haplochromines. We
   revealed evidence of structural adaptations between Tropheops `Red
   Cheek' and Labeotrophues fuelleborni that impacted the dispersion of
   mechanical stress in ways that matched the foraging of these species.
   Also, hybrids showed higher stresses relative to both species across the
   mandible. Sexual dimorphism in stress handling was evident despite minor
   differences in shape with males showing enhanced load resistance.
   However, in hybrids it appeared that males were disadvantaged relative
   to females, and displayed asymmetry in load handling. Together, these
   results show evidence of species and sex based biomechanical variation,
   that could be targeted by divergent selection.},

Abstract = {Fish diversification into sympatric ecomorph pairs demonstrates a
   striking parallelism across a number of taxa in numerous lakes. However,
   there is a dearth of information on environmental conditions, which may
   orchestrate divergence processes across generations. Here we explore
   whether the environmental factors affecting food and reproductive niche
   distinctions could trigger the divergence of the lacustrine-riverine
   fish species into two morphs based on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka of the
   Lake Kronotskoe. We reveal drastic differences in temperature on the
   tributary reproduction sites affecting the early ontogeny timing and
   disrupting the time of lakeward migration of the morphs. The juveniles
   of the benthivorous morph run into the lake in spring during the food
   abundance peak on the slope, while the planktivorous kokanee migrates to
   the lake in the summer when the pelagic zone abounds with zooplankton.
   The dynamics of this food niches is determined by water temperature
   dynamics and may be stable for long periods of time, thus making each
   morph adapting to similar condition throughout generations. We suggest
   that the pelagic-benthic divergence could be explained by the factors,
   which are extrinsic for fish, making our results applicable for numerous
   cases of this microevolutionary pathway all over the Holarctic.},

Title = {Procrustes Shape Cannot be Analyzed, Interpreted or Visualized one
   Landmark at a Time},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-254},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Landmark-based geometric morphometrics using the Procrustes approach has
   become the dominant family of methods in morphometrics. However, the
   superimposition (and sliding, if semilandmarks are present), that
   transforms raw coordinates into shape coordinates is biologically
   arbitrary. Procrustes has desirable statistical properties, but is not
   based on a biological model. The same is true for sliding methods. These
   techniques allow powerful statistical analyses of a full set of shape
   coordinates, but make the use of subsets of landmarks/semilandmarks
   problematic, inaccurate and misleading, if not totally wrong. Crucially,
   the biological arbitrariness of the superimposition prevents any
   meaningful quantification, analysis and interpretation of variation one
   landmark/semilandmark at a time. We exemplify how misleading this type
   of analyses can be by using a real dataset, as well as simulated data
   with isotropic variation. Both show inconsistencies in
   `per-landmark/semilandmark' variances. The simulation in fact helps to
   make even more obvious that the pattern of variance is strongly
   influenced by the biologically arbitrary choice of the mathematical
   treatment. Unfortunately, despite this limitation of all superimposition
   methods being known since the early days of Procrustean morphometrics,
   there has been a recent series of papers in leading journals presenting
   results of `per-landmark' analyses. Thus, we further clarify why these

Title = {Winter flowers for bees: reproductive biology of Trixis praestans
   (Asteraceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The shrub Trixis praestans (Asteraceae) is widely distributed in
   Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. It has great potential as a
   melliferous resource, since its abundant flowering occurs in winter
   (when flower offer is scarce) and spring, and it is intensely visited by
   honey bees. This study provides information on some aspects of the
   reproductive biology, which are essential for the species cultivation,
   conservation and breeding. Flowering phenology, floral biology and
   floral visitors were observed. The mechanism of fruit set was evaluated
   through manipulative experiments, embryological analyses and genotypic
   characterization of offspring using molecular DNA markers. Flower
   longevity was 3.5 +/- 1 days and duration of the capitulum in floral
   state was 15 +/- 6 days; peak flowering occurred in mid-August. Floral
   visitors belonged to nine species of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and
   Lepidoptera. Apis mellifera was the most abundant species and showed
   foraging behavior on pollen and nectar. Fruit set was 70\% higher in
   open-pollination and hand cross-pollination (xenogamy) treatments than
   in hand self-pollination and autonomous self-pollination treatments. The
   embryological analysis indicated a path of sexual development which
   originated a reduced embryo sac (female gametophyte). Molecular analysis
   showed a prevalence of cross-fertilization in fruits derived from
   open-pollination. Based on the results, we conclude that T. praestans is
   a sexual species in which xenogamy predominates and that pollinators are
   necessary for fruit set.},

Title = {Out of the mud: two new species of Hippeastrum (Amaryllidaceae) from the

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In 2015, Brazil faced the worst environmental disaster in its history,
   when the collapse of an iron ore dam dumped millions of tons of tailings
   into the Doce River. In this paper, we describe two Hippeastrum species
   native to localities directly involved in the tragedy. The dam was
   located in the foothills of Serra do Caraca, a mountain range in the
   state of Minas Gerais, from where we describe the endemic H.carassense;
   H.velloziflorum was first found on an inselberg located on the banks of
   the Doce River, in the neighboring state of Espirito Santo. Comments on
   their distribution, ecology, and phenology are provided, as well as
   comparisons with the most similar taxa. The conservation status of the
   two new species is preliminarily assessed, and both are considered
   threatened with extinction. We also compared their leaf anatomy and
   micromorphology with related species of Amaryllidaceae. Based on nrDNA
   ITS, we infer the phylogenetic position of H.velloziflorum, a taxon with
   several unique morphological characters for Hippeastrum, as the first
   branch in subgenus Hippeastrum. The placement of H.velloziflorum in
   Hippeastrum is also supported by anatomical and cytological data. The
   somatic chromosome number was 2n = 22, and the karyotype formula was 2n
   = 8m + 12sm + 2st chromosome pairs. An identification key to the species
   of Hippeastrum occurring in the Doce and Jequitinhonha River basins is
   presented.},

Title = {Species delimitation and molecular diagnosis of Cyrtomium yamomotoi
   (Dryopteridaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Cyrtomium is one of the most taxonomically challenging groups,
   which comprises about 40 taxa globally. Cyrtomium yamamotoi is a great
   example showing the taxonomic difficulties in the genus. The plant was
   first described as a variety (C. fortunei var. intermedium), thereafter
   the rank was moved to a species by Tagawa in 1938. Cyrtomium yamamotoi
   and its related taxa including five varieties of C. fortunei are
   triploid apogamous taxa with high morphological variabilities. The
   substantial morphological variations likely resulted from hybrid origins
   leading to various taxonomic complications. To determine the species
   boundary between C. yamamotoi and the C. fortunei complex, we inferred
   the phylogenetic relationships among the complex and the five related
   taxa including C. falcatum using the two widely used cpDNA regions, rbcL
   and psbA-trnH IGS. We also carefully examined the nomenclatural
   histories of eleven Cyrtomium taxa (five taxa of C. fortunei complex and
   six related taxa) and the key morphological characters. According to our
   analysis, Cyrtomium yamamotoi is likely an independent species as the
   phylogenetic results revealed that C. yamamotoi was separated from the
   C. fortunei complex while all members of C. fortunei complex formed a
   monophyletic clade.},

Title = {Anatomical Correlates of Cursoriality are Compromised by Body Size and
   Propensity to Burrow in a Group of Small Mammals (Lagomorpha)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {464-481},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Highly cursorial animals are specialised for fast, sustained running via
   specific morphological adaptations, notably including changes in limb
   segment length and mechanical advantage. Members of the order Lagomorpha
   (hares, rabbits and pikas) vary in cursorial ability; hares are
   generally highly cursorial, rabbits more frequently saltate, and pikas
   predominantly trot. Previous investigations of lagomorphs have
   identified anatomical trends correlated with this `cursoriality
   gradient', however, the phylogenetic sampling of such investigations has
   been limited to three American species, namely the American pika
   (Ochotona princeps), brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani), and
   black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Here, we expand the
   phylogenetic sample and body size range by including novel data from
   Australian samples of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and
   European hare (L. europaeus), alongside unpublished data on the Eastern
   cottontail (S. floridanus). X-ray Computed Tomography and digital
   landmarking were used to capture proportions within the appendicular
   skeleton of similar to 40 specimens of each European species. In
   doubling the number of species studied, we find the
   previously-identified morphological gradients associated with cursorial
   behaviour are complicated when evaluated in the larger sample. The
   relative length and joint velocity of limbs was found to be lower than
   predicted in European rabbits and hares. Furthermore, we present a novel
   assessment of morphological integration in the lagomorph appendicular
   skeleton, finding between-limb covariation patterns that are generally
   similar to those of other mammals. Broadly, these results suggest
   cursoriality is only one of many selective forces driving lagomorph
   skeletal evolution, with variations in body size and fossoriality
   potentially having measurable impacts.},

Title = {New records of pollen tube shower in species of Bertolonia
   (Melastomataceae) suggest that autogamy may be the rule in the genus},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that Bertolonia
   (Melastomataceae), an endemic genus to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   (AF) with 35 species, presents a strong correlation regarding species
   distribution and some floral traits. The same analyses showed that all
   species belong to three clades: marmorata (species mostly distributed in
   northern AF), formosa (species only occurring in central AF), and
   nymphaeifolia (species mostly distributed in southern AF). A rare
   delayed selfing mechanism, the pollen tube shower (PTS), was recently
   described for two species in the nymphaeifolia Glade; however, this
   mechanism may also be prevalent in species of the other clades. Here, we
   investigated the potential occurrence of PTS in two other species of the
   genus: B. violacea (marmorata Glade) and B. acuminata (nymphaeifolia
   Glade). We also investigated species, as well as herbarium specimens,
   searching for potential evidence of floral traits that could suggest the
   presence of an autonomous selfing mechanism in other Bertolonia species.
   Both B. violacea and B. acuminata produced seeds through PTS. We also
   observed the occurrence of PTS in two exsiccates from two different
   species: B. maculata (marmorata Glade) and Bertolonia sp. Taxonomic data
   across all clades of the genus indicate the absence of herkogamy,
   presence of post-anthesis petal closure and corolla persistence on the
   floral receptacle, all traits associated with the occurrence of PTS. We
   present here empirical evidence and descriptions of floral traits that
   indicate that the genus Bertolonia is predominantly autogamous, an
   uncommon characteristic in Melastomataceae.},

Title = {Decoupling in Diversification and Body Size Rates During the Radiation
   of Phyllodactylus: Evidence Suggests Minor Role of Ecology in Shaping
   Phenotypes},

Volume = {49},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that several taxa exhibit a decoupled
   relationship between lineage species diversification (the balance
   between speciation and extinction) and phenotypic diversification. This
   has been recognized by some authors as fundamental evidence for
   non-adaptive radiation. In the leaf-toed geckos Phyllodactylus of North
   America, there is a wide inter-specific overlap of phenotypic traits and
   high intra-specific morphological variation, despite predominantly
   allopatric distributions and the colonization of both insular and
   continental habitats. Here we demonstrate two outstanding aspects of the
   evolution of Phyllodactylus-first, that the radiation occurred with rate
   decoupling (body size and diversification), and second, that the
   contributions of island colonizations to the genus' diversification
   (phenotypic and species) have been of the same magnitude as those of
   continental habitats. Phyllodactylus diversification has proceeded with
   minimal ecological influence, as suggested by the identification of
   limited phenotypic diversity, evidenced by the wide representation of
   one morphotype (shared in island and mainland environments) and limited
   disparity (body size and shape) for long periods of time. Conversely,
   some head traits like snout length have increased in disparity in recent
   times. Most likely, snout length is being shaped by selective pressures
   associated with the differential exploitation of insular and continental
   trophic niches. The decoupling of rates (diversification and body size
   evolution), long periods of morphological stasis (body size and shape),
   overlapping of traits in the morphological space, and minimal ecological
   influence on the evolution of body size suggest that Phyllodactylus has
   proliferated following the tempo and mode of a non-adaptive radiation.},

Title = {Bite Force Performance from wild Derived mice has Undetectable
   Heritability Despite Having Heritable Morphological Components},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {434-448},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fitness-related traits tend to have low heritabilities. Conversely,
   morphology tends to be highly heritable. Yet, many fitness-related
   performance traits such as running speed or bite force depend critically
   on morphology. Craniofacial morphology correlates with bite performance
   in several groups including rodents. However, within species, this
   relationship is less clear, and the genetics of performance, morphology
   and function are rarely analyzed in combination. Here, we use a half-sib
   design in outbred wild-derived Mus musculus to study the morphology-bite
   force relationship and determine whether there is additive genetic
   (co-)variance for these traits. Results suggest that bite force has
   undetectable additive genetic variance and heritability in this sample,
   while morphological traits related mechanically to bite force exhibit
   varying levels of heritability. The most heritable traits include the
   length of the mandible which relates to bite force. Despite its
   correlation with morphology, realized bite force was not heritable,
   which suggests it is less responsive to selection in comparison to its
   morphological determinants. We explain this paradox with a non-additive,
   many-to-one mapping hypothesis of heritable change in complex traits. We
   furthermore propose that performance traits could evolve if pleiotropic
   relationships among the determining traits are modified.},

Title = {The Early-Life ``Programming{''} of Anxiety-Driven Behaviours in
   Adulthood as a Product of Predator-Driven Evolution},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In mammals, a persistent increase in anxiety affects animal's behavioral
   activities in adulthood consistently and might be ``programmed{''} by
   early-life adverse events permanently. The ``programming{''} of anxiety
   in adult subjects by severe neonatal events like cerebral
   hypoxia-ischemia or prolonged maternal separation is well established.
   By contrast, the age of onset of anxiety-related behavioral changes
   triggered by neonatal events of marginal intensity such as mild anoxia
   or a short-term exposure to glucocorticoids remains elusive to date.
   Here we studied anxiety-driven behaviors demonstrated in the elevated
   plus maze (EPM), in the marble burying (MB) and in the light-dark box
   (LDB) tests in adolescent and adult rats pre-exposed to an acute anoxic
   event and/or a single injection of synthetic glucocorticoid
   dexamethasone on postnatal day 2. Adult rats pre-exposed neonatally to
   hypoxia and dexamethasone demonstrated decreased activities either in
   the EPM or in the MB tests. Both exposures influenced anxiety-related
   activities as independent factors of similar strength, with additive
   impact on behaviors. In adolescent animals, the earliest behavioral
   changes detected after neonatal exposure to anoxia and glucocorticoids
   were found in the MB test at the age of one month. The findings
   evidenced that neonatal events of marginal intensity are capable of
   triggering a subsequent persistent increase in anxiety-driven behaviours
   in mammals, which might be detected in the adolescent age already. The
   identified within-generation early-life ``programming{''} of mammalian
   anxiety by stress hormones and hypoxia might be considered as a possible
   product of prolonged predator-driven evolution and depicted like a
   signal-detection-theory payoff matrix.

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Oceanic islands have isolated biota, which typically include many
   endemic species. However, island endemics are vulnerable due to small
   population sizes, and they are often threatened by habitat destruction
   or by introduced pests and predators. Adequate conservation planning
   requires good information on genetic variability and population
   structure, also when seemingly viable species are considered. Here, I
   analysed the genetic structure in the terrestrial orchid Dactylorhiza
   foliosa, which is endemic to Madeira. This species is a characteristic
   component of evergreen laurel forests occupying the northern slopes of
   the island. Levels of diversity in both the plastid genome and in the
   nuclear genome were comparable to levels of diversity found in congeners
   growing in continental regions. Within populations, plants separated by
   distances up to 256 m shared plastid haplotypes significantly more often
   than plants at random, but when nuclear markers were considered, only
   plants growing closer than eight metres were significantly more closely
   related. Analysis of plastid marker variation revealed that gene
   dispersal by seeds is not sufficiently large to counterbalance the
   accumulation of mutations that build up divergence between the most
   distant populations. However, differentiation in the nuclear genome was
   considerably smaller, suggesting that gene dispersal by pollen is much
   more efficient than gene dispersal by seeds in D. foliosa. The overall
   pollen to seed dispersal ratio, mp/ms, was 7.30. Considering genetic
   parameters, conditions for long-term persistence of D. foliosa on
   Madeira seem to be good.},

Title = {Ability of rbcL and matK DNA barcodes to discriminate between montane
   forest orchids},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Orchidaceae is among the largest plant families in the world; that is
   why it is notoriously difficult to identify species using traditional
   taxonomic methods. This problem is especially apparent in the Andean
   region of South America, a global hotspot for orchid diversity. Plant
   DNA barcoding has been proposed to help with orchid species
   discrimination. However, the utility of the rbcL and matK DNA barcode
   markers to discriminate between orchid species still needs
   investigating. The goal of this study is to determine the utility of the
   rbcL and matK DNA barcode markers to discriminate orchid species from a
   localized Andean montane forest in Ecuador. A total of 174 samples from
   the Siempre Verde Preserve, Ecuador, were sequenced, returning 51 unique
   rbcL and 81 unique matK barcode gene region sequences. Similar rates of
   sequencing success, rbcL (76\%) and matK (75\%), were found for both
   gene regions. Sequences were then queried to GenBank, where top matches
   were compared to the taxonomic identification of samples. Analysis of
   132 unique orchid sequences indicated that, overall, the matK gene
   region was more robust for species (63\%) and genus level (78\%)
   discrimination compared to the rbcL gene region (species: 29\%; genus:
   36\%). However, for 11 of 29 genera, rbcL and matK had similar success
   at genus level discrimination. Collectively, results emphasize the
   utility of the matK DNA barcode for the discrimination of orchid taxa
   and the importance of incorporating taxonomic and genetic methods when
   investigating the identity of plant species from complex groups.},

Abstract = {Morphoanatomical features can provide useful information for plant
   taxonomy. In Oxalis sect. Polymorphae (Oxalidaceae) there are currently
   12 accepted species, mostly from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, but the
   historical recognition of some infraspecific taxa may have resulted in
   underscored species richness. Integrated analyses of additional types of
   data are critical to evaluate if some taxa would be better recognized at
   species level. To evaluate this, we carried out leaf morphoanatomical
   analysis of O. neuwiedii subsp. neuwiedii and O. neuwiedii subsp.
   pardoensis and a phylogenetic analysis of nrITS sequences. Both leaf
   morphoanatomy and phylogenetics lend support to recognize O. neuwiedii
   subsp. pardoensis at species level. Leaflet venation pattern, epidermal
   cell outline, hair-covering, vascular conformation of the pulvina, and
   tissue organization in the midvein were the main morphoanatomical
   diagnostic features for the recognition of two species instead of a
   single one. A new rank and the second-step lectotypification are
   proposed for this taxon, raising to 13 accepted species in O. sect.

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Based on molecular and morphological evidence, two species of Seseli
   sect. Eriocycla subsect. Cordata are described as a new genus, Shomalia.
   The new genus is related to the Iranian endemic genus Azilia; the taxa
   have the following common diagnostic features: similar plant
   architecture, imparipinnate leaves, leaf segments ovate or orbiculate,
   with obtuse or cuneate basis and dentate or dissected margin coming down
   over abaxial surface, up to five linear bracts present, and late
   blooming and fruiting. At the same time, Shomalia, gen. nov. differs
   from Azilia in carpological features: it has elongated or lanceolate
   mericarps, terete in cross-section, covered with non-branching simple
   hairs or glabrous (vs. elliptic glabrous mericarps strongly compressed
   from the dorsal side in Azilia), morphology of the underground part
   (multi-branched woody rootstock vs. thickened and non-branching
   rootstock), and number of stems (numerous vs. solitary).},

Title = {Phylogeny, biogeography, and character evolution in the genus Scilla

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Scilla s.l. is taxonomically one of the most problematic genera of the
   Asparagaceae. Within the last few decades, several genera were
   segregated from this genus; however, there is still no consensus on the
   taxonomic status of Scilla segregates. Although some previous studies
   indicated a polyphyletic origin for the genus Scilla, there has been no
   comprehensive phylogenetic study focusing on the entire complex
   including Chionodoxa, Prospero, Puschkinia, and the recently described
   Gemicia. To achieve this, we evaluated three plastid regions, namely
   rbcL, trnL-F, and matK, for 79 accessions. The monophyly of Puschkinia
   and Prospero was supported by our phylogenetic analyses; however,
   Chionodoxa and Gemicia were placed into a clade with representatives of
   the S. bifolia species group. While our divergence time estimation
   analysis indicated a Miocene origin for all studied genera of
   polyphyletic Scilla s.l., the results of our ancestral area and
   ancestral state analyses showed that Scilla, Prospero, Chionodoxa, and
   Puschkinia, together with Brimeura Salisb., Bellevalia, Hyacinthella,
   and Alrawia, probably had a most recent common ancestor without a
   perianth tube and a corona, and with a non-papillate testa surface,
   which evolved about 36 Ma in the Mediterranean region.},

Title = {Stamen and pollen development in Menispermaceae with contrasting

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Menispermaceae, stamens can occur as free stamens or synandrous
   stamens, but few studies have investigated the development of these
   different types. Androecium development in Sinomenium acutum, Stephania
   japonica and Cyclea racemosa was observed in detail by scanning electron
   microscopy and light microscopy. The results showed the following: (1)
   The development and morphology of stamens differed among the three
   genera, and the stamen primordia exhibited different patterns. A total
   of 9 free-stamen primordia developed independently in the staminate
   flowers of S. acutum, and 6 occurred in the pistillate flowers. At
   anthesis, all 9 stamens in the staminate flowers of S. acutum were
   fertile, and 6 staminodes were detected in the pistillate flowers. In
   the staminate flowers of S. japonica and C. racemosa, a congenitally
   united stamen primordium developed from the central remaining
   meristematic zone through enlargement of the early floral primordia and
   became a synandrous structure consisting of 2 (C. racemosa) or 3-4 (S.
   japonica) stamens. (2) All three genera exhibited a basic-type anther
   wall composed of 5-6 layers of cells, including 2 layers of irregular
   tapetum cells. A glandular tapetum was present in S. acutum and C.
   racemosa, whereas an amoeboid tapetum was observed in S. japonica. (3)
   Meiosis of the microspore mother cells occurred with simultaneous
   cytokinesis, and the tetrads were tetrahedral and occasionally
   symmetrical. At anthesis, the pollen of all three genera was 2-celled,
   the pollen of S. japonica was triporate, and the other species had
   tricolpate pollen. (4) In family Menispermaceae, free stamens was the
   ancestral form, and synandrous stamens may have multiple evolutionary
   origins because this family does not form a single clade. Among
   angiosperms, four families (Menispermaceae, Balanophoraceae,
   Apodanthaceae and Rafflesiaceae) exhibit congenitally fused stamens.},

Title = {Chloroplast phylogenies of Australasian Gleichenia ferns
   (Gleicheniaceae) reveal incongruence with current taxonomy, and frequent
   long-distance dispersal},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Gleichenia (Gleicheniaceae) is a genus of distinctive branching ferns
   well represented in Australasia (Australia, New Caledonia, and New
   Zealand) where seven of the total eleven species occur. Published
   chloroplast phylogenies have shown that G. dicarpa is polyphyletic in
   New Zealand, and that one species from Madagascar and Reunion previously
   included in Gleichenia represented a separate newly-recognised genus,
   Rouxopteris. Here, chloroplast rbcL, trnL-trnF and combined trnL-trnF
   and rps4-trnS phylogenies are produced for all Australasian species.
   Australasian species formed a clade sister to the type of Gleichenia, G.
   polypodioides, confirming their placement in Gleichenia. Gleichenia
   dicarpa occurred in three major clades, which also contained other
   species or undescribed forms. The three separate lineages of G. dicarpa
   were morphologically distinct from these other species or forms;
   however, the three separate chloroplast lineages of G. dicarpa are
   difficult to morphologically distinguish from each other. Further study
   is required to elucidate whether the polyphyly of G. dicarpa could be
   due to unrecognised cryptic species, hybridisation, or incomplete
   lineage sorting. Low rbcL variation between all Australasian species
   suggests a radiation in the last five million years and at least six
   long-distance dispersal events in Australasia are inferred, comprising
   five between Australia and New Zealand, and one between Australia and
   New Caledonia.},

Title = {What explains the variation in length of stamens and styles in a pollen
   flower? a study exemplified by Macairea radula (Melastomataceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Variations among stamens and styles are widespread in angiosperms. In
   both heteranthery and heterostyly, variation in styles and stamens is
   considered an outcome of selective forces driven mainly by pollinators.
   Macairea radula (Melastomataceae) has two stamen sets, poricidal
   anthers, pollen as the main floral resource and flowers visited by
   vibrating bees, a set of traits related to heteranthery. However,
   tristyly, which also predicts stamens differences within the same
   flower, has been proposed as a possible floral system for this species.
   We describe the variation in length of stamens and styles in two
   populations of this species considering the interaction with their
   pollinators. Both populations showed high variation in stamen and style
   lengths with length overlap between floral types. These populations also
   showed low reciprocity between stamens and styles. In one chosen
   population, where we evaluated fruit formation after controlled
   pollination and checked the individual floral types, plants were
   partially self-incompatible and there was no proportional representation
   of floral types (anisoplethy). These results suggest that M. radula does
   not follow the theoretically expected patterns of the tristylous
   systems, because there is a flexibility in all heterostylous traits
   analyzed within populations. Considering the length of bee bodies as
   well as their behavior, stamens and styles could be associated with bee
   feeding or plant reproduction, as occurs in heteranthery. Our study
   points out that the evaluation of floral systems only based in floral
   morphological traits without considering the morphology and behavior of
   pollinators may be misleading in some cases.},

Title = {Genetic structure and demographic history of Allium mongolicum based on
   SSR markers},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The population genetic structure was proved to be influenced by both
   historical events and gene flow, which can be examined by analyzing
   intraspecific differentiation and spatiotemporal population dynamics of
   a species at large spatial scale. In this study, we surveyed the
   population structure and evolutionary dynamics of 38 natural populations
   of a desert plant, Allium mongolicum Regel (Liliaceae), in northwestern
   China, using nine microsatellite loci. High genetic diversity was
   observed within populations, with mean allele diversity and the expected
   heterozygosity values of 0.689 and 0.655, respectively. The value of
   expected heterozygosity (He = 0.655) was higher than that of observed
   heterozygosity (Ho = 0.317), which indicated an excess of homozygosity
   within populations, which could be due to inbreeding. The gene flow
   among populations was high (N-m = 1.245) while the genetic
   differentiation among populations was low (F-st = 0.169). However, a
   distinct regional-scale differentiation was discerned among three
   geographical regions. Our results further detected considerably
   restricted but asymmetric gene flow among the three regions. The
   demographic dynamic analysis also detected an ancient population
   contraction and subsequent expansion during 0.11-0.33 Ma. These results
   suggested that both gene flow and population contraction/expansion
   caused by climate oscillations in ancient time played an important role
   in forming the population structure and accelerating the regional-scale
   differentiation of the desert plant. Our results further enforce the
   idea that the aridification and subsequent desert expansion/contraction
   since Pleistocene have greatly promoted the habitat fragmentation, and
   subsequent plant differentiation in northwestern China.},

Title = {Genome size variation in Deschampsia cespitosa sensu lato (Poaceae) in
   Eurasia},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The grass Deschampsia cespitosa is a variable taxon out of which many
   varieties, subspecies and endemic species have been separated. In this
   paper, the variation in genome size (GS) and ploidy of this grass
   including several of its subspecies and two related species in Eurasia
   was investigated by flow cytometric (FCM) measurements. GS and ploidy
   data were also related to specific environments and reproduction mode.
   Ploidy levels found by FCM were confirmed by chromosome counts of
   diploid (2n = 28) and tetraploid (2n = 52) samples. Seminiferous (seed
   bearing) D. cespitosa was mainly diploid (GS between 3.754 and 5.438
   pg/1C). GS variation in diploids showed a geographic pattern with a
   significant difference (H = 41,441, P < 0.001) between European (median
   = 4.377 pg) and Asian (median = 4.881 pg) accessions. Genome size (1C)
   in tetraploids ranged from 7.9426 to 9.0399 pg. Tetraploid seminiferous
   D. cespitosa was found mostly in disturbed habitats in western and
   southern Europe, while tetraploids in Asia were registered in wet Arctic
   habitats. Genome size (1C between 8.3278 and 8.8603 pg) of the
   pseudoviviparous plants (spikelets produce plantlets asexually) of wet
   habitats in central and northern Europe indicated tetraploidy. A
   putative triploid (GS 6.6817 pg) was detected in Iceland. Summing up, we
   found a high variation in GS on the geographic scale with significant
   regional differences in diploid D. cespitosa. Among the tetraploids, the
   asexually reproducing plants were bound to specific habitats, while the
   seminiferous plants showed a habitat preference similar to the diploids.},

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Abstract = {Satellite DNA is a class of tandemly repetitive sequences characterized
   by rapid evolution and high intra- and inter-specific diversification
   and is usually the major component of the constitutive heterochromatin.
   We investigated the abundance of the satDNA in 77 species of Asclepias
   from Americas, a genus of the Apocynaceae family. De novo identification
   of the most abundant satDNA sequences was performed using Tandem Repeat
   Analyzer and Repeat Explorer pipelines. The abundance of satDNA in 77
   species was determined using mapping reads, and the correlation between
   the abundance of satDNAs and clades on the phylogeny tree was estimated
   by lambda statistics using phytools R package. The repetitive sequences
   in Asclepias were mostly constitutive by transposable elements, ranged
   11.11 to 16.32\%. The satDNA ranged 0.985 to 7.732\% and we obtained 12
   satDNA sequences (call Sat1 to Sat12), being for the Sat1 we obtained
   seven families distributed across all species. The Sat2, Sat3, and
   families of Sat1 showed significant correlations with the topologies of
   the phylogenetic tree, among which some families of satDNAs displayed
   varying abundances across the main clades. We concluded that Asclepias
   is characterized by many satDNAs, and that the abundance of satDNAs is
   in accordance with the phylogeny and geographical distribution.},

Title = {Flower morphology and phylogenetic analysis of some Dioscorea species of
   the section Stenophora (Dioscoreaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The section Stenophora is the most basal clade in the phylogeny of the
   genus Dioscorea. Most of the species in the section have not been
   morphologically and embryologically investigated and phylogenetic
   relationships among species of this section are not very clear.
   Embryological features, such as the structure of anthers, pollen,
   ovules, embryo sacs etc., less undergo phenotypic variability and can be
   used as important characters for systematics and phylogeny. Comparative
   morphological and embryological analyses of the reproductive structures
   in 5 Dioscorea species of the section Stenophora (D. balcanica, D.
   caucasica, D. deltoidea, D. nipponica, D. villosa) are presented. Four
   characters, which may be significant for systematics of this section as
   well as the whole genus Dioscorea, were designated: (1) heteromorphism
   of the stamens in the male flower; (2) the structure of the stigma; (3)
   the structure of the ovule; (4) the type of female gametophyte
   development. It was shown that D. balcanica, D. caucasica, D. deltoidea
   are characterized by similar morphological features and differ from D.
   nipponica and D. villosa. Analysis of haplotype networks showed that the
   section Stenophora consists of genetically close species, that was
   confirmed by the phylogenetic tree of this section. The morphological
   similarity of D. balcanica, D. caucasica and D. deltoidea is consistent
   with their location on the phylogenetic tree. However, detailed
   morphological, embryological and molecular phylogenetic studies of a
   larger number of species are needed for more accurate interpretation of
   the Stenophora phylogenetic system.},

Title = {Phenotypic integration of pollination traits in a distylous species with
   high intra-individual floral variation},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Plants are modular organisms, and flowers are their reproductive
   modules. Low intra-individual variation and high phenotypic integration
   are expected for floral traits, especially in distylous plants in which
   reciprocity between morphs enhances reproductive success. However, cases
   of high intra-individual floral variations and sets of traits more
   integrated within the flowers have been reported. We evaluated the
   morphometry of a distylous species, focusing on floral variation at
   different levels (between morphs, among individuals within the same
   morph, and within individuals) and on floral integration. We selected
   flowers from both long- and short-styled morphs within a population of
   Psychotria nuda (Rubiaceae). We measured floral parts to evaluate
   variability at the different levels, using a hierarchical model to
   partition the variation. We analyzed the integration of the whole flower
   and the two intra-floral modules: pollination-mechanics traits (PMT) and
   attraction traits (AT). We found high intra-individual variation, except
   for the stigma and anthers heights which distinguished the floral
   morphs. The intra-floral integration of PMT was higher than the
   integration of AT and of the whole flower, supporting the concept of
   functional structuring through intra-floral modularity related to
   pollination accuracy. Despite expecting low variation at intra-morph
   levels, we found high intra-individual floral variation in this species.
   We described a potential functional module within the flowers; hence,
   selection on PMT may be somewhat independent of selection on other
   floral traits. The intra-individual variation, added to the high degree
   of integration of PMT, could increase the chance of reciprocity between
   the two morphs in this distylous species.},

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Exocarp anatomy of 30 species of Atraphaxis has been studied to shed
   light on possible diagnostic and phylogenetic significance of
   carpological characters. The diversity of the exocarp structure observed
   in Atraphaxis was comparable to that in the entire tribe Polygoneae. The
   size of the exocarp cells, the size and shape of the lumen and its
   branching were the most variable. The radial size of the exocarp cells
   and the thickening of the walls determined the size and shape of the
   lumen in the exocarp cells of ripe fruits. The occurrence of the types
   of the exocarp cells among species of Atraphaxis only partly confirmed
   an earlier morphology-based division of the genus into three sections.
   Optimizations of the evolution of exocarp characters using parsimony on
   plastid phylogeny of Atraphaxis showed homoplastic changes in many
   characters and the absence of subclades with unique synapomorphies. Some
   new species identified using plastid data were confirmed by exocarp
   characters. Species with thick exocarp are distributed mainly in
   mountain regions of Central Asia, whereas species with thin exocarp are
   widespread in steppes and semi-deserts of Eurasia. Fruit coloration
   associated with the amount of phenolic compounds in the exocarp cells
   might be related to differences in the timing of seed germination.
   Species with light-brown fruits are widespread, while those with dark or
   black fruits are mostly local endemics.},

Title = {Palynological study of Asian Thismia (Thismiaceae: Dioscoreales) reveals
   an unusual pollen type},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {307},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The mycoheterotrophic genus Thismia shows a great number of structural
   and ecological traits which are rare or unique for angiosperms. Pollen
   morphology of this genus is still poorly known. Pollen of Thismia was
   reported to be porate with one to several pores. Position of the pores
   is unknown, and therefore, the pollen type has not been established to
   date. Information on sporoderm structure in the genus is scarce, as
   high-quality images of pollen grains are available for several species
   only. In our comprehensive investigation of pollen morphology of
   Thismia, we involved nine Asian species of the genus and employed an
   integrative approach, which included data from light microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. All
   studied species were shown to possess monoporate pollen of
   asymmetric-elliptic planoconvex shape. Using TEM investigation of
   immature anthers, we demonstrated that pollen grains are organized in
   tetragonal tetrads, and the pore occupies an equatorial position. We
   argue that Asian species of Thismia along with Burmannia from the same
   order Dioscoreales are the only known lineages of seed plants with a
   single equatorial aperture. The sporoderm surface is psilate or
   perforate with perforations of various size and density in the studied
   species. We discuss the interspecific variation of sporoderm morphology
   in the light of the phylogenetic relationships between Asian species of
   Thismia. We demonstrate that the pollen morphology of Thismia fails to
   conform to the idea of entomophily, which is believed to prevail in this
   genus. Finally, we describe an unexpected striking difference in
   sporoderm structure between the specimens belonging to T. javanica
   species group.},

Abstract = {Recent increases in wildlife cause negative impacts on humans through
   both economic and ecological damage, as well as the spread of pathogens.
   Understanding the population dynamics of wildlife is crucial to develop
   effective management strategies. However, it is difficult to estimate
   accurate and precise population size over large spatial and temporal
   scales because of the limited data availability. We addressed these
   issues by first fitting a random encounter and staying time (REST) model
   based on camera trap data to construct an informative prior distribution
   for a capture rate parameter in a harvest-based Bayesian state-space
   model. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model that integrated
   administration data on the number of captured wild boar with the prior
   distribution of capture efficiency estimated by camera trap data. The
   model with informative prior distribution from the REST model
   successfully estimated population dynamics, whereas the model using only
   the administration data did not, owing to a lack of parameter
   convergence. We identified areas where (1) wild boars exhibit a high
   potential population growth rate and a high carrying capacity, (2)
   current trapping efforts are effectively suppressing local populations,
   and (3) trapping reinforcement is required to control populations in the
   whole region. The model could be used to predict future trends in
   populations under the assumptions of ongoing trapping pressure. This
   will help identify spatially explicit trapping efforts to achieve target
   population levels.},

Title = {Transient persistence of bobcat (Lynx rufus) occurrence throughout a

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Human developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations
   globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx
   rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs
   throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may
   be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our
   objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of
   bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the
   northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat
   occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We
   established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode
   Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models,
   we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount
   of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub
   cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization.
   Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level
   extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters.
   Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively
   influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy
   was high, >0.8, throughout much of the study area (49\%), but we also
   found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would
   change occurrence status from season to season at approximate to 0.27 in
   the majority of the study area (70\%). Our results show that although
   bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require
   contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road
   infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road
   mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population.},

Abstract = {Several floral traits in Papilionoideae (Fabaceae) have been correlated
   to certain pollination mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
   20 qualitative and 21 quantitative floral traits of 17 species of
   Papilionoideae with keel flowers from various tribes and genera native
   to Salta, Argentina, which are representative of the four general
   pollination mechanisms described for the subfamily. We performed field
   and laboratory studies, including description of morphology,
   micro-morphology, position, size, and synorganization of all floral
   organs. Correlation between floral traits and a particular pollination
   mechanism was evaluated through a principal component analysis (PCA).
   According to our results, species with the same pollination mechanism
   share similar qualitative and quantitative traits, the latter being the
   most relevant, according to our statistical analysis.},

Title = {A pentaploid endosperm and a Penaea-type embryo sac are likely
   synapomorphies of Azorella (Apiaceae, Azorelloideae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {About 80\% of angiosperms form a monosporic Polygonum-type embryo sac,
   whereas in the remaining species, eleven other types of embryo sac are
   found. Evidence as to the type of embryo sac is lacking for many plant
   species, and the role of higher-ploidy endosperm is unknown. In contrast
   to the rest of the Apiaceae, where a Polygonum-type embryo sac (3n
   endosperm) has been reported, the few species of the Azorelloideae
   studied to form a Drusa-type embryo sac (3n endosperm) or a Penaea-type
   embryo sac (5n endosperm). This variation within Azorelloideae makes
   this subfamily, and its genus Azorella in particular, a good candidate
   for studying the evolutionary importance of the embryo sac and endosperm
   in diversification. We studied the variation in the type of embryo sac
   and the ploidy level of the endosperm in Andean-Patagonian Azorella and
   closely related Pozoa on a sample of 101 individuals from 31 populations
   of 21 species. We employed flow cytometric seed screening and calibrated
   the results of ploidy level estimation against embryological
   observations. In addition, we examined the genome size variation of the
   species sampled. All species of Azorella formed Penaea-type embryo sacs
   and a pentaploid endosperm, whereas one species of Pozoa formed triploid
   and the other tetraploid endosperms. Variations in the type of embryo
   sac and endosperm ploidy have probably shaped the evolution of the
   different lineages of Azorelloideae in the southern Andes. A Penaea-type
   embryo sac, which represents a likely synapomorphy of Azorella, is a
   feature of underestimated significance in the evolution of angiosperms.},

Title = {From East Asia to Beringia: reconstructed range dynamics of Geranium
   erianthum (Geraniaceae) during the last glacial period in the northern
   Pacific region},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Geranium erianthum is an alpine plant growing in dry habitats, which is
   distributed from East Asia to northern coastal regions of the northern
   Pacific. The ice-free area around the current Bering Strait (i.e.,
   Beringia) had played an important role in range expansion into
   neighboring regions such as East Asia and North America for some alpine
   plants. However, recent studies suggest that some alpine plants in
   snowbed environment spread from East Asia to northern coastal regions of
   the northern Pacific. In this study, we investigated phylogenetic
   relationships and genetic differentiations among populations of G.
   erianthum and the related species using the chloroplast genome and
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms, to evaluate the alternative
   biogeographic hypotheses in which region of Beringia, British Columbia
   or East Asia is probable for its distributional origin. Range
   reconstruction based on phylogenetic tree of chloroplast genome
   indicated G. erianthum and related species originated in East Asia, from
   where G. erianthum migrated eastward into Beringia and British Columbia.
   In addition, nuclear genome-wide SNPs indicated that no significant
   genetic differentiation was detected between Japanese and Beringian
   populations. The lack of genetic differentiation suggests that the
   current range of G. erianthum resulted from rapid range expansion during
   the latter period of the last glacial era. Overall, the East Asian
   refugium hypothesis was applicable to the alpine plant G. erianthum in
   dry habitat, indicating that range expansion pattern from East Asia into
   the northern Pacific may be more common rather than limited for snowbed
   species.},

Title = {Morphometric analysis of the Saccharum complex (Poaceae, Andropogoneae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Saccharum s.l. comprises 35-40 species, including sugarcane (S.
   officinarum), and is distributed in the tropics and subtropics. The term
   ``Saccharum complex{''} refers to four related genera: Saccharum,
   Erianthus s.l. (including E. sect. Ripidium, or Tripidium), Narenga, and
   Sclerostachya. Miscanthus and Miscanthidium are also closely related to
   this group. The delimitation of these genera is contentious and largely
   unresolved, with most species recognized under Saccharum. This study
   aimed to assess the morphological variation of the Saccharum complex,
   especially Saccharum s.s. and Erianthus s.l., and contribute to
   clarifying their generic circumscriptions. To accomplish this purpose,
   31 exomorphological characters (17 qualitative and 14 quantitative) were
   analyzed using cluster (UPGMA) and discriminant analyses. The existence
   of significant differences among groups was analyzed by a one-way
   MANOVA. The morphological evidence clearly indicated three groups: (1)
   Saccharum s.s. from the Old World, (2) Tripidium + some species of
   Saccharum s.l. sometimes recognized as Narenga, Miscanthus, or
   Miscanthidium (all taxa from the Old World), and (3) Erianthus s.s. from
   the New World. The results support that the native species from the New
   World (Erianthus s.s.) are morphologically different from the species of
   Saccharum s.s. often cultivated, suggesting that Erianthus should be
   accepted as a genus distinct from Saccharum. For the species of
   Tripidium, we provide the morphological traits that distinguish them
   from Saccharum s.s. and Erianthus s.s. and revalidate the recent
   differential recognition postulated by molecular works.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {21-30},
Abstract = {Experimental works are devoted to research the efficiency of
   deamonization and de-nitrogenation of wastewater during treatment in a
   biodisk installation. Working hypothesis ??? immobilization of the
   microbiocenosis can provide simultaneous deep treatment of wastewater
   from organic compounds and inorganic nitrogen-containing compounds. The
   purpose of this work is to assess the efficiency of purification of
   highly concentrated organic pollutants and mineralized wastewater from
   nitrogen compounds in a biodisk installation and to determine the main
   ecological-trophic groups of microorganisms included in the immobilized
   nitrogen-transforming microbiocenosis. Methods of research of
   immobilized microbiocenosis ??? microbiological. physiological,
   biochemical (inhibitory experiments), natural and model wastewater ???
   hydrochemical. It has been established that in microbiocenosis
   immobilized on disks conditions that allow heterotrophic and autotrophic
   microorganisms to actively metabolize organic and inorganic compounds
   under aerobic and anoxidic conditions are created. The quantitative
   indicators of the influence on the kinetics of the processes of the
   concentration of organic substances in the treated wastewater have been
   determined. On the basis of microbiological, physiological and
   biochemical studies in the immobilized microbiocenosis, ammonium-acid
   bacteria (and, possibly, archaea) nitrite-acid and denitrifying bacteria
   were found, and in the absence of organic substances in the environment
   ??? anammox bacteria. Moreover, in the biofilm that was formed in the
   absence of organic substances in the environment, the activity of
   anammox bacteria in deamonization significantly exceeded the activity of
   ammonium oxidizing bacteria and archaea. The obtained results and
   quantitative requirements were used in the organization of real
   wastewater treatment in a biodisc plant in industrial conditions.},

Title = {The Distribution, Nesting Habits and Status of Threatened Vulture
   Species in Protected Areas of Central India},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {7-22},
Abstract = {Protected Area (PA) establishment is one of the commoner strategies for
   wildlife conservation, but the effectiveness of these developments is
   rarely evaluated in terms of species' performance. This article assesses
   the effectiveness of PAs of Central India, using an assessment of
   threatened vulture species. These species may be considered as keystone
   species in this region. Relevant parameters considered for assessment
   comprised: (i) the presence and population density of vultures in PAs
   compared with those in unprotected forests and agricultural landscapes;
   (ii) counts of the breeding population, nesting preferences and
   environmental factors for such variables; and (iii) the impacts of
   policies designed to combat the effects of the deadly diclofenac drug on
   vulture populations. Quantitative (total counts of vultures and nests,
   transect surveys) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews, secondary
   data surveys) methodologies were used in data collection, to provide an
   adequate information base. White-rumped, Long-billed, Egyptian and
   Red-headed vultures (resident) and Cinereous Vulture, Eurasian Griffon
   and Himalayan Griffon (migratory) were recorded in PAs. The probability
   of vulture occupancy was significantly higher in PAs (44-51\%), than in
   unprotected forest (17.6-17.8\%) and agricultural areas (0.03\%). The
   average vulture density in PAs (0.529 +/- 0.228 km(-2)) was also much
   higher than in unprotected forest (0.014 +/- 0.012 km(-2)) and
   agricultural areas. The presence of active, inactive and abandoned nests
   in PAs revealed favorable habitat conditions for breeding, potential
   breeding and floater vulture categories. Disturbance factors were
   insignificant. The statutory ban on diclofenac use had a significant
   impact on vulture populations within the PAs, but this factor was
   insignificant in surrounding areas. These findings indicate a positive
   role of PAs in conservation, with insignificant impacts of the
   diclofenac ban across different types of landcover. It is concluded that
   increased promotion of environmental education is important to ensure
   effective vulture conservation and the success of PAs.},

Abstract = {The aim is to present a summarized study of the available literature on
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia for Middle Eastern countries, in
   order to identify trends in human cryptosporidiosis and childhood
   morbidity, and to raise awareness among residents. This is necessary in
   order to address the gap in preventive measures required to mitigate the
   overall effect attributed to associated illness and its impact in the
   already water stressed Middle Eastern countries. To assess
   seroprevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia in Middle Eastern
   countries systematic review was carried out based on online articles
   published from 2010-2018. PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar,
   Science Direct, Scopus, World Bank and WHO report and scientific
   database were explored. The current study highlights the existing
   subsequent epidemiology, its seroprevalence distribution, genetic
   diversity across Middle Eastern countries since 2009. This study
   therefore will provide the platform for future research work and
   development in comprehending Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia
   epidemiology in Middle Eastern countries. It was found that lack of
   awareness, personal hygiene and sanitation facilities, poverty,
   indiscriminate eating habits are favourable infestation conditions for
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia infections. The prevalence for both
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia, is higher in developing countries
   as compared to developed countries. The originality is that it is the
   only study of its kind in the region, as such studies are still lacking
   in Middle East countries as compared to other European, Asian, American
   continents and countries.},

Abstract = {Trillium apetalon (4x) and T. tschonoskii (4x) hybridize commonly where
   both species grow sympatrically, leading to the formation of tetraploid
   T. miyabeanum in Hokkaido, Japan. The present study aimed to determine
   which isolation factor is responsible for the frequency and asymmetry of
   hybrid T. miyabeanum formation in a sympatric population of T. apetalon
   and T. tschonoskii. We examined the contributions and strengths of four
   reproductive isolation barriers of T. miyabeanum formation: flowering
   phenology, breeding system, genetic isolation, and hybrid inviability.
   In addition, we also investigated the effect of flowering phenology on
   reproductive success (i.e., seed production and outcrossing rates) and
   outputs (i.e., ovule production) for T. apetalon and T. tschonoskii. We
   calculated the absolute contribution of each isolation barrier to the
   total reproductive isolation and found that flowering phenology and
   differences in breeding systems between the two parental species were
   more effective when T. apetalon was the maternal parent. Furthermore,
   hybrids with T. apetalon as the maternal parent had lower viability than
   those of the reciprocal cross and did not reach the flowering stage.
   Particularly, absolute contribution of premating isolation, especially
   by flowering phenology and breeding system, was higher than that of
   other isolation factors for both crossing directions. For the formation
   of T. miyabeanum, we concluded that asymmetry of hybridization between
   T. apetalon and T. tschonoskii would be caused by strong premating
   isolations. The asymmetry of the isolating barriers may promote T.
   tschonoskii as the maternal parent of T. miyabeanum.},

Title = {The evolutionary history of Fouquieriaceae (Ericales): biogeography,
   growth habit, habitat colonization, and chromosome evolution},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fouquieriaceae consists of a single genus Fouquieria with eleven species
   occurring in arid and semiarid regions in Mexico and the southwestern
   USA. A recently developed phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA sequences
   provided strong support for the monophyly of the genus and the
   evolutionary species relationships. However, details of its evolutionary
   history remain unclear. Due to this uncertainty, additional information
   such as the evolution on its growth habit, reconstruction of the
   ancestral habitat, and on chromosome evolution is needed for a clear
   understanding of its evolutionary history. Different hypotheses
   concerning the shift of growth habits (succulent or woody) and the
   occupation of the ancestral habitat, and the chromosomal evolution in
   the family were analyzed. We assessed the ancestral distribution by
   fitting different biogeographic models. Our results suggest that
   Fouquieriaceae may have originated in two regions at the margins of the
   present geographic distribution of the genus: the Sonoran Desert and
   desert areas south of the Mexican Transvolcanic Belt. However, our
   results suggest that the ancestral lineage of Foquieriaceae was
   originated in desert habitats in central-southern Mexico with a basal
   chromosome number of n = 12, and a succulent habit, all of which may
   have allowed the dispersion of polyploid species to newly developed dry
   environments during the Late Miocene.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems play an essential role in climate stabilization, and
   the study of influence of climate change on their biomass and carbon
   depositing is of paramount importance. The objective of this study was
   (a) to verify the operation of the law of the limiting factor at the
   transcontinental level when modeling changes in the biomass of trees and
   stands of the two-needled subgenus Pinus sp. of Eurasia in relation to
   geographically determined indicators of temperatures and precipitation,
   and (b) to show the possibility of using the constructed
   climate-conditioned models of tree and stand biomass in predicting
   temporal changes in tree and stand biomass based on the principle of
   space-for-time substitution. As a result of the implementation of the
   principles of the limiting factor and space-for-time substitution, a
   common pattern has been established on tree and stand levels: in
   sufficiently moisture-rich climatic zones, an increase in temperature by
   1 degrees C with a constant amount of precipitation causes an increase
   in aboveground biomass, and in moisture-deficient zones - its decrease;
   in warm climatic zones, a decrease in precipitation by 100 mm at a
   constant average January temperature causes a decrease in aboveground
   biomass, and in cold climatic zones - its increase.},

Title = {Quantitative documentation of traditionally used medicinal plants and
   their significance to healthcare among the Mishing community of
   Northeast India},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Mishing community is one of the major tribal communities residing in
   Northeastern India. They have adapted their lifestyle with one of the
   adverse conditions and their reliance on plants for food and medicine is
   widely prevalent. This article presents an explorative ethnobotanical
   survey on documentation of plants used by the Mishing community of Assam
   in treating the common ailments as well as their mode of preparation and
   administration. Research was conducted in eight villages from four
   districts of Assam. Various participatory interaction methods, group
   discussions and semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with a
   total of 80 respondents. Plant importance analysis was done using four
   quantitative indices (Use value, Use report, Informant consensus factor
   and Fidelty level). In total, 153 plants under 126 genera and 62
   families are recorded. Fabaceae (11 spp.) was the most dominant family
   and Clerodendrum and Solanum (5 spp. each) were the most dominant
   genera. The highest use values were recorded for Musa balbisiana (0.087)
   followed by Paederia foetida (0.075). Kidney stone has the highest
   Informant Consensus Factor value of 0.97 with 74 use reports for 3
   species. A total of 7 species were found to have >= 90\% Fidelty Level
   and Cissus quadrangularis recorded the highest value, i.e. 93.7\% FL for
   treating bone fracture with 75 use reports. In addition, a review of
   ethnomedicinal plants published in earlier literature for the community
   is presented, and 77 plants are reported as new ethnomedicinal records
   for the community. A list of bioactive compounds found in the presently
   reported plants is also listed. Though modern health facilities have
   gained pace in the developing countries like India, traditional medicine
   still co-exists with tribal communities as these are the nearest and
   reliable forms of treatment in Assam, exemplified by the high degree of
   reliance on it.},

Abstract = {The adaptive radiation of flowering plants as manifested by the floral
   diversity has long been considered associated with the diversity of
   plant-pollinator interactions, because changes in plant-pollinator
   interactions are hypothesized as one of the major mechanisms driving
   plant ecological speciation. To understand the relative contributions of
   various mechanisms for plant radiation, including pollinator changes, it
   is useful to study a plant group for which comparative study of the
   species life history across the whole lineage is feasible. To this end,
   we will focus on the plant lineages that have presumably radiated in the
   Japanese archipelago, namely, the genera Asimitellaria, Asarum, and
   Arisaema. By comparing these three genera, we will comment on the
   possible modes of adaptive radiation and diversification among the
   endemic flora of Japan.},

Title = {The habitat use and trophic niche comparisons among closely related land

Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {282-299},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The diversification of phenotypes and species has been a major concern
   in evolutionary biology. Both resource competition and predator-prey
   interactions have been suggested as mechanisms that drive phenotypic
   divergence and speciation, but the latter has attracted much less
   attention than the former. The Karaftohelix land snails in Northeast
   Asia provide an excellent model to investigate the effects of
   competition and predation on the divergence process. This is because (1)
   all species-especially Karaftohelix editha and Karaftohelix gainesi in
   northern Japan-are closely related and sometimes indistinguishable by
   genital morphologies and neutral nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers,
   despite the distinct phenotypes among species; (2) two different
   anti-predatory strategies (i.e., passive and active defenses) are
   observed for each species in this group; and (3) multiple species have
   generally overlapping distributions and were often observed at exactly
   the same time and place. In this study, we conducted quantitative
   quadrat surveys and carbon/nitrogen stable isotope analyses to compare
   the microhabitat and trophic niches among Karaftohelix land snails and
   estimated the cause of adaptive radiation in this taxon. All the results
   indicated that the differences in microhabitats and trophic niches among
   Karaftohelix land snails-especially between the most closely related
   sister species, K. editha and K. gainesi in northern Japan-were too
   small to promote the adaptive radiation in this group. Therefore, it is
   difficult to explain the extreme divergence of phenotypes and species
   among Karaftohelix land snails in Northeast Asia based on environmental
   adaptation through resource competition and/or reproductive
   interference.},

Abstract = {The effect of sex-biased dispersal in mammalian ecology and evolution
   can be elucidated by focusing on maternally or paternally inherited DNA
   polymorphisms. In sika deer, the genetic structure of the maternal
   lineage has been clarified by studies based on mitochondrial DNA
   variation. However, the genetic structure of the paternal lineage has
   not been well analyzed due to the limited number of point mutations in Y
   chromosome sequences. In this study, we focused on mutations of highly
   polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the Y chromosome and
   developed 16 Y chromosome SSR markers to evaluate male-biased dispersal
   in sika deer. In total, 55 alleles and 31 multi-locus haplotypes were
   detected from these 16 loci, revealing clear genetic differentiation
   among populations (F `(ST) = 0.783). In particular, there were unique
   alleles for the native individuals on Tanegashima and Yakushima Islands
   and introduced exotic individuals from Taiwan. These markers are highly
   useful for evaluating not only historical male-mediated dispersal,
   genetic structure, and demography of the native populations in Japan,
   but also the impact of artificial introductions on hybridization,
   especially the introgression of alleles from escaped farmed individuals
   to native populations.},

Title = {`New' species are not always new: a case study of Ephedra sumlingensis

Abstract = {Historically, and even today, discovery of new species has remained one
   of the primary research activities driving the discipline of taxonomy.
   Discovering scientifically still unknown biodiversity is critical in
   addressing the taxonomic impediment which is hampering our progress to
   meet the challenges of global biodiversity crisis. However, in the rush
   to accelerate the rate of new species' discoveries, it is crucial to
   follow objective, stable and reproducible taxonomic criteria. Otherwise,
   new species' discoveries based solely on subjective, unstable and
   non-reproducible characters can be cause of artificial taxonomic
   inflation in biodiversity data with wider implications in conservation
   policy and practice. In this study, by integrating empirical evidences
   from multiple sources, we critically evaluate the validity of two
   recently described new species of Ephedra in India (E. sumlingensis and
   E. khurikensis) to underscore the fact that all `new' species are not
   always new. Use of morphologically plastic characters in diagnosis,
   discrepancies in the protologues and inconsistencies with the freshly
   collected live specimens from the type localities clearly revealed that
   both these species unambiguously fall within the circumscription of
   already known E. intermedia. With further support from robust analyses
   of morphometric and molecular data, we recognise both the species as new
   synonyms of E. intermedia. Based on the lessons learnt from this study,
   we suggest recommendations to be practised by the taxonomists to avoid
   such pitfalls in biodiversity data due to arbitrary new species'
   discoveries.},

Abstract = {Croton guaritensis, sp. nov. is here described, illustrated, and
   classified based on morphological and molecular data. The new species is
   restricted to the Pampa biome where it grows around rocky outcrops.
   Examination of the morphology from herbarium collections and field
   observations, as well as evidence from molecular analysis, indicate that
   Croton guaritensis belongs to Croton section Barhamia subsection Medea.
   Croton subsection Medea is represented by several rare and endemic
   species and stands out by its glandular structures in stipules, bracts,
   and sepals. The new species differs from other species of this
   subsection in the indumentum on branches and leaves, which consists of
   subentire lepidote trichomes, and in the sepals of staminate and
   pistillate flowers that have stipitate glands. An identification key to
   the new species and closely related taxa in southern Brazil is provided,
   as well as a preliminary conservation status.},

Title = {Leaf wax composition and distribution of Tillandsia landbeckii reflects
   moisture gradient across the hyperarid Atacama Desert},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the hyperarid Atacama Desert, water availability plays a crucial role
   in allowing plant survival. Along with scant rainfall, marine advective
   fog frequently occurs along the coastal escarpment fueling isolated
   mono-specific patches of Tillandsia vegetation. In this study, we
   investigate the lipid biomarker composition of the bromeliad Tillandsia
   landbeckii (CAM plant) to assess structural adaptations at the molecular
   level as a response to extremely arid conditions. We analyzed long-chain
   n-alkanes and fatty acids in living specimens (n = 59) collected from
   the main Tillandsia dune ecosystems across a 350 km coastal transect. We
   found that the leaf wax composition was dominated by n-alkanes with
   concentrations (total average 160.8 +/- 91.4 mu g/g) up to three times
   higher than fatty acids (66.7 +/- 40.7 mu g/g), likely as an adaptation
   to the hyperarid environment. Significant differences were found in leaf
   wax distribution (Average Chain Length {[}ACL] and Carbon Preference
   Index {[}CPI]) in the northern zone relative to the central and southern
   zones. We found strong negative correlations between fatty acid CPI and
   n-alkane ACL with precipitation and surface evaporation pointing at
   fine-scale adaptations to low moisture availability along the coastal
   transect. Moreover, our data indicate that the predominance of n-alkanes
   is reflecting the function of the wax in preventing water loss from the
   leaves. The hyperarid conditions and good preservation potential of both
   n-alkanes and fatty acids make them ideal tracers to study late Holocene
   climate change in the Atacama Desert.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {We investigated a mathematical model of the dynamics of the ecological
   system consisting of two competing perennial species, each of which
   leads a sedentary life. It is an individual-based model, in which the
   growth of each individual is described. The rate of this growth is
   weakened by competition from neighboring individuals. The strength of
   the competitors' influence depends on their size and distance to them.
   The conditions, in which the competitive exclusion of one of the
   competitors and the coexistence of both competitors take place are
   provided. The influence of the parameters responsible for the strength
   of competition, the degree of competitive asymmetry, and consideration
   of the importance of specific elements of the spatial structure of this
   ecological system on the results of the competition were analyzed. Both
   species co-exist when they are equal competitors. Permanent coexistence
   is possible only when interspecific competition is weaker than
   intraspecific. When interspecific competition is stronger, the
   coexistence of equal interspecific competitors is random. Both species
   have equal probability of extinction. If species are not equal
   competitors, the stronger one wins. This result can be modified by
   different strengths of intraspecific competition. The weaker
   interspecific competitor can permanently coexist with stronger one, when
   its individuals suffer stronger intraspecific competition.},

Abstract = {The study is focused to study the diversity and distribution of shrubs
   in the Behali Reserve Forest. A total of 46 species of shrubs belonging

   Lamiaceae were the dominant families. Pycnarrhena pleniflora has the
   highest IVI value of (48.25) followed by Coffea benghalensis (41.1).
   Plotting in Raunkiaer???s frequency class distribution it was found that
   the shrub community of BRF is heterogeneous in nature i.e. represents
   uniform species diversity which does not allow the dominance of a
   species. Among the recorded shrubs, Pycnarrhena pleniflora, Coffea
   benghalensis, Boeica filiformis, Gnetum gnemon and Dalhousiea bracteata
   has a good population status. Gnetum gnemon on the other hand a
   potential NTFP of BRF has an infrequent distribution which is due to its
   high economic value and unregulated collection. The market value of
   G.gnemon and its conservation needs are also presented.},

   different environmental conditions. The paper presents the results of
   the study of the progeny test of groups of clones of plus trees of Scots
   pine selected according to certain characteristics in Northern Steppe
   and South Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. Analysis of results showed: a
   significant improvement in the growth rates of the all testing progenies
   of seed orchard in the better climatic and soil conditions of South
   Forest-Steppe between the ages of 3 and 10 years. At the same time 4 out
   of 5 studied progenies worsened their growth indicators relative to
   local control at the age of 3 to 26 years in less optimal climatic and
   soil conditions of Northern Steppe. The leader in the steppe conditions
   was the progeny of a fraction of three clones, which had the highest
   seed productivity. The selection of the fastest growing clones and the
   rejection of the slowest growing ones had a positive effect on the
   growth of progenies of seed orchards at both test points.},

Title = {Allopolyploidisation in a geological collision zone: on the origin of

   Sicily},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The genus Anthemis has a circum-Mediterranean distribution and comprises
   c. 175 annual, biennial, and perennial species with polyploid species
   and species complexes found in its section A. sect. Hiorthia. In Sicily,
   the genus is represented by 13 species, one of these being the
   tetraploid A. cupaniana, which is endemic to the island and is
   distributed throughout the limestone mountains at elevations between 500
   and 1800 m a.s.l. Discordant positions in phylogenetic trees based on
   two plastid regions (psbA-trnH and trnC-petN) and on one nuclear marker
   (nrDNA ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2) reveal that the species is of allopolyploid
   origin, with the maternal parent from the species group around A.
   cretica and the paternal one from a monophyletic group comprising mostly
   N African representatives around A. pedunculata. Owing to the fact that
   the latter group also comprises the Sicilian perennial and diploid A.
   ismelia and that A. cretica has been found with diploid populations in
   the C Sicilian Madonie Mts, these two species are considered being the
   most probable parental diploids of A. cupaniana. The close relationship
   of A. ismelia with the N African A. pedunculata group supports the
   biogeographical interpretation of A. cupaniana being the result of a
   `collision' between diploids from the southern (African) and northern
   (Eurasian) platforms after dispersal along a Pleistocene corridor in the
   Sicilian channel.},

Title = {Different effects of two exotic herbivores on the pollinator-mediated
   effect of an exotic plant on a native plant},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Exotic plants can affect native plants indirectly through various biotic
   interactions. However, combinations of the multiple indirect effects of
   exotic plants on native plants have been rarely evaluated. Herbivory can
   either positively or negatively influence plant-pollinator interactions.
   Here, we addressed whether the pollinator-mediated plant interaction
   between exotic and native plants is altered through the introduction of
   exotic herbivores by conducting a 2-year common garden experiment. We
   compared the effects of pollinator-mediated indirect effects of an
   exotic plant, Solidago altissima, on the co-flowering native plant Aster
   microcephalus in geographically different populations reflecting
   differences in insect herbivore communities. We found a positive effect
   of co-flowering S. altissima on pollinator visitation of A.
   microcephalus, which varied between gardens and years. The co-flowering
   S. altissima did not significantly affect the seed set of A.
   microcephalus in the first year but had a negative effect in the second
   year. The facilitative effect of S. altissima on A. microcephalus
   pollination was suggested to be negatively affected by an exotic aphid,
   while it was not significantly affected by an exotic lace bug. Our study
   suggests that the phenology and feeding guilds of the herbivores may be
   critical for predicting the effect of exotic plants on native plants
   through herbivore-pollinator interactions. Integrated effects between
   plant interactions via multiple species interactions under different
   abiotic and biotic environments are necessary to understand the impact
   of exotic plants under complex interactions in nature.},

   dioecious plant, Mallotus japonicus (Euphorbiaceae)},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Month = {2022 FEB 1},
Abstract = {Among all the different organs of a plant, flowers might have one of the
   most dynamic microbial communities, since many microbes are transmitted
   during flowering by insects and pollen. However, little is known about
   how these microbes affect floral characteristics and plant reproduction.
   Among the microbes transmitted to flowers, pathogens may have highly
   negative effects on plants' fitness. In this study, we investigated
   whether a bacterial pathogen, Erwinia mallotivora, occurs on flowers of
   the host plant Mallotus japonicus, and whether the transmission of the
   pathogen to flowers can result in systemic infection and/or reduction of
   fruit production. The pathogen has been reported to infect through
   leaves, while its ecology on flowers is unknown. We first confirmed the
   presence of the pathogen on flowers, indicating possible transmission by
   visitors or pollen. Then, we showed that the bacteria can infect the
   plant through flowers by inoculating the pathogen to both male and
   female flowers. Interestingly, the symptoms on leaves appeared earlier
   on the female plants than on the males. Besides, the inoculation
   significantly decreased fruit set of the female plants. Our results
   suggest a higher cost of infection in a female than in a male once the
   pathogen infected flowers. Although the effects of pathogen infection to
   flowers have rarely investigated in wild plants, it would be an
   interesting topic for future study if such sexual differences in the
   infection cost can cause sexual conflict and intraspecific adaptation
   load.},

Abstract = {The main object of the research was to assess the forecast values of the
   weather parameters by using three-time series methods such as
   Decomposition of time series, Autoregressive (AR) model with seasonal
   dummies and Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) /Autoregressive
   Integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. A recent phenomenon in weather
   changing has disturbed the world in general and Pakistan in particular.
   In Pakistan due to climate change, flood and heat stroke have taken many
   lives. Stationarity was measured through the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
   test; results showed that some variables are I(0) and some are I(1). The
   reliability of the forecast results was examined through the goodness of
   fit test. For finding the best fit model, the performance measures of
   various models: Root Mean Squire Error, Mean Absolute Error and Mean
   Absolute Percentage Error were considered. The model in which the above
   statistics are the minimum was chosen as the appropriate model. After
   model analysis and validation, it was observed that AR-model with
   seasonal dummies was found to be the best fit model between the three
   models. Meanwhile, the forecasting for the period Jan.2018 to Dec.2018
   was made based on the best fit model. Given the future forecasting
   results, the temperature will be normal at selected stations. The wind
   and rainfall will also be present. Overall, it was suggested that the
   obtained findings of meteorological stations' weather might be normal
   for the coming few months over there, and no chance of heatstroke and
   flood might be expected. Future studies must be carried out to provide
   the awareness to well-being regarding ecological hazardous to minimize
   their economic loss through mass media.},

Title = {Resources and dynamics of halophytes in agricultural and industrial
   landscapes of the western part of Kujawy, Central Poland},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This paper presents the status and comparison of the halophytic flora on
   two research plots in the Upper Notec catchment, distinguished by the
   intensity of human activity and the type of landscape: 1 - Lake Goplo
   (G) and 2 - the area located by the Notec Canal (N) in the western part
   of the Kujawy region. Fishery on the twelfth largest lake in Poland and
   agriculture are the main forms of economy in the former plot. A
   significant part of this plot is a Natura 2000 site, legally protected
   in compliance with the EU directives. The development of halophytes,
   mainly facultative ones, in the G plot is conditioned by natural
   factors, i.e. the inflow of saline groundwater. In the N plot, the
   agricultural landscape was transformed into the industrial and urbanised
   landscape following the years of development of two soda factories and
   the municipal and housing infrastructure of the nearby town of
   Inowroclaw. Strong human impact led to the fact that already several
   decades ago this plot was classified as one of the most ecologically
   endangered areas in Poland. The abundance of halophytes in the N plot,
   including many obligatory ones, is related to the geomorphology of the
   area and the associated pattern of salt deposit leaching, as well as
   brine exploitation and soda industry. The species composition and
   population resources of individual halophyte species at 65 sites on the
   G plot and 90 sites on the N plot were compared using numerical
   classification methods. The distribution of the sites and their species
   richness are presented on the maps of the study area. The results of our
   analysis were compared with the results of observations made by other
   authors in the same area at different times. Based on the comparative
   analysis, we have arrived at conclusions regarding the protection of
   halophytes and the anticipated effects of technological changes in
   agriculture, salt and soda industry, as well as spatial management. We
   believe that the data provided in the tables and the resulting maps will
   constitute reference points for assessing the effectiveness of
   undertaken conservation recommendations and the correctness of scenarios
   formulated by different authors for the development of natural systems
   in the study area.},

Abstract = {In every section of the environment pharmaceuticals are now can be
   observed and detected. Hospitals are one of the major sources of
   pollution via either through environment or wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs). The treatment plants are not prepared for effective treatment
   of emerging contaminants (ECs). This paper further illustrates the lack
   of understanding of the ecotoxicity of certain large concentrations of
   pharmaceutical compounds in HWW (mg L-1). In order to expand this
   analysis, the ecotoxic risks associated with numerous pollution
   scenarios, particularly water-dilution and metabolite processing,
   particularly during transit inside WWPs, have now to be investigated.
   Furthermore, in hospitals, the average water demand is reported to be
   between 200-1200 L bed(-1) day(-1). Water is consumed in the hospital
   system with equivalent wastewater discharge. There is also domestic
   waste disposal in hospital fluids from kitchens, washrooms, and toilets.
   This paper reviews about characteristics of hospital wastewater,
   legislation around the globe and its paths ways in biotics system. This
   review also provides an overview of the pathways of ECs and focused few
   of its characteristics in biological treatment.},

Pages = {101-109},
Abstract = {A good condition of trees and shrubs growing in urban green areas is one
   of the key aspects of management. Plant monitoring, including
   recognition of symptoms of diseases caused by pathogenic fungi and
   prevention of their spread, is one of the ways of supporting the process
   of maintenance of green areas. The aim of the study was to conduct
   preliminary investigations of plants growing in Siberian Square in
   Warsaw infected by phytopathogenic fungi. The research carried out in
   2017-2019 in Siberian Square in Warsaw revealed that the most common
   diseases observed on the trees and shrubs were caused by powdery mildew
   fungi infecting maples, poplars, apple trees, and barberry shrubs.
   Sawadaea tulasnei, Erysiphe adunca, Erysiphe berberidis, and Podosphaera
   leucotricha (Erysiphales) were identified as the causal agents of
   powdery mildew. Pathogens causing leaf spots and leaf lesions were
   identified as Venturia inaequalis on Malus x purpurea `Ola' and Rhytisma
   acerinum on Acer platanoides. Rust caused by Melampsora laricis-populina
   (Pucciniales) and basidiomata of Pleurotus ostreatus were detected on
   infected Populus nigra `Italica' trees.},

Title = {Economic dependence of forest fringe communities on threatened and

   cover state of central India},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {People have a free access to the Non timber forest produce (NTFP) in the
   State of Madhya Pradesh, India barring only a few NTFP which are
   monopolized by the state for collection and trade. Because of such free
   access tenure, people and the policy makers have little appreciation for
   the provisional ecosystem services emanating from the state's forests.
   Hence, a research study was conducted in Madhya Pradesh state of India
   during 2014-2015.This paper evaluates the dependence of the forest
   fringe communities on the already Threatened and Near-threatened
   Medicinal Tree resources (TNMTs) in the forests of the state for their
   health and livelihood requirements.This study was conducted in all the
   six eco-regions of the state after selecting the most forested divisions
   and purposely selected forest compartments and socio-economic surveys
   were conducted in the villages adjoining these forest compartments. The
   TNMTs of these compartments were fully enumerated in the selected
   compartments and their physical conditions were recorded. Focus group
   discussions and household surveys were conducted to study the dependence
   of forest fringe communities on TNMTs in the adjoining forests. The
   results show that contribution of direct forest income to the total
   annual household income was found to vary from 29.35\% to 69.48\% in
   forest divisions located in all the six eco-regions of the state. In all
   the six eco-regions, the percentage of households found to be dependent
   on forests for some or the other benefits ranged from 96\% to 100\%.
   Almost all the TNMTs encountered during this survey were found facing
   threat of local extinction due to poor regeneration and many other
   factors at most of the forest sites. The authors have suggested some
   corrective measures for sustainable management of forest resources for
   the benefit of forest fringe community in the article.},

Title = {Plant phylogeography of the Balkan Peninsula: spatiotemporal patterns
   and processes},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Balkan Peninsula is widely acknowledged as one of the centers of
   European biodiversity and a major glacial refugium for plant species.
   Its extensive geographic heterogeneity and diverse mosaic of habitats,
   coupled with relatively high environmental stability over long periods,
   have enabled the diversification of lineages and simultaneously fostered
   the long-term survival of diverse species. The increasing number of
   phylogeographically studied plant species in the region has
   substantially contributed to a better understanding of the relationships
   among closely related taxa and provides significant insights into
   intraspecific lineage differentiation. The present paper reviews the
   current knowledge on plant phylogeography in the Balkan Peninsula. By
   providing an updated overview of the most recent studies dealing with
   the diversity and evolution of Balkan plants, we explore the
   phylogeographic patterns and roles of refugia in structuring genetic
   diversity and highlight the crucial evolutionary processes that shaped
   the diversity of plants in the region. Molecular clock-based estimations
   highlight the importance of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations across
   taxonomic groups and lineage distribution patterns corroborate the
   persistence of multiple glacial refugia. Spatial congruence in
   phylogeographic splits is determined and discussed. An examination of
   phylogeographic connections with adjacent regions (i.e., the Alps,
   Apennine Peninsula, Asia Minor, Carpathians, and central Europe)
   uncovers several consistent patterns. Additionally, allopatric and
   ecological speciation, polyploidy, and hybridization are identified as
   crucial evolutionary mechanisms acting in the Balkan Peninsula and
   shaping species diversity. Furthermore, the existing research gaps are
   identified and future approaches with the potential to better understand
   the unique Balkan flora are highlighted.},

Title = {Breeding systems of four plant communities in the Venezuelan central
   plains},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess breeding systems, and inbreeding
   and outbreeding depression in four vegetation types in the Venezuelan
   central plains: forest, ecotone, savanna and disturbed areas. Such
   analysis allowed inferring how reproductive systems are influenced by
   the structure and complexity of the vegetation. This analysis was
   conducted considering the life form, successional stage, dispersal
   syndrome, pollination system specificity, and flowering time.
   Information on sexual systems, dichogamy and herkogamy, was also
   included. Experimental pollination tests were carried out on 115 plant
   species belonging to 41 plant families. Most species were
   non-agamospermous, and tended to have a mixed breeding system: partially
   spontaneous self-pollinated, and partially xenogamous. Xenogamous and
   non-spontaneous self-pollinated species were the second most frequent
   categories, which are represented by woody species, dispersed by
   frugivores or abiotically, with polyphilous and monophilous pollination
   systems, that flower during dry periods in the forest and forest-savanna
   transition. The high incidence of partial self-incompatibility was
   associated with herbaceous species, seed dispersal by granivores and
   epizoochory, and flowering throughout the rainy period in the herbaceous
   communities. Self-incompatibility was mainly associated with the woody
   condition and flower production during the dry period in forest
   communities. The proportion of species with inbreeding depression
   increased from forest to disturbed areas, and was frequently related
   with herbs, seed dispersal by granivores and epizoochory, and flowering
   during the rainy period. Outbreeding strategies and inbreeding
   depression increased from disturbed areas to forest along with the
   increase in woody life forms, frugivory and wind dispersal, and
   flowering during drought period.},

   highlights a distinct role of dispersal in generating evolutionary
   change. The potential role for spatial sorting to facilitate or impede
   adaptation in natural populations at large spatial scales has been

Title = {Presence of native trees in rural tribal homegardens doesn't necessarily
   mean conservation: A case study from Mishmi belt of Arunachal Pradesh,
   India},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Increasing human population and various developmental activities in the
   Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which lies in one of the most
   bio-diverse regions of the world, has caused large-scale deforestation,
   pushing a large number of native tree species to the serious verge of
   elimination from their native forest. In such tribal-dominated
   landscapes around the world, myriads of studies have emphasized the
   potential of homegardens as a site for local biodiversity conservation
   as they are known to have a huge Indigenous Knowledge System (IKS) on
   the use of diverse native floras. The present study was, therefore,
   undertaken to investigate if the native communities of the Mishmi tribe
   conserved native indigenous tree species in their homegardens and if
   they are grown then what is the future of these tree species? It was
   hypothesized that harbouring greater indigenous knowledge implies
   greater domestication of tree species in their homegardens. Altogether,
   103 species of trees were recorded from 243 homegardens in the present
   study. Although the native species constituted more than half of the
   species diversity, they, however, greatly lagged in all other aspects of
   the study such as population share, frequency distribution and
   regeneration potential. Native tree species constituted just 37\% of the
   total tree population. Only two species, Bauhinia variegata L. and Alnus
   nepalensis D. Don, made up the major bulk of the native population. In
   terms of frequency distribution, only a handful of native species
   maintained a decent presence in the homegardens. Most of the native
   species grew naturally in unmanaged homegardens. The regeneration
   potential of all native species was very poor, including B. variegata.
   The study demonstrates that out of the 76 native species recorded from
   the region, only 7 species can rightfully be regarded as being
   domesticated by virtue of IKS of the Mishmi community. Our study
   concludes that the native species do exist in large number in
   homegardens of the rural tribal areas, but most of the native wild
   species exist in the rural homegardens not because they are
   planted/preferred but because they just happen to randomly grow there
   since most of the homegardens of tribal household are unmanaged or
   poorly managed, thereby giving way to wild species to germinate, at
   least until the owner decides to weed them out.},

Title = {Abundance and conservation status of Rosa gallica in Strzyzow Foothills
   (SE Poland)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {83-94},
Abstract = {Rosa gallica is a rare, threatened, and legally protected species;
   hence, research on this species is important for identification of
   threats and development of protection strategies. The aim of the study
   was to characterise plant communities with Rosa gallica and to determine
   the habitat conditions, abundance, and diversity of selected population
   traits. The study was conducted in 2016-2020 in two localities (Bukowa,
   Kolaczyce) in Strzyzow Foothills. Twenty phytosociological releves were
   made using the Braun-Blanquet method. The habitat conditions were
   assessed using Ellenberg indicator values. The following parameters were
   used to evaluate the diversity and quantitative relationships between
   the species in the analysed communities: Shannon-Wiener diversity (H'),
   Evenness (J'), and Simpson dominance (SIMP) indices. The size of the
   analysed populations was estimated based on the number of vegetative and
   generative shoots. Height was measured in 100 randomly selected shoots,
   and the number of flowers per generative shoot was additionally
   determined. Rosa gallica was part of the community with Brachypodium
   pinnatum in the Bukowa locality and occurred in the association
   Arrhenatheretum elatiorisin Kolaczyce. The diversity indices had higher
   values in Kolaczyce. The population in Bukowa covered an area of 500
   m(2) and comprised 911 (578 generative and 333 vegetative) shoots. From
   1 to 10 flowers per shoot were noted. The population from Kolaczyce
   occupied a twofold smaller area and was less numerous, i.e. 465 (168
   generative and 297 vegetative) shoots were recorded. It was also
   characterised by less abundant flowering (1-5 flowers per shoot). There
   were differences in the height of the generative and vegetative shoots.
   The parameter exhibited higher values in Bukowa (55.17 and 36.95 cm,
   respectively) than in Kolaczyce (33.79 and 26.79 cm, respectively). All
   the habitat indices (except for K and R) and the biodiversity indices
   had higher values in Kolaczyce. The present results show that Rosa
   gallica occurs in a wide range of habitats varying in light, moisture,
   and fertility requirements. It grows in different-sized clusters or
   sometimes produces single shoots. Advanced succession has a negative
   impact on the conservation status of the population, which is
   particularly evident in the Kolaczyce locality. Therefore, the
   conservation of this species will depend on active protection measures.},

Abstract = {In 2019???2020 (for 13 months), 21 macrofungi species, both native (14)
   and inadvertently introduced from warmer regions (7), were found in
   greenhouses at the Warsaw University Botanic Garden. These included 13

   and photographs are given for 5 species identified, which are new to
   Poland (Gymnopus luxurians, Hemimycena ignobilis, Leucoagaricus
   meleagris, L. rubrotinctus, and Xylaria arbuscula s.l.). The highest
   variety of species was found in the greenhouses with the collection of
   tropical and succulents and cacti, with 11 and 8 species, respectively.
   The number of species ranged from five to four in other greenhouses. The
   current results increase the number of species reported from greenhouses
   in Poland to approximately 50. None of the identified species has a
   negative impact on the growth and health of plants in the greenhouses at
   the Warsaw University Botanic Garden and at present none of them are

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was the investigation of biofilm-forming,
   hydrophobic, sulfidogenic and aggregative properties of sulfate-reducing
   bacteria Desulfovibrio oryzae strains in monocultures and associations
   with organic acid-producing bacteria Anaerotignum propionicum. Studies
   of biofilm formation on polypropylene surface by strains were carried
   out by a biofilm assay (indirect measurement of bacterial biofilm
   biomass by crystal violet adsorption/desorption), hydrogen sulfide
   production was determined by iodometric titration, aggregation - by
   aggregation test, hydrophobicity - by salt aggregation test. It was
   found that the studied strains of D. oryzae NUChC SRB1 and NUChC SRB2
   are highly adhesive, have high sulfidogenic, aggregation and hydrophobic
   properties in the complete Postgate's medium (with Fe2+). During the
   cultivation of the studied strains of D. oryzae with A. propionicum
   NUChC Sat1, a significant increase in aggregation (both in complete
   medium and without Fe2+) and hydrogen sulfide production by
   sulfate-reducing bacteria were observed. These properties indicate the
   potentially high biodegradable activity of D. oryzae monocultures NUChC
   SRB1 and NUChC SRB2 and their associations with A. propionicum NUChC
   Sat1. The observed increase in the sulfidogenic activity of D. oryzae in
   association with A. propionicum promotes the corrosion hazard of the
   studied bacterial association.},

Abstract = {This work aimed to understand ecological and evolutionary aspects of
   Juncus tenuis (Juncaceae) by analyzing its seed coat and seedling
   development. Mature seeds were germinated under controlled conditions
   and analyzed every 24 h for 60 days. Seeds and seedlings at different
   developmental stages were analyzed using a stereomicroscope, light
   microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The seed coat consists of
   the endotegmen, endotesta, and exotesta. The endotegmen is tanniferous,
   and the exotesta is mucilaginous. The germination percentage was low
   (28\%), a result that may be related to specific light, humidity, and
   temperature requirements to overcome dormancy. Germination begins with
   the disruption of the seed coat and the emergence of a phaneromer,
   followed by the development of the collar rhizoids and the primary root.
   The anatomical analyses show that the formation of shoot and root apical
   meristems occurs only after the elongation of the phaneromer. The
   anatomy of the seedlings at early development is described for the first
   time for the family. The phaneromeric cotyledon is shared by Juncaceae
   and Thurniaceae and is most likely the ancestral condition in the
   cyperid clade (Poales). The presence of a mucilaginous exotesta is
   probably related to seed protection, dispersal, and germination.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships and migration patterns of the Fargesia
   spathacea complex inferred from genomic data},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recent molecular research has revealed the significance of hybridization
   and reticulate evolution in the evolution of temperate woody bamboos at
   both intergeneric and intrageneric levels. Although the monophyly of
   Fargesia s.l. is debated, species of Fargesia s.l. with the spathe-like
   leaf sheath syndrome form a clade as the Fargesia spathacea complex. A
   previous study showed varying degrees of genetic diversity and an excess
   of heterozygotes across the F. spathacea complex, but phylogenetic
   relationships within this complex remain unclear. Here, we sampled 24
   populations and 72 individuals of the F. spathacea complex and three
   outgroups: Yushania confusa, Fargesia setosa, and Bashania fargesii.
   Using phylogenomic data, we generated a robust phylogeny and explored
   the implications of the phylogeny for previous hybridization and
   introgression hypotheses. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that the
   72 individuals were clustered into four major clades consistent with the
   genetic structure but different from the statistical results of
   vegetative traits. Our phylogenetic and biographical evidence
   demonstrate that the species in the F. spathacea complex originated
   outside the Hengduan Mountains region and spread to heterogeneous
   mountain habitats in the Daba and Qinling Mountains. In addition,
   adaptive radiation to cold climates and reticulate evolution may have
   driven species diversification within the F. spathacea complex, making
   it difficult to classify at the population level.},

Title = {Bioremediation of Petroleum Contamination: A Short Review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-52},
Abstract = {The pros and cons of using the bioremediation method for the removal of
   petroleum pollutants are discussed in this review article. Other methods
   along with bioremediation have been used to remediate petroleum
   hydrocarbon contaminants in the past. Bioremediation is cheap and
   efficient method than any other because major constituents of the crude
   oils are biodegradable. Despite the fact that, as compared to
   physicochemical strategies, longer periods are normally required,
   complete pollutant degradation can be achieved, and no further
   containment of the contaminated matrix is required. According to
   hydrocarbon present in the contaminants different strategies and
   organism are used for the bioremediation. Common strategies include
   controlling environmental factors such as oxygen availability,
   hydrocarbon solubility, nutrient balance and managing hydrocarbon
   degrading bacteria by eliminating the rate limiting factors that may
   slow down the bioremediation rate. Microorganism dynamics during
   bioremediation is most important for understanding how they respond,
   adapt and remediate pollution. However, bioremediation can be considered
   one of the best technologies to deal with petroleum product
   contaminants.},

Title = {Environmentally friendly disposal of used automotive oil filters:
   legislative aspects and technology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {77-89},
Abstract = {Due to external environmental concerns, new European Union (EU)
   legislation is currently increasing the requirements for the disposal of
   vehicles and their used components. Used automotive oil filters (UAOF)
   are both a threat to the environment and contain valuable components for
   reuse. Waste minimization, their environmentally safe disposal,
   neutralization, utilization and conservation of natural resources is an
   urgent global problem. It is the legislative rationale for solving this
   problem and the search for an environmentally friendly UAOF recycling
   technology that is the purpose of this study. The legislative aspects
   were studied by reviewing the current regulatory and legislative
   documents of Ukraine and the EU countries, as well as scientific
   literature. The reviewed scientific literature was collected from three
   main databases: Scopus, Web of Science, ResearchGate, where the
   corresponding keywords. It was found that the current legislation in the
   field of waste management is not perfect and has many gaps and
   contradiction. The search for environmentally friendly technology was
   carried out in different temperature conditions and using different
   amounts of detergents, which made it possible to determine the most
   effective detergent sodium percarbonate (Na2CO3 center dot 1.5 H2O2) - a
   chemical compound that is a safe and convenient carrier of hydrogen
   peroxide. As a result of the conducted theoretical and experimental
   researches the complex utilization technology of UAOF and the detailed
   algorithm is presented. The scheme process plant for washing the
   contaminated filter paper and the washing technology, which allows
   retrieving resource valuable components, has been developed. It is
   experimentally proved that pre-treatment of the filter paper with a
   washing solution allows reducing the number of pollutants, namely the
   content of waste oil is reduced by 55\%, and the number of pollutants in
   the flue gases by 89\% of sulphur (IV) oxide, 15\% of nitrogen (IV)
   oxide, 66\% of carbon (II) oxide, 86\% of carbon (soot).},

Title = {Generic models of the biomass of larches (Larix spp.) and stone pines
   (Pinus L. subsection Cembrae Loud.) for laser sensing in climatic
   gradients of Eurasia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In the context of growing global urbanization and climate fluctuations,
   understanding the development of forest ecosystems in terms of their
   ability to remove atmospheric carbon is of increasing interest. Its
   content in the atmosphere continues to increase due to the burning of
   fossil fuels and deforestation. Airborne laser scanning technology has
   become widely used in assessing the biomass of trees by remotely
   registering such taxation indicators of trees, such as the width of the
   crown and the height of the tree. There are many allometric biomass
   models of different tree species in different climatic conditions, but
   allometric models for estimating biomass by remote methods are presented
   by single works.
   The authors use the base of harvest data of 138 sample trees of larch
   (Larix spp.) and 93 ones of stone pines (Pinus L. subsection Cembrae
   Loud.) growing on Eurasia with measured indicators of tree height, crown
   width, as well as the biomass of the trunk, foliage, branches and roots.
   For all components of aboveground biomass, a positive relationship with
   the crown width and the tree height was established.
   The results obtained give an vision of how the structure of the biomass
   of equal-sized trees of such species as larch and stone pine can differ,
   whether this structure can change in the climatic gradients of Eurasia,
   what can be the contribution of climate variables to the explanation of
   the variability of tree biomass, and what are the potential
   possibilities of laser technology for recognizing tree species at the
   level of individual trees.},

Abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of nonlinear functional relationships in nature we
   tend to characterize mechanisms in science using more tractable linear
   functions. In demographic modeling, transfer function analysis is used
   to calculate the nonlinear response of population growth rate to a
   theoretical perturbation of one or more matrix elements. This elegant
   approach is not yet popular in ecology. Inconveniently, using transfer
   function without care can produce erroneous results without warning. We
   used a large matrix projection model database to explore the potential
   pitfalls to be avoided in using transfer function analysis. We asked a
   fundamental population control question, what matrix element
   perturbation would be needed to reach a minimum goal of replacement
   population growth? We then tracked instances in which transfer function
   yields erroneous output and explored these cases in detail to measure
   how frequently it occurs. We developed a phylogenetically-corrected
   mixed effects logistic regression model in a Bayesian framework to test
   the effect of species traits and the identity of matrix elements on the
   probability that transfer function yields errors. We found in 16\% of
   cases the transfer function yielded erroneous outcomes. These errors
   were more likely when perturbing demographic stasis and also for shrubs
   more than any other life form. Errors in transfer function analysis were
   often due to perturbing matrix elements beyond their biological limits,
   even when this is still mathematically correct. To use transfer function
   analysis properly in demographic modeling and avoid erroneous results,
   input must be carefully selected to include only a biologically
   admissible set of perturbations.},

Title = {Tree diversity and regeneration status in the different forest types of
   Kotla watershed (Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, India)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to assess the diversity and regeneration status
   of tree species in different forest types viz., Pinus forest (PF),
   Pinus-Oak mixed forest (POF) and Deodar forest (DF) of Kotla watershed
   (Barkot, Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand). The data were collected through
   quadrat method and analyzed quantitatively. A total of 28 tree species,
   belonging to 21 families were recorded in the sampling area (3 forests x
   10 plots in each x plot size 400 m2). Fagaceae, Pinaceae, Ericaceae,
   Fabaceae and Juglandaceae were the major families (in terms of number of
   species). The species-area curves (SACs) of PF and DF reached an
   asymptote while it predicted more species (din not reach asymptote) in
   case of POF. The resulted values of different diversity indices (i.e.,
   Dominance, Simpson, Shannon, Evenness, Margalef, and Equitability)
   revealed that the POF was most diverse (in tree diversity) followed by
   PF and DF. The ranked species abundance (RSA) curve of POF was log
   normal type but geometric series type for PF and DF. The
   density-diameter curves (d-d curves) was reverse J-shaped for POF while
   in case of PF and DF, the higher densities were observed for middle DBH
   classes in comparison to lowest and highest DBH classes. The overall
   regeneration status of the forests in the area was fair (25.8\% tree,
   18.6\% saplings and 55.6\% seedlings). The present study provides a
   deeper understanding of tree diversity pattern and regeneration status
   from a pocket of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR).},

Title = {The analysis of biological diversity of coronaviruses contributes in the
   early awareness of their zoonotic spreading},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {67-75},
Abstract = {The recent outbreak of COVID-19 rose a new wave of interest to
   coronaviruses though the first coronaviruses were discovered in the
   first half of the 20th century. That time coronaviruses were considered
   as a quite serious veterinary problem but they were not believed to
   become highly dangerous for humans. However, such ideas were revised in
   2002 when SARS-CoV was transferred to human population in the Southeast
   Asia assumably from the bats, and later in 2012 when natural focus of
   the MERS-CoV was discovered in the Arabian countries. Using PubMed,
   EMBASE, Scopus, and Google scholar, the authors searched for various
   research and review articles using the combination of terms
   ``coronavirus, Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19,
   taxonomy{''}. Due to the increased interest a large number of new
   Coronaviridae family members was revealed in the first decades of the
   XXI century. Since then taxonomic structures of coronaviruses underwent
   significant changes. This review is focused on the need for continued
   monitoring of the biological diversity of coronaviruses. The structural
   studies of coronaviruses regardless of the host species may allow us to
   identify early changes that can affect the evolutionary drift process of
   a particular HCoV species involved in viral transmission from bats or
   birds to humans. Taking into account the migratory abilities of bats and
   especially birds, it is necessary to not only to include coronaviruses
   in the ecological monitoring programs, but also to expand the scope and
   depth of environmental and virological monitoring.},

Abstract = {Cypripedium japonicum Thunb. (Orchidaceae), once a common perennial
   herb, is now designated as endangered throughout most of its
   distribution due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, and the
   impacts of horticultural collection. We investigated the genetic
   characteristics of this species for conservation purposes, using
   microsatellite markers to examine the genetic diversity and structure of
   15 native and 5 ex situ populations in Japan. The results imply that
   although allelic variation is low in Japanese C. japonicum, sexual
   reproduction by seed, as well as clonal propagation, may occur in some
   populations. Both native and ex situ populations were found to be
   genetically differentiated, indicating that some populations may have
   experienced recent population declines, genetic fragmentation, or
   bottlenecks. The degree of genetic drift from the putative ancestral
   population, inferred through STRUCTURE analysis, was more pronounced in
   northern populations than in southern populations. Some of the ex situ
   conserved populations exhibited a low degree of differentiation from
   ancestral native populations. Our results imply that conservation of C.
   japonicum in Japan is best supported by maintaining individual
   populations and their unique genetic characteristics.},

Title = {Why do traditional dispersion indices used for analysis of spatial

Abstract = {It is common to characterize the spatial distribution of plant patterns
   as random, aggregate, or uniform. In this context, a major challenge for
   the researcher is the choice of the method to identify the spatial
   pattern correctly as well as the factors related to it. The vast
   literature on the subject is not recent, especially regarding the
   dispersion indices. The aim of this review was to conduct a critical and
   temporal analysis of these dispersion indices and test their
   effectiveness in determining the spatial distribution of Paepalanthus
   chiquitensis Herzog (Eriocaulaceae). This species is a meaningful model
   due to its occurrence in specific sites. The Lexis, Charlier,
   dispersion, relative variance, aggregation, Green, inverse of k of the
   negative binomial, Morisita, and standardized Morisita indices were
   limited to indicating that the individuals of the species are aggregate
   and did not provide information on neither spatial dimension (scale)
   where the aggregation occurs, nor the factors related to this
   aggregation. Although they have distinct magnitudes, the algebraic
   expressions of dispersion, relative variance, aggregation, Green,
   inverse of k, Morisita, and standardized Morisita indices exhibited a
   close relationship with each other and little progress from their
   precursors Lexis and Charlier. By disregarding the possibility of
   spatial dependence, these indices make it impossible to generate
   important hypotheses for the investigation of factors related to spatial
   structure. Therefore, they became obsolete and are falling into disuse.
   It should be noted that these measurements accomplished their role and
   contributed to science in times of limited technologies for spatial
   data.},

Title = {Prediction (on the content of radionuclides and heavy metals) of the
   Solidago canadensis L. use as a honey resource in Polesie},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {In the context of the problem of the rational use of the meadow
   ecosystems of Polesie, which have been exposed to radioactive effect and
   have not been used economically for a long time, the indicators of
   radionuclides and heavy metals in soil and plants predict the
   possibility of using Solidago canadensis L. as a honey resource in
   summer and autumn periods. The article presents new research results in
   the direction of studying the species specificity of plants for the
   accumulation of radionuclides and heavy metals, which are aimed at
   solving the problem of obtaining the environmentally friendly
   bee-keeping products from non-traditional honey resources. The habitats
   of Solidago canadensis were studied in the floodplain of the Dnieper
   river, its tributaries of various orders and loess ``islands{''} in
   Polesie - the transformed meadow ecosystems, phytocenoses of which
   belong to the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea R.Tx. 1937 class, and the ruderal
   Artemisietea vulgaris Lohmeyer et al. in Tx. ex von Rochow 1951
   communities. The content of the radionuclides (Cs-137 Ta Sr-90) and
   heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu) in the soil and inflorescences of Solidago
   canadensis of 18 sites were analyzed. 11 sites of them, that were not
   contaminated by the Chernobyl disaster, were analyzed for honey samples.
   The linear regression equations for honeyplant and honey-soil systems,
   Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), significance level (p) and the
   determination coefficient (r(2)) for predicting (by indicators of
   radionuclides and heavy metals in soil and plant) the possibility of
   honey gathering have been determined. According to the predicted
   indicators of the heavy metal content and specific activity of
   radionuclides, it was found that only the meadow ecosystems in the
   floodplain of the Iput river (the Zalissia village, Dobruskyi district,
   Gomel region, Belarus) out of 7 studied sites, which were exposed to
   radioactive contamination in 1986, are suitable for gathering goldenrod
   honey. In the case of honey gathering on the infested with the Canadian
   goldenrod meadows in the floodplains of the Dnieper, Sozh and Pakulka
   rivers, the maximum permissible concentration of cadmium or
   radionuclides in the products may exceed. It is emphasized that to
   assess the possibility of obtaining the environmentally friendly
   goldenrod honey, it is advisable to predict the content of radionuclides
   and heavy metals in both plants and soil. To do this, it is also
   necessary to take into account the calculated values of the highest
   content of heavy metals and the specific activity of radionuclides in
   soil and plants, at which the metal content in honey will be at the
   level of the maximum permissible concentration (MPC).},

Title = {New biodegradable polylactide material with antimicrobial properties},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the bactericidal, fungicidal and
   non-phytotoxic properties of vapor permeable polylactide films
   containing five different concentrations (in the range of 0.2-1.0\%) of
   thiabendazole. All films showed bactericidal properties on
   Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Thiabendazole introduced
   into polylactide affected the antifungal activity of the materials
   containing 0.8 and 1.0\% thiabendazole. The films containing
   thiabendazole were characterized by increased permeability. The vapor
   permeability of the film increased with the increase of the biocide
   content in the composites. The new materials had no a negative effect on
   the growth and development of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
   plants. It has been shown that the presence of thiabendazole increases
   the water vapor permeability of polylactide films. The obtained
   materials are biodegradable and can be used in horticulture and
   agriculture to protect plants against pathogens. The use of films with
   biocide properties will reduce the use of plant protection products.
   This is particularly important due to the need to protect biodiversity
   in the ecosystem of agricultural soils.},

   Karachi, Pakistan. It is the highly interactive place of a metropolis,
   therefore, considers functionally effective zones. This paper will prove
   even with a high rate of urbanization and expansion due to urban sprawl,
   still Saddar is the focus of attraction concerning several facts. The
   main objectives of the study were to explore the land-based cataloging
   of Saddar based on activity and to assess the environmental issues which
   are associated with this land use classification for the sustainability
   of CBD the people perception methods of identification of research,
   Land-use (LU) Analysis of Area of Interest (AOI) via,
   questionnaire-based surveying, and geo-coding of activities methods have
   been used in this study. The obtained results revealed that Saddar town
   covers land use approximately, 4.28\% Leisure, 9.38\% Shopping, Business
   or Trade, 7.9\% Social, Institutional, or Infrastructure Related, 4.62\%
   Mass Assembly of People, 6.37\% Industrial, Manufacturing, and Waste
   Related, while 5.68\% Traveler Movement, 5.9\% Natural Resource Related,
   52.40\% Residential,3.4\% No Human Activity or Unclassified.
   Approximately, 44.2\% of the land use was engaged in capita producing
   activities, which reflects CBD's functional strength. Overall, it
   recommended that there should be more green spaces in the CBD to improve
   air quality. Vertical urban gardening/forest can be implemented as
   Saddar has limited space and it is a concrete jungle having very less
   open space.},

Abstract = {The article presents a common locality of Asplenium ruta-muraria and
   Asplenium trichomanes (Aspleniaceae) in north-eastern Poland. Asplenium
   ruta-muraria and Asplenium trichomanes are small ferns occurring on

   are very rare species, found mainly on old walls and stone fences.
   Common locality of Asplenium ruta-muraria and Asplenium trichomanes was
   again subjected to a floristic inventory in September of 2020 in
   Ciechanowiec (Podlaskie Province). The populations consist of about 87
   individuals of Asplenium ruta-muraria and 1001 individuals of Asplenium
   trichomanes, both growing on stone fences around old nineteenth-century
   cemetery in Ciechanowiec (ATPOL plot FC66). These locality isn't
   threatened now, but it is suggested to remove shrub cover (especially
   Robinia pseudoacacia and Urtica dioica) from those parts of the walls in
   order to maintain the local populations of Asplenium ruta-muraria and
   Asplenium trichomanes.},

   L., Salvia officinalis L., Mentha x piperita L. and Eucalyptus viminalis
   Labill. The essential oils had a significant effect on the lifespan of
   adult ticks. The results showed the acaricidal effect of Thymus
   serpyllum essential oils. When searching the acaricidal and repellent
   properties of individual essential oils components thymole, menthol and
   citral showed the high activity as acaricides. In the same time, eugenol
   and borneol proved the effectiveness as repellent. Our research schowed
   that essential oils are promising as alternative methods of controlling
   the number of Ixodes ticks in areas where there are conditions for
   infection with tick infections.},

Title = {Advancement in Ozone base wastewater treatment technologies: Brief
   review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {7-19},
Abstract = {Over 70\% of the planet???s surface is covered by water. A universal
   solvent, water can dissolve a wide variety of compounds. The majority of
   water contamination is caused by human activity. Increasing water use
   and pollution are to blame for the current shortage of fresh water
   supplies. Population expansion, agricultural runoff, and municipal
   wastewater are the primary sources of pollution in the river. To conduct
   the study, the logical chain was developed. For the review, open sources
   of scientific information were used. The focus was on publications from
   the last 10 years and at the same time; earlier works were taken into
   accounts that have useful information for this study, which were
   identified in the list of references when studying recent sources. The
   number of sources published earlier than 10 years ago does not exceed
   7\% of the total number of references. The present study aims to
   determine the optimum conditions for best removal of contaminants as the
   review focuses on advancement in Ozonation/AOP technology, different
   type of methods used for drugs removal and different operating
   condition. Various modern treatment procedures make extensive use of
   drinking water treatment plants. Water shortages in countries can be
   alleviated by implementing some of the recommendations made in the
   research. More catchment areas need to be developed; strict management
   policies and guidelines should be implemented. Ozonation can also more
   effectively remove certain personal care products (PPCPs) from the skin.
   Recycled water can be disinfected using ozonation, which breaks down
   ozone in water. When ozone is used in this way, it is an effective
   parasiticide, germicide, and virucidal agent. It can also remove the
   chroma compounds, smells, infections, and many micro-pollutants
   simultaneously. Ozone-based AOP should be studied in the future to see
   whether it is cost-effective and to see if it consumes more energy than
   other traditional treatment methods.},

Abstract = {Natural resources and social conflict have a strong relationship. The
   current natural resource management problems have caused deforestation,
   resulting in unstable environmental ecosystems. Consequently, a movement
   towards mitigating natural resource management emerged because of the
   threat to the ``Bekantan{''} Proboscis Monkey habitat and population in
   South Kalimantan Province. Indonesian Proboscis Monkey Friends (SBI)
   Foundation is a non-profit organization aiming to protect Proboscis
   monkeys on Curiak Island. SBI adopts collaborative resource governance
   in building stakeholder capacity with shared motivation and principles
   for collective action. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the
   collaborative governance process conducted on Proboscis Monkey
   conservation in Curiak Island. The results showed that anyone, including
   non- government organizations, could initiate collaboration in the
   several programs such as conservation, buy back the land and rambai
   mangrove restoration. Various parties collaborations are proven to
   successfully increase the support for environmental conservation
   efforts, especially the habitat and endemic proboscis monkeys.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in age, sex, and reproductive status of Mexican
   free-tailed bats},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {254-266},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In North America, Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis
   mexicana) consume vast numbers of insects contributing to the economic
   well-being of society. Mexican free-tailed bats have declined due to
   historic guano mining, roost destruction, and bioaccumulation of
   organochlorine pesticides. Long-distance migrations and dense
   congregations at roosts exacerbate these declines. Wind energy
   development further threatens bat communities worldwide and presents
   emerging challenges to bat conservation. Effective mitigation of bat
   mortality at wind energy facilities requires baseline data on the
   biology of affected populations. We collected data on age, sex, and
   reproductive condition of Mexican free-tailed bats at a cave roost in
   eastern Nevada located 6 km from a 152-MW industrial wind energy
   facility. Over 5 years, we captured 46,353 Mexican free-tailed bats.
   Although just over half of the caught individuals were nonreproductive
   adult males (53.6\%), 826 pregnant, 892 lactating, 10,101
   post-lactating, and 4327 nonreproductive adult females were captured.
   Juveniles comprised 11.5\% of captures. Female reproductive phenology
   was delayed relative to conspecific roosts at lower latitudes, likely
   due to cooler temperatures. Roost use by reproductive females and
   juvenile bats demonstrates this site is a maternity roost, with
   significant ecological and conservation value. To our knowledge, no
   other industrial scale wind energy facilities exist in such proximity to
   a heavily used bat roost in North America. Given the susceptibility of
   Mexican free-tailed bats to wind turbine mortality and the proximity of
   this roost to a wind energy facility, these data provide a foundation
   from which differential impacts on demographic groups can be assessed.},

Abstract = {The present study was carried out community forest of Tehri Garhwal
   Uttarakhand. The amount of growing stock volume density in the study
   region were ranges between 28.21 m(3)/ha and 44.59 m(3)/ha, above-ground
   biomass density ranges between 200.59 Mg ha(-1) and 238.44 Mg ha(-1),
   belowground biomass density range between 128.03 and 192.96 Mg/ha, total
   biomass density was in the range of 287.76 and 431.40 Mg ha(-1) and
   total carbon density ranges between 162.40 and 194.13 Mg ha(-1) . The
   isolation of total biomass density into aboveground and belowground
   parts showed a similar pattern in every one of the forest locales.
   Present study proposes that community forests play a vital role in
   ecosystem health they are playing their job quietly in the moderation of
   environmental carbon and crucial for future planning. Loss of old
   community forestry system is centre for concern to the forest
   department, forest rangers and forestry researchers. Protection of
   community forests is an urgent need for the maintenance of community
   ecosystem in temperate region of Garhwal Himalaya Uttarakhand.
   Preservation of the both young and old growth forests is the best way to
   adapt to environmental change and a worldwide temperature alteration. As
   we probably are aware the pattern of old cultivating in the networks
   close to the urban communities is decrease and will be supplanted by
   present day procedures so we need to look through some new strategy and
   execution to monitor the old cultivating methods. The ground stock
   volume density shows moderate positive correlation with altitude (r
   =0.325) while above ground biomass density (r = 0.203) below ground
   biomass density, total biomass density and total carbon density shows
   week positive correlation with altitude (r =0.117, r = 0.194 and r =
   0.194 respectively). The Linear regression shows that ground stock
   volume density, above ground biomass density, below ground biomass
   density, total biomass density and total carbon density not dependent
   only altitude some other factor affecting them. While as above ground
   biomass density show highly positive correlation with total biomass
   density and total carbon density whereas altitude show less positive
   correlation with below ground biomass density).},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Due to the low dietary value of crops, Zn-deficient soils and
   insufficient intake of other minerals, soil fortification is often
   necessary. Fortification is defined as the addition of one or more
   crucial nutrients to a food to reduce poverty in a population or
   specific population groups. Currently available technologies for rice
   fortification with vitamins and minerals are high-energy and
   time-consuming methods. Therefore, mineral enrichment of crops has
   received much attention from scientists. The originality of the current
   study consists in determining the optimal use of hard hazelnut shells,
   orange peel and rice husks for enrichment of paddy soil and simultaneous
   immobilization of heavy metals. The combination of the identified
   wastes, namely hazelnut shells, orange peel and rice husks, showed good
   potential for immobilization/elimination or reduction of heavy metals to
   less than permissible limits. Therefore, the use of this combination
   could be an effective strategy to both introduce new micronutrients into
   rice grain and remove heavy metals.},

Abstract = {The reuse of treated domestic wastewater is an imperative source of
   water for numerous purposes. The treatment of municipal wastewater can
   be process by utilizing the technique for electrocoagulation.
   Electrocoagulation (EC) is an eco-friendly technique that combines the
   functions and advantages of conventional coagulation, flotation, and
   electrochemistry in water and wastewater treatment. The aim of present
   study was to assess the potential of electrocoagulation process in
   removing COD, BOD, TSS, turbidity, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and TDS
   from municipal wastewater. This experimental study was carried out at a
   batch system by using copper and aluminium electrodes aiming to treat
   the municipal wastewater at (0, 7, 14, and 21 volts, 50mamp for
   60minutes) from Sample Baloch Colony (SBC), Sample Rind Goth (SRG),
   Sample Cattle Colony (SCC), Sample Pakistan Machine Tool Factory (SPMTF)
   and Sample Mehran Highway (SMH). The results revealed that the maximum
   removal efficiency of COD 96\% for SPMTF, BOD 38.5\% for SPMTF, TSS
   98.14\% for SMH, Turbidity 95.7\% for SPMTF, Sulphate 95.9\% for SRG,
   Nitrate 95.23\% for SMH, Chloride 97.92\% for SMH and TDS 96.9\% for SRG
   at 21 volt. The present study suggested that the treated wastewater
   could be safely reuse for lawns, parks, tree plantation and recreation
   purpose.},

Title = {Paddy Stubble Management: A Study on Farmers? Opinions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to examine the paddy straw management
   practices by farmers amidst the various difficulties faced by them in
   terms of machinery, resources, etc. The study was conducted in Rohtak
   district of Haryana (India). A well-structured interview schedule was
   formulated and one hundred farmers were interviewed accordingly. Simple
   random sampling technique was adopted for the selection of twenty paddy
   growing farmers from each of the blocks viz. Rohtak, Sampla, Meham,
   Lakhan Majra and Kalanaur of the selected district. The data was
   analysed, tabulated and the results were drawn using the statistical
   tools of SPSS and MS Excel. The Chi-square test was used to establish
   the relation between the paddy straw management technologies and the
   reasons for non-adoption of these technologies. It is found that maximum
   number of farmers are marginal land holders. Many farmers are unaware of
   the conservation techniques to manage paddy stubble viz. use of
   decomposers, etc. The high cost and low availability of paddy stubble
   management machinery also plague the farmers. The results of the study
   help in understanding the behaviours of farmers towards tackling the
   paddy stubble. Also, useful inputs can be drawn to design, manufacture
   and adopt the agricultural implements for stubble management. The study
   is based on a sample of just hundred farmers and is limited to Rohtak
   district only. Nevertheless, the study is valuable for it
   comprehensively interrelates the myriad aspects of paddy stubble
   management in the stubble burning prone area of Rohtak.},

Title = {Driving forces behind the fluctuating growth of the number of successful

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {This study aimed to describe the change in the number of successful
   nests of the white-tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla, for 25 years
   (1997-2021) along the Teshio River (100 km), Japan, which is a new
   habitat for this endangered species and identify factors driving the
   number of nests. The number of nests grew from two to nine. The logistic
   function fitted in well with the growth, and the capacity of the study
   area sustaining the successful nests was estimated at 6.5. The
   precipitation in January and April explained the deviation of the
   observed values from the model prediction. In particular, heavy rain in
   April was associated with low numbers. Forty-six nest remains were
   collected from 17 nest locations. Twelve genera of birds, six genera of
   mammals, and four genera of fishes were identified. Fish and bird items
   occupied 93.6\% of prey individuals. The fish proportion was similar
   between high-performance years when the observed number of successful
   nests was higher than the model prediction and low-performance years
   with a lower number than the prediction (55.2\% and 51.0\%). However, it
   was higher in the nests with two fledglings (63.0\%) than those with a
   single fledgling (41.5\%). The nearest neighbor distance (NND) of the
   successful nests declined with the increase in the number of nests.
   Based on territory size (the mean NND = 7.8 km), the study area can hold
   13 nests. The process and mechanism of the dynamics of the number of
   nests were discussed, focusing on territoriality and weather effects.},

Title = {Integrating video and genetic data to estimate annual age-structured

Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Camera or genetic data are increasingly used to estimate wildlife
   abundance and density. We integrated video camera data with genetic data
   over 7 years to estimate annual age-structured apparent survival of
   American black bears (Ursus americanus). We identified 70 individuals
   through meticulous scrutiny of 7531 video captures, cross-referenced
   with 721 genetic captures from hair samples concurrently collected from
   stations in view of cameras. We used the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in
   Program Mark to estimate annual age-structured apparent survival for
   yearling males, yearling females, 2+ year-old males, and 2+ year-old
   females. We manually calculated cub survival. We compared parameter
   estimates based on combined video and genetic data with those based on
   only genetic data. Combining video and genetic data provided a means to
   test video-based identification accuracy, which was highest for females
   (97\%-100\%). Annual apparent survival was highest for yearling females
   (phi = 0.92, SE = 0.07), followed by 2+ year-old females (phi = 0.88, SE
   = 0.05), 2+ year-old males (phi = 0.84, SE = 0.06), and yearling males
   (phi = 0.80, SE = 0.14). Annual cub survival (phi = 0.86, SE = 0.07) was
   likely biased because we could not account for mortality that occurred
   in-den through early spring. Annual apparent survival and recapture
   probabilities derived from only genetic data were lower than those
   derived from combined video and genetic data. Our finding that
   noninvasive data can be used to estimate annual age-structured apparent
   survival of a species with relatively indistinct traits is broadly
   relevant to wildlife research and conservation.},

Title = {Ocean temperature and density dependence as key drivers of the
   population dynamics of an intertidal crab at the Brazilian oceanic
   islands},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {349-364},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding how climatic and density-dependent processes affect
   demography is crucial for predicting population responses to climate
   change. For marine invertebrates with complex life cycle such as decapod
   crustaceans, increasing temperatures might affect survival and
   development of early pelagic stages, whereas high density can increase
   competition and thus reduce growth and fecundity of older life stages.
   In this study, we investigate the effects of warm ocean events, body
   size and density on the population dynamics of the intertidal Sally
   lightfoot crab (Grapsus grapsus) at the Brazilian oceanic islands.
   Firstly, we assessed the trends of marine heatwaves (MHW) and positive
   temperature anomalies (Delta SST+) at the equatorial St Peter and St
   Paul (SPSP) Archipelago and Rocas Atoll and the subtropical Trindade
   Island. We then jointly analyzed short-term count, capture-recapture and
   fecundity data, and long-term population monitoring data (2003-2019)
   using an integrated population model. Warm ocean events have become more
   frequent and intense only at the equatorial islands. Increasing MHW
   frequency positively influenced recruitment in the high-density SPSP
   population, while MHW intensity and Delta SST+ frequency had negative
   impacts. Conversely, no climatic effects were observed for the
   low-density Rocas population, which has the largest crabs. Despite a
   lack of warming in Trindade, this subtropical population with
   intermediate density and body size was negatively affected by Delta
   SST+. Our findings revealed population-specific responses to climate
   change when accounting for local life history and ecology. Thus,
   environmental and density-dependent effects should be broadly considered
   in future conservation studies regarding ocean warming impacts on marine
   invertebrate populations.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are among those most affected by human activity.
   Constructing artificial reservoirs can change freshwater biodiversity,
   thereby impacting genetic diversity (GD), which is crucial to
   population-level adaptation. The Maipo River basin, inhabited by the
   endemic silverside Basilichthys microlepidotus, is one of Chile's most
   impacted freshwater systems. In this basin, the species is divided into
   five populations. Recently, a new population was discovered in the
   reservoir Laguna Esmeralda (LE). We hypothesized that LE silversides
   possess less GD than other populations and originated from a single
   basin population. Our evidence shows that the LE is a genetically
   isolated population with evidence of low genetic variation, but not
   showing signals of bottleneck or significant reduction in GD. Results
   consistently identified two sites as unlikely to be the origin of the LE
   silverside population, suggesting that it was established by the
   immigration of many individuals from the other three populations.},

Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-279},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We develop a new population-scale model incorporating diapause induction
   and termination that allows multi-year predictions of pest dynamics. In
   addition to predicting phenology and voltinism, the model also allows us
   to study the degree of overlapping among the life-stages across time; a
   quantity not generally predicted by previous models yet a key
   determinant of how frequently management must be done to maintain
   control. The model is a physiological, stage-structured population model
   that includes temperature-dependent vital rates, diapause processes, and
   plasticity in development. The model is statistically fitted with a
   33-year long weekly term time series of Cydia pomonella adults captured
   in pheromone-baited traps from a research orchard in southern
   Pennsylvania. The multiannual model allows investigation of both within
   season control strategies, as well as the likely consequences of climate
   change for this important agricultural pest. The model predicts that
   warming temperatures will cause earlier spring emergence, additional
   generations, and increased overall abundance. Most importantly, by
   calculating the circular variance, we find that warmer temperatures are
   associated with an increase in overlap among life-stages especially at
   the beginning of the growing season. Our findings highlight the
   importance of modeling diapause to fully understand C. pomonella
   lifecycle and to better inform management for effectively controlling
   this pest in a warmer future.},

Abstract = {Preservation of the endangered plant species requires knowledge of the
   impact of environmental factors on their populations. This study was
   undertaken to evaluate the potential of a Bayesian network (BN) model to
   analyze the impact of habitat conditions on the current characteristics
   of Pulsatilla patens (L.) Mill. population in NE Poland. The model was
   based on field data collected in 2011-2015 from 47 sites in the four
   largest forest complexes of NE Poland. The causal network between (1)
   the biotic and (2) abiotic factors as well as
   morphological-developmental features of individuals and demographic
   features of populations (20 attributes, 1573 records) was made using the
   Bayesian Search Algorithm in GeNIe 2.0. The results indicate that the
   greatest impact on the population features had the number of competing
   species in forest undergrowth and exposition of slopes. Diagnostic
   testing and sensitivity analysis revealed that these factors were the

Title = {Effects of phenolic compounds on the sulfidogenic activity of
   Desulfotomaculum sp. and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans bacteria},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Purification of environment from the pollutants of organic and inorganic
   matter is one of the actual problem of nowadays. Compounds with benzene
   ring are among the most hazardous pollutants. The danger of getting the
   phenolic compounds into the environment is connected with their toxicity
   for biological objects and stability. One of the most effective methods
   of environment detoxification is the usage of microorganisms. The aim of
   this work was to determine the ability of Desulfotomaculum sp. AR1 and
   Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Ya-11 bacteria to utilize phenol derivatives
   as the carbon source and to study the effects of phenolic compounds on
   the sulfidogenic activity of these bacteria. Both bacterial strains grew
   in the media with pyrogallol and hydroquinone, but the biomass in the
   medium with hydroquinone was considerably lower. Inhibition of sulfate
   ion utilization by bacteria was found during the growth of
   Desulfotomaculum sp. AR1 and D. desulfuricans Ya-11 in the medium with
   phenolic compounds. Effectiveness of pyrogallol utilization by both
   bacterial strains was for 4 times higher, compared to the effectiveness
   of hydroquinone utilization. Desulfotomaculum sp. AR1 and D.
   desulfuricans Ya-11 bacteria are also capable for growth in the medium
   with sodium benzoate, utilizing this aromatic compound as carbon and
   energy source. Process of catechol degradation by Desulfotomaculum sp.
   AR1 bacteria under anaerobic conditions is ineffective.
   Desulfotomaculum sp. AR1 and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Ya-11 bacteria
   are capable for growth in the medium with phenolic compounds, utilizing
   them as the sole carbon source and removing them from the environment.
   ANOVA showed significant differences between the amount of utilized
   SO42- in the control medium and medium with aromatic compounds. Presence
   of aromatic compounds in the medium inhibits the sulfate reduction in
   Desulfotomaculum sp. AR1 and D. desulfuricans Ya-11 bacteria, which
   results in the decrease of toxic hydrogen sulfide accumulation in the
   medium.
   Usage of microorganisms with the aim of environment detoxification is a
   promising way of water biotopes remediation technologies.},

Title = {Dispersal kernel of green rice leafhopper estimated from truncated data},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Characterizing dispersal kernels from truncated data is important for
   managing and predicting population dynamics. We used mark-recapture data
   from 10 previously published replicated experiments at three host plant
   development stages (seedling, tillering, and heading) to estimate
   parameters of the normal and exponential dispersal kernels for green
   rice leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler). We compared classic
   statistical methods for estimating untruncated distribution parameters
   from truncated data with maximum likelihood (MLE) and the method of
   statistical moments for simulated and empirical data. Simulations showed
   that both methods provided accurate parameter estimates with similar
   precision. The method of moments is algebraically complex, but simple to
   calculate, while the MLE methods require numerical solutions of
   nonlinear equations. Simulations also showed that accurate, precise
   estimates of the parameters of the untruncated distributions could be
   attained even under severe truncation with sufficient numbers of
   recaptures. Both diffusivity and the exponential mean were higher with
   later plant growth stage, showing that insects moved farther and faster
   at the heading stage. Precision of the estimates was not strongly
   related to percent capture, size of the experimental field, or the
   number of leafhoppers captured. The leptokurtic exponential kernel fit
   the data better than the normal kernel for all the experiments. These
   results support an alternative explanation for the strong
   density-dependent population regulation of this species at the heading
   stage. Instead of leafhopper density per se, the increase in movement at
   this stage could integrate the populations in the separate fields,
   leveling densities throughout the landscape.},

Title = {Proximate stimuli: An overlooked driving force for risk-induced trait
   responses affecting interactions in aquatic ecosystems},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {205-213},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Inducible responses in prey to predation risk can influence species
   interaction strength, with significant ecological consequences. Much of
   the past research on interactions in aquatic ecosystems has focused on
   remote stimuli (e.g., diffusible chemicals emitted from predators and
   injured conspecifics, which easily propagate through environmental
   water), as cues triggering trait responses in prey, and has overlooked
   the importance of proximate stimuli (e.g., physical disturbance and
   less-diffusible chemicals), which occur in attack or direct contact to
   prey by predators. Proximate stimuli from predators as well as remote
   stimuli may induce significant responses in prey functional traits such
   as behavior, morphology, and life history and, therefore, act as an
   important mechanism of top-down effects in aquatic ecosystems. In this
   opinion paper, we argue that studying the effects of proximate stimuli
   is essential to better understanding of individual adaptation to
   predation risk in nature and ecological consequences of predator-prey
   interactions. Here, we propose research directions to examine the role
   of proximate stimuli for phenotypic plasticity and interaction systems.},

Abstract = {Age-specific survival trajectories can vary significantly among wild
   populations. Identifying the environmental conditions associated with
   such variability is of primary importance to understand the dynamics of
   free-ranging populations. In this study, we investigated survival
   variations among alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) families living in
   areas with opposite environmental characteristics: the typical habitat
   of the species (alpine meadow) and a marginal area bordering the forest.
   We used data collected during an 11-year study in the Gran Paradiso
   National Park (Italy) and performed a Bayesian survival trajectory
   analysis on marked individuals. Furthermore, we investigated, at a
   territorial level, the relationships among demographic parameters and
   habitat variables by using a path analysis approach. Contrary to our
   expectations, for most of the marmot's lifespan, survival rate was
   higher in the marginal site closer to the forest and with lower
   visibility than in the alpine meadow site. Path analysis indicated that
   the number of families living close to each other negatively affected
   the stability of the dominant couple, which in turn affected both
   juvenile survival and reproduction. Given the lower number of
   neighboring families which inhabited the marginal site and the
   potentially different predation pressure by the most effective predator
   in the area (Aquila chrysaetos), our results suggest that species
   adapted to live in open habitats may benefit from living in a marginal
   habitat. This study highlights the importance of habitats bordering the
   forest in the conservation of alpine marmots.},

Title = {Demography of cape petrels in response to environmental changes},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {25-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Predicting the responses of populations in changing environments is an
   important task for ecologists. Understanding the population dynamics of
   high-latitude breeding species is critical given the particularly rapid
   environmental changes that occur in these regions. Using long-term
   mark-resighting data acquired over 53-years in Pointe Geologie, Terre
   Adelie, Antarctica, we estimated age-specific demographic parameters and
   evaluated the effect of the environment on survival of a poorly known
   species, the cape petrel Daption capense. We then modeled the dynamics
   of this population using a life-history model and performed prospective
   and retrospective analyses to estimate the sensitivity of the population
   growth rate to demographic parameters, and to quantify their relative
   contribution. Survival of cape petrel increased with age, being 0.610
   (+/- 0.193) for juveniles, 0.739 (+/- 0.158) for individuals from 2 to
   4, and 0.920 (+/- 0.031) for older individuals. Minimum age at first
   reproduction was 3 years old, the age at which all birds were recruited
   was 14 years, and mean age at first reproduction was 9.05 (+/- 2.06)
   years. Adult survival increased over time and was positively correlated
   with the southern annular mode (SAM). The stochastic population growth
   rate was estimated at 1.019, and adult survival over age 5 made the
   largest contribution to variance of the population growth rate.
   Sensitivity analyses revealed that population regulation was mainly
   driven by the SAM. Our results suggest that despite the decrease in
   breeding success, the population of cape petrels at Pointe Geologie
   increased due to the increase in immature and adult survival.},

Abstract = {The monospecific genus Aitchisonia (Rubiaceae), a suffrutescent plant
   endemic to Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan, was merged in the genus
   Plocama of the monogeneric tribe Putorieae sensu Backlund et al.
   (Spermacoceae alliance, subfamily Rubioideae). This decision was based
   on the phylogenetic placement of the specimen Rafei and Zangooei 25651
   (FUMH) erroneously identified as Aitchisonia rosea in Plocama. This
   specimen was later correctly re-identified as Plocama dubia, rending the
   position of Plocama rosea (= Aitchisonia rosea) in Plocama (thus
   Putorieae) doubtful. We reconstructed a new phylogeny of Spermacoceae
   alliance based on trnL-F and nrITS sequence data and using the Bayesian
   method to: 1) assess the phylogenetic placement of P. rosea within
   Rubioideae, using new material from Iran; 2) pinpoint the phylogenetic
   positions of Plocama asperuliformis, P. crucianelloides, P. dezfulensis,
   P. ehrendorferi, P. kandaharensis, P. szowitsii, and P. vassilczenkoi;
   and 3) re-assess the monophyly of Plocama bruguieri and P. eriantha. The
   trnL-F and nrITS trees further support the monophyly of the Rubieae
   complex, but were not fully congruent. The trnL-F tree resolved Plocama
   rosea as sister to tribe Rubieae (including Kelloggia), while the nrITS
   tree was inconclusive. We described a new monogeneric tribe
   Aitchisonieae to accommodate P. rosea. Our nrITS analysis resolved
   Plocama crucianelloides in the Plocama Middle-Eastern clade and P.
   asperuliformis, P. dezfulensis, P. ehrendorferi, P. kandaharensis, P.
   szowitsii, and P. vassilczenkoi in the Plocama Central-Asian clade, both
   sensu Rincon-Barrado et al. The non-monophyly of P. bruguieri and P.

Abstract = {Geastrum is a genus with worldwide distribution and the most
   species-diverse in the family Geastraceae and is easily recognized by
   the star-like basidioma in the majority of species. The most recent and
   accepted classification based on phylogenetic, morphological and
   chemical data, subdivided the genus into 14 sections. The section
   Exareolata is formed by eleven species from which only G. echinulatum
   and G. verrucoramulosum are truly stipitate. During field trips in
   Brazilian Amazonia, we found a stipitate species of Geastrum. Based on
   morphological and phylogenetic data, we propose it as a new species for
   the genus, which forms a sister group of G. verrucoramulosum and is
   allocated in sect. Exareolata. Geastrum squameoramulosum sp. nov. is
   characterized by a prominent and well-developed ramified stipe and the
   presence of scales on the outer surface of the exoperidium. It is known
   so far only from the Amazon rainforest. We also provide an updated key
   to the species in this section.},

Abstract = {Due to the global warming of the climate, the assessment of the carbon
   cycle in forest ecosystems has become particularly important. One method
   for determining deposited carbon is based on the use of biomass
   expansion factors (BEF) and State Forest Inventory (SFI) data. By
   combining BEF models with SFI data in two ecoregions of Russia - taiga
   and forest-steppe - it was found that over a 20-25-year period,
   accumulating the carbon deposition in the taiga zone is significantly
   less (5\%) compared to the forest-steppe zone (39\%). Comparable results
   were obtained by the same method in different ecoregions of the planet
   (from 8\% in 5 years in China to 68\% in 50 years in Japan). A
   comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method and the IIASA
   method showed a minimal discrepancy (3\%), which gives reason to
   consider the above estimates of carbon deposition close to reality.
   However, uncertainties remain related to the quality of the SFI data and
   the carbon deposition in the soil.},

Title = {Study of Seasonal variation and Index Based Assessment of Water Quality
   and Pollution in Semi-Arid Region of Morocco},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Water resources quality assessment a basic requirement for ensuring its
   sustainability. Groundwater resources being restricted under the earth
   crust are at high risk of being polluted as compared to rivers which
   flow continuously. This study evaluated groundwater quality in
   Mohammedia prefecture, Morocco in terms of physicochemical parameters
   and seasonal variation. The physicochemical parameters analysed were
   Temperature, pH, EC, TDS, Na+, Ca2+, K+, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42.
   Seasonal variation was evaluated for winter and spring seasons. The
   water quality was assessed in terms of overall water and Pollution
   index. Cation/anion ratio to TDS revealed evaporation and rock
   weathering dominance. Based on Pollution index, water quality of 88\%
   samples was in excellent to good category in winter season. The
   pollution index during winter season was <1 for all sample locations. In
   Spring PI was >1 only at Location P1 which was attributed to NO2-. In
   Spring season 78\% water samples were in Good to excellent category. The
   decrease in concentration during spring season was attributed to lack of
   soil-water interaction with reduced infiltration rate. The increase in
   concentration of parameters was attributed to anthropogenic activities.
   Further studies are needed to establish relationship between
   infiltration rate and pollutants concentration with respect to
   precipitation during monsoon season. Even though water quality in
   majority areas was fit for consumption and domestic use still further
   analysis should be carried out in terms of heavy metals and other
   emerging pollutants.},

Title = {Urbanization and stream ecology: Moving the bar on multidisciplinary
   solutions to wicked urban stream problems},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Decades of research on the effects of urbanization on stream ecology
   have shown that urban stream problems are inherently wicked. These
   problems are wicked in the sense that they are difficult to solve
   because information is incomplete, changing, or conflicting and because
   finding potential solutions often requires input from stakeholders who
   can have conflicting and competing values. The 5(th) Symposium on
   Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE5) in February 2020 brought
   together diverse perspectives from scientists, managers, practitioners,
   and local communities. Participants at SUSE5 discussed the state of the
   science in urban stream ecology and worked through in-depth case studies
   in teams to tackle complex real-world problems in urban stream
   management. The papers in this special series on urbanization and stream
   ecology include empirical research studies and synthesis papers sparked
   by discussions at SUSE5 and advance multidisciplinary solutions to
   wicked urban stream problems.},

Title = {Using theoretical models to explore dispersal variation and
   fragmentation in urban environments},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cities are fundamentally changing the environment that plants inhabit,
   most notably through habitat fragmentation. Urban plant habitat patches
   are separated by impervious surfaces like buildings and roads and may
   vary from small, isolated green spaces to large green spaces like parks.
   Understanding the consequences of this urban fragmentation on seed
   dispersal is essential to both maintain urban biodiversity and mitigate
   the spread of unwanted weeds or invasive species but we currently lack
   enough empirical data to draw generalities. Theoretical reasoning (via
   both verbal and mathematical models) is well positioned to contribute to
   this knowledge gap in dispersal by providing useful predictions when
   empirical data are lacking. Variation in dispersal can easily be
   captured by models by incorporating different dispersal kernel shapes,
   and multiple habitat configurations can be examined. Urban environments
   are rarely considered by mathematical models, and our literature review
   indicates that most models that include dispersal variation via a
   dispersal kernel use only one or two shapes, suggesting a gap in the
   theoretical literature as well. We present a proof-of-concept model of
   fragmentation in an urban environment illustrating how varying habitat
   width can lead to different outcomes depending on the dispersal kernel.
   We also provide some thoughts for future directions on the application
   of mathematical models in urban areas.},

Title = {The transfer function method reveals how age-structured populations

   fisheries management},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Fluctuations in wild fish populations result from interaction between
   population dynamics and environmental forcing. Age-structured
   populations can magnify or dampen particular frequencies of these
   fluctuations, depending on life cycle and species traits. The transfer
   function (TF) gives a detailed analytical description of these
   phenomena. In this study, we derive a generalized form of TF to
   investigate the fluctuations of fish populations in response to species
   traits and environmental noise characteristics. We found that for
   semelparous species, fluctuations in fish stocks log-size are directly
   proportional to the recruitment elasticity and inversely proportional to
   the age of maturity, and for iteroparous species, fluctuations in fish
   stocks log-size are inversely proportional to the adult lifespan. In
   addition to the already known effect of cohort resonance (increased
   sensitivity to environmental fluctuations on cohort timescales in the
   elastic range of recruitment elasticity), we find a stock resonance
   effect (increased sensitivity to environmental fluctuations on double
   cohort timescales in the inelastic range of recruitment elasticity).
   These results were then applied to fisheries management. The
   relationship between fishing mortality and species-specific variability
   of fish stocks was formalized. In accordance with this analysis,
   precautionary levels for different catches were estimated.},

Title = {Maternal flower color, ultraviolet protection, and germination in
   Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae)},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {176-187},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transgenerational interactions between flower color, seed quality, and
   seedling performance have rarely been investigated. The ecological
   model, Ipomopsis aggregata, is a great candidate for examining the
   maternal effects of flower color because it is a mostly
   scarlet-flowering plant which shows color polymorphism within natural
   populations. Anthocyanin, the red flavonoid pigment which gives these
   flowers color, has been shown to act as an ultraviolet (UV) protectant
   by shielding chloroplasts and acting as an antioxidant. This study was
   conducted on scarlet- and fuchsia-flowering maternal plants and their
   seeds from natural populations in Colorado. Dark-flowering (scarlet)
   maternal plants from these populations had consistently higher foliar
   anthocyanin content, photosystem efficiency, and chlorophyll content
   than light-flowering (fuchsia) plants over a 3-year period in the field.
   Seeds from a subset of these maternal plants were counted, weighed, and
   germinated in a growth chamber. Photosystem efficiency, vegetative
   anthocyanin content, chlorophyll content, and biomass were measured on
   germinated seedlings after the germination census was completed.
   Dark-flowering maternal plants yielded seeds and seedlings with higher
   biomass than light-flowering ones. Seeds from dark-flowering maternal
   plants also germinated faster than those from light-flowering maternal
   plants and seedlings had higher vegetative anthocyanin content. The
   hereditary nature of anthocyanin content thus suggests that higher
   anthocyanin levels (both floral and vegetative) are potentially linked
   to measures of fitness such as increased seed weight, germination rate,
   and seedling biomass. These data suggest that UV protection provided by
   anthocyanins potentially increases the realized fitness of maternal
   plants, thereby influencing life history.},

Title = {Demographic and growth patterns of Pentaclethra macroloba (Willd.)
   Kuntze, a hyperdominant tree in the Amazon River estuary},

Abstract = {Little is known about the life history and environmental factors that
   regulate the growth rate of hyperdominant trees in flooded Amazonian
   forests. Pentaclethra macroloba is a hyperdominant tree, and it is
   widely explored in the Amazon, because its seed oil is a powerful herbal
   medicine. We evaluated the demographic structure and growth patterns of
   P. macroloba and tested the effect of the Amazon River flood pulse on
   its growth. We modeled the growth and determined the age of P. macroloba
   by analyzing the growth rings of 30 monitored trees in relation to
   hydroclimatic variables. We also inventoried 240 juvenile and 2072 adult
   trees arranged in a clustered pattern. The diametric distribution
   pattern of the juvenile and adult trees was exponential and log-normal,
   respectively. The trees were found to be up to 102 years old, and 47\%
   of them grew freely toward the canopy. Peak growth in height and
   diameter occurred at 24 (61.7 cm year(-1)) and 46 (9.38 mm year(-1))
   years, respectively. Pentaclethra macroloba showed cambial dormancy
   during the seasonal peak of rainfall (R-2 = 0.41; t = -2.62; p < 0.01)
   and flooding of the Amazon River (R-2 = 0.47; t = -3.01; p < 0.01).
   Increases in rainfall and flood level of the river in the rainy season
   control the growth rate of P. macroloba, making it a seasonal process.
   The demographic and growth patterns of P. macroloba respond to the
   environmental heterogeneity of the estuarine floodplain forest and also
   reflect its life history over time.},

Title = {Poaceae and Fabaceae of meadows of Poltava region and their protein
   value},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The main representatives of meadow Poaceae and Fabaceae of Poltava
   region are established and their ecomorphic analysis is made 93 species
   of meadow Poaceae have been found in meadow phytocenoses, which are
   grouped into 44 genera. Among the found cereals on biomorphs are
   dominated by perennials (73.0\%), on climamorphs among them
   approximately the same number of cryptophytes and hemicryptophytes,
   consideration of hygromorphs of the family indicates the predominance of
   mesophytic plants (56.0\%), the bulk of species by tropomorphs belongs
   to mesotrophic (46.0\%), viewing heliomorphs of identified family
   members indicates their photophobia.
   71 species of Fabaceae belonging to 16 genera were found in the meadows.
   According to biomorphs, most of the identified species are perennials
   (73.0\%). According to ecomorphs, mesophilic, light-loving species,
   which love soils of medium richness (more than half of all identified
   species), predominate among the studied species.
   The consequences of studying the protein in meadow Poaceae and Fabaceae
   of Poltava region are given. The total protein accumulation in the
   species studied by us was in the range of 2.5-25.8\%. The average values
   for families are given and specific quantitative indicators of separate
   genera and species are given.
   The division of the studied species into three groups according to the
   content of the indicator is proposed: with low (up to 6.9\%), medium
   (7.0-13.0\%) and high (more than 13.0\%) number. The studied species
   were analyzed on a scale of protein content (from 0 to 20 points).
   According to the given score, the studied cereals are in the group of
   species with low and medium content, and legumes - medium and high.
   In the dynamics of protein content during the phases of the growing
   season you can see a certain trend. Maximum protein is accumulated by
   representatives at earlier stages of ontogenesis.
   Analysis of the indicator, depending on their relationship to the
   biomorph showed some patterns. Thus, annual species, on average, contain
   an indicator at the level of the second group, and perennial - all three
   groups. Two-year-olds most often have protein at the level of the third
   group. This is understandable because they need a lot of nutrients for
   overwintering and active flowering and fruit formation next year.
   Moisture conditions also affect protein accumulation. Thus, the studied
   xerophilous Poaceae according to our research have 9.2 +/- 0.4\%,
   mesophilic - 8.2 +/- 1.2\%. Proven value biomorfy to quantify protein
   content. It is shown that the concentration parameter affecting growing
   conditions, including moisture.},

   Critical Review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {35-47},
Abstract = {The purpose to highlight and focus on the most important risks of forest
   fires in radiation-contaminated areas, with some detailing of the
   problem in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). The search strategy was
   to collect a sufficient number of relevant publications in
   ScienceDirect, PubMed, Mendeley, ResearchGate, GoogleScholar from 2006
   to the present in English, Russian, Ukrainian. Requests were made on the
   topics ,,Forest fires in a radioactively contaminated area{''} and
   ,,Assessing the territories' radiation safety{''}, as well as for the
   keywords of this study. Analysis of available open information about the
   CEZ was done. Although, in the future, temperatures are expected to rise
   in contaminated forests, and the amount of precipitation will remain the
   same or slightly decrease, which will contribute to an increase in the
   frequency of fires. Considering the socio-economic situation in Ukraine,
   the introduction of early detection systems is more profitable than the
   elimination of the consequences of such emergencies. Investigations have
   been studied, which were published after 2006 only in English, Russian,
   and Ukrainian. The most attention is paid to Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
   Despite the fact that a lot of studies are devoted to the study of the
   ecological situation in radioactively contaminated areas, many issues
   related to safety still concern the population living in this area. The
   reason for this is intermittent fires, which again and again cover large
   areas with smoke and cannot be extinguished for a long time. To
   eliminate anxiety, it is necessary to convey truthful information to the
   population in the most accessible and convincing way. It was a critical
   look at numerous studies in this area that made it possible to present
   concentrated information understandable for most segments of the
   population. The document concentrates on the most key problems of fires
   in radioactive forests, shows the intensity of the radionuclides impact
   on the population and the exposure ways, as well as the probable risks.
   Such information is necessary to reduce the psychological stress that
   can be caused by the media influence. Objectively understood situation
   promotes constructive action in extreme conditions and reduces the
   likelihood of panic.},

   Archipelago},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study aimed to reveal the evolutionary timescale and processes
   underlying the diversity of Rubus in the Japanese Archipelago. We
   conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of most native species (35
   species), along with previously published data from 116 foreign species,
   based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and
   chloroplast DNA sequences. Most of the northern species of Japan, that
   is, Rubus chamaemorus, R. pedatus, R. vernus, R. pseudojaponicus, and R.
   ikenoensis, were found to belong to anciently diverged lineages; in
   particular, R. ikenoensis formed a unique lineage distinct from other
   species. The other species diverged into two evolutionary groups. One
   included subg. Malachobatus, Chamaebatus, and sects. Pungentes,
   Idaeanthi, and Parvifolii (subg. Idaeobatus), which was further divided
   into two clades in the chloroplast phylogenies. Although the
   phylogenetic structures within this group were unresolved, R. sieboldii
   has been proven to be recently derived. The second group represented a
   well-supported clade, comprising sects. Microphylli, Corchorifolii,
   Peltati, and Rosifolii (subg. Idaeobatus) and suggested early Miocene
   diversification of this Asian lineage associated with character
   specialization in vegetative reproduction and leaf shape. This clade was
   further resolved into lower clades primarily representing the sectional
   classifications, although the placement of the earliest diverged
   species, R. sumatranus, R. peltatus, R. corchorifolius, and R. chingii,
   was incongruent among gene trees. At the lower taxonomic levels, R.
   illecebrosus, R. grayanus, and the thornless species of sect.
   Microphylli showed earlier divergence.},

Abstract = {It is common knowledge that winter temperatures influence the life
   history of small mammals. Cold temperatures necessitate increased energy
   requirements for survival, and recent studies indicate that snow cover
   can have both negative and positive influences. With each new
   observation, we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the
   mechanisms that influence small mammal populations. Here we report on
   our recent study on Japanese field vole Microtus montebelli, which
   reaches its peak in population during the early spring and its low
   during the autumn. To understand the population dynamics of these voles,
   we conducted a capture-mark-recapture survey, then estimated the
   seasonal abundance, recruit, capture probabilities, and survival
   probabilities using the Bayesian hierarchical model. We also analyzed
   the impact of mammalian generalist predator visits on the survival
   probabilities. Our data indicates that the early spring peak in
   population is due to intensive winter breeding and the highest survival
   probabilities during the periods of deep snow cover. When snow cover
   reaches a certain depth, the circumstances can combine to raise survival
   probability and favor breeding. During the breeding season in May and
   June, on the contrary, the survival probability reached its lowest,
   resulting in a decrease in population despite breeding. The low survival
   probability between spring and autumn could be attributed to the impact
   of generalist predators, and low vegetation may have amplified the
   effect. In summary, the deep snow cover and generalist predators were
   considered to be the key factors shaping this unique population dynamics
   in this orchard area.},

Title = {Visitors' opinions on the environmental protection in Shumen Plateau
   Nature Park from the negative anthropogenic impact of a nearby city,

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Parks are essential for the preservation and protection of wildlife, but
   human activity affects their functions. The objective of our study was
   to investigate visitors' opinions on the environmental protection of
   Shumen Plateau Nature Park from the negative anthropogenic impact of a
   nearby city. Face-to-face interviews were conducted among summer
   visitors. The standardized Pearson correlation coefficient was
   calculated to determine the correlation between items questioned and
   demographic variables. The highest percentage of the informants were of
   the opinion that the Shumen Plateau Nature Park is a relatively clean
   place and a much cleaner green area compared to the parks in Shumen.
   According to most visitors, the high level of fine particulate matter in
   the air in the town of Shumen does not affect organisms that inhabit the
   Nature Park, soil and groundwater. The main pollutant of the Shumen
   Plateau Nature Park is garbage left by park visitors (88.97\%),
   landfills in the park area (46.32\%) and car traffic in the nearby town
   of Shumen (30.88\%). The factor that has the most adverse effect on the
   biodiversity and ecological balance in the Nature Park are the visitors.
   Both visitors and inhabitants of the town of Shumen should be more
   responsible for the environment and the conservation of the Shumen
   Plateau Nature Park as a clean green area. Park visitors do not consider
   the town of Shumen as a source of negative anthropogenic impact on the
   Shumen Plateau Nature Park, but our previous studies show the opposite.
   This indicates a gap in the relationship between the scientific

Title = {Freshwater mussel burrow position and its relation to streambed
   roughness},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels live partially or fully buried in river sediments,
   and burrowing by mussels causes bioturbation, increases benthic
   complexity, provides niche partitioning among other mussel species, and
   may reduce the chance of mussel dislodgment during high flows. However,
   there remains a need to better understand what influences the burrow
   position of mussels and how burrow position modifies physical and
   hydraulic habitat. In this study, we examined how mussel burrow position
   varied across species in 2 gravel-bedded rivers in the northeastern USA
   and how burrow position modified benthic habitat. We quantified the
   amount of benthic habitat mussels contributed to the riverbed and
   determined the contribution of burrow position to bed roughness and
   near-bed flow patterns. We found that burrow position varied by species,
   which was likely influenced by shell morphology, sculpture type, and
   river characteristics. We observed that the amount of shell exposed into
   the water column was similar to the coarse-sized sediment where mussels
   were found. We also found that mussel shells were exposed at a height
   greater than the median grain size and could, therefore, influence
   near-bed flows. Moreover, because larger grain sizes control sediment
   stability, the similar exposed length of burrowed mussels as coarse
   sediment could contribute to enhanced bed stability and reduce the risk
   of dislodgement. Better understanding of how mussel burrow position
   influences these important biophysical processes may help identify
   important Allee effects or minimum viable population indices, which may
   aid conservation and restoration efforts.},

Title = {Predator-permanence hypothesis in time: Community dynamics in a
   seasonally flooded wetland},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 1},
Abstract = {The predator-permanence hypothesis predicts that as hydroperiod
   increases in lentic ecosystems, biotic interactions-mainly
   predation-replace physical factors like drying as the main determinant
   of community structure and population dynamics. We propose that the same
   transition occurs over time in seasonally flooded ecosystems that are
   connected to permanent water bodies. To test for evidence of
   successional changes that are similar to spatial changes in the relative
   importance of drying and predation, we used a 12-y time series of snail
   density, predator density, and water depth at 4 sites arranged along a
   nutrient gradient in a subtropical, seasonally flooded wetland, the
   Florida Everglades, USA. The rate of change in snail population size was
   negatively correlated with their density at all 4 sites, suggesting that
   density-dependent factors such as resource limitation regulate snail
   dynamics. The strength of the relationship varied among sites such that
   when water depth changes were less important, snail population size was
   more important in predicting changes in snail population size. At the
   site that consistently had the greatest snail density, crayfish density
   negatively affected the rate of snail population change, suggesting that
   crayfish predation may limit snail population growth in areas with more
   or higher-quality resources that support larger snail populations.
   Tethering studies were also conducted, which revealed higher snail
   mortality in the wet season, primarily because crushing predators (e.g.,
   molluscivorous fishes) were more common at that time and added to the
   chronic mortality by entry-based predators (e.g., crayfish, which access
   snails through their aperture). In summary, 3 of the sites resembled
   temporary or permanent fishless ponds where snail populations were
   primarily structured by abiotic factors, intraspecific competition, and
   invertebrate predators (e.g., crayfish) during the wet season, whereas 1
   site showed evidence that snail populations were also influenced by
   molluscivorous fish. This temporal change in importance of water
   permanence factors to fish that affected population dynamics supports
   the spatial pattern proposed by the predator-permanence hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Large-scale disturbances, such as wildfire, can markedly affect streams
   for years. As terrestrial areas within a watershed slowly recover,
   stream environments and biota can experience repeated and long-lasting
   challenges. In 2011, the Las Conchas wildfire burned (1)/(3) of the
   Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, USA. Seven y
   post-fire, streams located near the burn perimeter continue to
   experience varying levels of alteration (e.g., channel alteration with
   large diel temperature swings), whereas the terrestrial uplands have
   begun to recover. Extreme temperatures in stream systems may affect the
   aquatic community, including ectotherms such as caddisflies. These
   post-fire temperature ranges may increase an ectotherm's breadth of
   thermal adaptation, but at metabolic costs that diminish organismal
   performance, such as growth, development, and fecundity. In this study
   we characterized in-situ effects of varied thermal regimes across
   preserve streams on the performance of the caddisfly Hydropsyche oslari
   Banks, 1905. We measured mass and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in H.
   oslari larvae from preserve streams affected by wildfire (high
   temperature range) and in streams minimally affected by wildfire (low
   temperature range). We predicted that increased daily temperature maxima
   and reduced daily temperature minima (i.e., large diel temperature
   swings) would be associated with reduced H. oslari mass because of the
   limiting effects of suboptimal temperatures on growth. As predicted, in
   the weeks prior to their emergence as terrestrial adults, 5(th)-instar
   larvae within the high-temperature range stream had reduced mass (mean
   3.3 +/- SE 0.55 mg) relative to larvae from the low-temperature range
   stream (6.2 +/- 0.69 mg). We also predicted that CTmax of H. oslari
   would reflect stream thermal history. Indeed, larvae H. oslari from the
   high-temperature range stream exhibited increased CTmax (35.4 +/- 0.17
   degrees C) compared with larvae from the low-temperature range stream
   (34.4 +/- 0.28 degrees C). We demonstrated that the effects of wildfire
   on caddisflies can be long lasting, as evidenced by the reduced size at
   maturity and higher thermal tolerance in a caddisfly population 7 y
   post-fire.},

Title = {Periphyton C and N stable isotopes detect agricultural stressors in

Abstract = {Shifts in the stable isotope signatures of C and N in ecological
   materials have the potential to indicate environmental disturbances.
   This study examined the delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15
   parts per thousand ratios of stream water and periphyton from low-order
   streams in a landscape influenced by agricultural activities. Our key
   purpose was to assess the influence of best management practice (BMP)
   presence and age on C and N isotope values as a potential water-quality
   assessment. We collected stream water and periphyton from 19 streams
   within the Upper Delaware River watershed in New York, USA, in each of 4
   management categories: 1) recently applied BMP treatments, 2)
   long-standing BMPs, 3) streams lacking BMPs, and 4) minimally disturbed
   reference streams. We sampled and analyzed water and periphyton for
   delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand in a
   repeated-measures design (BMP category x time) from April to November
   2013. There were large seasonal differences in stream water delta
   C-13-dissolved organic C (DIC)parts per thousand and delta(NO3)-N-15-N
   parts per thousand, with strong differences between reference and
   agricultural streams. Periphyton delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta
   N-15 parts per thousand values also differed strongly across streams
   draining land with agricultural activities, with 85\% higher periphyton
   delta N-15 parts per thousand signals in all agricultural categories vs
   reference streams. Periphyton diatom and chlorophyte taxonomic
   proportions showed the strongest relationship with periphyton delta C-13
   parts per thousand values, where diatoms were negatively associated with
   increasing delta C-13 parts per thousand. These results suggest that
   aqueous and periphytic stable isotopes were sensitive in detecting
   persistent effects of agriculture on these streams despite BMP
   mitigation, where nutrient (orthosphosphate, nitrite, and ammonia)
   levels were non-indicative. These results also suggest that BMPs may not
   have fully eliminated the negative impacts of agricultural stressors on
   water quality in impacted streams.},

Abstract = {Migratory connectivity is a metric of the co-occurrence of migratory
   animals originating from different breeding sites, and like their
   spatial dispersion, can vary substantially during the annual cycle.
   Together, both these properties affect the optimal times and sites of
   population censusing. We tracked taiga bean geese (Anser fabalis
   fabalis) during 2014-2021 to study their migratory connectivity and
   nonbreeding movements and determine optimal periods to assess the size
   of their main flyway population. We also compared available census data
   with tracking data, to examine how well two existing censuses covered
   the population. Daily Mantel's correlation between breeding and
   nonbreeding sites lay between 0 and 0.5 during most of the nonbreeding
   season, implying birds from different breeding areas were not strongly
   separated at other times in the annual cycle. However, the connectivity
   was higher among birds from the westernmost breeding areas compared to
   the birds breeding elsewhere. Daily Minimum Convex Polygons showed
   tracked birds were highly aggregated at census times, confirming their
   utility. The number of tracked birds absent at count sites during the
   censuses however exceeded numbers double-counted at several sites,
   indicating that censuses might have underestimated the true population
   size. Our results show that connectivity can vary in different times
   during the nonbreeding period, and should be studied throughout the
   annual cycle. Our results also confirm previous studies, which have
   found that estimates using marked individuals usually produce higher
   population size estimates than total counts. This should be considered
   when using total counts to assess population sizes in the future.},

Title = {How extreme drought events, introduced species, and disease interact to

Abstract = {Over the past century, native amphibian species in California, USA, have
   declined in geographic range and population size, including precipitous
   declines of the California Red-legged Frog Rana draytonii Baird and
   Girard, 1852 and the California Tiger Salamander Ambystoma californiense
   Gray, 1853. Habitat loss, infectious disease (e.g., chytridiomycosis),
   and the introduction of invasive species are potential contributors to
   this decline, but it is unclear how these variables interact with
   extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought to affect amphibian
   population dynamics. We used a 7-y dataset (2013-2019) on amphibian
   breeding activity that encompassed a recent extreme drought event to
   assess 1) how breeding activities of these taxa differed during and
   after drought conditions and 2) the additive and interactive
   relationships of drought, chytrid fungal infection (Bd), and invasive
   species with the presence and abundance of larval amphibians. Based on
   650 surveys of 110 lentic habitats in California, both amphibian species
   were highly sensitive to drought severity, such that the proportion of
   occupied sites during peak drought conditions decreased by 36\% for R.
   draytonii and 87\% for A. californiense relative to the initial year of
   the study. However, both taxa showed strong recovery, with increases in
   breeding occurrence as drought conditions eased in the following years
   (2016-2019). Invasive fishes and American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana
   Shaw, 1802) also negatively predicted the occurrence and density of the
   2 native taxa. Finally, we found that the relationship between Bd and R.
   draytonii larval density was influenced by drought conditions,
   suggesting that Bd's transmission rates or effects on host persistence
   are sensitive to climate. These findings illustrate the ability of
   native taxa to recover from recent drought conditions and reinforce the
   importance of controlling invasive species for improving breeding
   activities of threatened amphibians.},

Title = {Heat and smoke from wildfires influence water temperature and dissolved

Abstract = {Wildfire has become increasingly common and severe in forested
   landscapes across the western United States. Stream and air temperatures
   within these landscapes are influenced not only by direct heating during
   the fire but by shading from heavy smoke. In addition, dissolved oxygen
   (DO) can be affected by increased ash inputs from fire or reduced
   primary production under lower light conditions. Because collecting data
   as the event occurs is challenging, most research exploring fire effects
   on streams has focused on responses months to years after the event as
   opposed to during and immediately after the fire. We sought to
   understand how physical stream parameters change as wildfire burns near
   streams, how stream temperature responses vary through a stream reach,
   how parameters respond to shading from pervasive smoke during and
   shortly after the fire, and how fire severity correlates with observed
   changes. In this study, we report measurements of light, air
   temperature, stream temperature, and DO across eleven 2(nd)- to
   4(th)-order streams in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA, 1
   wk before, during, and 1 wk after an extensive wildfire in 2020. Burning
   near streams resulted in a brief increase in daily maximum stream
   temperature of 4.5 degrees C at the most severely burned site but small
   increases or decreases at less affected sites. Longitudinal replication
   revealed that temperature responses can be patchy at relatively small
   scales (similar to 50 m). DO daily minima decreased by 1.3 to 16.9\%
   saturation on the day of the fire, with the magnitude of effect
   corresponding to burn severity. Across all 11 sites, riparian and
   watershed estimates of Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after
   Wildfire and soil burn severity were better correlated with stream
   temperature responses to fire than percentage of watershed burned. Smoke
   effects were pervasive, both spatially and temporally, resulting in
   decreased light, stream temperature maxima, and diurnal variation in DO.
   Our results suggest that acute changes to physical stream parameters
   caused minimal harm to aquatic biota at our sites, and the effects of
   smoke on physical stream parameters will likely impose larger immediate
   effects on headwater streams than heating from the fire itself.},

Title = {Assessing seasonal and biological indices of juvenile Chinook Salmon for
   freshwater decision triggers that increase ocean survival},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {253-269},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Decision triggers, used in adaptive management frameworks to decide when
   a specific management action will be implemented, are often informed by
   monitoring data. The identification and application of decision triggers
   is highly relevant to endangered fishes migrating through regulated
   rivers, as examined in the current study. The main goal was to determine
   whether seasonal patterns of behavioral, physical, and physiological
   indices of juveniles were related to subsequent smolt-to-adult return
   (SAR) survival and, if so, to determine whether these indices could be
   used to guide decisions related to the mitigation strategy of the
   juvenile fish transportation program in the Federal Columbia River Power
   System (Pacific Northwest, USA). Hatchery yearling Chinook Salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha Walbaum in Artedi, 1792) were collected over
   the migration season at 3 dams in the hydrosystem and measured for fork
   length, wet mass, Fulton's K (or condition factor), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)
   activity (or smoltification index), and \% dry mass (or index of
   energetic reserves and smoltification). We estimated SAR survival from
   passive integrated transponder-tagged fish representative of our field
   samples and assessed its relationship to our fish indices, as well as
   indices of transported vs run-of-river passage and distance of sampling
   site to ocean. SAR survival was associated to interaction effects
   between juvenile fish transportation and \% dry mass or NKA activity.
   Transported hatchery Chinook Salmon with dry mass 7 mu mol ADP mg
   protein(-1) h(-1) showed greater SAR survival than their run-of-river
   counterparts. Fish with the highest predicted SAR survival had been
   transported and had fish indices consistent with smolts that were more
   developed (i.e., lower \% dry mass and higher NKA activity).
   Furthermore, our results on \% dry mass provided support for the
   hypothesis that greater lipid content increases fish buoyancy leading to
   greater susceptibility to predation. The buoyancy effect is expected to
   be greatest in hatchery fish. Overall, this study shows that decision
   triggers based on biological indices of migrating fish are potentially
   useful tools for in-season management.},

Title = {Optimizing stormwater management to facilitate urban stream restoration
   via a science-based approach},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Stormwater management affecting an urban stream is most effective when
   managers design programs tailored to the physical characteristics of the
   stream and the political and socioeconomic characteristics of the
   community it serves. Likewise, restoration projects and policy
   implementation should be designed to address the needs of the local
   community. This paper documents the development and implementation of a
   science-based, community-driven approach to stormwater management by a
   United States regional stormwater utility, Sanitation District No. 1
   (SD1) of Northern Kentucky, USA, that manages stormwater in 3 suburban
   counties in the greater metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. SD1
   began by establishing a hydrogeomorphic and biological monitoring
   program from 2006 to 2008 to gather the data needed to design a locally
   calibrated stormwater management program. SD1's monitoring network has
   facilitated multiple cross-jurisdictional partnerships and provides
   validation for stormwater management rules and regulations that are
   tailored to Northern Kentucky. Moreover, the monitoring data has
   informed the activities of a watershed restoration program that
   prioritizes cost-effective geomorphic recovery by retrofitting existing
   stormwater management facilities. Furthermore, diverse stakeholders,
   such as local land developers, engineers, and members of the regulatory
   community, have embraced the data-driven approach and are currently
   collaborating with SD1 to incorporate hydrologic restoration via
   stormwater management activities into an existing program that generates
   stream mitigation credits. The sale of these credits, designed to
   mitigate the loss of stream habitat due to development, could then
   further fund the expansion of these restoration efforts. SD1's approach
   could serve as a road map for other regional utilities hoping to tailor
   stormwater management to their streams and communities and find
   innovative funding sources for urban stream restoration.},

Title = {Quantifying spatial and temporal relationships between diatoms and
   nutrients in streams strengthens evidence of nutrient effects from
   monitoring data},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Observational data are frequently used to better understand the effects
   of changes in P and N on stream biota, but nutrient gradients in streams
   are usually associated with gradients in other environmental factors, a
   phenomenon that complicates efforts to accurately estimate the effects
   of nutrients. Here, we propose a new approach for analyzing
   observational data in which we compare the effects of changes in
   nutrient concentrations in time within individual sites and in space
   among many sites. Covarying relationships between other, potentially
   confounding environmental factors and nutrient concentrations are
   unlikely to be the same in both time and space, and, therefore,
   estimated effects of nutrients that are similar in time and space are
   more likely to be accurate. We applied this approach to diatom rbcL
   metabarcoding data collected from streams in the East Fork of the Little
   Miami River watershed, Ohio, USA. Changes in diatom assemblage
   composition were consistently associated with changes in the
   concentration of total reactive P in both time and space. In contrast,
   despite being associated with spatial differences in ammonia and urea
   concentrations, diatom assemblage composition was not associated with
   temporal changes in these nitrogen species. We suggest that the results
   of this analysis provide evidence of a causal effect of increased P on
   diatom assemblage composition. We further analyzed the effects of
   temporal variability in measurements of total reactive P and found that
   averaging periods greater than \~{}1 wk prior to sampling best
   represented the effects of P on the diatom assemblage. Comparisons of
   biological responses in space and time can sharpen insights beyond those
   that are based on analyses conducted on only 1 of the 2 dimensions.},

Abstract = {Around the world, freshwater lakes are increasingly suffering from
   harmful algal blooms (HABs) as a result of anthropogenic eutrophication.
   Muskegon Lake (Muskegon, Michigan, USA), a drowned river mouth, Great
   Lakes estuary, was declared an Area of Concern by the Environmental
   Protection Agency in 1987 with nuisance algal blooms cited as a
   beneficial-use impairment. The objective of this study was to quantify
   changes in HAB prevalence and assemblage composition in Muskegon Lake
   over 14 y (2003-2016) and explore the environmental factors potentially
   driving the changes. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses
   on long-term monitoring data, including environmental and phytoplankton
   data, to understand their relationships and temporal variation. Using
   linear regressions, we assessed changes in environmental variables over
   time and relationships between cyanobacteria biovolume and environmental
   variables. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualize
   variation in annual cyanobacteria assemblage composition and association
   with environmental variables. Analyses revealed that, despite generally
   rising water temperatures, which would be expected to increase HABs, a
   reduction in nutrient concentrations caused by restoration efforts has
   likely led to substantial decreases in HAB abundance over time.
   Additionally, HAB assemblage composition appears to be driven by
   temperature and nutrient form and amount, with Microcystis (Lemmermann,
   1907) often dominating. HABs in freshwater bodies should be closely
   monitored into the future as we enter an era of uncertain climatic
   conditions.},

Title = {Lessons learned from 20 y of monitoring suburban development with
   distributed stormwater management in Clarksburg, Maryland, USA},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Urban development is a well-known stressor for stream ecosystems,
   presenting a challenge to managers tasked with mitigating its effects.
   For the past 20 y, streamflow, water quality, geomorphology, and benthic
   communities were monitored in 5 watersheds in Montgomery County,
   Maryland, USA. This study presents a synthesis of multiple studies of
   monitoring efforts in the study area and new analysis of more recent
   monitoring data to document the primary lessons learned from monitoring.
   The monitored watersheds include a forested control, an urban control
   with centralized stormwater management, and 3 suburban treatment
   watersheds featuring low-impact development and a high density of
   infiltration-focused stormwater facilities distributed across the
   watershed. Treatment watersheds were monitored before development,
   during construction, and after development. Monitoring was initiated to
   inform adaptive management of stormwater and impervious cover limits
   within the study area, with a focus on the impacts of distributed
   stormwater management. Results from our synthesis indicate that
   distributed stormwater management is advantageous compared with
   centralized stormwater management in numerous ways. Hydrologic benefits
   were greater with distributed stormwater infrastructure, demonstrating
   the ability to mitigate runoff volumes and peak flows and, for small
   storms, replicate predevelopment conditions. Baseflow temporarily
   increased during the construction phase in the treatment watersheds.
   Water-quality benefits were mixed, with declines in baseflow nitrate
   concentrations but limited changes to nitrate export and increases in
   specific conductance after development. Substantial topographic changes
   occurred during construction in the treatment watersheds, including
   changes within the riparian zone, despite riparian buffer protections.
   Ecological monitoring indicated that even though index of biotic
   integrity scores rebounded in some cases, sensitive benthic
   macroinvertebrate families did not fully recover in the treatment
   watersheds. Lessons learned from this synthesis highlight the importance
   of tracking multiple indicators of stream health and considering past
   land use and that more stormwater facilities distributed across the
   watershed is beneficial but cannot mitigate the effects of all urban
   stressors on aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Climate change predictions for Southern Europe indicate an increase in
   the frequency and duration of summer low flows and water scarcity in
   streams. Droughts can cause substantial changes in aquatic communities
   and biogeochemical processes because they modify stream environmental
   conditions. Among the many physical, chemical, and biological variables
   that influence stream metabolism, nutrients may affect algae and
   heterotrophic microorganisms, and nutrient concentrations may vary with
   reduction in water discharge. We experimentally manipulated stream
   discharge and used a before-after control-impact paired design to assess
   how reduction of stream discharge affected metabolism (i.e., ecosystem
   respiration {[}ER] and gross primary production {[}GPP]). The study was
   done in 2 lowland forested streams in northwestern Spain with
   contrasting nutrient concentrations (i.e., mesotrophic: Caselas stream;
   eutrophic: Pego stream). In the 2 streams, metabolism was estimated
   before and after discharge manipulation. Prior to discharge reduction,
   the 2 streams were heterotrophic (i.e., GPP : ER < 1), and GPP and ER
   were related in the eutrophic Pego. Discharge reduction increased GPP at
   the impacted reaches of the mesotrophic Caselas and decoupled GPP and ER
   at the Pego. An information-theoretic approach was used to assess which
   combinations of physical, chemical, and biological variables were most
   important to explain the variation in ER and GPP under the different
   hydrologic conditions. The observed differences between the 2 streams
   suggest that the metabolic response to stream drought can be modulated
   by the interplay between nutrient availability and the density of
   consumers feeding on resources, among other environmental variables. We
   show that longer summer periods and reduced stream discharge have the
   potential to increase daily hypoxia in nutrient-rich lowland stream
   ecosystems. Increased hypoxia can threaten biodiversity of stream
   ecosystems and reduce consumer pressure on basal instream resources,
   such as algae, bacteria, and fungi, which may, in turn, favor instream
   GPP. In addition, drying conditions seemed to favor autotrophic over
   heterotrophic activity under moderate nutrient availability (i.e.,
   increase in the GPP : ER ratio in the impacted Caselas reaches).
   Therefore, drought conditions not only affect overall daily rates of
   metabolic activity, but also the relative importance of different energy
   sources and organic matter for instream function. Our results show that
   discharge reduction caused by increased water scarcity, due to both
   climate change and water demand by human activities, can influence
   energy flow and organic matter dynamics through effects on the
   metabolism of forested lowland streams.},

Abstract = {The native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri
   Jordan and Gilbert, 1883) population in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone
   National Park, Wyoming, USA, is in decline because of competition from
   the introduced, invasive Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush Walbaum in
   Artedi, 1792). Gillnetting is used to suppress adult Lake Trout;
   however, methods are being developed to suppress embryos, including
   adding Lake Trout carcasses and carcass-analog pellets to spawning
   sites. Decomposing carcasses and analog pellets cause decreased
   dissolved oxygen concentrations thereby leading to Lake Trout embryo
   mortality, but the effects of these methods on primary producers are
   unknown. We deployed in-situ nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS) at 3
   spawning sites. The 1(st) site was treated with carcasses, the 2(nd)
   site was treated with analog pellets, and a 3(rd) lacked treatment
   (control). To estimate how suppression measures may alter nutrient
   limitation, we measured algal biomass in 6 NDS amendments at each site:
   nothing (control), N, P, N + P, ground carcasses, or pulverized analog
   pellets. We deployed 5 replicates of each amendment at each site before
   and after treating whole sites. N and P co-limited periphyton before
   carcasses or analog pellets were added to spawning sites (p < 0.01);
   however, nutrients were not limiting after the treatments were added to
   spawning sites (p = 0.31-1). Algal biomass was 4x higher after
   whole-site carcass treatments. In contrast, analog pellets appeared to
   suppress algal biomass in the amendments (20\% of NDS at the control
   site post-treatment) and in the treatment plot (33\% of pre-treatment
   biomass at analog pellet site). We also measured how individual
   ingredients in analog pellets altered periphyton biomass, which
   suggested that vitamin E, estrogen, and soybean oil ingredients reduced
   the growth of primary producers. Suppression methods may stimulate or
   reduce algal biomass, depending on the methods used, which could have
   cascading effects on food webs and potentially reduce the success of the
   control measures. Estimating how different Lake Trout suppression
   methods may alter basal resources in the littoral zone of Yellowstone
   Lake will help natural resource agencies develop effective plans to
   control invasive predators at early life stages while minimally altering
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonium concentration as drivers of

Abstract = {Nitrification rates and ammonia-oxidizer functional gene abundance were
   measured in the water column of Lake Lacawac, Pennsylvania, USA, a
   freshwater lake on a nature sanctuary that allowed an investigation with
   minimal human impacts. Nitrification is a 2-step process consisting of
   ammonia oxidation followed by nitrite oxidation. Recent studies have
   shown that these 2 nitrification steps may be uncoupled and respond in
   different ways to environmental conditions. Additionally, the relative
   contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archea (AOA) vs ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) to nitrification rates varies widely across aquatic
   systems. To determine how nitrification rates are related to
   environmental parameters and the ammonia-oxidizing community in a nearly
   pristine environment, rates and gene abundance were measured over
   multiple seasons where in-situ environmental conditions varied. Rates of
   ammonia and nitrite oxidation were measured separately and summed to
   calculate total nitrification rates ranging from 1 to 568 nM/d. Ammonia
   oxidation rates generally outpaced nitrite oxidation rates, and rates of
   both ammonia and nitrite oxidation were higher at depth (10 m) compared
   with near-surface and mid water column. Ammonia oxidation, nitrite
   oxidation, and total nitrification rates were all strongly, positively
   correlated with in-situ {[}NH4+] (Kendall's tau > 0.35, p < 0.02). AOB
   ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene copy numbers were generally greater
   than AOA amoA. However, AOB gene copy numbers were not correlated with
   any ammonia oxidation or total nitrification rates, whereas AOA
   abundance was positively correlated with both ammonia oxidation and
   total nitrification rates (Kendall's tau > 0.41, p < 0.01). A Bayesian
   generalized additive model, which accounted for sampling month,
   indicated that total nitrification rates were best explained by AOA and
   {[}NH4+]. Thus, substrate concentration and AOA likely play key roles in
   regulating rates of nitrification in this small, nearly pristine
   freshwater lake. These reported relationships between rates of ammonia
   and nitrite oxidation (and, thus, total nitrification), in-situ
   environmental parameters, and the ammonia-oxidizer community in a
   protected environment establish a reference for evaluating the impact of
   a changing environment on mesotrophic lake water quality.},

Title = {Nutrient processing domains: Spatial and temporal patterns of material

Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Reaches are a fundamental unit for lotic biogeochemical
   characterization, yet a functional classification of nutrient processing
   at the reach scale is currently lacking. Here, we introduce nutrient
   processing domains (NPDs) to integrate routing (nutrient delivery) and
   local (benthic uptake and transformation) processes that dictate
   longitudinal patterns of lotic biogeochemical function. An NPD is
   defined as a realm in functional space occupied by reaches that share
   similar biogeochemical character. Occupation of a given NPD reflects
   characteristic net material balance (NMB), exchange potential, and
   availability, associated with changes in solute load, the extent of
   hydrologic gain or loss, and changes in concentration from the head to
   the base of a reach, respectively. Using a mass-balance approach, we
   represent NMB as the effective solute flux (F-eff, M L-2 T-1, where M =
   mass, L = length, and T = time), designating reaches as sources (+F-eff)
   or sinks (-F-eff). Discharge change along a reach is measured as the
   change in hydraulic load (Delta H-L, L/T), reflecting the potential for
   import and export to influence solute loads. Finally, the ratio of
   downstream-to-upstream concentration (C-dwn:up) represents the net
   effect that processes have on nutrient availability. Using a 20-y
   historical record for N and P in the Upper Clark Fork River, Montana,
   USA, we employed this approach to 3 consecutive reaches covering nearly
   90 km of channel length to address spatial and temporal dynamics in NPD
   behavior in a nutrient-rich, productive river system. For total N and
   total P, reaches typically occupied compiler or enhancer NPDs,
   displaying load increases without or with concomitant increases in
   concentration, respectively. In contrast, reaches were NO3- consumers,
   acting as sinks for NO3-N during summer and autumn. NO3- load reductions
   were typically accompanied by striking declines in concentration,
   despite positive exchange potential (i.e., +Delta H-L). Measured F-eff
   magnitudes for NO3- (-1.2 to -60.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) were similar to
   those reported in the literature associated with autotrophic N demand.
   Individual reaches occupied contrasting NPDs for NO3-N and soluble
   reactive P by simultaneously serving as a sink for one and a source for
   the other. Hence, alternating reaches acted as enhancers or consumers,
   sequentially along the river, reflecting geologic and biological
   influences with implications for whole river behavior. The NPD approach
   combines routing influences of material exchange and local biological
   stream processes to provide a biogeochemical taxonomy for stream reaches
   with application to theory and practice.},

Title = {Alien species of the Romanian and Bulgarian Black Sea coast: state of

Abstract = {In order to assist the implementation of the European policies on
   Invasive Alien Species (IAS Regulation) and mitigate the impact of alien
   species that threaten the marine ecosystem services and biodiversity,
   accurate lists of alien species per European Member State are required.
   Although inventories of marine alien species and relevant information
   about them have been reported for the Black Sea marine region of Romania
   and Bulgaria, a validated list of alien species for the two countries is
   still lacking. In this paper we (i) propose a validated list of the
   marine alien species occurring in the Romanian and Bulgarian Black Sea
   regions, and (ii) address errors, gaps and uncertainties associated with
   listing alien species from the marine waters of the two countries. The
   list of alien species includes 37 species for Romania and 26 for
   Bulgaria, with the highest number of alien species belonging to the
   phylum Arthopoda for both countries. The majority of alien species have
   been classified as successfully established in the marine waters of both
   countries. Thirteen alien species were classified as invasive in Romania
   whilst eight alien species were classed as invasive in Bulgaria. The
   historical overview indicates that the number of alien species has
   steadily increased over the last 50 years both in Romania and Bulgaria.
   The results of our study provide the baseline list and information for
   addressing marine alien species at a national level and a starting point
   for selecting the invasive alien species for risk assessment towards an
   effective implementation of the IAS Regulation. In conclusion, this
   study provides supporting information for implementing measures to
   tackle the introduction of alien species in the western region of the
   Black Sea. These measures are needed to build an early warning,
   prevention, and control of invasive alien species in the Black Sea, a
   unique and fragile ecosystem.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Invasive species are the 2(nd)-greatest threat to global freshwater
   biodiversity. Crayfish are especially robust invaders due to their
   omnivorous nature and ability to compete both directly (resource
   procurement) and indirectly (habitat occupation and modification) with
   native species. The Northern Crayfish (Faxonius virilis Hagen, 1870) was
   introduced to the North Saskatchewan River basin (Alberta, western
   Canada) and has persisted there since the early 1990s. Faxonius virilis'
   impacts on native fish assemblages in the North Saskatchewan River have
   yet to be assessed, even though the watershed is ecologically,
   economically, and culturally valuable and home to multiple sensitive and
   at-risk fish species. We aimed to identify the instream environmental
   characteristics associated with F. virilis occupancy in the North
   Saskatchewan River basin and to determine which currently unoccupied
   tributaries are most vulnerable to F. virilis invasion. We used
   occupancy modeling to meet these objectives. We deployed 24-h baited
   crayfish traps and measured water temperature, turbidity, flow velocity,
   and physical complexity at 37 sites along the Alberta portion of the
   North Saskatchewan River basin. We detected F. virilis at 13/37 sites
   with no occurrences detected in the upper basin. Occupancy model
   selection and averaging revealed that water temperature alone was
   associated with occupancy of F. virilis in the North Saskatchewan River
   basin. Streams with mean summer water temperatures >similar to 19
   degrees C were >= 50\% more likely to be occupied by F. virilis than
   cooler streams and are at highest risk of invasion. Further, we found
   that streams with mean summer water temperatures F. virilis than warmer
   streams. Coldwater streams may thus have some natural protection against
   F. virilis invasion. The results from this study provide practical
   guidelines for watershed management of invasive F. virilis populations
   in western Canadian river basins. Managing F. virilis is particularly
   important and time sensitive because F. virilis' range will likely
   expand when water temperatures in the basin rise because of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes in stream biofilms dominate
   biogeochemical cycling and rely on nutrient and energy resources for
   growth and productivity. In the boreal forest, variation in these
   resources can originate from permafrost distribution and controls
   competition for nutrients between stream autotrophs and heterotrophs. We
   investigated which resources control nutrient uptake and metabolism in
   headwater stream biofilms of subarctic Alaska, USA, and how resource
   availability affects competition for inorganic nutrients. We
   hypothesized that the competitive outcome between autotrophs and
   heterotrophs for inorganic nutrients would be dependent on availability
   of organic C, or inorganic nutrients (N and P). To test our hypotheses,
   we measured resource limitation at the patch and reach scales along a
   permafrost gradient in interior Alaska. At the patch scale, nutrient
   diffusing substrata revealed that, secondary to light, N and P were
   colimiting to autotrophic growth, whereas C was primarily limiting to
   heterotrophic respiration. In the presence of labile C, heterotrophs
   exhibited a larger response to nutrient enrichment and outcompeted
   autotrophs for inorganic nutrients. At the reach scale, light
   availability had the largest influence on nutrient uptake, but inorganic
   nutrients were also important. The positive response to increased
   nutrient and C availability at the patch scale suggests that the
   predicted increase in exports into fluvial networks with permafrost
   degradation will alter biofilm structure and function. Ultimately,
   biofilm communities will shift to more heterotroph-dominated patches if
   heterotrophs outcompete autotrophs for inorganic nutrients. As
   permafrost thaws and nutrients and organic C mobilize into streams,
   nutrient uptake dynamics and competition within biofilms will be
   altered, affecting nutrient use and export.},

Title = {Including equity in urban stream restoration: From historical wrongs to
   new paradigms},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {As the practice of stream restoration continues expanding globally, the
   importance of including social factors and communities within the
   restoration or revitalization process also increases. Engineers and
   environmental scientists have acknowledged the crucial role of actively
   involving such communities, but community involvement poses challenges
   because there is little guidance on managing social processes and
   balancing different interests. Although many restoration efforts appear
   to be addressing the needs of crucial ecological habitats, there have
   been concerning disparities identified associated to race, ethnicity,
   and income. Through examining 2 case studies, we attempt to identify
   historical trends and to describe inequities, environmental burdens, and
   urgent needs of oppressed communities. This validation process also led
   us to explore systemic constraints that can perpetuate injustices. We
   suggest that an equity and environmental justice perspective can provide
   both context and an opportunity to recognize and address basic needs of
   communities. The ultimate goal of stream restoration should be to
   achieve solutions that provide true justice; therefore, considering
   power relations and finding causes rather than symptoms of inequities
   are both important to achieving more sustainable and equitable stream
   restoration outcomes.},

Abstract = {The organization of species metacommunities can be controlled by local
   factors, such as habitat quality, landscape factors, such as land use,
   and spatial factors, such as stream network distances. Species within a
   metacommunity have different traits that may be used to understand the
   determinants of community structure. This study aimed to understand how
   changes in environmental and spatial factors affected stream fish
   assemblages delineated based on their dispersal-related traits, such as
   preferential habitat use (i.e., benthic, nektobenthic, nektonic,
   marginal, and surface), preference for water velocity (i.e., fast,
   intermediate, and slow), and body size (i.e., small, medium, and large).
   We sampled 18 stream reaches in a dendritic network in the Upper Parana
   River basin, located in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used variation
   partitioning techniques to test the relative effects of local
   environmental, landscape, and spatial variables on different species
   groups defined according to dispersal-related traits. Environmental and
   spatial variables weakly explained the variation in total assemblage
   taxonomic composition. However, based on different functional trait
   groups, we found that the environment had a strong relationship with
   assemblage composition of nektobenthic and small fish, whereas spatial
   variables were most strongly associated with marginal and surface fish.
   Large-scale spatial variables were associated with large fish and those
   that prefer slow water, whereas fine-scale variables were associated
   with small and surface-dwelling fish. These findings help improve
   understanding of how functional composition of stream fish assemblages
   may be affected by urban development, riparian conversion, and resulting
   changes in local environmental conditions.},

Title = {Freshwater floodplain habitats buffer native food webs from negative
   effects of nonnative centrarchids and bullfrogs},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-341},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Species introductions are common in freshwater environments and have the
   potential to transform community and ecosystem structure. Predatory
   centrarchid fishes and American Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus Shaw,
   1802 previously Rana catesbeiana) are both widespread aquatic invaders
   implicated in native amphibian declines. In lowland ecosystems,
   co-occurrence between native and nonnative amphibian and fish taxa is
   common; however, the mechanisms that facilitate their co-occurrence are
   poorly studied. Stable isotope analysis offers a tool to examine trophic
   interactions among native and nonnative taxa, including predation,
   competition, and shifting food resource availability, which may provide
   mechanistic insight into the drivers of co-occurrence. In this study, we
   used stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to determine how the
   trophic structure of native fishes and amphibians differs between
   waterbodies with and without nonnative centrarchid fishes and bullfrogs
   across a floodplain in southwestern Washington, USA. We hypothesized
   that native species alter their feeding strategies to reduce niche
   overlap with nonnative taxa. In the presence of nonnative taxa,
   Three-spine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus, 1758), all
   native larval salamander species (Ambystoma gracile Baird, 1859 and
   Ambystoma macrodactylum Baird, 1850), and 1 of 2 native larval frog
   species (Rana aurora Baird and Girard, 1852) exhibited shifts in food
   resources or trophic position. Despite trophic differences, only 1
   species (A. macrodactylum) had a smaller niche size in the presence of
   nonnatives. The observed trophic shifts reflect changes in habitat or
   food resources, which may reduce competition or predation and promote
   co-occurrence between nonnative and native taxa. Our results suggest
   that the co-occurrence of native and nonnative amphibians and fishes in
   lowland floodplain habitats may be facilitated by a broad range of food
   resources and complex habitat structure.},

Abstract = {Trinidad and Tobago are home to three endemic species in the anuran
   genus Pristimantis, of which two (Pristimantis charlottevillensis and
   Pristimantis turpinorum) occur in Tobago alone and the third
   (Pristimantis urichi) is present on both islands. Earlier, the IUCN
   assessed the conservation status of these species as: P. urichi,
   Endangered (EN); P. charlottevillensis, Least Concern (LC); P.
   turpinorum, Vulnerable (VU). However, these assessments were based on
   very little field-based evidence. Here, we present survey results which
   contributed to reassessments as LC, VU and Data Deficient for these
   three species, respectively. Despite the close proximity of Trinidad to
   northern Venezuela, the islands do not share any Pristimantis species
   with the mainland, which holds a rich endemicity of Pristimantis
   regionally. In this study, we used genetic sequencing from several
   island populations and compared them to northern Venezuelan endemics to
   assess genetic divergence for the first time. The time tree analyses
   found that only the northern Tobago species P. turpinorum is closely
   related to mainland Pristimantis, with a genetic split dating to the
   Late Miocene, suggesting a vicariant event of mainland and island
   species. Pristimantis urichi, although identical between the two
   islands, remains highly divergent from the mainland species. Similar
   results were found for P. charlottevillensis. In addition, there was a
   high level of divergence between P. urichi and P. charlottevillensis.
   These findings indicate different island colonization events by
   different lineages. Sequencing other Venezuelan species remains pivotal
   to unravel the complexity of the colonization episodes in the region,
   likely influenced by the changing topography and multiple connection and
   isolation episodes of the islands by eustatic sea-level changes.},

Abstract = {A survey of the exchange of freshwater gastropods mollusks between
   Europe and North America is provided. Several dozen species of snails
   migrated, during the last two centuries, in either direction across
   North Atlantic and this process is ongoing. The intensity of the faunal
   exchange is unequal since much more snail species have dispersed from
   North America to Europe than in the opposite direction. Two cases of
   ``failed{''} invasions of North American lymnaeid snails to Europe are
   discussed. A species of pulmonate snails, Ampullaceana balthica
   (Linnaeus, 1758), is reported here as new for the malacofauna of Canada
   (and for the whole North America). This snail of European origin was
   found in June 2019 in a small lake in the vicinities of Rimouski Town
   (Quebec, Canada). The taxonomic identification of the mollusks was
   confirmed by molecular analysis, with the studied specimens having two
   unique COI haplotypes, hitherto not found in Europe.},

Title = {Nutrient limitation of periphytic algal assemblages in agricultural

Abstract = {Land-use practices can deteriorate the health of aquatic ecosystems in
   lower-order streams by increasing the availability of nutrients to
   periphytic algae. The magnitude of eutrophication likely depends in part
   on the nature of nutrient limitation and other local environmental
   factors. We used nutrient diffusing substrates and assessments of
   taxonomically diagnostic pigments to experimentally identify the drivers
   of nutrient limitation of periphytic algal assemblages across 30 streams
   which collectively spanned a gradient of agricultural land-use intensity
   (cropland, pasture, and nutrients) across Boreal Forest, Grassland, and
   Parkland ecoregions in Alberta, Canada. We identified N as the primary
   limiting factor of total algal biomass accrual. Overall,
   bacillariophytes made up most of the total algal biomass response to N.
   Dissolved inorganic N to total P ratios in the water column were
   consistently low, and P amendment altered assemblage composition by
   stimulating chlorophytes over bacillariophytes. Differences in soil
   types, precipitation, runoff, and leaching potential within and across
   ecoregions did not alter the algal responses to the experimental
   nutrient amendments. The effect of N-limiting conditions observed across
   most streams had greater relative importance than other potential
   abiotic factors (e.g., light) on algal growth. Whereas a historical
   focus on P management remains important, our findings highlight the need
   to increase the attention and focus on N in watershed management plans
   during the summer months to mitigate eutrophication of agricultural
   streams.},

Title = {Stream macroinvertebrate reintroductions: A cautionary approach for
   restored urban streams},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Macroinvertebrate assemblages often remain depauperate in physically
   restored urban streams despite efforts to improve habitat conditions and
   increase species abundance and diversity. The lack of biological
   recovery may be due to a lack of a natural, nearby source of colonists,
   and this has inspired researchers and practitioners to reintroduce
   macroinvertebrates in otherwise restored urban streams to jump start the
   recovery process. However, without standardized guidelines that describe
   reintroduction best practices, some reintroduction programs may create
   additional problems (e.g., disease spread, genetic homogenization,
   population loss). To reduce these risks and limit a potential waste of
   resources, a cautionary approach is warranted. In this paper we
   summarize current stream reintroduction knowledge and detail best
   practices for aquatic macroinvertebrate reintroduction in restored urban
   streams. We provide criteria that managers can use to determine whether
   reintroduction is appropriate and demonstrate how researchers can use
   reintroduction as a tool to test hypotheses regarding factors limiting
   recolonization. We provide guidance for how to set clear reintroduction
   goals, select donor sites, determine the number of organisms required,
   establish reintroduction frequency and timing, and overcome challenges
   associated with monitoring. This framework can help managers create more
   successful reintroduction programs that can benefit urban stream
   restoration.},

Title = {Influences of stream ecosystem respiration on stream network
   denitrification: Results from a simulation modeling experiment},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Denitrification can remove substantial amounts of NO3- from stream
   networks, but controls on the magnitude and distribution of
   network-scale denitrification remain poorly understood. Prior research
   using an empirical relationship between stream {[}NO3-] and
   denitrification efficiency to construct a stream network denitrification
   model suggested that smaller, lower order streams contributed
   disproportionately to whole-network NO3- removal when NO3- loads were
   low. We expanded this model by incorporating an empirical relationship
   between whole-stream aerobic respiration rate and denitrification
   efficiency, which decreased the simulated sensitivity of NO3- removal to
   {[}NO3-] and displayed additional heterogeneity in NO3- removal
   associated with variation in respiration rates. We explored the
   sensitivity of the expanded model across a set of scenarios representing
   variation in stream respiration and NO3--loading rates. Stream
   respiration rates used in these scenarios were determined from a
   theoretical relationship between aerobic respiration rate and stream
   temperature and were calculated for model scenarios representing warm
   (high respiration rate) and cool (low respiration rate) conditions. Our
   results indicated that reach- and network-scale denitrification is apt
   to be strongly influenced by respiration rates when NO3- supplies are
   high relative to removal rates. Therefore, the distribution of
   respiration rates across stream networks likely plays a more important
   role in determining spatial patterns of denitrification rates than
   previously described, highlighting a mechanism by which larger (higher
   order) streams may contribute substantially to whole-network
   denitrification.},

Title = {Responses of survival, growth, and feeding of the invasive Golden Apple
   Snail (Pomacea canaliculata) to salinity stress},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {The Golden Apple Snail Pomacea canaliculata (Lamark, 1822) is one of the
   most aggressive invasive freshwater snails and has been found in
   tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Their presence
   threatens trophic structure in invaded ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and
   harms human health both directly (e.g., as a vector of parasites) and
   indirectly (e.g., through altering the provision of ecosystem services
   from uninvaded ecosystems). The tolerance of Golden Apple Snails to
   saltwater is of concern because they may pose an invasion risk into
   estuary habitats. We studied the salinity tolerance of Golden Apple
   Snails by determining differences in their survival, growth, and feeding
   at 5 salinity levels (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 practical salinity
   units {[}PSU]) over 30 d. Artificial seawater was prepared with aerated
   tap water and synthetic sea salt, consisting of NaCl (68.88\%), KCl
   (1.79\%), CaCl2 (2.55\%), MgCl2 (8.67\%), MgSO4 (5.36\%), and NaHCO3
   (12.75\%). Snails were classified into 3 life stages based on shell
   length: juvenile (10-19.99 mm), mature (20-29.99 mm), and old snails
   (30-39.99 mm). Snails at all 3 life stages survived in salinities of 0
   to 5.0 PSU but died within 9 d in salinities of 7.5 and 10.0 PSU. The
   survival percentage of snails decreased in the order: mature > old >
   juvenile. Snails across all life stages had reduced shell and mass
   growth with salinity exposure, but their feeding rate in salinity 2.5
   and 5.0 PSU became similar to the control group after 23 d. Generally,
   Golden Apple Snails may live in waters of <= 5.0 PSU. Therefore, special
   attention should be paid to the activity of Golden Apple Snails in
   tropical and subtropical areas with salinities <= 5.0 PSU, which would
   be important for protecting against the snails' destructive effects on
   productive resources.},

Abstract = {One of the major goals in microbial ecology is to understand whether the
   empirical biogeographic patterns of macroorganisms also apply to
   microorganisms. Here, we used morphological data from live organisms,
   along with molecular data, to investigate the importance of spatial
   factors and environmental variables in influencing ciliate composition
   from floodplain lakes. Our main goal was to use 2 different approaches
   (morphological and molecular) to compare ciliate diversity and
   distribution patterns as well as to compare how these methods differ in
   their ability to detect distribution patterns and the roles of spatial
   and environmental factors that shape ciliate assemblages in the 4
   largest floodplains in Brazil. Planktonic water samples were gathered
   from 33 lakes associated with 4 different river floodplain systems in
   Brazil. We analyzed ciliates in vivo and sequenced surface water DNA
   using a metabarcoding approach with general eukaryotic primers. We
   showed that the diversity of operational taxonomic units was much higher
   than that of morphospecies. Regardless of the method of identification,
   we found a consistent spatial assembly pattern of ciliate assemblages
   across the 4 floodplain systems. We also found that environmental
   filters had a stronger association with the morphological than with the
   molecular site-by-site dissimilarities. Meanwhile, biogeographic factors
   and the distance among sites limited the distribution of molecular-based
   composition, resulting in strong differences among the floodplain lakes
   analyzed. This finding suggests that ecological research and
   biomonitoring activities should find an equilibrium between
   morphological and molecular approaches because each approach provides
   unique insights.},

Title = {The contribution of autochthonous resource to the diet of aquatic
   consumers is unrelated to its spatial distribution in tank bromeliads},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-87},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Autochthonous biomass is heterogeneously distributed within freshwater
   ecosystems, shaping community structure and ecosystem functioning, yet
   few studies have evaluated how the spatial heterogeneity in the
   availability of the autochthonous resource affects its contribution to
   the diets of aquatic consumers. To fill this gap, we conducted a field
   survey to test whether the spatial heterogeneity of the autochthonous
   resource within freshwater ecosystems formed in tank bromeliads
   determines its contribution to the diet of aquatic consumers. Tank
   bromeliads are Neotropical plants with densely arranged leaves in a
   rosette shape that accumulate rainwater and terrestrial plant material,
   providing suitable habitat for a diversity of aquatic invertebrates. We
   sampled 3 regions (north, central, and south) of the bromeliad ecosystem
   to provide a natural gradient in the availability of the autochthonous
   resource (i.e., algae biomass). To trace the diets of aquatic consumers,
   we used stable isotope analysis of hydrogen coupled with Bayesian stable
   isotope mixing models. The availability of the autochthonous resource
   varied among the tank-bromeliad regions with light availability, but it
   was not related to its relative contribution to the diets of aquatic
   consumers. Instead, aquatic consumers from all regions showed similarly
   high degrees of autochthony. The capacity of aquatic consumers to move
   within the plant did not affect the contribution of the autochthonous
   resource to their diets. We reason that the contribution of the
   autochthonous resource to the diets of consumers is not related to its
   spatial distribution because aquatic consumers preferentially feed on
   this resource, even when its stocks are limited. In addition, water flow
   among tanks could provide a subsidy of the autochthonous resource from
   more productive to less productive regions. We conclude that spatial
   heterogeneity in the availability of the autochthonous resource does not
   limit its contribution to the diet of aquatic consumers because of
   active foraging on the autochthonous resource and the flux of this
   resource among compartments in freshwater tank-bromeliad ecosystems.},

Title = {The origins of Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) in New Zealand's

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) is a widely distributed aquatic
   gastropod, primarily found in tropical regions, which has also invaded
   geothermally heated waters in temperate regions. The spread of M.
   tuberculata globally has primarily been in association with the aquarium
   trade and aquatic plants. In New Zealand, M. tuberculata is known from
   both the aquarium trade and from one non-indigenous population in a
   geothermal stream. To date, the origins of M. tuberculata in the
   aquarium trade in New Zealand-or elsewhere-has not been systematically
   examined genetically, and it has not been confirmed whether New
   Zealand's non -indigenous population is genetically similar to, or
   originated from, individuals sold in aquarium stores. We examined the
   origins of New Zealand M. tuberculata, in the aquarium trade, and in the
   established non-indigenous population using COI marker sequences.
   Representatives of M. tuberculata in New Zealand have not originated
   from a single source; two distinct genetic clades were identified for
   individuals, with the origins of each inferred to be from Asia and
   Africa. The non-indigenous population and individuals sourced from one
   private aquarium owner were found to originate in Asia, and are
   genetically similar to those collected from Singapore, one of the most
   significant countries globally for the culturing and distribution of
   aquarium species. The remaining collections, from a display aquarium and
   three online suppliers in various New Zealand locations, were most
   similar genetically to populations native to Lake Malawi and Tanganyika,
   and non-indigenous populations from Australia. Overall, as M.
   tuberculata is an obligate parthenogen, each independently introduced
   clone may be considered a distinct non-indigenous taxon. We recommend
   further systematic genetic analyses of individuals in the aquarium trade
   elsewhere, to assess more fully the diversity and origins of Melanoides
   being transported in the aquarium trade.},

Title = {Bioinvasion impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human

Abstract = {Biological invasions have become a defining feature of marine
   Mediterranean ecosystems with significant impacts on biodiversity,
   ecosystem services, and human health. We systematically reviewed the
   current knowledge on the impacts of marine biological invasions in the
   Mediterranean Sea. We screened relevant literature and applied a
   standardised framework that classifies mechanisms and magnitude of
   impacts and type of evidence. Overall, 103 alien and cryptogenic species
   were analysed, 59 of which were associated with both negative and
   positive impacts, 17 to only negative, and 13 to only positive; no
   impacts were found for 14 species. Evidence for most reported impacts
   (52\%) was of medium strength, but for 32\% of impact reports evidence
   was weak, based solely on expert judgement. Only 16\% of the reported
   impacts were based on experimental studies. Our assessment allowed us to
   create an inventory of 88 alien and cryptogenic species from 16
   different phyla with reported moderate to high impacts. The ten worst
   invasive species in terms of reported negative impacts on biodiversity
   include six algae, two fishes, and two molluscs, with the green alga
   Caulerpa cylindracea ranking first. Negative impacts on biodiversity
   prevailed over positive ones. Competition for resources, the creation of
   novel habitat through ecosystem engineering, and predation were the
   primary reported mechanisms of negative effects. Most cases of combined
   negative and positive impacts on biodiversity referred to
   community-level modifications. Overall, more positive than negative
   impacts were reported on ecosystem services, but this varied depending
   on the service. For human health, only negative impacts were recorded.
   Substantial variation was found among Mediterranean ecoregions in terms
   of mechanisms of impact and the taxonomic identity of impacting species.
   There was no evidence that the magnitude of impact increases with
   residence time. Holistic approaches and experimental research constitute
   the way forward to better understanding and managing biological
   invasions.},

Abstract = {The monogenean freshwater parasite Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957
   is endemic to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) east of the Baltic Sea, but
   has spread outside this area via transport and stocking of fish. In
   Norway and Russia, infections with G. salaris have had catastrophic
   consequences for many salmon populations. The parasite is also common on
   farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) where it can persist in low
   numbers and without clinical signs. The transport and movement of
   infected rainbow trout is an important factor in the spreading of G.
   salaris in Europe. Due to increasing interest in establishing rainbow
   trout farms in White Sea drainages in Murmansky Oblast, Russia, and the
   potential subsequent unintentional spreading of G. salaris,
   parasitological examinations of salmonids were carried out. Farmed
   rainbow trout (n = 48) and Atlantic salmon (n = 375) from River Tuloma
   and farmed rainbow trout from Lake Imandra (n = 10), were examined in
   the period from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, environmental DNA monitoring
   was conducted for the detection of G. salaris in 2018. Gyrodactylus
   specimens were first detected in 2015 on Atlantic salmon from the
   tributary River Pak. Specimens obtained from Atlantic salmon in River
   Tuloma and from rainbow trout in River Tuloma and Lake Imandra the
   following years were confirmed to be G. salaris by sequencing of the
   nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA) and
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI). All specimens carried the same
   COI sequence, which was identical to a strain (GenBank Accession number
   AF479750) frequently found on farmed rainbow trout. The prevalence
   varied, but reached 100\% in some samples. Maximum intensity observed
   was 899, but intensities were generally lower than intensities expected
   to lead to mortalities. There was good correspondence between eDNA
   monitoring and conventional methods. The results indicate that G.
   salaris has spread to River Tuloma via transport of live rainbow trout.},

Abstract = {The non-indigenous tanaidacean crustacean Sinelobus vanhaareni Bamber,
   2014 was first found in northern Europe in 2006 and has since spread to
   the northern Baltic Sea. Here, we surveyed the distribution of the
   species in different habitats in southwestern Finland, focusing on
   vegetated macroalgal and seagrass habitats (i.e., Fucus vesiculosus beds
   and Zostera marina meadows). We also evaluated its potential impacts by
   synthesizing current knowledge on the traits and ecology of the species,
   and identified knowledge gaps. We found that S. vanhaareni is now
   present throughout most of the southwestern Finnish coast, in a number
   of vegetated and non-vegetated substrates down to 25 m depth.
   Furthermore, the presence of egg-brooding females in most areas also
   confirms that the population is self-sustaining. The species is
   especially abundant in shallow macroalgal belts and eelgrass meadows,
   which are critical habitats for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and
   ecosystem service provisioning, highlighting the need to understand the
   effects of S. vanhaareni in these important ecosystems. Its presence on
   boat hulls and in marinas and harbours suggests that recreational
   boating may be a major spread vector, while drifting macroalgal
   fragments may also contribute to regional spread. At this stage of
   invasion, we found high overlap in epifaunal community composition in
   sites where S. vanhaareni was present and sites where it was absent.
   Based on the functional traits of S. vanhaareni and closely related
   species, we infer that it is likely part of the detritus-based pathway
   in benthic food webs. However, additional sampling and experiments are
   necessary to determine the true extent of its distribution and to
   quantify trophic links (through stable isotope analysis, gut content
   analysis, and experimental trials) to fully understand its effects on
   communities and trophic networks in the northern Baltic Sea.},

Abstract = {Dormancy termination in aquatic invertebrates depends on multiple
   environmental cues, notably hydration, and on the invertebrates' ability
   to respond to each new flooding event. Hatching of dormant stages is
   important to ecological processes in intermittent wetlands, such as
   recolonization of biota after dry periods and maintenance of foodweb
   dynamics. However, hatching responses of invertebrates to hydration cues
   can show considerable spatial and taxonomic variation, and consequences
   of this variation to the hatchling assemblage structure are still
   unclear. In this study, we tested how multiple hydrations in series
   affect hatching dynamics and assemblage structure of invertebrate fauna
   that hatch from sediments of temporary ponds. We hypothesized that
   variable responses to flooding among taxa would influence the hatchling
   assemblage structure. We predicted that hatchling richness would show
   little or no variation across hydration events but that hatchling
   composition would vary among hydration events. We performed an ex-situ
   hatching experiment to expose the sediments of 12 temporary ponds in the
   southern Brazilian Coastal Plain to a sequence of 3 hydration events and
   to induce hatching of invertebrates from dormant stages in the
   sediments. Hatchling composition, but not richness, differed among the 3
   hydration events. Additionally, hatchling composition showed marked
   short-term variation within each hydration event. We showed that
   dormancy dynamics of aquatic invertebrates in subtropical temporary
   ponds are influenced by multiple hydration cues. Our results have
   important implications for biodiversity assessment and management of
   temporary ponds and for understanding the effects of changing hydrologic
   regimes on the ecological processes of intermittently flooded
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We examined the association between habitat parameters and gastropod
   communities across a number of freshwater ecosystems, whose biodiversity
   has been affected by increased mining activities over decades.
   Reservoirs inhabited by the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus
   antipodarum (Gray, 1843)) exhibited different abiotic conditions than
   waterbodies that were not, such as higher salinity indicators (max.
   conductivity 13400 mu S/cm, TDS 7700 mg/l and chlorides 7200 mg/l), and
   degraded water quality. In such water bodies P. antipodarum density was
   high (max. 23686/m(2)). Further, invaded waters were inhabited by less
   diverse gastropod communities than reservoirs without P. antipodarum.
   The invader has established reproducing populations and were the
   dominant species (D 87.53\%), or formed mono-specific assemblages, in
   the reservoirs. Our results indicate that P. antipodarum occurred in
   habitats whose conditions are unfavorable or less preferred by other
   species, such as those with high conductivity, and high concentrations
   of chlorides and calcium. Since this snail is known to inhabit water
   bodies with degraded water quality, we assumed that along with the
   progressing development of industries worldwide, this species will
   continue to spread to industrial areas and will inhabit increasing
   numbers of anthropogenically affected water environments. Our study
   contributes to the global understanding of the mechanisms involved in
   successful establishment in waters by P. antipodarum, and is especially
   novel in addressing its occurrence in anthropogenically created
   ecosystems. Our results showed that human impact is the cause of the
   trend in P. antipodarum populations, and compared habitats from the
   perspective of both abiotic parameters and community structure. Human
   activities can have a significant impact on water quality that can
   result in the permanent establishment of P. antipodarum populations,
   especially when the environment is not favorable for the native species.},

Abstract = {Piaractus brachypomus is highly valued as an aquaculture and ornamental
   fish species. However, it is frequently considered as a non-native or
   invasive species. In Polish waters P. brachypomus is an incidental
   non-native species, most likely released by aquarists, and it is unable
   to overwinter or reproduce. Outside its native distributional range,
   this species has been recorded nearly world-wide. In regions where exist
   it is often confused with other species such as Piaractus mesopotamicus
   and Piaractus orinoquensis, possibly with Colossoma macropomum and their
   hybrids, and Pygocentrus nattereri. In this study, we provide a detailed
   taxonomic description and the most useful discriminative features for
   the species, of five specimens of P. brachypomus caught in water bodies
   in northwestern Poland (in 2002-2010), and a sample of 11 specimens
   obtained from laboratory culture (2012-2019) that originated from South
   America. The examinations included describing metric and meristic
   characters, the neurocranium structure, the dentition formula, parasite
   fauna, and species identification based on a mitochondrial COI sequence.
   The phylogenetic tree inferred using maximum likelihood showed that
   pirapitinga samples were nested within the Amazon Basin clade of P.
   brachypomus. This is the first molecular study in Europe and first
   detailed morphometric study (including the neurocranium) of this species
   from a non-native area of its distribution. Characters such as dentition
   can be used to discriminate among the genera Colossoma, Piaractus and
   Pygocentrus, while meristic characters such as lateral line scale
   counts, numbers of scale rows above and below the lateral line, pectoral
   and pelvic fin rays counts, and ventral-keel spine counts can be used to
   discriminate among species within the genus Piaractus. Nevertheless,
   morphometric characters do not seem to be an appropriate tool to
   distinguish closely related species in the genus Piaractus.},

Abstract = {Decades ago, Dr Noel Hynes eloquently summarized the inherent
   interconnectedness of a stream and its valley and made the case that
   human alteration of the valley would have direct negative consequences
   for freshwater systems. Currently, the freshwater biodiversity crisis
   extends across all continents and demands urgent attention from
   environmental planners, practitioners, and policymakers to protect
   streams and their valleys. As we work to slow losses of freshwater
   biodiversity and restore freshwater ecosystems, it is time to revisit
   the important messages from Hynes. One of the most obvious and immediate
   actions that could be undertaken is to ``back off{''}-that is, to limit
   human activity and new development in floodplain and riparian areas
   immediately adjacent to freshwater systems, including streams, rivers,
   lakes, and wetlands, while minimizing impacts and risks in areas with
   existing development. From reducing erosion and flood damage to
   maintaining cool water temperatures, filtering pollutants, protecting
   critical habitats, and enabling lateral connectivity, intact riparian
   zones mitigate many of the threats that degrade freshwater ecosystems.
   There has been much research to identify optimal setbacks and
   buffer-strip widths to protect against harm. As such, in many areas, our
   ability to protect the stream and its valley is not limited by natural
   science but rather our failure to consistently apply floodplain and
   riparian regulations and the absence of political will. We are too quick
   to trade off the environment for short-term economic development. In
   areas that are already developed, solutions are more complicated but, in
   many cases, represent a key priority for healing damaged ecosystems and
   for addressing economic and social risks of vulnerable development. We
   need to redefine our relationship with freshwater ecosystems, and the
   first step is to back off and give freshwater ecosystems the opportunity
   to heal while ensuring that as-of-yet intact riparian areas continue to
   support freshwater resiliency. In doing so, we will also gain climate
   adaptive benefits, given that maintaining intact riparian areas is an
   effective nature-based solution.},

Title = {Closing the gap on wicked urban stream restoration problems: A framework
   to integrate science and community values},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Restoring the health of urban streams has many of the characteristics of
   a wicked problem. Addressing a wicked problem requires managers,
   academics, practitioners, and community members to make negotiated
   tradeoffs and compromises to satisfy the values and perspectives of
   diverse stakeholders involved in setting restoration project goals and
   objectives. We conducted a gap analysis on 11 urban stream restoration
   projects to identify disconnections, underperformance issues, and
   missing processes in the project structures used to develop restoration
   project goals and objectives. We examined the gap analysis results to
   investigate whether managers appropriately identified problem statements
   and met stated objectives. Projects that aimed to restore overall stream
   health commonly fell short for various reasons, including limited
   stakeholder and community input and buy-in, revealing potential
   limitations in the breadth of objectives, values, and stakeholder
   perspectives and knowledge types. Projects that emphasized integrating
   community values and diverse knowledge types tended to meet the expected
   outcomes of restoring stream processes through incremental solutions.
   Managers implementing more holistic solutions and values-driven
   approaches are more likely to consider diverse viewpoints from a variety
   of community local institutions. Based on these and other results, we
   propose a conceptual framework that integrates diverse perspectives and
   knowledge to enhance social and ecological outcomes of urban stream
   restoration. The framework also emphasizes the importance of setting
   objectives that support incremental solutions to foster more realistic
   expectations amongst stakeholders.},

Title = {Weighted stream temperature tolerance index is insensitive to changes in
   stream fish composition},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Freshwater fish species require and compete for specific water
   temperatures and thermal regimes to maximize physiological and
   behavioral processes; however, the thermal habitats on which freshwater
   fish rely are being modified by local human activities and global
   climate change. Water temperature measurements that are often used to
   determine thermal regimes allow predictions of species occurrence in the
   absence of assemblage surveys. Methods that connect assemblage
   composition with temperature provide additional information that
   otherwise is lost when temperature is measured alone. Using stream fish
   assemblage data collected over 2 decades from various biomonitoring
   programs in southern Ontario, Canada, we tracked site-level changes in
   stream fish assemblage composition from numerous watersheds. We also
   assessed the utility of using a weighted species association tolerance
   index with respect to water temperature (WSATI-WT) that weights the
   abundance of each species in an assemblage by their thermal preference
   to generate an assemblage temperature preference. We tracked temporal
   changes in assemblage temperature preferences and used bootstrapping to
   assess the effects of sampling variability on this index. Fish
   assemblage composition changed over time in all watersheds, but these
   changes had differential effects on WSATI-WT values. Temporal changes in
   WSATI-WT values ranged from -9.43 to 5.04 degrees C, of which 68\% were
   negative and 32\% positive. These changes imply that, over time, the
   thermal regime of some sites changed, but bootstrapping showed that
   WSATI-WT estimates could differ by <= 10 degrees C (mean = 1.57 degrees
   C) due to sampling variability alone. Examination of the variation in
   bootstrapped values relative to species composition indicates that
   uncommon or underrepresented species that have atypical thermal
   preferences relative to the other species within individual samples may
   have a large influence on WSATI-WT values. We must develop robust and
   resilient methods of tracking assemblage responses to warming
   temperatures if we hope to manage watersheds and species that are
   sensitive to warming temperatures.},

Abstract = {The jellyfish Phyllorhiza punctata is native to Australia and has been
   widely regarded as a successful invader. In the Mexican Pacific, this
   species has been recorded in the Gulf of California, specifically in La

   of its introduction to the Mexican Pacific is unknown. There is a poor
   baseline of knowledge and monitoring of this species; therefore, the
   present study provides genetic and morphological evidence of the
   reappearance of this exotic species in La Paz Bay, Mexico. The taxonomic
   identification of the specimen was carried out based on the
   morphological descriptions, and its identity was corroborated with the
   BLAST search tool and phylogenetic analyses. The collected specimen
   showed genetic and morphological evidence indicating that it belongs to
   P. punctata, whose distribution has expanded to tropical and subtropical
   coastal waters of 16 countries. Therefore, this study allows the
   establishment of a baseline for future studies of this invasive

Title = {Spread of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies and their effect on native fish

Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-223},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fish assemblages in the Neckar River were investigated by electrofishing
   under the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) to assess the
   ecological status of rivers. This monitoring program also provides
   information on the distribution of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies along
   the Neckar River in Germany, a tributary of the Rhine River. The western
   tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris was first recorded on the Neckar
   River in 2007, followed by bighead goby Ponticola kessleri and round
   goby Neogobius melanostomus in 2009 and 2012, respectively. The current
   distribution boundary for Ponto-Caspian gobies coincides with the
   navigation limit for cargo ships at the river port of Plochingen (about
   200 km up-stream of the city of Mannheim). Marked differences in fish
   assemblages took place following invasion of the round goby, with
   average CPUE of native stone loach Barbatula barbatula and gudgeon Gobio
   gobio declining from 19.6 and 21.5 individuals per 100 m, respectively,
   to fewer than one. Bighead gobies failed to build up a stable stock
   after round goby invasion but have still been caught in small numbers at
   most sampling sections. The earlier-arriving western tubenose goby could
   not be detected any longer. The results indicate a strong impact of the
   round goby on native fish assemblages in the Neckar River which will
   hamper efforts to improve the ecological quality of the river. Further
   investigations are needed to assess long term effects of round goby
   invasion and find solutions for achieving the mandatory European Water
   Framework Directive (WFD) target of ``good ecological status `` of the
   river.},

Title = {Biological trait profiles discriminate between native and non-indigenous
   marine invertebrates},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {571-600},

Abstract = {The increasing rate of marine invasions to Western Europe in recent
   decades highlights the importance of addressing the central questions of
   invasion biolog: what allows an invader to be successful, and which
   species are likely to become invasive? Consensus is currently lacking
   regarding the key traits that determine invasiveness in marine species
   and the extent to which invasive and indigenous species differ in their
   trait compositions. This limits the ability to predict invasive
   potential. Here we propose a method based on trait profiles which can be
   used to predict non-indigenous species likely to cause the greatest
   impact and native species with a tendency for invasion. We compiled a
   database of 12 key biological and life history traits of 85
   non-indigenous and 302 native marine invertebrate species from Western
   Europe. Using multivariate methods, we demonstrate that biological
   traits were able to discriminate between native and non-indigenous
   species with an accuracy of 78\%. The main discriminant traits included
   body size, lifespan, fecundity, offspring protection, burrowing depth
   and, to a lesser extent, pelagic stage duration Analysis revealed that
   the typical non-indigenous marine invertebrate is a mid-sized,
   long-lived, highly fecund suspension feeder which either broods its
   offspring or has a pelagic stage duration of 1-30 days, and is either
   attached-sessile or burrows to a depth of 5 cm. Biological traits were
   also able to predict native species classed as ``potentially
   invasive{''} with an accuracy of 78\%. Targeted surveillance and
   proactive management of invasive species requires accurate predictions
   of which species are likely to become invasive in the future. Our
   findings add to the growing evidence that non-indigenous species possess
   a greater affinity for certain traits. These traits are typically
   present in the profile of ``potentially invasive{''} native species.},

Title = {Weak differences in sensitivity to major ions by different larval stages
   of the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Freshwater salinization is a global ecological concern because of the
   alarming biodiversity declines associated with increases in major ion
   concentrations. Loss of mayfly diversity appears to be a common
   ecological response to anthropogenic salinization worldwide. Remarkably
   few regulatory standards exist to protect aquatic life from major ions,
   and antiquated approaches for setting such standards rely on traditional
   laboratory toxicity tests, which do not address sensitivities of
   mayflies at different larval stages. The lab-reared mayfly Neocloeon
   triangulifer (McDunnough, 1931) has emerged as one of the very few
   useful aquatic insect models for studying the effects of environmental
   stressors, including salinity, in the laboratory. Here, we asked if
   different larval life stages are differentially sensitivity to ion
   concentrations by conducting traditional 96-h toxicity tests with NaCl,
   CaCl2, and Ca/MgSO4. We used a general linear model to determine if
   survivorship differed among larval stages as well as ion type and
   concentration. We also calculated median lethal concentrations (LC50)
   for each larval stage. Larval sensitivity to NaCl decreased slightly
   with age (2-6, 9-13, and 17-21 d, with LC50 values of 401, 441, and 570
   mg/L, respectively, when expressed as Na concentrations). Similarly,
   larval sensitivity to Ca/MgSO4 differed slightly among age groups (LC50
   = 748, 1503, and 1439 mg/L, respectively, when expressed as SO4
   concentrations). Reliable confidence intervals on LC50 values for CaCl2
   could not be calculated because of high survivorship. However, our
   general linear model revealed that age played a moderate role in
   survival (p = 0.0065) across all salts of interest. To assess the
   potential changes in ion flux between larval stages, we used
   radiotracers (Na-22, (SO4)-S-35, or Ca-45) in 18- and 25-d-old larvae
   and found no strong differences in ion uptake rates. We also
   qualitatively examined morphological differences between larval life
   stages, including the appearance of gills and number of ionocytes. Our
   results indicate that younger N. triangulifer larvae may be more
   sensitive to major ions than mature larvae. These results should be
   considered when experimentally using larger, late-stage N. triangulifer
   larvae to study the physiological effects and acute toxicity of
   salinity.},

Title = {Have stream diatom assemblages changed a decade after the loss of a
   foundation riparian tree species in a headwater Appalachian watershed?},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {342-361},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Terrestrial and stream ecosystems are interconnected, with changes in
   one system cascading to affect the other. Tree mortality related to
   nonnative pest infestation has increased, yet we do not understand the
   effects that riparian tree species losses will have on the structural
   characteristics of stream ecosystems. We compared riparian canopy cover,
   algal standing crop, and diatom assemblage composition in 8 southern
   Appalachian headwater stream reaches within the Coweeta Hydrologic
   Laboratory in North Carolina, USA, before and after a massive die-off of
   riparian eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis {[}L.] Carr.) related to the
   introduction of hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand), an
   invasive insect. We analyzed historical preserved algal samples
   collected prior to hemlock die-off, in both summer (September 2005) and
   winter (January 2006), and used multivariate analyses to compare them to
   samples collected in the same 8 reaches and seasons 13 y following
   hemlock die-off (2018-2019). We predicted that increased canopy openness
   following hemlock death would change light availability and lead to
   higher standing crop and increases in the relative biovolume of
   high-profile diatoms. Contrary to our expectations, we found little
   difference in canopy cover and lower algal standing crop 13 y
   post-hemlock die-off, likely due to increased basal area of the
   understory shrub, Rhododendron maximum L., that replaced shade cover
   formerly provided by hemlock. Diatom assemblages were dominated by
   acidophilic taxa (e.g., Eunotia spp.) across all stream reaches before
   and after hemlock die-off. We observed some shifts in diatom assemblage
   composition, but the relative biovolume of a majority of the top 20 most
   abundant taxa, including Eunotia incisa W. Sm. ex W. Greg., Nupela
   lapidosa (Krasske) Lange-Bert., and Meridion alansmithii Brant (an
   endemic taxon), remained relatively unchanged 13 y after hemlock
   mortality. Diatom assemblages differed post-hemlock die-off in summer
   but not winter due to a decrease in the relative biovolume of Eunotia
   metamondon complex and an increase in the relative biovolume of Eunotia
   rhomboidea complex. Our study highlights the relative stability of
   diatom assemblage composition in southern Appalachian streams and the
   importance of long-term studies following a major riparian disturbance.},

Title = {Interactions between microplastics and benthic biofilms in fluvial
   ecosystems: Knowledge gaps and future trends},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Plastics, especially microplastics (<5 mm in length), are anthropogenic
   polymer particles that have been detected in almost all environments.
   Microplastics are extremely persistent pollutants and act as
   long-lasting reactive surfaces for additives, organic matter, and toxic
   substances. Biofilms are microbial assemblages that act as a sink for
   particulate matter, including microplastics. They are ubiquitous in
   freshwater ecosystems and provide key services that promote biodiversity
   and help sustain ecosystem function. Here, we provide a conceptual
   framework to describe the transient storage of microplastics in fluvial
   biofilm and develop hypotheses to help explain how microplastics and
   biofilms interact in fluvial ecosystems. We identify lines of future
   research that need to be addressed to better manage microplastics and
   biofilms, including how the sorption and desorption of environmental
   contaminants in microplastics affect biofilms and how microbial exchange
   between microplastics and the biofilm matrix affects biofilm
   characteristics like antibiotic resistance, speciation, biodiversity,
   species composition, and function. We also address the uptake mechanisms
   of microplastics by consumers and their propagation through the food
   web.},

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},

Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Urban streams can provide amenities to people living in cities, but
   those benefits are reduced when streams become degraded, potentially
   even causing harm (disease, toxic compounds, etc.). Governments and
   institutions invest resources to improve the values and services
   provided by urban streams; however, the conception, development, and
   implementation of such projects may not include meaningful involvement
   of community members and other stakeholders. Consequently, project
   objectives may be misaligned with community desires and needs, and
   projects may fail to achieve their goals. In February 2020, the 5(th)
   Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology, an interdisciplinary
   meeting held every 3 to 5 y, met in Austin, Texas, USA, to explore new
   approaches to urban stream projects, including ways to maximize the full
   range of potential benefits by better integrating community members into
   project identification and decision making. The symposium included
   in-depth discussion about 4 nearby field case studies, participation of
   multidisciplinary urban stream experts from 5 continents, and input from
   the Austin community. Institutional barriers to community inclusion were
   identified and analyzed using real-world examples, both from the case
   studies and from the literature, which clarified disparities in power,
   equity, and values. Outcomes of the symposium have been aggregated into
   a vision that challenges the present institutional approach to urban
   stream management and a set of strategies to systematically address
   these barriers to improve restoration solutions. Integrating community
   members and other stakeholders throughout the urban restoration process,
   and a transparent decision-making process to resolve divergent
   objectives, can help identify appropriate goals for realizing both the
   ecological and social benefits of stream restoration.},

Abstract = {Beta diversity patterns have been frequently used to investigate
   metacommunity structure. The metacommunity concept has focused primarily
   on the spatial beta component, but part of the unaccounted variation is
   likely associated with temporal beta patterns. Here, we examined the
   effect of seasonal variation in water availability on the spatiotemporal
   assembly of microcrustaceans living in temporary pools. Specifically, we
   sampled microcrustaceans in 5 pools monthly for 12 mo and tested how
   temporal fluctuations in physicochemical variables affected beta
   diversity. We also investigated whether species showed synchronous
   responses in tracking dry or wet conditions. Our study revealed that
   only those microcrustacean species associated with the wet season had
   temporally synchronous population dynamics. However, we did not find
   population synchrony in the dry season and in those comparisons
   including all microcrustacean species. Physicochemical variables such as
   pH, dissolved oxygen, and water transparency explained part of the
   spatial variation in beta diversity. These results suggest a strong
   influence of species sorting on metacommunity structure both in space
   and in time. Extreme climatic conditions, such as water scarcity, could
   affect population dynamics; thus, linking spatial and temporal patterns
   will be necessary to disentangle the effects of stochastic processes and
   environmental filtering on metacommunity dynamics.},

Title = {Evidence for pulse-shunt carbon exports from a mixed land-use, restored

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {284-298},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Watersheds in the Great Plains region of the United States are dominated
   by agriculture, interspersed with remnant or restored prairie
   vegetation. The pulse-shunt concept predicts these coexisting land uses
   likely have opposing effects on seasonal biogeochemical and hydrological
   controls of organic C (OC) fates in freshwater ecosystems, but few
   studies have focused on temporal patterns of OC fates in streams that
   are influenced by agriculture and tallgrass prairie. We estimated stream
   metabolism and OC spiraling in a stream (Glacier Creek, Omaha, Nebraska,
   USA) draining a mixed land-use watershed with restored tallgrass prairie
   and agriculture to answer: 1) Does a mixed land-use stream exhibit
   seasonal patterns of ecosystem metabolism? and 2) Does the balance
   between active OC processing vs passive OC transport change across
   seasons and years as predicted by the pulse-shunt concept? We
   hypothesized that the stream would be net heterotrophic, rapidly
   mineralize OC (Vf-OC), and exhibit short spiraling lengths (S-OC) at
   baseflow, and that these functions would be modulated in opposing
   directions by seasonal patterns of nutrient availability and turbidity.
   Mean gross primary production was 0.30 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), mean ecosystem
   respiration was -1.25 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), and Glacier Creek was net
   heterotrophic throughout the study (mean net ecosystem production =
   -0.94 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1); mean production:respiration = 0.19). Peak gross
   primary production and ecosystem respiration occurred in the spring
   driven by discharge and light. High-resolution OC-spiraling estimates
   revealed a continuum of OC processing and transport consistent with
   pulse-shunt fluxes. OC-spiraling lengths spanned 2 orders of magnitude
   (1-934 km), but most S-OC ranged between distances of 4 to 15 km at
   baseflow. S-OC was shorter with higher nutrient concentrations and
   longer with higher turbidity, consistent with the inverse pattern for
   Vf-OC. Our study confirms that the metabolic regime of a prairie stream
   was seasonal, while underscoring that factors that are modified by
   land-use change, such as nutrients and turbidity, can influence OC
   processing.},

Abstract = {The spread of invasive non-native species, one of the greatest threats
   to biodiversity and the economy, affects the structure and functions of
   ecosystems at all levels. At the beginning of the 21st century a rapid
   expansion of the submerged macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was observed in
   southern and eastern Europe. However. this plant, native to North
   America, was already recorded in Europe in the first half of the 20th
   century. Our study aimed to evaluate changes in phytoplankton
   communities caused by the presence of this new invader. The research was
   conducted in a large floodplain lake in the Vistula valley
   (north-central Poland) and involved regular monitoring of the lake's
   ecological status using phytoplankton-based methods. Long-term
   observations enabled us to track the impact of this invasive plant on
   phytoplankton and to compare the conditions of the phytoplankton
   community before and after Elodea nuttallii invasion. In the first stage
   of the research (2007-09) massive phytoplankton growth (max. biomass
   over 90 mg/L) and Cyanobacteria blooms (mainly of Aphanizornenon
   floc-aquae) were noted. Submerged vegetation along the shore was sparse
   and its development was inhibited by phytoplankton shading. Elodea
   nuttallii was first reported in this lake in 2009, together with native
   macrophyte species. The second stage of the research was carried out in
   the years 2013-15, when E. nuttallii had already colonised the lake, in
   some parts occupying the entire bottom surface and almost completely
   outcompeting native species of submerged macrophytes. As a consequence,
   the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton decreased. The highest
   biomass recorded in summer 2013-15 was approximately 4 mg/L. Secchi
   depth increased from 0.5 in in 2007-08 to 1.6 in in 2015. Elodea
   nuttallii expansion caused a shift from the turbid-water to clear-water
   state with higher water transparency. Phytoplankton blooms did not
   develop. The massive growth of E. nuttallii seems to have caused
   positive changes in the lake ecological status. However, E. nuttallii is
   considered to be a highly invasive species, threatening native
   hydrobionts at various levels of organisation.},

Title = {Invasive virile crayfish (Faxonius virilis Hagen, 1870) hybridizes with

Abstract = {Crayfishes are a diverse group of freshwater crustaceans which have
   proven to be harmful invasive species and are a leading cause of
   displacement of native crayfishes. Invasive species can harm populations
   of native species through hybridization which facilitates the
   displacement of native species and leads to a decrease in diversity.
   Hybridization has rarely been documented between crayfish species and
   the only genetically documented reports of North American crayfish
   species hybridizing have been between invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius
   rusticus Girard, 1852) and two congeners. Virile crayfish (Faxonius
   virilis Hagen, 1870) is the most widely distributed crayfish in North
   America and occurs in its native range from the Hudson Bay watershed in
   Canada south to across the midwestern United States. Faxonius virilis
   has been introduced throughout North America and parts of Europe and is
   considered invasive in many locations. Faxonius virilis is invasive in
   the Ozark National Scenic Riverways (ONSR) in Missouri, U.S., and has
   been detected in the park since 1986. Setting out to document an updated
   range of E virilis in the ONSR, we began developing a F.
   virilis-specific eDNA assay and noticed a discordance between the
   phenotype and mitochondrial DNA barcode of some native spothanded
   crayfish (Faxonius punctimanus Creaser, 1933) specimens. We compared
   mitochondrial, phenotypic, and microsatellite data and found that
   invasive P: virilis have hybridized with native F. punctimanus in the
   ONSR. Our research adds to the rarely documented occurrences of crayfish
   hybridization and supports previous researchers' remarks that
   undocumented hybridization between native and non-native crayfish may be
   more common than previously thought. While the invasion of F. virilis

Title = {Physiological and microbiological determinants of the subtropical
   non-indigenous Rangia cuneata health and condition in the cold coastal
   waters of the Baltic Sea: the Vistula Lagoon case study},

Abstract = {The clam Rangia cuneata originating from the Gulf of Mexico has recently
   been introduced in the Baltic Sea waters. In the Polish coastal waters
   R. cuneata colonized riverine (the Vistula Delta) and the lagoon (the
   Vistula Lagoon) areas. In the Vistula Lagoon population strong
   fluctuations in clam biomass and density was observed being a
   consequence of reoccurring yearly spring mortality. In the present work
   we examined the condition and general health of R. cuneata from the
   Vistula Lagoon and the potential role of microorganisms as causative
   factors of mortality events. Overall, 102 adult clams were collected in
   March 2019. Out of those, 50 clams were used for microbiological and
   histological analyses while 52 for biochemical examination. Histological
   examination revealed that 47 clams were characterized by infiltration of
   hemocytes in various internal organs with mantle and gills most commonly
   affected. Observed inflammatory response was morphologically classified
   as mild to severe infiltrative hemocytosis as seen in severe systemic
   infections (septicemia) with the latter occurring in 40\% of clams.
   Bacteria isolated from the clam tissues, characterized by a massive
   growth included those from the genus Aeromonas (A. sohria. A. caviae, A.
   hydrophila), all classified as potential pathogens. Additionally, the
   presence of Kocuria spp. (G+) and pathogenic Shewanella putrefaciens
   (G-) was documented in one individual. Bacteria identified in water
   samples were almost identical to those from the tissue and included all
   the three Aeromonas species, S. putrefaciens and Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius (G+). Grain staining revealed the presence of G(+)
   bodies in hepatopancreas, while G(-) bodies were often observed in the
   epithelial tissue of gills and mantle. Biochemical examination revealed
   the lack of glycogen, low carbohydrate and lipid contents indicating
   scarce levels of stored energetic materials. Hence, predominant bacteria
   isolated from R. cuneata together with low energetic reserves may
   greatly explain poor condition of these clams, and periodical mortality
   outbreaks occurring in the studied area. We thus hypothesize that the
   disease outbreak potentially elevating species mortality and affecting
   its reproduction may limit rangias' success in creating a stable
   population in some areas with microorganisms forming mechanism
   participating in ecosystem resistance against introduced species during
   early colonization of the new environments.},

Title = {Effect of lipid levels and size in invasive carp overwinter survival},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {300-307},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most important dynamic rate functions (i.e.,
   recruitment, growth, and mortality). Often, recruitment can be heavily
   dependent on overwinter survival. Wintertime presents thermal and
   metabolic challenges to fish. Studies have suggested that overwinter
   survival and mortality is correlated to lipid content before entering
   winter. Inadequate lipid reserves are related to poor condition and may
   lead to overwinter mortality. Young fish need to accumulate adequate
   lipid reserves before entering winter. In the Mississippi River, where
   silver carp Hypophthalmichthys moltrix Valenciennes, 1844 are hyper
   abundant, silver carp are not experiencing recruitment issues. As such,
   we evaluated lipid levels and size as potential silver carp recruitment
   regulators. Silver carp were collected by the Long Term Resource
   Monitoring element in 2015 on the middle Mississippi River using mini
   fyke nets; total lengths ranged from 34-177 mm. Lipid levels of whole
   carp were determined using the phosphovanillin assay. No difference in
   lipid levels (mg/g) was observed between spring and fall fishes.
   Additionally, we observed no relation between total length and lipid
   levels. Size structure did not significantly differ between fall age-0
   and spring age-1 silver carp. Our results suggest there may not be a
   size dependent overwinter mortality/survival in silver carp in the
   middle Mississippi River. Additionally, lipids may not be a driving
   factor in overwinter mortality/survival. Our research suggests silver
   carp in the Mississippi River basin do not follow most early life
   history paradigms and may explain the successful nature of the silver
   carp invasion.},

Abstract = {Atractolytocestus huronensis Anthony, 1958 has been co-introduced with
   its cyprinid host Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, common carp, to
   several continents. This cestode was only recently (2012) detected in
   South Africa and occur in two major river systems. In Africa, A.
   huronensis has only been reported from C. carpio. During routine
   parasitological surveys in the Vaal River system in central South
   Africa, unidentified cestodes were recorded from common carp at several
   localities. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, alongside
   genetic characterisation, they were identified as A. huronensis, greatly
   expanding the distribution of this parasite in the upper reaches of the
   Vaal River system and indicating rapid spread in the system. Thereafter,
   in November 2020, more caryophyllidean cestodes were detected infecting
   native smallmouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus aeneus (Burchell, 1822) just
   below the Vaal Dam wall. They were also morphologically and genetically
   identified as A. huronensis, indicating a possible new definitive host
   and spillover from carp. However, only juvenile worms (up to late stage
   4) were detected in L. aeneus, suggesting a paradefinitive or accidental
   infection. Their pathological effect on the intestine of L. aeneus
   mimicked that described in acute infections in common carp, with damage
   limited to the intestinal epithelium and no prominent ulcerations. This
   apparent mild infection of an indigenous host needs to be monitored. The
   spillover to L. aeneus appears to be recent as no caryophyllidean
   cestodes were collected from this host species at the same locality and
   season the previous year, nor at any of the other well studied sites in
   the Vaal River system. Chronic infection of L. aeneus may still develop
   and indicate that the near threatened largemouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus
   kimberleyensis (Gilchrist \& Thompson, 1913), may be at risk as well.},

Abstract = {Pacific whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931), a highly
   significant global commodity, has been introduced for aquaculture to
   many countries outside its native range, including Thailand. In
   Thailand, this species was introduced to replace Penaeus monodon for
   aquaculture in 1998, and it has represented more than 90 percent of
   total cultured shrimp production since 2005. The rapid expansion of P.
   vannamei aquaculture has led to escapes of P. vannamei into natural
   waters. We examined abundance, size and sex ratio of P. vannamei caught
   by commercial fishing gears, namely trammel, trawl and push nets, to
   determine the extent to which this species has entered the natural
   ecosystems in the Gulf of Thailand. Sampling was performed from August
   2009 to October 2010 at five locations along the east coast of Thailand.
   We consistently found P. vannamei in shrimp catches in all three fishing
   gears across all locations. The frequency of occurrence of P. vannamei
   ranged from 0.13 (trawl nets) to 0.99 (push nets). The relative
   abundance by weight of wild-caught P. vannamei ranged from 0 to 5.43\%,
   with highest mean abundance in Chanthaburi (0.42 +/- 0.72\%) and lowest
   mean abundance in Chonburi (0.04 +/- 0.15\%). All 4.041 individuals
   collected were sub-adults or adults (total length = 82 to 212 mm, weight
   = 3.2 to 71.8 g), with a 0.92:1 female to male ratio. The samples
   consisted of approximately 22\% aduilts, suggesting a notable proportion
   of potential breeders in the wild. Our study can serve as a baseline for
   monitoring programs for aquaculture escapes. Our report is among the few
   studies that document substantial numbers of P. vannamei specimens
   throughout the study period. Participation by fishers proved valuable
   for detecting P. vannamei in the wild. Incorporating a similar sampling
   approach in fisheries monitoring programs will provide a consistent
   means of detecting population trends of P. vannamei in the wild.},

Abstract = {In the wake of biological globalization, translocated species of high
   bio-engineering capacity increasingly change bottom topography of
   sedimentary coasts. A Vaucheria- taxon (Xanthophyceae) of unknown origin
   is spreading at the transition between intertidal and subtidal zones,
   while resident Vaucheria-species are confined to the upper shore in the
   Wadden Sea (European Atlantic). Near the island of Sylt, dense turfs of
   green filaments rapidly expanded over an area of 180 ha within 3 years.
   The unicellular filaments reach about 5 cm out of and 5 cm into the
   sediment. Felted rhizoids provide firm anchorage. Dry phytomass (up to
   208 g m-2) was similar to that of intertidal seagrass beds. Residual
   filaments overwinter in the sediment and give rise to renewed growth in
   late spring. In addition, oospores germinate. Fine particles are trapped
   by the turf during summer, generating laminated cohesive mud. Muddy
   hummocks arise up to 20 cm above ambient sand flats, alternating with
   troughs but gradually merge into coherent and pertinacious plateaus of
   mud. This shift in bottom topography and sediment composition may
   potentially change the mud balance of tidal basins, and the capacity of
   tidal flats in catching up with accelerating sea-level rise.},

Title = {Trematode parasites have minimal effect on the behavior of invasive
   green crabs},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {238-258},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Trophically-transmitted endoparasites can manipulate the behavior of
   intermediate hosts to increase transmission to definitive hosts. Less
   clear, however, is whether these relationships exist when parasites and
   hosts have limited coevolutionary history, e.g., a native parasite
   infecting an invasive host. We investigated infection by the
   northeastern North American trematode Microphallus similis in non-native
   green crabs (Carcinus maenas) to assess whether infection by M. similis
   influenced feeding behaviors in C. maenas and if this changed with time
   post-infection. We manipulated infection by randomly assigning crabs to
   parasite exposure and control groups. We then measured individual crab
   behavior at five time points (pre-infection, 72 h, 1 week, 2 week, and 3
   week post-infection) with an established ethogram that recorded multiple
   behavioral types. We also conducted righting response trials at each
   time point and additionally at 4 and 5 weeks post-exposure. Compared to
   controls, infected crabs showed little difference in recorded behaviors,
   and burden of infection (i.e., number of trematode cysts) was not
   correlated to any behavioral metric. This lack of behavioral impact
   occurred at all stages of infection. Active parasite
   penetration/establishment early in the infection process did not provoke
   greater behavioral response than later stages, when the encysted
   parasite becomes relatively dormant. Although M. similis is capable of
   infecting non-native C. maenas, our results suggest that it does not
   manipulate host behavior, possibly because of limited coevolutionary
   history with C. maenas in the region, or because host manipulation is
   unnecessary for successful completion of its life cycle. In nature, this
   may have implications for the crab's invasion success in the western
   Atlantic, where it has escaped much of its native parasite diversity.},

Title = {Population structure and demography of non-indigenous Japanese mystery
   snails in freshwater habitats of Virginia and Washington, DC, USA},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Non-indigenous species may drive declines in global freshwater
   biodiversity. Japanese mystery snails, Heterogen japonica (previously
   Cipangopaludina / Bellamya / Viviparus japonica), have invaded numerous
   freshwater systems in North America. To resolve questions about its
   population demography and genetics, we surveyed ponds and rivers from
   six Mid-Atlantic USA locations (Richmond, Virginia to Washington, D.C.)
   in 2018 and 2019 for mystery snails and co-occurring indigenous snails.
   A random subset of each snail species (max N = 80) per location was
   assessed for population demographics (size, sex), and brooding embryos
   were counted in mystery snails. Because morphological identification can
   be difficult to discern from its congener, the Chinese mystery snail
   (Cipangopaludina chinensis), we used a mitochondrial barcoding gene
   (COI) to confirm identity of H. japonica and also serve as a population
   genetics marker. Our barcoding confirmed that the mystery snails
   detected in our surveys were H. japonica, and that, compared to the
   indigenous range, its populations have low genetic diversity and limited
   genetic structure. Even so, H. japonica had the highest overall
   catch-per-unit-effort among all snails and sites. In demographic
   analyses, H. japonica populations skewed towards females, and females
   brooding live young were the largest across all sites. The number of
   live young ranged from 14 to 101/female (average: 52 live young/female).
   Further, a linear relationship existed between brooding female shell
   length and the number of live young for all sites, except one. Possible
   explanations could include site-level differences in abiotic or biotic
   parameters, but this requires further research. Altogether, the snail's
   reproductive capacity documented here suggests that H. japonica has the
   potential to undergo additional population growth, especially if large
   females spread to new locations. Moreover, it highlights another example
   of an invasive species with high population abundance, demographic
   performance, and distributional range even with depauperate genetic
   diversity.},

Title = {Environmental related variation in growth and life-history traits of
   non-native sailfin catfishes (Pterygoplichthys spp.) across river basins
   of South China},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {92-109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Plasticity in growth and life-history traits is an important attribute
   of non-native (NN) fishes, facilitating their adaptation to novel
   environments. Few studies have investigated geographical variations in
   multiple biological traits and the factors affecting the variations. In
   this study, variations in multiple biological traits of NN sailfin
   catfishes Pterygoplichthys spp. were investigated in the main river
   basins of the Guangdong and Hainan provinces of South China. The impacts
   of environmental factors on the biological traits were analysed using
   general linear modeling and an information-theoretic approach.
   Among-basin differences in population growth was observed, with richness
   of competitor fishes negatively affecting growth, maturity and
   reproductive traits - this suggests biotic resistance was mediated by
   competition with native fishes. These traits were positively affected by
   total phosphorus concentration, which is indicative of bottom-up
   effects, mediated by inorganic nutrients, potentially playing an
   important role in the invasion success of NN fish. In population level,
   a bet-hedging strategy was observed in sailfin catfishes under
   unfavourable environment conditions (e.g. Nangdujiang), whereas a
   ``master-of-some{''} strategy was found under favourable conditions
   (e.g. Pearl River Delta and Western Basin). The results suggested that
   plasticity in multiple biological traits of sailfin catfishes is an
   important strategy to overcome changing environmental conditions in
   different rivers, and habitat-specific variations across river basins
   would reflect trade-offs amongst traits at the population level.
   Therefore, habitat-specific management measures, adapted to the invaded
   ecosystem's features and the life-history strategy of the NN species,
   could provide an effective means to control invasive species.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {136-152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several taxa forming a species complex within the bryozoan genus
   Watersipora are successful global marine invaders that are common in
   marine fouling communities in bays and harbors. This species complex has
   recently been recorded spreading to natural intertidal and subtidal
   habitats on the central California outer coast near the San Francisco
   Bay, suggesting that its invasive potential is greater than previously
   believed. To determine the species and clades present in these outer
   coast populations, and their relationship to populations in nearby bays
   and harbors, we produced COI sequences for a set of new Watersipora
   specimens sampled from four rocky intertidal sites, for which there is
   currently no published genetic data. Watersipora subtorquata and
   Watersipora new species were both identified at rocky intertidal sites.
   All haplotypes identified in this analysis have previously been reported
   in California harbors and marinas, suggesting that intertidal
   populations may be sourced from existing populations in harbors, rather
   than representing independent invasions. Field observations of
   intertidal populations support Watersipora's year-round persistence at
   rocky intertidal sites, which has significant implications for invasion
   dynamics and invasion management strategies. Continued sequencing of
   outer coast Watersipora samples will be crucial to further characterize
   the genetic diversity and structure of these coastal populations and
   describe the dynamics of Watersipora's outer coast spread.},

Abstract = {New Chinese mitten crab sequence data were obtained from eight European
   localities spanning France, The Netherlands, England and Wales. The
   Netherlands and Wales samples were taken from two areas where mitten
   crab populations had never before been sequenced. DNA results uncovered
   the presence of a second Eriocheir species coexisting sympatrically with
   E. sinensis H. Milne Edwards, 1853 in the Dee Estuary, Wales and at two
   sites sampled in The Netherlands. Molecular results and comparative
   morphology analyses suggest that the second species in European waters
   is likely to be an undescribed cryptic species. Additional evidence for
   the presence of a second European invasive mitten crab species is
   provided by confocal laser scanning microscopy of the male first
   gonopod. The origins of the Welsh introduction may date back to the
   early 2000s, when several Dutch dredging operators were active in the
   Dee Estuary. Despite several localities being sampled, the Eriocheir
   cryptic species was not found in England, which suggests that English
   and Welsh mitten crab populations originate from independent
   introductions. These results radically challenge current assessments of
   Eriocheir invasion in Europe and should be considered by stakeholders as
   a new baseline to implement efficient management strategies against
   invasive mitten crabs.},

Title = {Expansion of the barnacle Austrominius modestus (Darwin, 1854)

Abstract = {The barnacle Austrominius modestus, native of New Zealand and Australia
   was introduced to the South of England around 1943 and has since spread
   to most coastal waters in Western Europe, including the southern North
   Sea. Apart from an ephemeral incursion into the Danish Wadden Sea in
   1978, since 2010 it has established permanent populations capable of
   reproduction along the North Sea coast of the Jutland peninsula, the
   Limfjord, the north-western Kattegat, and the Skagerrak. It has probably
   invaded Danish waters by pelagic larvae originating in the German Wadden
   Sea. The species has since spread to other Danish localities, likely
   following the prevailing currents, but other means, as for instance
   transport by vessels, are possible. The barnacle inhabits stones,
   stone-reefs, mollusk shells, and live shore crabs in shallow waters.
   Based on hydrographical data from its native and recently invaded areas,
   we predict its future distribution to extend to most coasts of
   continental Europe except for brackish waters (< 20 PSU), and the Arctic
   seas. The northernmost distribution limit may include the Lofoten
   Islands of Norway.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem metabolism is a fundamental process that governs
   biogeochemical C cycling through the fixation and mineralization of C by
   all the organisms in a system; however, the functional responses of
   ecosystem metabolism to light and temperature variability remain unknown
   in streams and rivers. In this study, we assessed the effects of
   temperature and light on ecosystem metabolism, namely gross primary
   production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), in a Japanese stream by
   monitoring the seasonal diel changes in dissolved oxygen. We found that
   the temperature dependence of metabolism, which is expressed as
   activation energy, was higher for ER (0.48 eV) than for GPP (0.39 eV),
   supporting the metabolic theory of ecology. Both daily GPP and ER
   increased with the daily integrated photosynthetically active radiation
   (PAR), peaking at moderate PAR values and decreasing at higher
   irradiance levels. This unimodal relationship between daily GPP and PAR
   was due to the rapid increase of instantaneous PAR during the early
   morning, suppressing the maximum rate of area-specific productivity,
   which was a main determinant of daily GPP. Moreover, daily GPP and ER
   were closely associated in this study stream, resulting in a unimodal
   pattern of daily ER with daily integrated PAR. Our results suggest that
   both temperature and light regulate stream ecosystem metabolism but that
   the sunlight regime (i.e., the rapid increase of solar irradiance in the
   early morning) rather than light intensity per se may be a critical
   factor for both GPP and ER in the study stream.},

Title = {More non-native fish species than natives, and an invasion of Malawi

Abstract = {Ancient Lake Poso in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, is among the deepest
   lakes in Asia, and hosts a largely endemic fauna of fishes, crustaceans,
   and molluscs. Introduction of non-native fish species started at least a
   century ago to foster local fish production. Recent fieldwork suggests
   that introduction of non-native fishes is ongoing, including species
   that originate from the ornamental pet trade. These include the
   hybridogenic ornamental ``flowerhorn{''} cichlid, a fish that spread
   rapidly in Sulawesi's Malili Lakes, and the ``golden cichlid,{''}
   Melanochromis auratus from African Lake Malawi. This popular aquarium
   species colonized Lake Poso even more rapidly than the flowerhorn, and
   is omnipresent at benthic habitats across most of the lake. Here, we
   list records of 17 non-native fish species from Lake Poso, present the
   first assessment of golden cichlid stomach contents outside of their
   native habitat, report the occurrences of non-native crustaceans,
   molluscs and plants, and discuss potential impacts on the native fauna
   and ecosystem. Most of the non-native species have established
   substantial populations, and it appears very plausible that the
   non-native fauna affects endemics. This is supported by the finding that
   golden cichlid stomachs contained a broad spectrum of items, including
   fish, their scales, fins, eggs and larvae, and various invertebrates. We
   conclude that non-native species introduction poses a substantial and
   increasing threat to the Lake Poso fauna, a major hotspot of aquatic
   biodiversity in the Wallacea region.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are an easy target for invasive species given that
   aquatic plants possess specific traits that enhance rapid spread and
   colonization The significant lack of knowledge on ecological demands and
   the current distribution of aquatic aliens is a crucial limitation to
   the effective protection and management of water bodies. In Slovakia,
   there are two established alien macrophytes that are widely distributed
   throughout the country: Elodea canadensis Michx. and Elodea nuttallii
   (Planck) H. St. John. We focused on the temporal dynamics of
   colonization and the current distribution of both species, their
   ecological requirements and their effects on native flora and
   vegetation. We gathered 415 records of occurrence, including 168 for E.
   canadensis and 247 for E. nuttallii. Both Elodea species showed
   different temporal patterns of colonization of native aquatic habitats.
   Although the occurrence probability of E. nuttallii stabilized after an
   initial steep increase, the probability of E. canadensis occurrence
   showed a decreasing tendency over recent decades. The probability of
   species occurrence was significantly related to altitude and climatic
   characteristics. Mean January temperature emerged as the best predictor
   of the species distribution. Assessing the impact of both species, our
   results showed that elodeas contribute to the homogenization of natural
   aquatic communities. Specifically, species richness and beta diversity
   were lower in releves with higher abundance of elodeas compared with
   uninvaded releves.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests worldwide have been subjected to biological invasion.
   Invasive apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) have established
   populations in some mangrove forests. The feeding behavior of P.
   canaliculata in mangroves has been unclear until now. The feeding
   electivity of P. canaliculata to mangrove leaves, including leaves from
   Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Kandelia candel, Aegiceras
   corniculatum, and Sonneratia apetala, was studied through a selective
   test, a nonselective test, and a T-tube test. The growth indicators, the
   feeding ratio, the feeding rate, the feeding amount, the electivity
   indicator, and the electivity frequency were determined. The weight
   increase ratios of P. canaliculata that consumed leaves of A.
   ilicifolius and A. aureum were higher than those that consumed leaves of
   K. candel, S. apetala, and A. corniculatum. The electivity indicator
   showed that P. canaliculata preferred A. ilicifolius leaves and fed
   little on A. corniculatum leaves. Acrostichum aureum leaves were the
   second most preferred food for the apple snails. The feeding electivity
   of P. canaliculata to leaves from five species of mangrove trees was
   significantly differentiated by cluster analysis, redundancy analysis,
   and principal component analysis. Eight feeding indicators of the apple
   snails were positively correlated with the leaf characteristics of
   nitrogen content, protein content, leaf area, moisture content, and
   aspect ratio and negatively correlated with the lignin, phenolic, and
   tannin contents. Pomacea canaliculata could discriminate mangrove leaves
   through physical and chemical characteristics and shift feeding
   electivity among mangrove leaves under intraspecific competition.
   Mangrove forests composed mainly of A. ilicifolius and A. aureum might
   be at risk of invasion by P. canaliculata. A detailed survey on benthic
   animals is necessary to monitor and prevent P. canaliculata invasion in
   mangroves.},

Title = {Isotopic niches of Silver Carp and two native planktivores in a large

Abstract = {Human-mediated biological invasions can greatly reduce native species
   diversity. More than 138 nonnative fishes have been introduced to the
   United States. Many of these nonnative species can alter ecosystem
   dynamics and compete with native species. The planktivorous Silver Carp
   (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes,
   1844) is a nonnative species of concern that is currently expanding its
   range across the Greater Mississippi River Basin in the Midwestern
   United States. The objective of our study was to determine the degree of
   potential competition among invasive Silver Carp and the native
   planktivores, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum Lesueur, 1818) and
   Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense Gunther, 1867), in Kentucky Lake, a
   large reservoir located in western Kentucky and Tennessee. We used data
   derived from N and C isotopes to model isotopic niches, calculate
   quantitative metrics to describe variability within and among isotopic
   niches and trophic positions, and qualitatively assess seasonal shifts
   in trophic positions. Our results suggest that in the spring, older (>=
   1 y old) Silver Carp share resources with older and young-of-year (YOY;
   <1 y old) Gizzard Shad, whereas YOY Silver Carp only share resources
   with YOY Gizzard Shad. Additionally, our analyses showed that older
   Silver Carp and older Gizzard Shad share resources in the summer. In
   contrast, we found no overlap in resource use between YOY Threadfin Shad
   and YOY or older Silver Carp. Furthermore, we provide evidence of
   intraspecific ontogenetic shifts in isotopic niche area and overlap
   between invasive and native fishes (measured by sample-size corrected
   standard ellipse area). If resources become limiting, invasive Silver
   Carp may compete with multiple life stages of Gizzard Shad in Kentucky
   Lake and alter foodweb dynamics.},

Abstract = {The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, is a broadly distributed and
   abundant invasive species, yet many aspects of its biology are not well
   understood. Based on previous research by other investigators, we
   hypothesized that abundance, population growth rate, and individual
   growth rate of C. fluminea would increase with temperature, chlorophyll
   -a, and dissolved oxygen. We sampled C. fluminea at two sites in the
   lower Columbia River (CR), USA. Modal progression analyses indicated a
   life span of 2-3 years. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)
   predicting the abundance of C. fluminea indicated a significant negative
   association with chlorophyll -a concentration, whereas a GLMM predicting
   the population growth rate of C. fluminea indicated a significant
   positive association with dissolved oxygen. The GLMM predicting the
   individual growth rate of C. fluminea indicated the individual growth
   rate was not significantly related to any individual environmental
   variable. Overall, these results emphasize that the biology of C.
   fluminea in the CR is similar in many regards to other populations
   studied in temperate regions globally, but that important spatial
   differences can occur between sites separated by 60 km within the same
   river system.},

Title = {A doubled down invasion of the northeast Pacific by the Asian mud
   shrimp, Upogebia major and its coevolved bopyrid isopod parasite,
   Orthione griffenis},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Dramatic declines of the native northeast Pacific mud shrimp, Upogebia
   pugettensis over the last three decades have occurred in response to
   intense infestations by the Asian bopyrid isopod parasite, Orthione
   griffenis, that was introduced in the 1980s. We report herein the
   arrival of the Asian mud shrimp, Upogebia major, in San Francisco Bay no
   later than 2006. Complications of identifying juvenile U. major and
   inefficiencies of collecting mature and readily identified specimens
   recovered by conventional sampling devices are likely to have delayed
   its identification and discovery. U. major is less vulnerable to O.
   griffenis and is displacing or replacing U. pugettensis in its present
   200 km range to the north and south of San Francisco Bay. Upogebia
   major, as a coevolved alternative host, assures persistence of O.
   griffenis in this region even where native species extinctions occur and
   can potentially expand to all habitats that are presently invaded by O.
   griffenis (Alaska to Baja California Norte). The individual and combined
   O. griffenis and U. major invasions thus threaten U. pugettensis in
   particular and all other native Upogebia species occurring north of
   Mexico. Our review of Upogebia taxonomy for a key to species revealed a
   previously reported 1912 invasion of San Francisco Bay by Upogebia
   affinis that was in error; hence, the introduction of U. major is the
   first confirmed gebiid invasion in the world. Greater resolution of U.
   major natural history and timing of its invasion is needed to test
   whether it evaded present vector management efforts. Intervention is
   warranted to limit the doubled down U. major and O. griffenis invasion
   and to conserve U. pugettensis and other native Upogebia species from
   ecological or absolute extinction in the coming decades.},

Abstract = {The dreissenids, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and zebra mussel D.
   polymorpha, are invasive freshwater mussels in Europe and North America.
   These species strongly impact aquatic ecosystems, such as the food web
   through their high abundance and filtration rate. They spread quickly
   within and between waterbodies, and have the ability to colonize various
   substrates and depths. The zebra mussel invaded and established in Swiss
   lakes in the 1960s, whereas the quagga mussel was not detected until
   2014. We collected all available data from cantonal as well as local
   authorities and other institutions to describe the colonization pattern
   of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps. We also
   collected data regarding the distribution of larval stages of the
   mussels, the so-called veliger larvae. We observed that in lakes
   colonized by the quagga mussel, veligers are present the whole year
   round, whereas they are absent in winter in lakes with only zebra
   mussels. Additionally, we present detailed information about the
   invasion and colonization pattern of quagga mussels in Lake Constance.
   Quagga mussels colonized the lakeshore within a few years (similar to
   2016-2018), outcompeted zebra mussels, and have reached densities > 5000
   ind.m(-2) in the littoral zone, even at 80 m densities above 1000
   ind.m(-2) were found at some locations. At the end of the article, we
   discussed possibilities on how the spread of quagga mussels within and
   among northern perialpine lakes should be monitored and prevented in the
   future.},

Abstract = {The palaemonid shrimp Palaemon sinensis, a species native to China, was
   first discovered as an established non-native species in Japan in 2005,
   and it has since been reported in 25 of 47 prefectures. To genetically
   elucidate that P. sinensis was introduced to Japan from China via
   importation as a live fishing bait species, this study analyzed partial
   nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of 165 specimens
   collected in 7 geographical regions in Japan (Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu,
   Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu), and from 18 imported specimens from
   China purchased at a fishing store. All sequences were classified into
   11 haplotypes, which included one widespread haplotype shared by more
   than half of the P. sinensis samples. Almost all of the samples of
   imported specimens possessed the dominant haplotype. Analysis of
   molecular variance showed no genetic differentiation between the
   Japanese local and imported samples or among regions in Japan. The
   overall results suggest that P. sinensis was introduced through
   human-mediated dispersal; furthermore, the haplotype distributions of P.
   sinensis established in Japan reflected the intensity of the species'
   importation from central and northern China. This is the first study to
   document the genetic structure of non-native P. sinensis in Japan.},

Abstract = {For risk assessment and prevention of further invasion of the alien
   apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, into new habitats in Japan, we
   estimated the snail's potential overwintering areas on the basis of
   climate data and a field census. Presence or absence was examined at 38
   sites in six regions of Kyushu Island, where the snail has invaded most
   areas in which it can overwinter. The effects of cumulative low
   temperature during winter on the presence/absence data were examined by
   using a logistic regression analysis. As a result, a model using
   cumulative low temperature below 10 degrees C (CLT10) was adopted as the
   best determinant of snail overwintering success, with the risk
   evaluation formula y = 1 / {[}1 + exp(-4.7931474 + 0.007574x)], where x
   is CLT10 (5-year average) and y is the probability of overwintering
   success. To verify the model, y was calculated for 1348 sites on Honshu,
   Shikoku, and Kyushu islands where P. canaliculata was confirmed to be
   present by recent field censuses. Of these sites, 1344 (> 99.7\%) had y
   values exceeding 0.4; the remaining four had y values ranging from > 0.2
   to 0.4, with a minimum of 0.377. These results indicate that the model
   can be used to predict the overwintering success and subsequent
   localization of P. canaliculata. A potential invasion map that we drew
   by using the model will help to prevent further expansion of this
   invasive snail into new areas.},

Abstract = {Recent invasions of the North and Baltic Seas by three Marenzelleria
   species have extensively altered benthic communities in the region.
   Despite several studies on the morphology and biology of the worms,
   their morphological identifications are often challenging. Here we
   summarize and map the available records of Marenzelleria from Eurasia,
   distinguishing those based on morphology versus molecular data. Based
   upon the genetic similarity (p = 0.08\% for COI) between individuals
   from the Baltic Sea and individuals from the Barents and White Seas we
   propose, for the first time, a possible route for the invasion of the
   Baltic Sea by M. arctia from the White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic
   Sea Canal. At the same time, our analysis of the sequences of COI
   fragments showed a significant genetic distance (p = 4.28- 4.29\%)
   between individuals identified as M. arctia from the Baltic, Barents and
   White Seas and those from the Kara Sea. This genetic distance, as well
   as the isolated estuarine habitats of these Arctic worms, and the large
   geographic distance between the type locality of M. arctia in the
   Beaufort Sea (Alaska) and northern Europe, raise doubts about the
   conspecificity of North American, North European and Northwest Pacific
   populations. We report M. neglecta for the first time for the British
   Isles (River Thames). We also review the evidence for the role of the
   Baltic Sea-Volga Canal and the Volga-Don Canal in facilitating the
   dispersal of M. neglecta to the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov,
   respectively. We further provide new insight on the phylogeny of
   Marenzelleria, an updated diagnosis of the genus and a key for
   morphological identification of Marenzelleria adults greater than 1.2 mm
   wide.},

Title = {Seedling establishment and early growth in Calobota sericea subjected to
   moisture stress},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {The South African perennial legume Calobota sericea (Thunb.) Boatwr. \&
   B-E van Wyk has been shown to be drought tolerant as mature plants, but
   information on drought tolerance of seedlings is lacking. This study
   evaluated the impact of moisture stress on seedling emergence, survival
   and growth in C. sericea. In the first trial, pre-germinated seeds were
   planted at 100, 70, 50 and 40\% of soil moisture holding capacity
   without additional watering. Seedling emergence and mortality was
   recorded daily for 14 days. In the second trial, seeds were allowed to
   grow under well-watered conditions for one month, after which moisture
   stress was imposed for 15 and 30 days. Thereafter, the seedlings were
   uprooted, for shoot and root measurements. Results from these trials
   show that C. sericea seedlings will establish even at severely reduced
   water-availabilities, but without subsequent watering, significant
   seedling mortality will occur. Calobota sericea seedlings displayed a
   range of morphological adaptive strategies to moisture stress including
   the minimisation of water loss and optimisation of water uptake. Further
   research into the impacts of regular cycles of moisture stress is needed
   to determine if changes in morphology due to prior moisture stress will
   result in improved adaptation to subsequent moisture stress.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to quantify forage yield, economic performance,
   biological efficiency and competitive ability in cactus intercropped
   with millet, compared with their monocrops, both with and without mulch,
   under irrigation. The experiment was conducted over two years in
   semi-arid of Brazil. The experimental design was of randomised blocks
   with four replications and six treatments: monocropped cactus without
   mulch; monocropped cactus with mulch; monocropped millet without mulch;
   monocropped millet with mulch and cactus intercropped with millet, with
   and without mulch. The individual yields of fresh (270 t ha(-1)) and dry
   (23 t ha(-1)) matter in the cactus were not affected by the mulch or by
   intercropping. Mulching improved the individual yields of fresh (69.7 t
   ha(-1)) and dry (23.4 t ha(-1)) matter in the monocropped millet. Total
   dry matter was greater in the intercropping systems, both with (32.8 t
   ha(-1)) and without (31.4 t ha(-1)) mulching, being the average monetary
   advantage index equal to 8 404 BRL ha(-1). The cactus-millet
   configuration, irrespective of the use of mulch, but irrigated in dry
   environments or during dry periods of the year, is more advantageous
   than the monocrops, because it promotes gains in production and food
   diversity for meeting the demand of the herd.},

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Over the past similar to 15 y, unconventional oil and gas (UOG)
   production utilizing hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has
   increased dramatically in the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian region
   of the USA. The area also has a long history of conventional oil and gas
   (COG) production as well as coal mining, and the 3 extractive activities
   (UOG, COG, and coal mining) often occur in the same watersheds. Produced
   water and wastewater from oil and gas (OG) extraction can have very high
   concentrations of dissolved metals, radionuclides, and other solutes.
   Previous studies have documented streamwater pollution associated with
   spills and releases of these fluids, but it remains unclear whether OG
   development has broad regional effects on streamwater quality. This
   study assessed whether COG and UOG well densities in watersheds were
   associated with water-quality metrics, including specific conductance,
   dissolved metals, nutrients, radium isotopes, and anions, when
   controlling for coal mining and land cover. Water quality was measured
   at 120 stream sites with non-nested watersheds in the Marcellus Shale
   region. Linear modeling revealed that COG well density was associated
   with higher concentrations of Mg and Cl-, and UOG well density was
   associated with higher Ra-228:Ra-224 ratios, suggesting that this ratio
   might be a useful indicator of UOG development in watersheds. Adding OG
   well density to linear models explaining the concentrations of
   water-quality variables improved R-2 by <= 0.04, indicating little
   increase in explanatory power. However, linear regression coefficients
   indicated that an increase in COG well density from 0 to 11 wells/km(2)
   (the maximum well density observed in our study area) could be
   associated with 35x increases in Mg and Cl- concentrations, although the
   SE of these estimates was large. This research suggests that OG well
   density may have small but measurable effects on streamwater quality;
   however, the effects of other human activities and land uses, such as
   coal extraction and urban development, are likely larger and more
   environmentally relevant.},

Title = {Effects of impoundments on stream crayfish assemblages},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Life-history timing, trophic interactions, and colonization potential of
   stream benthos are linked to a stream's flow regime. Modifications to
   flow regimes often alter the composition of benthic assemblages. We
   assessed the impacts of relatively large storage dams (>15 m in height,
   >400-ha impoundments) on crayfish assemblages in southern Appalachian
   Mountain streams, Alabama, USA. We sampled crayfishes at multiple sites
   in flowing sections upstream and downstream of dams in 3 impounded
   streams and along similar lengths of 2 unimpounded streams in the Bear
   Creek and Cahaba River drainages. We analyzed at 2 scales: within and
   between drainages. This multi-scale approach allowed us to assess the
   effects of impoundments on crayfish assemblages in 1 drainage and then
   assess whether impoundment effects could be generalized across
   drainages. We compared crayfish assemblages between impounded and
   unimpounded streams and examined changes in crayfish assemblages with
   distance from impoundments, considering land-use history as a potential
   confounding factor. Adult densities averaged 45\% higher, and sizes 10\%
   smaller, in downstream sections of unimpounded streams compared with
   impounded streams. Densities and sizes of adults in upstream sections
   did not differ between unimpounded and impounded streams. In both
   drainages, unimpounded stream crayfish assemblage structure gradually
   shifted along the stream length, with species present upstream differing
   from those present downstream. Conversely, in all impounded streams,
   species assemblages did not differ between upstream and downstream
   sections, illustrating that dams diminish crayfish diversity.
   Nonetheless, finer-scale assessments showed that crayfish density and
   richness increased with distance downstream of impoundments. This
   suggests that assemblage recovery is possible with increasing distance
   downstream of impoundments. Additionally, we detected fewer crayfish
   assemblage differences between impounded and unimpounded streams in the
   Cahaba River drainage than the Bear Creek drainage. In the Cahaba River
   drainage, urbanization and the presence of an invasive crayfish species
   in both streams may have hindered our ability to distinguish impoundment
   effects on crayfishes. Our results show that large dams negatively
   affect crayfishes and may affect hundreds of crayfish species in
   thousands of stream km, possibly altering stream systems by interfering
   with the numerous ecosystem functions influenced by crayfishes.},

Title = {Effect of botanical composition calibration on the accuracy of

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the influence of botanical composition
   calibration on the accuracy of undisturbed sward height and comparative
   yield method (CYM) techniques for herbage mass estimation in tropical
   heterogeneous pastures. Two studies were conducted using two grazing
   systems based on heterogeneous pastures. Herbage mass was estimated
   using CYM and undisturbed sward height techniques within quadrats (SHQ)
   or at a set of standard points in the paddocks (SHP). SHQ had a higher
   adjusted R-2 when calibrated with the Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (U.
   brizantha) proportion compared to the simple SHQ model (0.75 vs 0.68),
   while RSE was lower (0.18 vs 0.21). The R-2 increased (0.63 to 0.68),
   while both residual means and RSE decreased (-2.30 to -0.05 and 0.22 to
   0.20, respectively) when SHP was calibrated with U. brizantha. It also
   resulted in a reduction of mean squared prediction error (MSPE) to CYM,
   SHQ, and SHP, respectively. The CYM allows for higher accuracy of
   herbage mass estimation in tropical heterogeneous pastures than
   undisturbed sward height, irrespective of botanical calibration.
   However, the botanical composition calibration had positive effects on
   the models from undisturbed sward height, and the calibration with U.
   brizantha increased the accuracy of herbage mass prediction.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined forage, soil and cattle serum mineral status,
   and their relationships in severely (SD) and less severely (LSD)
   degraded rangelands, South Africa. Such evidence is essential to inform
   rangeland policies and interventions. In each rangeland, three villages
   were identified, and sites near, at intermediate and far distance from
   homesteads were selected. Soil from LSD had generally greater macro and
   microelement levels than soil from SD rangelands. Soil elements (i.e. N,
   P, Mg and Cu) displayed variations at local scale (between villages or
   distance points from homestead) depending on degradation condition.
   Degradation level significantly influenced the local distribution of
   grasses between the distance points from the homestead (Themeda triandra
   Forssk., Aristida congesta Roem. \& Schult.) and between villages
   {[}Digitaria eriantha Steud., Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees, T.
   triandra]. Forage biomass was low (range: 45-223 kg ha(-1)) in both
   degraded conditions. During the dry periods, cattle grazing SD
   rangelands had most serum minerals below a critical level, but pastures
   showed Cu and N deficiencies only. We conclude that the low forage yield
   may limit animal mineral intake. On the other hand, the great abundance
   of grasses with high forage values (60-76\%) indicates that degraded
   areas may be regenerated. In SD rangelands, complete mineral
   supplementation is recommended during the dry period.},

Title = {The diversity of epigeal insects after the application of the brush
   packing restoration method following bush-encroachment control in South
   Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 23},
Abstract = {Evidently, bush encroachment caused by factors, such as overgrazing,
   results in a change in savanna ecosystems. This shift in vegetation
   structure can affect many factors, including insect fauna. Epigeal
   arthropods occupy smaller habitat patches and therefore respond to the
   effects of bush encroachment at finer scales. Different restoration
   efforts to combat bush encroachment have been implemented. A
   low-intensity management method is brush packing, which involves the use
   of removed woody branches to cover the soil surface. This study
   investigates whether the application of brush packing is effective in
   the restoration of insect communities. Total insect richness and the
   tendency towards diversity were higher on bush-controlled plots,
   irrespective of brush packing. This trend was found for all tested
   insect orders, except for Hymenoptera. However, non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordination clustered distinctive insect
   communities in areas where brush packing was applied. The results
   indicate that the application of brush packing results in higher habitat
   heterogeneity and, consequently, more diversified insect communities on
   a small scale. We argue that brush packing application does not only
   benefit vegetation structure, but can also improve insect community
   composition, thereby increasing overall ecosystem health and stability,
   making this restoration method suitable for highly degraded areas.},

Abstract = {Fire is a key regulator of tree cover in grassy ecosystems, but
   century-long changes in fire regimes have not been explicitly quantified
   in South Africa. This study aimed to determine changes in the fire
   regimes of South Africa's grassy biomes over the past century in
   response to widespread human-induced changes. Using spatially explicit
   data, we employed random forest models to examine the importance of
   climatic and human drivers on the extent, frequency and intensity of
   fire. We then modelled how fire regimes are likely to have changed over
   the past century using historical trends in key human drivers
   (population growth, livestock density, road density and land cover
   change) as inputs. Results showed that human drivers, particularly land
   transformation and human population density, were important determinants
   of fire regime. Random forest predictions showed a decline in burnt area
   (mean of 10.5\% in 1910 to 5.1\% in 2020), and a shift to fire regimes
   with smaller burnt areas, longer fire return intervals and lower
   intensity fires over the past century, particularly in the mesic east.
   These dynamics have important implications for our understanding of the
   widespread increases in woody cover observed in the region over this
   period.},

Abstract = {Vegetation cover estimates for trees, shrub-grass mosaics, and grassland
   and bare ground, were quantified in the savanna-woodland of Bwabwata
   National Park, north-east Namibia. Changes in woody cover were analysed
   using repeat photographs in combination with aerial photographs and
   recent satellite imagery taken between 1996 and 2019. Cover estimates
   for each vegetation type were obtained using object-based classification
   techniques and a non-parametric random forest classifier algorithm in
   eCognition Trimble software. Results show that over the two decades
   under investigation (1996-2019), trees declined (-10.6\%), and the
   shrub-grass mosaic vegetation type increased (8.1\%) across the park.
   The largest decline in trees occurred in the western land use areas
   (-36\%), which also experienced the greatest increase in the shrub-grass
   mosaic (17\%), when compared with areas in the east (11\%). Variation of
   woody cover estimates is attributed to different seasonal fire
   management practices in the east versus the west of the park. The fire
   history (2000-2018) revealed that late dry season fires were frequent in
   the west, whereas in the east, early dry season fires were frequent. The
   stages of encroachment recorded in this study have consequences for
   biodiversity, people's livelihoods, and tourism.},

Abstract = {Feed scarcity is a major challenge facing free-range beef farming in
   semi-arid areas. Specifically, low quality and quantity of forage in
   rangelands and higher feeding costs are the main constraints limiting
   smallholder free-range beef farmers' participation in mainstream beef
   markets. Using farmers' participatory approaches, this study identified
   major locally available forage resources (LAFRs) and evaluated their
   nutritional value. A total of 40 free-ranging commercially orientated
   smallholder beef farmers were interviewed using semi-structured
   questionnaires and tasked to identify LAFRs in the Cradock and
   Middelburg areas of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Chemical analysis
   was conducted for the most cited forages such as African sheepbush
   (Pentzia incana), sweet thorn (Vachellia karroo) leaves and pods, reed
   (Phragmites australis), lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay, natural pasture
   grasses (NPGs) and barbary fig, or prickly pear cactus, (Opuntia
   ficus-indica) cladodes collected from twelve participants' farms. Feed
   shortage was ranked by more than 53\% respondents as the main constraint
   to smallholder beef production. Regardless of the farming area, crude
   protein content of V. karroo leaves and pods averaging 18.8 and 19.5\%,
   respectively, was higher than other LAFRs. However, V. karoo pods had
   relatively low ash content than other forages in both farming areas.
   Opuntia ficus-indica attained high in vitro neutral detergent fibre
   digestibility at 12, 24 and 48 hr incubation periods, due to low neutral
   detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin.
   Integration of participatory inventory and chemical analysis proved to
   be reliable in identifying LAFRs, with V. karroo leaves and O.
   ficus-indica cladodes being the main potential forage resources for
   inclusion in beef cattle diets. Further research is recommended to
   substantiate their supplementary nutritive value and level of inclusion
   in beef cattle finishing diets.},

Abstract = {Nutrient enrichment influences grassland ecosystem structure, typically
   manifested by reduced species richness and increased productivity.
   Quantifying the long-term impacts of nutrient enrichment on grasslands
   contributes to understanding eutrophication effects on grassland,
   particularly for grasslands adapted to low soil nutrient status.
   Overextended time periods, nutrient enrichment may modify soil
   fertility. The Ukulinga Grassland Nutrient Experiment situated on a
   natural C4 grassland was set up in 1951 on the Ukulinga research farm,
   South Africa. Continuously applied treatments on plots measuring 2.7 x 9
   m include combinations of nitrogen at 0, 7, 14 and 21 g m(-2) per annum,
   phosphorus at 0 and 2.8 g m(-2) per annum and lime at 0 and 225 g m(-2)
   applied every five years. Nitrogen sources included ammonium sulphate
   (acidifying) and limestone ammonium nitrate (less acidifying). Grass
   species composition was influenced by both nitrogen forms. In contrast,
   forb species composition was more sensitive to LAN. We found evidence of
   nitrogen limitation on aboveground net-primary production. However,
   species richness (for grass and forbs) declined with increasing ammonium
   sulphate levels, owing to increased soil acidity and high aluminium
   concentrations. Aluminium toxicity can affect overall species
   composition by replacing Al-sensitive species with Al-tolerant species
   on site.},

Title = {Q(c) threshold departs from theoretical Q(c) in urban watersheds: The
   role of streambed mobility data in managing the urban disturbance regime},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {The threshold discharge (Q(c)) for streambed mobilization is both
   biologically and geomorphically relevant to stream ecosystems. Excess
   streambed mobilization can disturb benthic organisms and initiate cycles
   of channel instability. The mechanistic relevance of Q(c) gives it great
   utility for aquatic ecosystem studies, stormwater management, and stream
   restoration design. However, field and laboratory data document
   considerable variability in Q(c) across hydrogeomorphic settings,
   underscoring the importance of using field data to calibrate the Q(c)
   estimate for a given stream or region. This paper shows how both high-
   and low-tech monitoring protocols can be used to constrain a Q(c)
   estimate, depending on monitoring program goals and budgets. Data from 3
   hydrogeomorphically distinct settings in the USA and Australia show that
   the departure of Q(c) from theoretical estimates increases with
   watershed imperviousness. Although Q(c) estimates derived from
   conventional critical Shields stress values tend to be a reasonable and
   conservative starting point for stormwater management in streams that
   lack site-specific or regional data, streambed mobility monitoring is
   recommended to calibrate and validate Q(c) estimates for a stream or
   region prior to making large investments in stormwater interventions
   aimed at mitigating the urban streambed disturbance regime.},

Title = {Reconceptualizing the hyporheic zone for nonperennial rivers and streams},

Abstract = {Nonperennial streams dominate global river networks and are increasing
   in occurrence across space and time. When surface flow ceases or the
   surface water dries, flow or moisture can be retained in the subsurface
   sediments of the hyporheic zone, supporting aquatic communities and
   ecosystem processes. However, hydrological and ecological definitions of
   the hyporheic zone have been developed in perennial rivers and emphasize
   the mixing of water and organisms from both the surface stream and
   groundwater. The adaptation of such definitions to include both humid
   and dry unsaturated conditions could promote characterization of how
   hydrological and biogeochemical variability shape ecological communities
   within nonperennial hyporheic zones, advancing our understanding of both
   ecosystem structure and function in these habitats. To conceptualize
   hyporheic zones for nonperennial streams, we review how water sources
   and surface and subsurface structure influence hydrological and
   physicochemical conditions. We consider the extent of this zone and how
   biogeochemistry and ecology might vary with surface states. We then link
   these components to the composition of nonperennial stream communities.
   Next, we examine literature to identify priorities for hydrological and
   ecological research exploring nonperennial hyporheic zones. Lastly, by
   integrating hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology, we recommend a
   multidisciplinary conceptualization of the nonperennial hyporheic zone
   as the porous subsurface streambed sediments that shift between lotic,
   lentic, humid, and dry conditions in space and time to support
   aquatic-terrestrial biodiversity. As river drying increases in extent
   because of global change, we call for holistic, interdisciplinary
   research across the terrestrial and aquatic sciences to apply this
   conceptualization to characterize hyporheic zone structure and function
   across the full spectrum of hydrological states.},

Abstract = {Thermal springs provide natural laboratories to test the responses of
   biological communities to various stressors. To date, little is known
   about how water temperature and chemistry influence the microalgal
   assemblages in these ecosystems, especially in the circum-Mediterranean
   area. In this study, we assessed the environmental drivers of benthic
   diatom assemblages collected from different substrates in 8
   thermo-mineral springs of Sardinia, Italy, with a focus on temperature
   and conductivity. A total of 205 diatom species (67 genera) were found,
   of which 12 (8 genera) were centric and 193 (59 genera) were pennate.
   Composition of diatom assemblages was associated with temperature, pH,
   conductivity, bicarbonates (HCO3-), and sulfates (SO42-). Multivariate
   analyses also confirmed differences in species composition, richness,
   diversity, and evenness of diatom assemblages from groups of springs
   distinguished by temperature and conductivity gradients. We found higher
   species richness, diversity, and evenness in hyperthermal (water
   temperature = 52.7-71.5 degrees C) and medium-mineral springs
   (conductivity = 590-1193 mu S/cm). Our results indicate that thermal
   springs are not always inhospitable environments for diatoms. Springs
   with high water temperatures hosted rich and diverse diatom assemblages,
   likely thanks to their ecotonal nature and a combination of multiple
   local factors.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a history of attempts to understand and manage fire
   in the grasslands and savannas of eastern and southern Africa from c.
   1900 to 2010. Given the brevity of the paper and the author's expertise,
   there is a focus on science and management in South Africa, though wider
   networks of research and expertise across the region are discussed.
   There is a focus on a few key figures like Charles Swynnerton, John
   Phillips and Winston Trollope, with references provided for other
   important historical figures like John William Bews. The emphasis is on
   scientific research and expert-led thinking on fire and fire management
   in vegetation, with brief discussion of African approaches and the
   extent to which they have been ignored or have influenced scientific
   thinking. Fire in relation to invasive species is not covered.},

Abstract = {Fire has been an integral evolutionary force shaping and maintaining
   grassy biomes, such as the Afromontane grasslands of South Africa.
   Afromontane grasslands represent a large carbon reservoir, but it is
   uncertain how fire affects their long-term C storage. We investigated
   the effect of fire regime on soil organic C and N (SOC; SON) in a
   long-term (39-year) burning experiment in the Maloti-Drakensberg Park,
   South Africa. We compared SOC and SON sampled in 2004 and 2019 from six
   treatments differing in fire frequency (annual, biennial, five-year,
   infrequent) and season (spring, autumn). Average SOC increased
   significantly between 2004 and 2019. Average SON increased slightly,
   resulting in a significant increase in C:N ratio, indicating that soil
   organic matter is becoming less N-eutrophic. Importantly, burning
   annually in spring increased SOC and SON. This unexpected response is
   attributed to the aluandic (acidic, high organic matter) properties of
   Drakensberg soils. Burning in autumn did not increase SOC and SON. The
   lowest C stocks were observed in infrequently burnt plots. Average C
   sequestration across all fire treatments was 0.30 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The
   observed increase in SOC under frequent fires is contrary to many
   findings from other studies in grassy ecosystems and notably driven by
   fire season.},

Abstract = {A 3 x 2 factorial study was conducted in 2015, 2016 and 2017, to assess
   the impact of dry season cutting management on fodder yield and quality
   of Napier grass. Three harvesting times (November, January and March)
   and two stubble- cutting heights (20 and 30 cm) were used in the study.
   The results revealed that the dry matter (DM) yield and leaf:stem ratio
   records in 2015 and 2016 were much higher than in 2017. Tilling
   performance was lower in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016. The highest DM
   yields were recorded during harvesting time in March. In the November
   harvest, however, the leaf:stem ratio was greater. In addition, tilling
   performance was better in March and November than it was in January.
   Overall, cutting at a height of 30 cm resulted in better DM yield and
   tiller numbers than cutting at a height of 20 cm. Experimental years and
   cutting height did not affect crude protein (CP), neutral detergent
   fibre (NDF) or acid detergent fibre (ADF). Harvesting times did,
   however, affect CP, NDF and ADF. As CP was greater in November than in
   March and both NDF and ADF levels were higher in March, cutting in
   November at 30 cm is advised.},

Abstract = {Dermacentor marginatus is a vector disease of both humans and animals
   and transmits the causative agents of Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) and
   the spotted fever group (Rickettsia raoultii and R. slovaca), as well as
   of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Dermacentor reticulatus can transmit
   various pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Babesia spp., tick
   encephalitis virus, Coxiella burnetii, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, and
   Rickettsia spp. and can cause serious skin lesions. Herein, ecological
   niche modeling (ENM) is used to characterize the niches of these two
   ticks and describe their potential distributional patterns under both
   current and future climate conditions, as a means of highlighting
   geographic distributional shifts that may be of public health

   marginatus showed broad suitable areas across western, central, and
   southern Europe, with potential for expansion in northern and eastern
   Europe. Dermacentor reticulatus has suitable areas across western,
   central, and northern Europe. Under future scenarios, new expansions
   were observed in parts of northern and eastern Europe and highland areas
   in central Europe. Despite broad overlap between the niches of the
   ticks, D. marginatus has a broader niche, which allows it to show
   greater stability in the face of the changing climate conditions. Areas
   of potential geographic distributional expansion for these species
   should be monitored for actual distributional shifts, which may have
   implications for public health in those regions.},

Abstract = {Fire plays an important role in the ecology of tropical grasslands
   globally. However, detailed studies comparing the response of plant
   functional groups to fire seasonality, and thus phenological timing, are
   scarce from humid Afrotropical grasslands. Such information, however, is
   crucial for understanding what keeps the grasslands open and for
   enabling evidence-based management, and conservation. We initiated an
   experiment in frost- and fire-prone Angolan geoxyle grasslands in 2017,
   investigating the effect of different timing of fires on cover and
   diversity of trees, grasses, geoxyles and herbs. We installed permanent,
   randomised plots with fire exclusion, annual early and late dry-season
   burning, representing the local burning practices. Functional plant
   groups reacted differently to the treatments, becoming apparent at
   species level and their performance metrics. After three years, grass
   species benefitted from late and no burning, and herbs from late
   burning, whereas geoxyles thrived under early burning. Tree growth was
   suppressed under late burning, and did not increase with fire exclusion.
   Species richness and diversity was higher in burnt than in unburnt
   plots. Seasonal timing of fire tips the scales between geoxyles and
   grasses. The extraordinary plant diversity of Angolan geoxyle grasslands
   is a result of pyrodiversity and frost, keeping the grasslands open even
   in absence of fire.},

Abstract = {Across much of southern Africa's savanna wildernesses, wildfires burn
   unchecked. This is particularly true in the woodland savannas of
   northern Botswana, where wildfires originate outside of management
   activities, and are left to burn uncontrolled, because of limited
   resources and remoteness. There is concern that severe annual wildfires
   are resulting in the `savannisation' of large tracts of wooded land
   across forest reserves, protected areas and surrounding wilderness
   areas. Because the current fire regime is unknown, management
   interventions are hard to introduce. We examine the recent 20-year
   (2001-2020) fire history in northern Botswana using MODIS
   satellitederived fire products to reveal fire frequency and seasonality.
   Six wildfire hotspots are identified for exploration of fire frequency
   and possible origins. Annual fire frequencies are far higher than would
   be expected without anthropogenic ignition. Extensive areas in some
   hotspots are shown to have burned between 14 and 16 out of the 20-year
   period. Fires peak in September, several weeks before the onset of the
   rainy season and associated lightning strikes, and when the fuel load is
   at its maximum and conditions at their driest. Adaptive fire management
   practices, such as those being followed in neighbouring South Africa and
   elsewhere should inform Botswana's fire management policies.},

Title = {Chemical fragmentation of stream systems and fish species richness: The

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {615-625},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The loading of chemical pollutants into stream systems can result in
   isolation of aquatic communities upstream of the discharge. Ecological
   theory suggests that isolation will result in species richness losses,
   but this potential indirect effect of stream pollution is not widely
   studied. Here, I present a study of fish assemblage structure in
   watersheds that have been longitudinally fragmented by abandoned mine
   drainage. A number of headwater streams in the Clarion River watershed
   of the upper Ohio River Basin, Pennsylvania, USA, have escaped any
   direct effects of abandoned mine drainage but have been isolated by
   severe pollution lower in the watershed. I evaluated the effects of
   watershed fragmentation on fish species richness, composition, and
   abundance by comparing the fish assemblages of 22 headwater streams
   embedded in watersheds receiving mine effluent with the assemblages of
   34 reference streams with no apparent blockages to dispersal. I used a
   general linear model to evaluate the effect of isolation on species
   richness while accounting for stream size and water quality. I also used
   non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of
   variance to evaluate differences in fish species composition between
   isolated and reference streams. Controlling for the effect of stream
   size, reference streams had a mean richness of 3.63 species (+/- 0.27
   SE), but isolated streams had a mean species richness of just 1.02 (+/-
   0.33), a 3.5x difference. Species occupying isolated stream systems were
   a nested subset of fish species in reference streams. Species
   composition also differed between isolated and reference streams, with
   higher relative abundance of Creek Chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus
   {[}Mitchill, 1818]) and lower relative abundances of Mottled Sculpin
   (Cottus bairdii Girard, 1850) and Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis
   {[}Mitchill, 1814]) in isolated streams. These results illustrate an
   important indirect effect of water pollution in dendritic watersheds and
   provide evidence for the importance of connectivity in maintaining
   aquatic biodiversity.},

Title = {Highlighting assumptions of community engagement in urban stream
   restoration},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 1},
Abstract = {Restoration practitioners experience mixed results when they try to
   engage community members in urban stream restoration projects. In some
   cases, practitioners make presumptions about community responses to
   restoration that lead to unsuccessful engagement and detract from
   restoration goals. During the 5(th) Symposium on Urbanization and Stream
   Ecology, we noticed that participants repeatedly discussed community
   stakeholder engagement as a tool for effective urban stream restoration.
   However, most presenters did not acknowledge that typical engagement
   strategies do not consider how the target community's social, economic,
   and political dynamics will influence stakeholder response. As a result,
   many practitioners make assumptions about communities that can be
   counterproductive to engagement efforts. Here, we discuss 4 underlying
   assumptions that many researchers make when trying to engage community
   stakeholders: 1) community members and researchers have the same project
   goals, 2) educating residents is essential in garnering community
   support, 3) the community will benefit from the restoration effort, and
   4) the community has solutions to contribute to the technical aspects of
   the restoration effort. We present and develop these assumptions in the
   context of relevant urban stream restoration projects and highlight the
   complexity represented across communities where urban stream restoration
   projects can take place. Land managers and researchers must first
   cultivate a thoughtful understanding of the community and its existing
   socioeconomic capacities before integrating community stakeholders into
   urban stream restoration projects. We believe highlighting these
   societal complexities will promote a deeper consideration of appropriate
   engagement strategies for urban stream restoration projects.},

Title = {Goals and approaches in the use of citizen science for exploring plastic
   pollution in freshwater ecosystems: A review},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-579},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The role of citizen science in environmental monitoring has received
   interest in the research community over the last decade, with citizen
   scientists playing a key role in engaging with and gathering scientific
   evidence to support natural resource management. Likewise, the
   involvement of citizen science in aquatic research is growing. One area
   of aquatic research where there has been successful application of
   citizen science is in support of plastic-pollution research.
   Plastic-pollution research benefits from support by citizen scientists
   both because of the ubiquity of plastic within our environments,
   requiring data to be collected from a wide geographical area, and
   because of the need for systemic behavior change at both individual and
   societal levels. Recent studies highlight citizen science contributions
   to plastic-pollution research within marine systems, but our knowledge
   is limited about how citizen science can support limnetic
   plastic-pollution research, with no known published systematic reviews.
   The involvement of citizen science within freshwater monitoring has been
   widely discussed, but most peer-reviewed literature focuses on commonly
   targeted water-quality parameters (e.g., nutrients). This is not
   surprising given that freshwater plastic waste is a newly emerging field
   of interest; thus, the support of citizen science in this research area
   is only just beginning. This review is the 1(st) to explore the status
   of freshwater citizen science focused on plastic pollution. Based on a
   synthesis of 12 peer-reviewed publications, we considered the
   environmental and geographic extent of the research, research scope,
   methods, involvement of citizen science, and data quality. We also
   discuss how citizen science can contribute to emerging issues in
   freshwater science. Through our review we found that the use of citizen
   science within the field of freshwater plastic-pollution research
   remains rare, with most projects following the contributory model of
   citizen participation. Additionally, methods and standardized approaches
   for citizen recruitment, engagement, and training were limited in the
   peer-reviewed literature. Greater transparency of methods and approaches
   used will be key to opening up the potential for citizen science within
   this evolving research field. This review can be used as a starting
   point for researchers to develop their own freshwater plastic-waste
   monitoring programs involving citizen scientists.},

Abstract = {We document changes in rangeland during a prolonged drought in the arid
   Karoo. Rangeland in this arid region is species-rich and dominated by a
   mixture of long-lived succulent and non-succulent shrubs. Ranching has
   led to the domination of vegetation by less palatable species, and
   resting does little to restore diversity because most species are
   long-lived. Between 2015 and 2020, a combination of rising temperatures
   and low rainfall reduced vegetation cover and grazing potential
   throughout the Karoo. Mortality varied among species, habitat and with
   predrought rangeland condition, but appeared independent of size class.
   Growth form was not a good predictor of drought survival, although
   vegetation dominated by non-succulent shrub species before the drought
   was dominated by a succulent shrub species toward the end of the
   drought. Dieback was greater on deep soil than in drainage lines and on
   stony rises. Historically degraded landscapes lost relatively more
   vegetation cover and grazing capacity than areas protected from grazing.
   By reducing dominant, long-lived, non-forage shrub species, drought
   appears to be changing the composition of the vegetation to a state that
   may have higher grazing potential, particularly if livestock numbers are
   reduced and reseeding is carried out during the recovery period.},

Title = {Effects of short-duration kraaling depend on initial conditions in a

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Short-duration overnight kraaling has been suggested as a tool for
   restoring degraded rangelands. However, the response of different plant
   functional types and communities to such intense livestock impact may
   vary depending on local context. We thus examined the effects of
   short-duration overnight kraaling on soil and vegetation characteristics
   in a mesic montane grassland in South Africa using paired kraal and
   control sites, as part of a low intensity grazing approach. Kraaling
   increased soil P and S, as well as soil organic matter (except when
   initial values were over 12\%). The effect of kraaling on vegetation was
   strongly dependent on initial condition. Basal cover of grasses and
   forbs increased by approximately 50 and 15\%, respectively, if sites had
   very low initial basal cover, but decreased by up to 15\% if initial
   values were over 50\% and 10\%, respectively. Kraaling always decreased
   herbaceous biomass, but especially when initial values were over 2 000
   kg ha(-1). In mesic grasslands, short-duration overnight kraaling is
   promising as a tool for rehabilitating degraded sites or fertilizing
   abandoned cropland, but should be avoided where the grass sward is
   intact. We recommend that the suitability of kraaling be evaluated per
   vegetation type and local context.},

Abstract = {Herbivory can induce changes in flower traits influencing the community
   of flower-visiting insects and ultimately impacting the plant's
   reproductive output. Here, we investigated how leaf herbivory on sweet
   pepper plants, Capsicum annuum L., by Diabrotica speciosa (Germar)
   adults influences the community of insect floral visitors and alters
   plant reproduction. In an experimental field, we found that flowers of
   herbivore-infested plants were less visited by insects than those of
   uninfested plants. A similar pattern was found for the abundance of the
   three most common species of floral visitors in the collections, Apis
   mellifera (Linnaeus), Toxomerus sp.1, and Trigona spinipes (Fabricius).
   The insect community associated with the flowers of herbivore-infested
   plants was distinct, less rich, and diverse than that of uninfested
   plants. Leaf herbivory also impacted flower abundance that likely
   influenced the visual attraction of insects. The changes in
   flower-visiting insect community associated with herbivore-infested
   plants coincided with a reduced number of fruits, which were smaller and
   contained fewer seeds than those from uninfested plants. Our results
   suggest that leaf herbivory by D. speciosa results in direct and
   indirect costs to the plants through modifications in abundance and
   composition of flower-visiting insect community.},

Title = {Herbicide trials on Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Asteraceae) during
   adverse conditions reveal incompatibility with biocontrol and a narrow
   window of opportunity for chemical control},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 23},
Abstract = {Herbicide trials on pompom weed Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC.
   (Asteraceae) were carried out in grasslands with xeric and hydric soils,
   at sites in Gauteng, South Africa, from 2005 to 2008. The rust fungus
   Puccinia eupatorii Dietel, an established self-perpetuating biocontrol
   agent on C. macrocephalum, caused significant damage to shoots in late
   summer and autumn. Herbicide efficacy was significantly better on
   foliage that did not already present symptoms and that was sprayed in
   early summer compared with on infected plants treated in autumn, at both
   the xeric (F = 36.71, p < 0.001) and hydric (F = 3.59, p = 0.031) sites.
   This pathogen has reduced the time available for effective chemical weed
   control from six months to three months. However, none of the herbicide
   treatments achieved commercially acceptable mortality rates of >= 80\%,
   and after three annual applications none succeeded in extirpating C.
   macrocephalum from the plots. Regression analyses of count data showed
   that metsulfuron-methyl at 45 g ha(-1) (USD 20.05 ha(-1)), picloram at
   252 g ha(-1) (USD 25.47 ha(-1)) and 2,4-D/dicamba/MCPA at 540/360/474 g
   ha(-1) (USD 45.41 ha(-1)) required five annual treatments in summer to
   eradicate C. macrocephalum, whereas 2,4-D amine at 1 440 g ha(-1) (USD
   13.65 ha(-1)) and MCPA at 1 200 g ha(-1) (USD 14.46 ha(-1)) required six
   treatments. Hence, there is a trade-off between the use of slightly more
   effective herbicides against the lower costs of other selective
   herbicides.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the bromatological and histological features of
   native African grasses under grazing in Brazilian semi-arid rangelands.
   An experimental grid design was used in a randomised sampling method for
   four replicate samples of three African grasses. The grasses evaluated
   were: Cenchrus ciliaris L., Digitaria pentzii Stent. and Megathyrsus
   maximus (Jacq.). The bromatological and histological traits analysed
   included dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre
   corrected to ashes and protein (NDFap), lignin, mesophyll, vascular
   bundle, phloem, xylem, vascular sheath, sclerenchyma, bulliform cells,
   and the adaxial and abaxial epidermis. The type of grass and grazing
   cycle correlated with DM, NDF and lignin (p < 0.05), whereas CP was not
   affected by these factors (p > 0.05). Dry matter ranged between 128 and
   304 g kg(-1); CP ranged between 90 and 167 g kg(-1); NDFap between 542
   and 707 g kg(-1), and lignin between 10 and 40 g kg(-1). The proportion
   of xylem (8.4\%), vascular sheath (30.5\%) and total vascular bundles
   (38.1\%) were greater in M. maximus (p < 0.05). The percentage of
   sclerenchyma did not differ between species (p > 0.05). Digitaria
   pentzii and C. ciliaris had a greater proportion of mesophyll than M.
   maximus (p < 0.05). Of the three grasses analysed. Digitaria pentzii
   exhibited the highest forage quality, because it had the lowest
   concentration of fibre and lignin, with lower proportions of lignified
   tissues.},

Title = {Associative nitrogen fixation could be common in South African mesic
   grassland},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 10},
Abstract = {Non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial diazotrophs closely associated
   with the roots of grasses probably contribute most of the new nitrogen
   acquired to sustain productive natural grasslands, yet their ecology is
   poorly understood, especially in southern Africa. We looked for genetic
   evidence, using qPCR and gel electrophoresis, for the presence of the
   bacterial nifH gene associated with the roots of four grass species (20
   plants each) in a mesic grassland in South Arica, which would indicate
   the potential for N fixation by diazotrophs. Grasses most tolerant of
   low N (Aristida junciformis) were predicted to harbour the most
   diazotrophs, especially compared to those most responsive to fertiliser
   N (Eragrostis curvula). However, the nifH gene was found in all 80 root
   samples and did not differ in copy number between species. Sequencing of
   a representative sample confirmed the identity of the nifH gene. The
   recently burned half of the grassland had 60\% more relative nifH gene
   copy numbers than the area burned 15 months previously, suggesting that
   grass growth stimulated by fire could recruit diazotrophs. Given their
   ubiquity and importance in the N economy of grasslands, research is
   required to characterise root-associated diazotroph communities,
   quantify their N fixation rates, and understand their environmental
   controls.},

Title = {Do native grasses emerge and establish in areas rehabilitated using
   vetiver grass?},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 17},
Abstract = {Species-rich grasslands provide important ecosystem services, and in
   South Africa, approximately 40\% of these grasslands are degraded.
   Vetiver grass (from India) is often used during rehabilitation efforts
   to restore soil function without a thorough understanding of the
   potential negative ecological impacts. Hence, a study was initiated to
   investigate vetiver's ecological impacts during grassland
   rehabilitation. Firstly, a field survey was conducted using a contiguous
   quadrat method to evaluate the extent of grass secondary succession in
   these rehabilitated sites. Secondly, the effect of vetiver competition
   and seed sowing method on the recruitment of two native grasses
   (Eragrostis curvula and Megathyrsus maximus) was examined using pot
   trials. The field survey results showed no evidence of grass secondary
   succession, but rather the abundance of bare ground around vetiver, and
   a marked increase in grass species richness with increasing distance
   from planted vetiver. Subsequently, in the pot trial, vetiver
   facilitated emergence in both native grasses, and soil surface sowing of
   indigenous grass seeds showed greater emergence than other sowing
   methods. However, vetiver inhibited native grass seedling establishment,
   even when root competition was excluded. This study suggests that areas
   rehabilitated using vetiver are unlikely to become productive grasslands
   with good grazing, because vetiver inhibits colonisation by native
   grasses.},

Title = {Nutritional quality of Calobota sericea fodders harvested at different
   phenological stages - opportunities for inclusion in fodder flow
   programs for extensive livestock farmers},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 3},
Abstract = {Calobota sericea (Thunb.) Boatwr. \& B.-E.van Wyk (Fabaceae) is a native
   legume from the semi-arid rangelands of South Africa. The species has
   been prioritised as a forage for water-limited agro-ecological areas. No
   information regarding the nutritional quality of C. sericea forage
   harvested at different phenological stages is currently available,
   limiting our knowledge as to the best time to harvest the forage. The
   aim of this study was to determine the nutritional quality of C. sericea
   forage harvested at five phenological stages. Results from the study
   show that crude protein, fibre, energy and digestibility of the forage
   decreased with plant maturity, but not all mineral nutrients showed the
   same trend. In general, C. sericea forage harvested at non-reproductive,
   early flower bud and full flower stages could provide sufficient energy
   and protein to maintain livestock condition. At these stages, the
   neutral detergent fibre and digestibility of the harvested materials are
   also good, indicating that intake and processing of these forage would
   not be a problem for the livestock. At these phenological stages most of
   the mineral nutrients were also sufficiently high to meet the minimum
   requirements of small stock. Thus, C. sericea forage harvested at the
   appropriate phenological stages could provide a useful source of forage
   for resource poor farmers.},

Abstract = {Human alteration of fire regimes is a hallmark of the Anthropocene; yet
   few studies have fully explored the implications of utilizing
   high-intensity fires in grasslands and savannas to manage shrub
   encroachment. Decades of fire research in South Africa inspired a unique
   convergence of high-intensity fire experiments in the USA. In the Great
   Plains of North America, high-intensity fire trials were designed to
   remove traditional investigator constraints that minimised variability
   in fire intensity and to explore woody mortality thresholds across a
   broader suite of experimental conditions. At the same time, studies in
   the Kruger National Park, South Africa, similarly investigated
   high-intensity fires to examine previously unstudied relationships
   between high-intensity fires and woody encroachment. These scientific
   pursuits have contributed to theoretical advances in our understanding
   of fire-vegetation dynamics. In this paper, we synthesise these
   high-intensity fire experiments, the empirical evidence emerging from
   them and their importance for managing grassland and savanna ecosystems,
   and the lessons learned and challenges ahead to maintaining critical
   ranges of variation in fire regimes during the Anthropocene.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {124-135},

Abstract = {Human-set fires are a crucial component of African savannas, affecting
   ecosystem structure, carbon emissions, local hazards and livelihoods.
   Yet, most fire research in these ecosystems focuses on the fire ecology
   of protected areas. Research exploring fire regimes in inhabited
   landscapes remains limited, undermining opportunities for culturally and
   environmentally sustainable fire management. To address this gap, we
   used interviews in Tanzanian farming communities and remote sensing to
   identify intentions behind fire use and the perceived relative frequency
   and riskiness of fires set for different purposes. We found that the
   most common ignitions were intentional and important to livelihoods.
   Burning was adaptive, responsive to environmental conditions, and
   optimised for the intended outcome with the perceived riskiest fires
   intentionally spreading uncontrolled. Remote sensing showed that most of
   the total burned area was accounted for by fires during the late dry
   season when people burned for activities, such as field preparation, and
   when environmental conditions encouraged fire spread. Our findings offer
   an insight into fire regimes in inhabited landscapes, by exploring how
   intentions shape the fire regime at the landscape scale. We discuss how
   understanding these intentions and local priorities, including adaptive
   uses of fire, is key to sustainable fire management outside protected
   areas.},

Title = {The influence of grass competition and soil moisture on the growth and
   phenology of Karoo shrubs in the Eastern Upper Karoo},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Rainfall in the Nama-Karoo is sporadic and a plant's ability to access
   and utilise available soil moisture will determine its ability to
   persist in the system and to successfully recruit. When summer rainfall
   in the Eastern Karoo increases, grassiness increases at the expense of
   shrub canopy cover. This may drive a transition from shrubland toward
   grassland. The effect of grass-shrub competition on shrub growth and
   phenology in the Eastern Karoo is not adequately explained by the
   root-niche separation hypothesis or the succession hypothesis. In an
   experiment, we measured shrub growth and phenology in the absence
   (clipping treatment) and presence (control treatment) of grass over the
   2017/2018 rainfall season. Grass clipping changed grass species
   composition over this period, but grass clipping did not benefit shrubs.
   We found no competitive effect of grasses on shrubs. However, shrub
   canopy cover showed a strong linear response to soil moisture, as did
   canopy cover to temperature. Similarly, soil moisture and temperature
   were important for stem growth and shrub phenology. Patterns of shrub
   growth and phenology in response to summer and winter rainfall provide
   important insight for land managers for optimising production while
   enabling phenological processes that allow recruitment to take place.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 5},
Abstract = {The performance of rainfed-based Megathyrsus maximus (syn. Urochloa
   maxima and Panicum maximum) was investigated in the semi-arid pastures
   of Sudan. Split-plot complete design experiments with three replications
   were applied for two consecutive seasons (2020-2021). The treatments
   were two in situ rainwater harvesting systems {[}i.e. ridges plus
   terraces (RD) and terraces (TR)], three seeding rates (i.e. 1.5, 2.5 and
   3.5 kg ha(-1)) and two urea fertilisation rates {[}0 kg ha(-1)(Z) and 95
   kg ha(-1)(F)]. These treatments were compared to a control (a flat,
   unfertilised and zero-tillage plot). Hydrological, biological and
   chemical indicators were used in the assessment. The results showed that
   the adopted RWH improved semi-arid pastures, with the RD treatment
   providing the best results for sustaining biomass production, water use
   efficiency, nutritional quality and soil quality. The highest plant
   density (112 000 plants ha(-1)) was associated with the RD3.5 treatment.
   The FSR1.5-RD treatment resulted in the greatest plant length (63.5 cm)
   and number of leaves per plant (34.59), whilst the FSR3.5-RD resulted in
   both the highest fresh biomass (25.9 t ha(-1)) and dry biomass (6.3 t
   ha(-1)). The chemical compositions of M. maximus (i.e. crude protein,
   organic matter and nitrogen contents) were also substantially improved
   by fertilisation. The water use efficiency of M. maximus was plant-,
   management- and climate-dependent.},

Abstract = {We examined the changes in tropical forest diversity, structure and
   trait composition during primary succession after volcanic disturbance.
   Whilst many studies have examined early stages of succession, fewer have
   looked at a precisely dated older location: 200 years old in this
   instance. To do this, we established a 0.5 ha plot on the lower slopes
   of Gunung (Mount) Tambora (Sumbawa, Indonesia) in which we enumerated
   and identified all trees >= 10 cm dbh, determined their key traits and
   calculated forest above-ground biomass. Saplings (1.5-3.0 cm dbh) were
   enumerated in one quarter of this area. We recorded 214 stems >= 10 cm
   dbh within 21 taxa contributing to an above-ground biomass of 135 Mg
   ha(-1). Most trees had light wood and broad distributions suggestive of
   early successional traits, but leaves were generally small; most trees
   were insect pollinated and animal dispersed as expected at later stages
   of succession. Saplings were variable in their density and showed some
   floristic similarity with adult trees, but differences indicated the
   future trajectory of succession. Our floristic and structural data from
   the poorly studied drier forests of eastern Indonesia show that this
   200-year-old forest is still undergoing succession at a slow rate.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests play an important role in the storing of
   significant amounts of biomass and carbon. However, carbon storage in
   these forests is linked to biotic, edaphic and climatic factors as well
   as human interventions. The forest structure and carbon storage in
   relation to human interventions and soil properties were studied in
   tropical dry forest patches located in a transition region of the
   Similipal Biosphere Reserve, India. Random sampling of vegetation and
   soil was done in 30 plots of 50 x 20 m in size. A total of 41 adult tree
   species, 50 juvenile tree species and 28 climber species were recorded
   within the study area. The average carbon stock of the forest was 179.54
   +/- 9.56 Mg ha(-1), of which adult trees were the highest contributors
   (55\%) followed by soil organic carbon (36\%), woody climbers (6\%) and
   juvenile trees (3\%). There was a significant effect of lopping, cutting
   of trees and soil properties on forest structure and carbon stock. This
   study confirms that anthropogenic disturbances and edaphic factors play
   a significant role in the variation of carbon stocks of biomass and
   soils in the forest.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crust (BSC) is an essential part of arid and semiarid
   regions; however information concerning the spatial heterogeneity of the
   interactions between crust, plants and soil microbes is limited.
   Sampling was confined to an area either covered with Erica spp. shrubs
   interspaced by crust cover (Cladonia rangiformis) or uncovered by crust.
   Along a straight line of 100 cm from the base of the shrubs towards
   their periphery and at successive distances of 20 cm, soil samples were
   collected once. The biomass, the composition and the network of
   interactions among the members of the soil microbial communities as well
   as the activity of soil enzymes involved in the C, N and P cycle were
   estimated. Crust coverage exerted a significant allelopathic negative
   effect on soil microbial biomasses due to the leaching of lichen's
   antimicrobial substances. In contrast, the crust effect on enzyme
   activity was positive, probably due to the amelioration of soil abiotic
   conditions. The distance from the base of Erica spp. affected the total
   microbial and bacterial biomass, with lower values at the base of the
   shrubs. The composition of microbial communities between the different
   sampling points exhibited significant dissimilarities. Network analysis
   revealed that in uncrusted soils the most connected microbial network
   was at samples collected from a distance of > 60 cm (bare soils), while
   in crusted soils this was at samples collected at the base of shrubs. We
   concluded that microbial biomass showed limited response to spatial
   heterogeneity, while the composition and the topology of interactions
   among the microbial members reflected a heterogeneous soil environment
   existing on a small spatial scale in Mediterranean areas. The microbial
   community in bare soil appeared to be the most robust against future
   disturbances.},

Abstract = {The Arasbaran Protected Area of northern Iran encompasses 160,000 ha of
   deciduous, broad-leaved forest with 78,560 ha recently designated as a
   United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's
   (UNESCO) Biosphere Reserve. Our study objectives were to (1) quantify
   whether anthropogenic pressures measurably impacted the structural
   complexity of Arasbaran forests and (2) determine which structural
   complexity indices were most sensitive to anthropogenic pressures in
   Arasbaran forests. We identified and sampled three study sites with
   high, moderate, and low levels of anthropogenic pressures and used nine
   forest structural indices to develop structural complexity indices. High
   anthropogenic pressure resulted in aggregated tree distribution,
   uniformity in tree sizes, and less heterogeneous forest structure. The
   structural indices particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressure were
   diameter differentiation, height differentiation, Gini coefficient, and
   structural diversity. Structural complexity appears to be a useful
   method for quantifying the impacts of anthropogenic pressure on montane
   deciduous forests. Regular sampling of the diameter differentiation
   index, height differentiation index, Gini coefficient and structural
   diversity index should be integrated into conservation management plans
   for the Arasbaran Protected Area.},

Abstract = {Consumptive and non-consumptive interactions of predators and prey can
   have strong direct and indirect effects on primary producers, such as
   stream algae. Increasing water temperatures may alter these interactions
   and thus influence productivity in streams. For each of 3 temperature
   treatments ('ambient', +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C), we measured the
   amount of algal biomass removed by grazing mayflies from 91 mesocosms
   after a 24-hour test period under 3 grazing treatments: lethal
   predators, non-lethal predators, and no predators. At all temperatures,
   grazers reduced algal biomass (p < 0.01), and the presence of lethal
   predators effectively dampened mayfly consumption of algae (p < 0.01).
   However, differences in algal biomass between lethal and non-lethal
   predator treatments were not significant, indicating that predators had
   no indirect behaviorally mediated effects on grazer consumption. Grazer
   removal of algal biomass marginally increased with increasing
   temperature (p = 0.051). We analyzed video data for changes in grazer
   foraging and drift behavior. Mayflies increased drift in the presence of
   lethal predators (p < 0.01) but not non-lethal predators, and no
   behavioral changes were seen with temperature increases. Mesocosms can
   help elucidate possible future shifts in trophic interactions due to
   climate warming. Yet, we found no evidence of indirect stonefly predator
   effects on grazing mayflies under these warming scenarios.},

Abstract = {Elephant grass genotypes display a variety of morphological differences,
   influencing the nutritive value of the forage. This study evaluated the
   histological arrangements of the leaves and stems of different
   elephant-grass genotypes, two tall-sized (Elephant B and IRI-381) and
   two dwarfs (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37), during a two-year trial. The
   grasses were harvested at 60-day intervals for two years. Biometric
   analyses of the stems and leaves were performed based on histological
   measurements. An in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) assay of the
   forage was performed. Among the elephant grass genotypes, the lignified
   cells and vascular bundles of the stems had higher variation than the
   leaves. Tall-sized genotypes displayed more lignified tissues in stems
   than the dwarfs. The transversal area occupied by vascular bundles and
   lignified cells were higher in Elephant B (44 911 mu m(2) and 35 895 mu
   m(2)) (p < 0.05), compared to the dwarfs. Forage IVDMD was higher in
   leaves (699 g kg(-1) of dry matter {[}DM]) than in the stems (678 g
   kg(-1) of DM), considering all genotypes (p < 0.05). We did not observe
   any direct influence of genotype on forage digestibility, despite some
   differences in the histological arrangements.},

Abstract = {Exceptionally large areas burned in 2014 in central Northwest
   Territories (Canada), leading members of the Tlicho First Nation to
   characterize this year as `extreme'. Top-down climatic and bottom-up
   environmental drivers of fire behavior and areas burned in the boreal
   forest are relatively well understood, but not the drivers of extreme
   wildfire years (EWY). We investigated the temporal and spatial
   distributions of fire regime components (fire occurrence, size, cause,
   fire season length) on the Tlicho territory from 1965 to 2019. We used
   BioSIM and data from weather stations to interpolate mean weather
   conditions, fuel moisture content and fire-weather indices for each fire
   season, and we described the environmental characteristics of burned
   areas. We identified and characterized EWY, i.e., years exceeding the
   80th percentile of annual area burned for the study period. Temperature
   and fuel moisture were the main drivers of areas burned. Nine EWY
   occurred from 1965 to 2019, including 2014. Compared to non-EWY, EWY had
   significantly higher mean temperature (>14.7 degrees C) and exceeded
   threshold values of Drought Code (>514), Initial Spread Index (>7), and
   Fire Weather Index (>19). Our results will help limit the effects of EWY
   on human safety, health and Indigenous livelihoods and lifestyles.},

Abstract = {Himalayan ecosystems provide a unique opportunity to analyze the
   determinants of species richness across large elevation gradients.
   Understanding forest diversity and structure is fundamental to set
   conservation priorities. A quantitative assessment of tree species was
   conducted in Kashmir Himalayan forests to ascertain their composition,
   stand structure and distribution in 143 plots of 50 x 50 m(2).
   Altogether, 13 species were recorded, ranging from five in subalpine
   (SA) forests to 10 in mixed conifer (MC) forests. There was a
   compositional dissimilarity among forest types. Pinus wallichiana was
   the most important species in low-level blue pine (BP) forests, whereas
   Abies pindrow prevailed in mid-elevation MC and high-elevation SA
   forests. Pinaceae contributed around 98\% of stems and was the most
   speciose family, followed by Sapindaceae and Betulaceae. Stand density
   and basal area differed among forest types and were significantly
   correlated with elevation and slope. The tree diameter class
   distribution displayed an approximate reverse J-shaped pattern
   indicating the influence of disturbance. As the first two axes of the
   canonical correspondence analysis explained more than 93\% of the
   inertia in the species-environment relation, elevation and slope are the
   main drivers of species distribution. Information about these forest
   attributes could provide better ecological insights for sustainable
   forest management.},

Abstract = {We present the first-ever attempt to estimate the taxonomic diversity of
   climbing plants in India, following the recent APG IV classification. We
   used more than 100 published and unpublished sources spanning more than
   a century to compile the extensive list of climbers. Our study revealed
   that the climbing plants in India are phylogenetically diverse,
   representing 2624 species radiated across 585 genera and 104
   spermatophyte plant families. About two-thirds of the total climbers
   enumerated from the present study are lianas. Scramblers, in particular,
   are exclusively woody, unlike twiners and tendril climbers. The
   diversity of climbing mechanisms varied significantly across the 104
   climber families. We also present the revised list of global climbing
   plant families, adding significantly to the existing dataset. We found
   that the climber diversity data collected exclusively from the
   ecological inventories or the taxonomic records underestimated the
   actual climber diversity by a significant margin. We discuss some of the
   key constraints in developing a climber database and recommend a
   replicable model, integrating ecology and taxonomy-based enumerations
   for the most precise estimate of climber diversity within a defined
   geographical area. The baseline data generated through our research will
   find applications in many ecological, taxonomic, phylogenetic, and
   evolutionary studies on climbers.},

   semi-arid rangeland},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},

Month = {2022 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Large-scale bush encroachment within rangelands is of increasing concern
   for land users. The aggressive encroachment of the woody shrub Seriphium
   plumosum (L.) Thunb. (Asteraceae), previously known as Stoebe plumosa,
   has resulted in a reduction in productivity, causing large
   socio-economic challenges, such as loss of productive land. In this
   study, we evaluated the efficacy of four herbicides in combination with
   mechanical removal of S. plumosum. We measured shrub mortality, regrowth
   and examined the grass species richness and cover after the execution of
   the control methods. Furthermore, we compared the productivity of the
   paddock where S. plumosum had been controlled with a neighbouring
   unencroached paddock. Five months after herbicide application, the total
   mortality of all shrubs was recorded. Grass species richness and cover
   were higher when shrubs had been mechanically removed before herbicide
   application. Additionally, the use of the non-species- specific
   herbicide (tebuthiuron) resulted in lower species richness and cover,
   compared to application of a species- specific herbicide
   (metsulfuron-methyl). The productivity of the treated area increased in
   the year after application. Our results show that when controlling S.
   plumosum the manual removal of shrubs before applying herbicides can
   improve the regeneration of the grass layer. This combination of
   mechanical and chemical control is effective in combating S. plumosum
   encroachment and increases forage yields in semi-arid rangelands.},

   collate prehistoric sedimentary charcoal studies from southern African
   grassy biomes and bring them to the attention of practitioners. We
   discuss how long-term data contribute to fire ecology and ecosystem

Abstract = {Southern Africa is dominated by fire-prone arid and semi-arid landscapes
   that are expected to experience increased maximum temperatures, rainfall
   variation and frequency of extreme rainfall events in the future. These
   conditions will affect fire and vegetation dynamics, but feedback and
   interactions among fire, rainfall and woody cover limit our ability to
   predict future ecosystem changes. Moreover, human activities can also
   drive changes in these components and their interactions. There are few
   long-term datasets available to monitor these changes over ecologically
   relevant time-scales. Here the combined analysis of a rainfall proxy,
   developed from a baobab tree core (Adansonia digitata) and fire proxy,

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Intensification of anthropogenic activities in many lake catchments
   during the twentieth century led to increased autochthonous organic
   matter sedimentation and degradation of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions
   due to the intensification of heterotrophic processes. These processes
   can be amplified by the effect of climate warming on thermal
   stratification in lakes. This study aimed to assess how metabolic
   disruptions affect carbon sources and pathways in lake pelagic food
   webs, focusing on methanogenic carbon. The studied lakes showed strong
   seasonal variations of carbon source availability and transfers to
   pelagic food webs, characterized by increased methanogenic carbon
   transfers to Daphnia populations in winter. The magnitude of these
   winter transfers seems to largely depend on the amount of methane stored
   in the hypolimnion during the stratification period, and thus on the
   amount of methane released with autumnal turnover. Methane production,
   storage and transfer mechanisms partly depend on thermal stratification
   intensity, but also on external factors such as land use. This study
   provides new insights into the impacts of global changes on the sources
   and pathways of carbon in pelagic food webs through their influence on
   lake metabolism and thermal regimes. These functional changes may lead
   to greater production and release of greenhouse gases into the
   atmosphere.},

Abstract = {The Cozumel Curassow (Crax rubra griscomi) is a critically endangered
   endemic bird from Cozumel Island, Mexico. After it was believed to be
   extinct, it was rediscovered in 1994. Its population status was assessed
   in 1994-1995, and later in 2005, predicting a population decline over
   the next four decades. A new evaluation of its population size was
   carried out in 2017 and 2019. Some of the main factors that affect the
   population size of this cracid were identified with a generalized linear
   model. With a line transect sampling effort over 360 km, a population
   size of 499 +/- 172 individuals was estimated in the tropical
   semi-deciduous forest occurring in the island, which was slightly higher
   compared to previous population evaluations. The distance to water
   bodies was significantly associated with the population size of the
   Cozumel Curassow, as well as the abundance of some species of fauna and
   flora. By modeling various scenarios, population viability was assessed
   over a period of 100 years, predicting a relatively stable population
   size with great variability depending on scenarios. However, as
   estimated in previous studies, given its small population size and
   continued threats, the Cozumel Curassow continues to be endangered.},

Abstract = {Clear correlations between human and bird visual assessments of color
   have been documented, and are often assumed, despite fundamental
   differences in human and avian visual physiology and morphology.
   Analyses of plumage colors with avian perceptual models have shown
   widespread hidden inter-sexual and inter-specific color variation among
   passerines perceived as monochromatic to humans, highlighting the
   uncertainty of human vision to predict potentially relevant variation in
   color. Herein, we use reflectance data from 13 Larus gull species as an
   exemplar data set to study concordance between human vision and avian
   visual modeling of feather colors near, or below, the human threshold
   for discrimination. We found little evidence among gulls for sexual
   dichromatism hidden from human vision, but did find inter-specific color
   variation among gulls that is not seen by humans. Neither of these
   results were predictable a priori, and we reassert that reflectance
   measurements of actual feather colors, analyzed with avian relevant
   visual models, represent best practice when studying bird coloration.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The lichens Erioderma pedicellatum (Hue) P.M. Jorg. and Erioderma
   mollissimum (G. Sampaio) Du Rietz are endangered species in Canada. Both
   species are obligate epiphytes found in forested wetlands near the
   Atlantic Coast. They are thought to be primarily threatened by logging
   and acid pollution, but the influence of these factors has not been
   examined at large-extents or relative to other habitat features.
   Critical habitat for protection has remained difficult to define beyond
   observed occurrences, because of the low accuracy of existing habitat
   models. To facilitate improved recovery planning and understanding of
   their ecology in the province of Nova Scotia, we created high-resolution
   distribution models for both species, incorporating elements of climate,
   forest composition, hydrology, acid pollution, and anthropogenic
   influence using the MaxEnt algorithm and a backwards stepwise selection
   process. The most important predictors were related to rainfall or an
   oceanic moderation of thermal optima. Depth to water table and the
   presence of suitable forest composition were also included, as was
   distance from roads for E. pedicellatum. The putative threats, acid
   pollution and silvicultural treatment, were not important and therefore
   excluded from models. Although both species have highly specific habitat
   requirements, E. pedicellatum appears to be more sensitive to human
   activities.},

Title = {Lengthening of the growth season, not increased water availability,

Abstract = {On the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the growth of trees is strongly affected
   by climate change. Previous researchers have found that climate warming
   changes thermal and hydraulic conditions, lengthening the growing season
   and promoting tree growth. Some studies have analyzed the effects of
   drought, precipitation, and temperature on tree growth. However,
   previous studies have mainly focused on natural forests, with few
   studies on the response of plantations to climate change. Therefore, we
   studied the relationship between dendrochronology (basal area increment,
   BAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and climate factors
   to explore the response of Picea likiangensis var. rubescens plantations
   to climate change. The results showed that from 1990 to 2018, the
   temperature in the study area increased significantly; the rate of
   increase was 0.39 degrees per decade. Among the climate factors,
   self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) had the most
   significant impact on BAI. From P\_May (P\_represents the month of the
   previous year) to December, BAI was always negatively correlated with
   the scPDSI, with 9 months being significantly negatively correlated. BAI
   was significantly positively correlated with the minimum 2m temperature
   (TMN) in P\_July, P\_September, July, and September. BAI was
   significantly positively correlated with the maximum 2 m temperature
   (TMX) in P\_October, P\_December, and July. BAI was significantly
   positively correlated with the mean 2 m temperature (TMP) in P\_July,
   P\_December, and July. There is a significant positive correlation
   between BAI and annual NDVI (NDVIa), which means that NDVI can be used
   to study the response of plantations to climate change. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of the response of plantation
   growth in high-altitude areas to climate change, which is needed by
   forest managers.},

Abstract = {In this work, populations of adult and immature honeybees and their
   honey production are studied through mathematical and statistical
   modeling approaches. Those models are complementary and are presented in
   disjunct form. They were used to show different modeling methods for
   honey bee population dynamics. The statistical approach consisted of a
   generalized linear model using data from the Department of Agriculture
   of the United States of America (USDA), which showed that the
   relationship between the number of colonies and the rate of honey
   production is not constant in time but decrease over the years. These
   models showed that when a bee population is subjected to a stress factor
   (i.e., habitat destruction, Varroa mite, climate variability, season,
   neonicotinoids, among others), the abundance of individuals decreases
   over time as well as the honey produced by the colonies. Finally, the
   mathematical approach consisted of two models: (1) a smooth model, in
   which conditions of existence and stability of the equilibrium solutions
   are determined by an ecological threshold value, and (2) a non-smooth
   model where the mortality rate of bees is included as a function of the
   number of adult bees in the population.},

Abstract = {Contrast and aggregation are two components of spatial heterogeneity. To
   precisely determine the influence of varying nutrient heterogeneity on
   the foraging behavior of clonal plants, we selected Potentilla anserina
   L. as the material and designed different patch patterns, sizes and
   qualities. In Experiment 1, compared with random and uniform patch
   patterns, aggregation increased ramet density and biomass accumulation
   at the patch scale, but not at the plot scale. This implies that the
   adaptive responses of clonal plants to nutrient heterogeneity depend on
   spatial scale. We further designed three levels of patch size with the
   same fertilizer concentration at the patch scale in Experiment 2, and
   four levels of patch quality with the same total amount of fertilizer at
   the plot scale in Experiment 3. Increased ramet density and stolon
   growth rate within small patches in Experiment 2 demonstrated effects of
   heterogeneity on plant foraging responses at the patch scale, while no
   difference was found in Experiment 3. This means that the influence of
   patch size on ramet establishment and residence time was alleviated by
   patch contrast at larger spatial scales. Hence, spatial scale is a key
   factor determining the interactions between heterogeneous ecosystem
   components.},

Title = {Artificial perches increase bird-mediated seed rain in agricultural

Abstract = {One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in
   degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas
   without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to
   attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance
   seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of
   artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and
   composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien
   invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the
   bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used
   artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment
   (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at
   each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these
   and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside
   the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of
   focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total
   of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a
   significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial
   perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition
   increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An
   ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed
   communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive
   exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the
   third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from
   12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most
   represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures
   for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed
   species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly
   due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore,
   artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow
   area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of
   alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about
   overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the
   arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of
   birds in this process.},

Title = {The BIODESERT survey: assessing the impacts of grazing on the structure

Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is both the main land use across drylands
   worldwide and a major desertification and global change driver. The
   ecological consequences of this key human activity have been studied for
   decades, and there is a wealth of information on its impacts on
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, most field assessments of
   the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have
   been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single
   ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa
   (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT
   survey, the first systematic field survey devoted to evaluating the
   joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the
   structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This
   collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and
   has involved the collection of field data and plant, biocrust, and soil
   samples from a total of 326 45 m x 45 m plots from 98 sites located in
   25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major
   characteristics and the field protocols used in this survey. We also
   introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful
   to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of
   researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the
   current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of
   grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of
   the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our
   planet using much-needed field data.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effects of interspecific competition on genetic
   diversity will deepen our knowledge on species evolution. In the case of
   Calopteryx splendens and C virgo, sympatric damselfly species,
   interspecific interference competition by C. virgo has remarkable
   effects on territoriality of C. splendens resulting in reproductive
   character displacement. Since territoriality is correlated with
   phenotype and mating success. we investigated the effects of
   interspecific interference competition on genetic diversity of C.
   splendens populations. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms
   (AFLP), we determined the population genetic structure of 12 C. viendens
   populations and used the genetic diversity information to relate
   heterozygosity of C. splendens to abundance of C. virgo in sympatric
   populations. We found that heteroggosity of C. splendens males decreased
   with increasing abundance of C. virgo males. This result most likely
   reflects changes in effective population size due to interspecific
   interference competition and shows an effect on genetic structure in

Title = {Environmental DNA and metagenomics of terrestrial mammals as keystone
   taxa of recent and past ecosystems},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {538-553},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Terrestrial mammals shape their ecosystems, and mammalian community
   assemblages can be important indicators of ecosystem functioning and
   ecosystem changes over time. Numerous taxa of terrestrial mammals are
   currently threatened by habitat loss and face displacement to new
   geographical areas or systems to which they are less suited and where
   they may affect the original communities. Understanding past ecosystem
   changes is important for predicting future responses of species
   assemblages to changes in their environments. Thus, ecological and
   evolutionary history, as well as adaptive capacity, are important
   predictors of future population viability. Genomic and metagenomic
   approaches using environmental or ancient DNA offer a wealth of
   information regarding genome-wide variation of changing communities or
   of taxonomic groups over time, which may help explain past changes and
   predict future responses of communities to changes in their environment;
   however, to date, such studies are relatively scarce. We review studies
   on environmental DNA and environmental genomics of terrestrial mammals
   to assess the potential of such approaches regarding past, contemporary,
   and future terrestrial ecosystems, identify inherent challenges, and
   discuss potential applications. We elaborate on lessons to be learned
   from mammal genomics of past ecosystems and compare metabarcoding with
   general metagenetic and metagenomic techniques. We provide a
   comprehensive overview of current applications, challenges, and future
   potential of environmental DNA with regards to terrestrial mammals. As
   current major challenges regarding mammalian eDNA we identify its
   scarcity and patchy distribution, along with the persistent necessity of
   genomic reference data. While the latter are steadily increasing, the
   former can only be tackled by explicitly mapping the environment to gain
   understanding of spatial eDNA distribution. Such understanding may
   facilitate informed choices of sample sites and substrates and, together
   with new sequencing techniques, this can allow mammalian eDNA to be
   maximally exploited as a source of biodiversity data.},

Abstract = {Termite nests act as shelters for a wide variety of invertebrates. We
   studied the Corotocini termitophile fauna (Staphylinidae, Aleocharinae)
   in nine Nasutitermes corniger nests and nine N. ephratae nests to test
   the resource size (larger nests should host more social-parasite species
   than smaller ones) and resource concentration (nests occurring closer to
   each other should host a greater richness and variety of social
   parasites) hypotheses. In total, we found 358 Corotocini individuals.
   Regression analysis did not reveal a relationship between species
   richness or population size of termitophiles and nest volume. Thus, we
   rejected the resource size hypotheses as a driver of termitophile
   diversity. Neither did distance between nests explain the richness of
   their fauna; thus, the resource concentration hypothesis was also
   rejected. In conclusion, we suggest that biological aspects, such as
   dispersal dynamics and species traits likely explain the diversity of
   termitophiles.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the morphology, genetics and distribution of
   the members of the Merodon chalybeus subgroup (M. aureus species group):
   M chalybeus Wiede-mann in Meigen, 1822, M. minutus Strobl, 1893 and M.
   robustus Veselic, Vujic \& Radenkovic, 2017. Two of the species, M.
   chalybeus and M. minutus. are morphologically very similar and often
   misidentified in the literature. Here, by employing an integrative
   taxonomic approach we provide strong evidence for the separation of M.
   chalybeus and M. minutus. Our results show their clear allopatric
   distribution: M. minutus on the Balkan Peninsula, Sicily, Sardinia and
   Corsica, while M. chalybeus is a western Mediterranean species
   distributed on the Iberian Peninsula and northwest Africa. Data on the
   distribution of M. robustus were updated, with new records from Cyprus,
   Israel and Turkey, besides its type locality (Samos in Greece). We
   provide evidence for M. chalybeus and M. minutus representing a species
   complex, named the M. chalybeus complex, which together with M. robustus
   constitute the M. chalybeus subgroup.},

Abstract = {We conducted a nonlethal feeding experiment to measure diet/hair and
   diet/faeces trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) in two rodent species
   fed two diet types. The mean TDFs between diet and hair (expressed as
   delta C-13/delta N-15) were 2.14 parts per thousand/3.44 parts per
   thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 2.65 parts per thousand/3.25
   parts per thousand for fodder with 30\% animal (insect) matter in
   yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and 1.66 parts per
   thousand/4.67 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 1.94
   parts per thousand/4.49 parts per thousand for fodder with 30\% animal
   (insect) matter in bank voles (Myodes glareolus). As compared with the
   diet, faeces were depleted in C-13 by about 0.75 parts per thousand and
   enriched in N-15 by about 2 parts per thousand. All bank voles and only
   half of yellow-necked mice had regrown hair at the end of the study (day
   95). We analysed archived skins of those species and confirmed, that
   moult in bank voles is more intensive. Our results can be used for
   trophic studies of temperate-forest rodents and for meta-analyses on

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effects of landscape differences
   associated with intensive agricultural activities on farmland use by
   medium and large mammals in Japan. We compared the species diversity of
   mammals that used farmland within three regions with different
   agricultural activity levels, and analyzed the relationship between the
   occurrences and escape responses of mammals in the farmland and
   surrounding landscape. We used spotlight count in intensive (high
   agricultural activity), intermediate (moderate agricultural activity),
   and non-intensive (low agricultural activity) areas. We observed 271 and
   199 occurrences of mammals in spring and autumn 2021, respectively.
   Seasonal changes in mammals occurrence were due to a decrease in the
   number of raccoon dogs observed. Species richness tended to be lower in
   intensive agricultural areas than in other areas, suggesting that
   intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affect the community
   structure of medium and large mammals. Generalized additive models
   showed that the effects of the surrounding landscape on the occurrences
   and escape responses of raccoon dogs, red foxes, and cats differed among
   species. Only raccoon dogs were negatively affected by the surrounding
   farmland, suggesting high sensitivity to agricultural activities. Our
   results have important implications for the management of ecosystems in
   Japanese agricultural areas.},

Title = {Lessons from comparative primatology for understanding trait covariation

Abstract = {Given the position of humans in the tree of life, comparative research
   on non-human primates has attracted the interest of researchers in
   biology, medical sciences, anthropology, psychology, and sociology.
   Covariation of species' phenotypes has been of particular interest.
   Learning from the historical development of comparative research with
   primates should thus be particularly valuable for evolutionary ecology
   and to improve understanding of phenotypic integration and diversity.
   Such learning would also help identify knowledge gaps, disputed
   questions, and new avenues of both basic and applied research in
   relation to the evolution of primate features and the conservation of
   our close relatives. We conducted a historical assessment through a
   non-systematic review and a systematic review, focusing on how the
   integration of different research lines in evolutionary ecology focused
   on primate phenotypic covariation unfolded throughout the 20th Century.
   The non-systematic review allowed us to reconstruct the history of the
   discipline from its earliest origins, when bibliometric assessments were
   more limited in scope, and to identify the most appropriate keywords for
   the systematic review. We employed a standard protocol for the
   systematic review, applying two complementary analyses: co-occurrence of
   keywords and bibliographic coupling of references. These analyses
   described the development of the conceptual and intellectual structures
   of comparative primatology from 1966 to 2020. By identifying the most
   influential researchers and concept interrelations, we highlight primate
   phenotypes critical for the development of the discipline (in
   particular, brain and body sizes and behavioural patterns), showcasing
   the reach of these investigations for evolutionary ecology. Overall, our
   findings emphasise the crucial role that comparative primatology has
   played in developing the study of phenotypic integration and the very
   onset of phylogenetic comparative methods.},

Title = {Testing for changes in rate of evolution and position of the climatic
   niche of clades},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {573-583},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is solid recognition that phylogenetic effects must be
   acknowledged to appreciate climatic niche variability among species
   clades properly. Yet, most currently available methods either work at
   the intra-specific level (hence they ignore phylogeny) or rely on the
   Brownian motion model of evolution to estimate phylogenetic effects on
   climatic niche variation. The Brownian motion model may be inappropriate
   to describe niche evolution in several cases, and even a significant
   phylogenetic signal in climatic variables does not indicate that the
   effect of shared ancestry was relevant to niche evolution. We introduce
   a new phylogenetic comparative method which describes significant
   changes in the width and position of the climatic niche at the
   inter-specific (clade) level, while making no a priori assumption about
   how niche evolution took place. We devised the R function
   phylo.niche.shift to estimate whether the climatic niches of individual
   clades in the tree are either wider or narrower than expected, and
   whether the niche occupies unexpected climates. We tested
   phylo.niche.shift on realistic virtual species' distribution patterns
   applied to a phylogeny of 365 extant primate species. We demonstrate via
   simulations that the new method is fast and accurate under widely
   different climatic niche evolution scenarios. phylo.niche.shift showed
   that the capuchin monkeys and langurs occupy much wider, and prosimian
   much narrower, climatic niche space than expected by their phylogenetic
   positions. phylo.niche.shift may help to improve research on niche
   evolution by allowing researchers to test specific hypotheses on the
   factors affecting clades' realised niche width and position, and the
   potential effects of climate change on species' distributions.},

Abstract = {Aim. To identify the distribution features of a key species of
   macrophytobenthos in the shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Material
   and Methods. The field materials from a comprehensive expedition carried
   out during the summer 2019 were collected and processed by the authors.
   Results. For the first time, a map was compiled and the features of the
   distribution of dominant types of macrophytobentos identified in the
   shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Conclusion. It was shown that in
   the eastern part of the bay, on a shallow slope composed of silty-sandy
   deposits, adjacent to the accumulative shores, sea grasses dominate and
   along the abrasive-clay shores there is no bottom vegetation and
   significant accumulations of dead leaves of Zostera marina i Z. noltei
   are typical there. In the water area of the Bakal spit macrophitobentos
   is not found on the sandy deposits. Cladophora spp. are represented in
   the base of the western branch of the spit, at the place of its joining
   an active clayey cliff. Mosaic distribution of bottom vegetation is
   noted in the area of Cape Kamenniy, where co-growth of algae on the
   limestone outcrops and marine herbs living on loose soils is registered.
   West of Cape Kamenniy in shallow water adjacent to the abrasive
   limestone coasts Carpodesmia crinite - Treptacantha barbata phytocenoses
   are characteristic. It was shown that in the composition of
   macrophytobentos decreased in the role of dominant species, an increase
   in the proportion of algae found in the areas with increased
   eutrophication of marine environment, which is probably due to the
   influence of anthropogenic and natural factors. Monitoring observations
   in this area will make it possible to develop scientifically based
   recommendations aimed at optimizing the environmental regime and
   rational environmental management of the coastal zone of Karkinitskiy
   Bay.},

Abstract = {We studied the formation of ant communities on rock dumps at coal mine
   dump sites of different ages and in natural environments in southwestern

   was determined using pitfall traps. Soil pH, turf extent, and vegetation
   cover were measured and their effects on the formation of ant
   communities were evaluated. Our results revealed that ants' density and
   species diversity increased with progressing recovery of the dumps. In
   the first succession phase, the soil at the dumps was alkaline and sites
   were inhabited primarily by Tetramorium caespitum. The density and the
   number of Myrmica sp. and Formica sp. nests increased with here was an
   increase in with increasing soil acidity. Lasius sp. ants were the first
   to form significant clusters of nests and to become numerically dominant

Pages = {313-318},

Abstract = {Pollinator species have seen recent declines in abundance, generating
   conservation concern as well as alarm about the ecosystem services they
   provide. A common approach to alleviate pollinator decline is through
   habitat management, including restoration of degraded habitats and
   removal of invasive species, but apparent habitat improvement does not
   necessarily mean an improvement in pollinator abundance and diversity.
   We collected pollinators in colored pan traps at three sites at the
   Lacamas Prairie Natural Area, Washington: remnant wet prairie, restored
   wet prairie, and an area invaded by reed canary grass (Phalaris
   arundinacea). We used model selection to assess whether site and trap
   color explained variation in pollinator abundance, richness, and
   diversity. Pollinator abundance was similar at the native and restored
   sites with predicted averages of 9.06 (7.15, 11.48) and 9.51 (7.52,
   12.03), respectively while a heavily invaded reed canary grass site had
   a significantly lower predicted mean of 7.26 (5.69, 9.26). Site was not
   included in the top model for species richness or diversity. All three
   measures varied with trap color. Habitat restoration and invasive
   species control at Lacamas Prairie appear to have benefited local
   pollinator populations, but evidence for differences in pollinator
   richness and diversity was weak. Further work, both characterizing the
   response of pollinator communities to wet prairie restoration and
   optimizing trap colors for monitoring in this area, is warranted.},

Abstract = {Aim. Reveal the distribution of cadmium in the components of the
   ecosystem of the Caspian Sea.
   Materials and Methods. The sampling was carried out according to
   generally accepted methods, the determination of heavy metals was
   carried out by the method of atomic absorption spectroscopy using an
   atomic absorption spectrometer with electrothermal atomization MGA-915
   MD.
   Results. As a result of the studies carried out, it was found that the
   bottom sediments of the Middle Caspian were distinguished by a greater
   accumulation of cadmium than the North Caspian. Invertebrates of the
   Caspian Sea accumulate cadmium from water and soil, with the exception
   of shrimp, for which water is the only source of metal. Among the
   taxonomic groups of organisms studied, molluscs of the genus Didacna are
   cadmium accumulators. In the body of the Russian and Persian sturgeons,
   cadmium is mainly accumulated in the kidneys.
   Conclusion. Coefficients of cadmium accumulation in the organs and
   tissues of Russian and Persian sturgeons, black-backed herring and
   Dolginsky herring relative to their food objects indicate that cadmium
   is able to accumulate in food chains.},

Abstract = {Reoccupation of European landscapes by native species causes changes in
   their population densities and home ranges. To test whether an increase
   in population density affects home range sins, we studied the strictly
   territorial herbivore Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). Twenty-four
   beavers were radio-tracked to reveal their home ranges under varying
   population densities. The mean length of occupied shorelines was 2648.0
   +/- 1530.6 m. We did not find any linkage between home range sizes and
   population densities. Our results showed that the availability of
   resources was significantly associated with the duration of site
   occupation. Thus, the space use was primarily determined by the
   availability of food resources, rather than by rising population
   density.},

Title = {Comprehensive disaster damage management planning and the safety of

   aspects)},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {200-207},
Abstract = {Aim. The author aims to draw attention to the urgent need to accelerate
   the development of the scientific, technical and organizational basis
   for solving a global economic problem: reducing damage from natural
   disasters and, in this context, the issue of security and legal
   regulation of the use of geophysical technologies for active protection
   against them.
   Discussion. The thirty-year universal campaign conducted by the UN and
   consisting of special events, did not at any stage bring about the
   repeatedly planned significant reduction in the number of human victims
   and the amount of material damage. Its prolonged failure proves that the
   expected result cannot be obtained due to the attracted potential. In
   addition, it makes us critically evaluate the chosen means of
   implementing programmes and look for new ways to increase the
   effectiveness of the fight against the threat. In the natural sciences,
   the most promising prospect is methods that are being mastered in many
   developed countries and focused on a targeted influence on the
   destructive natural process. In this area, large-scale scientific work
   has been carried out for a long time and already productively to
   increase the capabilities and scope of the modifying effect. However,
   serious problems arise on the path; they have been caused by
   insufficient knowledge of the changing natural phenomena, military and
   environmental aspects of these technologies, low predictability of the
   long-term consequences of their use, conflicts between economic
   interests of different states. From a humanitarian point of view, the
   scale and dynamics of the adverse natural trend require a more radical
   and operational response than the implementation of methodological
   recommendations of a single plan for the widespread dissemination of a
   safety culture. The form of a collective solution adequate to the
   importance and significance of the universal task is a global disaster
   risk management which has a developed institutional base and a solid
   executive discipline. But it is absent today.
   Conclusion. It is impossible to overcome the indicated obstacles for
   raising efficiency except by relying on a special regulatory platform of
   a universal level, which, however, today consists almost entirely of
   declarative decisions. Here it is necessary to increase the
   imperativeness of regulation, giving it legal force which is capable of
   more than recommendatory one to ensure by 2030 a previously unattainable
   substantial reduction in losses. It is also necessary to move to binding
   specific measures and technical standards agreed upon and guaranteed by
   legal instruments. To what extent the special system of international
   security created on such a basis will satisfy national interests in the
   future, depends very much on the degree of state participation in this
   construction today.},

Title = {A Comparison of Mechanical versus Chemical Control of the Invasive
   Species Myrtle Spurge ( Euphorbia myrsinites)},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {120-123},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Myrtle spurge (Euphorbia myrsinites) is an invasive plant in North
   America that was introduced from Eurasia as a drought-tolerant
   ornamental. It has escaped cultivation and is widespread in western
   North America. Infestations can be reduced by either mechanical or
   chemical means, but the two approaches have not been compared directly.
   One study recommended mechanical treatment in the spring and chemical
   treatment in the fall, but neither recommendation was supported by data.
   To test the effectiveness of mechanical versus chemical treatment in the
   fall, we located six sites in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains in
   Utah that were uniformly infested with myrtle spurge. At each of the
   sites we randomly assigned a 2.25 m(2) quadrat to one of three
   treatments (i.e., mechanical, chemical, or control). The mechanical
   treatment entailed hand pulling and the chemical treatment involved
   applying the herbicide Roundup to each myrtle spurge. The controls were
   unmanipulated. We photographed each quadrat pre-treatment and one year
   post-treatment. Both mechanical and chemical approaches significantly
   reduced the percent cover and stalk count of myrtle spurge compared to
   the controls. Additionally, the effects of the two treatments did not
   differ from each other. These results indicate that land managers can
   control myrtle spurge in the fall with either treatment and do not have
   to wait until the spring to employ mechanical methods. Mechanical
   removal of myrtle spurge is better suited to events that involve members
   of the general public such as ``Purge Your Spurge{''} activities because
   they reduce the public's exposure to herbicide.},

Abstract = {Structured demographic models can be valuable for assessing the status
   of at-risk plant species and for guiding efforts to protect and manage
   them, but they may be infrequently employed in assessments of species of
   conservation concern because they require data that are not often
   available to those charged with management. We constructed and analyzed
   matrix projection models for three populations of the threatened
   perennial plant species Euphorbia telephioides to reevaluate a prior
   assessment of stable status and to compare the conclusions of models
   based on different amounts of data. In contrast to the prior assessment,
   all of our models predicted population decline for all three
   populations. Projected growth rates were similar for models based on
   sparse sampling and those based on a larger more representative sample
   of individuals, but the models supported contrasting patterns of the
   sensitivity of population growth rate to individual demographic
   transitions. Models based on more complete data supported greater
   elasticity of growth rate to the demographic fates of small
   non-flowering plants, which had among the lowest elasticity values for
   models based on more sparse data. We conclude that even models based on
   limited data can be useful to species status assessments, but that more
   complete data may be necessary to identify targets for effective
   management.},

Abstract = {Aim. To study the influence of weather conditions on the formation of
   the spring barley crop under prevailing climatic changes.
   Material and Methods. The object of research was varieties and lines of
   spring barley of the FITZ Nemchinovka selection, which were studied
   annually in 2001-2020 in a competitive test in the conditions of the
   Moscow region. According to the meteorological data for the FITZ
   Nemchinovka, the average monthly indicators of precipitation, air
   temperature and GTCM were calculated. Mathematical processing of yield
   data was undertaken on a computer using the Excel programme.
   Results. A significant increase in the average monthly air temperature
   during the spring-summer season, an increase in the amount of
   precipitation in May and a decrease in other months of the growing
   season indicate a change in the climatic conditions of the region. In
   favorable years, with a GTCM value from 1.32 to 2.34, the average yield
   of barley was 5.88 t/ha and in dry years with GTCM values from 0.48 to
   1.26 - 3.28 t/ha. in the spring-summer period, there was a relatively
   stable variability in yield from the dynamics of precipitation and GTCM
   (r= 0.346...0.572). The negative correlation dependence of the yield of
   varieties on the average monthly air temperature throughout the season
   had a relatively unstable character and manifested itself as very weak
   or medium (r=-0.021...-0.372).
   Conclusion. The positive yield trend observed in the conditions of the
   Moscow region with the annual use of the same agricultural machinery is
   due to an increase in the adaptive potential of new varieties and
   breeding lines of FITZ Nemchinovka.},

Pages = {42-51},
Abstract = {Aim. Study of the growth dynamics of Dianthus awaricus plants in field
   experimental conditions and of laboratory germination of seeds obtained
   in the introduction experiment.Material and Methods. Samples of D.
   awaricus seeds collected in natural populations along the altitudinal
   ecocline from 820 to 1,720 m above sea level served as the material for
   the study. To study the field germination and growth dynamics of the
   plants, D. awaricus seeds were sown at two experimental bases of the
   Mountain Botanical Garden (at 1,100 and 1,750 m above sea level).
   Evaluation of laboratory germination was carried out using seeds
   collected at the Tsudakhar base.Results. Comparative characteristics of
   the average values of the shoot length and the number of lateral
   branches of the studied samples showed that the differences between the
   populations are significant. The monthly increase in D. awaricus plants
   of different accessions also differs. Monthly variability of the shoot
   length of D. awaricus in the tested accessions is at a high level, the
   expressivity of which, apparently, is significantly affected by a
   complex of environmental factors. A study of the germination of D.
   awaricus seeds showed that it is higher under laboratory conditions than
   under experimental field conditions. The highest percentage of seed
   germination was observed in the ``Gunib{''} sample: 64.0\% in the
   laboratory and 28.6\% in the field at the Tsudakhar base.Conclusions.
   Differences were noted in growth dynamics in the studied samples of D.
   awaricus studied, apparently due to a complex of abiotic and biotic
   environmental factors. For the ``Tsudakhar{''} samples the experimental
   conditions and place of collection of seed material were identical but
   for the other two samples they were different from their natural
   habitat. The low field germination of D. awaricus seeds is probably due
   to the negative impact of winter drought and adverse weather conditions
   in the spring.},

Title = {Environmentally friendly protection of tea plantations in the south of
   Russia},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {27-36},
Abstract = {Aim. Environmentally safe protection of tea plantations in southern
   Russia during the revival of a previously prosperous industry and
   development of a strategy for the development of biological protection
   of tea growing in the long term which requires the integration of
   science and production.
   Material and Methods. Pest contamination of the plantation was detected
   during phytosanitary surveys. The number of individual pests per unit
   area is calculated according to the Shapiro method. Studies of the
   effectiveness of the Australian ladybird beetle cryptolemus
   (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Muls.) in relation to tea pulvinaria were
   carried out on tea plantations in the Lazarevsky district of Sochi.
   Result. Justifications are given for the need to provide scientific
   support during work on farmland when developing environmentally safe
   protection of tea from pests and diseases. The results of surveys of tea
   plantations of the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory on the
   identification of the most dangerous pests for the yield of plantations
   together with the study of the effectiveness of cryptolemus in relation
   to tea pulvinaria (cottony camellia scale) in tea culture are given. As
   a result of the studies, the methodology, norms and multiplicity of the
   release of the cryptolaemus predator (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Muls.)
   were worked out, both in the larval and imago stages, with heavily
   infested tea plants. The research was carried using the material and
   technical facilities of the unique scientific installation, State
   Collection of Living entomoacariphages and entomopathogens.
   Conclusion. The revival of tea plantations involves a set of measures
   aimed at increasing productivity: improving the system of cutting bushes
   and methods of collecting leaf, repairing, irrigating and fertilizing
   and mechanizing work on plantations. The use of environmentally friendly
   methods of protection against the most harmful objects allows the
   obtaining of tea raw materials of the highest quality.},

Title = {Specific features of antagonism of Bacillus bacteria against toxinogenic
   Fusarium fungi in protecting plants against disease and contamination
   with mycotoxins (review)},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {86-103},
Abstract = {Aim. Summarize and analyze information on the results of studies on the
   antagonistic properties of Bacillus bacteria against phytopathogenic
   fungi of the genus Fusarium.
   Materials and Methods. Current information of research by Russian and
   foreign scientists on the role of bacteria of the genus Bacillus to
   suppress Fusarium diseases of plants and contamination of plant products
   with mycotoxins was studied and critically analysed.
   Results. Information on the prospects for the use of
   bacteria-antagonists of phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Bacillus for
   plant protection against diseases caused by toxinogenic fungi of the
   genus Fusarium has been generalized. The role of lipopeptides produced
   by bacteria in inhibiting the growth of fungi, which manifests itself
   both through the destruction of the cell wall of the fungus and by
   increasing the immune status of the plant, has been shown. The study
   contains information on the structure and mechanism of action of the
   main anti-fungal cyclic lipopetides. The features of the manifestation
   of the antagonistic properties of Bacillus bacteria, which consist in
   the ability of bacterial metabolites to destroy mycotoxins which can
   help to reduce their toxicity, have been disclosed. The prospect of
   searching for bacterial strains of the genus Bacillus suitable for
   creating effective biofungicides against Fusarium fungi is
   substantiated.
   Conclusion. Knowledge of the mechanisms of action of bacteria of the
   genus Bacillus as antagonists of Fusarium fungi will contribute to the
   careful selection of strains that are promising for the development of
   effective biological products for replacing chemical fungicides with
   biofungicides in the control of F. graminearum and its mycotoxins, which
   will make it possible to obtain products that are not burdened with
   either chemical means of protection or mycotoxins which are dangerous
   for consumers.},

Abstract = {Temperate-climate insects vary in overwintering life stages even within
   local communities, but factors driving this variation are not well
   understood. We studied the density and overwintering stages of insects
   in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and generated a
   phylogenetic tree of the insects based on DNA barcoding. The total
   number of studied individuals (of all four stages) was 2211; they
   belonged to 88 species, 36 families and 6 orders. Insect overwintering
   stages were phylogenetically conserved across species, primarily because
   particular stages dominated in related orders or families. In addition,
   immobile egg and pupal stages were common in the topsoil layer, whereas
   larvae and adults occurred generally in the top and deep soil layers;
   and larvae were often larger in the lower than in the upper soil layers.
   Thus, the stages of overwintering insects are evolutionally conserved
   despite their associations with physical parameters (e.g., soil
   temperature) or species traits (e.g., body size).},

Abstract = {Aim. In vitro analysis of the inhibitory activity of aqueous extracts of
   ready-made tea compositions and their constituent ingredients on
   SARS-COV-2 replication.Material and Methods. The laboratory strain
   SARS-CoV-2/human/RUS/Nsk-FRCFTM-1/2020 was passivated on Vero cell
   culture. For the preparation of water extracts six types of experimental
   tea compositions (not containing flavorings) based on black and green
   tea or flowers of hibiscus as well as individual ingredients were used.
   Antiviral (inhibitory) activity of plant raw materials was studied in
   vitro according to the classical scheme of neutralization (inactivation)
   of the virus.Results. When compared with the main control sample of an
   aqueous extract of chaga (Inonotus obliquus) with a 50\% effective
   concentration equal to 13.72 +/- 2.99 mu g/ml against 103 TCPD50/ml of
   SARS-CoV-2, superior activity was found for extracts of the spice
   Syzygium aromaticum L. and black tea from Nepal. Approximately equal
   inhibitory activity was detected for extracts of tea compositions based
   on black tea with the addition of the grass Thymus altaicus and the
   spice S. aromaticum L. or with the addition of seeds of Carum carvi L.
   and the root of Angelica archangelica L. In addition, such activity was
   detected for extracts of tea compositions based on green tea from China
   with the addition of leaves of Mentha piperita L. and flowers of
   Lavandula angustifolia MILL. or with the addition of the peel of Citrus
   sinensis L. and seeds of Pimpinella anisum L. Extracts from individual
   plant raw materials used to make tea compositions were black teas from
   India, Argentina, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, leaves of M. piperita L. and
   flowers of L. angustifolia MILL. Cetraria islandica lichen, green tea
   and berries of Oxycoccus also showed antiviral activity.Conclusion. The
   results obtained suggest that tea compositions based on black and green
   tea with the addition of various plant raw materials in the form of a
   regular drink can be useful to people with COVID-19 infection.},

Title = {The Common Hamster Cricetus cricetus L., 1758 in Western Siberia: the

Abstract = {Aim. To analyse the data on spreading and population of the common
   hamster in Western Siberia from the mid-20th to early 21st centuries and
   to determine the major predictors affecting these parameters.Material
   and Methods. Long-term data on species' population from the Zoomonitor
   Databank (Institute of Systematics and Ecology of Animals of the
   Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, ISEA SB RAS),
   populace survey data and field observations provided by scholars over
   recent years were used. The maximum entropy method was used to model the
   species' ecological niche and range based on 82 common hamster sighting
   spots in Western Siberia. 19 bioclimatic factors as well as various soil
   types were used.Results. The reduction of range and threefold decrease
   of common hamster population until the 90s of the last century and a
   local increase in the number of the population at the beginning of the
   21st century were noted. The main causes of the population decline
   include extensive extermination through the procurement of common
   hamster fur skins and limiting the harm caused as well as agricultural
   area size dynamics. The bioclimatic correlations revealed of the
   distribution of the common hamster, considered together with models of
   climate changes, suggest the possibility of common hamster obsolescence
   in modern steppe areas and its according repopulation of the large river
   bottomlands to the north of the current range.Conclusion. For the Asian
   section of its range, the species' status is not so disastrous due to
   less prominent factors negatively impacting the population. The lack of
   previous studies of the species' ecology in Western Siberia calls for
   the conducting of multi-aspect studies, including monitoring the
   tendencies of the limiting factors' dynamics.},

Title = {Soil processes in sandy podzols under conditions of variations in
   climatic parameters of the forest steppe of the Central Russian province},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-90},
Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research was to identify the influence of the
   climate factor on the soil processes in sandy podzols in the forest
   steppe of the Central Russian province.
   Material and Methods. Traditional methods (soil survey method, profile
   method, microbiological methods, etc.) and the latest methods (direct
   measurements {[}in situ] of soil CO2 emission) of investigation were
   used.
   Results. It has been established that soil formation processes in azonal
   Al-Fe-humus sandy soils are reflexive to variations in climatic
   parameters of the forest steppe zone. In warmer and arid conditions of
   the forest-steppe (southern part), sandy sod-podzols are formed, in
   colder and humid conditions of the forest-steppe (northern part) - sandy
   podzols. The soddy-podzols of the southern part of the foreststeppe can
   be characterized by a more humour soil profile, the content of which is
   19.2\% higher than in the sandy podzols. More over sodpodzols have
   greater availability of mineral nutrition elements for plants and a
   higher microbiological activity (the number of bacteria is 12.7 times
   higher, micromycetes - 10.5 times, actinomycetes - 4.5 times) than sandy
   podzols. In summer, the rate of CO2 emission in Al-Fe-humus sandy soils
   in the northern part of the forest-steppe zone reached 9.1 g CO2
   m(2)/day, in the southern part - 12.5 g CO2 m(2)/day.
   Conclusion. Further climate changes, which have an arid trend in the
   forest-steppe zone, can possibly lead to transformation of sandy podzols
   into sandy sod-podzols.},

Abstract = {Aim. Assessment of modern climatic and corresponding cartographic
   changes in the territory of the North Caucasus for its effective use.
   Methods. Assessment of the impact of climatic changes and their
   consequences from the point of view of the conditions of heat and
   moisture availability of the growing season on the biological
   productivity of the region, and on this basis the creation of maps of
   the dynamics of agro-climatic conditions.
   Results. The areas of territories with different humidity conditions
   vary quite significantly over time. Thus, the dry zone of the North
   Caucasus can almost completely disappear in some years, while other
   humidity zones are much more stable. The territories where the most arid
   conditions can be observed have the minimum area for the entire period
   of time under consideration. Recent changes have led to a reduction in
   forest-steppe conditions due to an increase in the area of steppe and
   dry steppe, which can also be attributed to an improvement in climatic
   conditions for the production of grain crops.
   Conclusion. Our research has shown that the territory of the North
   Caucasus is characterized by a rather significant variability in the
   conditions of heat and moisture supply during the active vegetation
   period, which leads to the fact that steppe conditions began to prevail
   in most of the Western and Central Caucasus, and this favors an increase
   in grain yields.},

Abstract = {To forage optimally, deer select individual plants highest in limiting
   nutrients, while avoiding individuals that are high in anti-herbivore
   defenses. For some woody species, deer may selectively browse on larger
   stems, which can provide a larger amount of younger, more nutritious
   tissue per individual. However, in some species, larger stems may
   possess increased levels of anti-herbivore defenses, ultimately
   discouraging deer from browsing on these larger individuals. We examined
   differences in the proportion of twigs and stems (individual
   seedlings/saplings/trees) browsed across three height classes for four
   species: blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata Michx,), white ash (F.
   americana L.), sassafras (Sassafras albidium Nutt.), and sugar maple
   (Acer saccharum L.), across multiple sites in central Indiana. Overall,
   we found that taller stems had a higher likelihood of being browsed, but
   smaller stems were browsed more heavily. We also found that sugar maple
   twigs and stems were most likely to be browsed, while sassafras twigs
   and white ash twigs and stems were least likely to be browsed. Our
   results indicate that under intense browsing pressure, preference should
   be given to smaller stems for protection, and that stands with greater
   vertical stratification of palatable species are more resilient to the
   effects of deer browsing.},

Abstract = {Aim. To refine the LWR coefficients for the Baikal omul Coregonus
   migratorius (Georgi, 1775).
   Material and Methods. The data set (number of fish, standard length
   (SL), weight (W), sex and morpho-ecological group (MEG) for the study of
   the LWR coefficients were taken from the Baikal Omul database. The
   analysis includes data from 3,091 specimens of Baikal omul, collected in
   May to June 2003, 2006 and 2007 and in September 2004 in the area
   adjacent to the delta of the Selenga River. The construction of
   regression models of LWR was carried out for all data without taking
   into account gender and MEG. In addition, regression models of LWR data
   were obtained, grouped by gender and belonging to a certain MEG.
   Results. Dependencies with close values of the coefficients of the power
   function are obtained. There were no significant differences between
   fish of different sexes and MEG, the coefficients differing at the level
   of statistical error. It is shown that the LWR in fish during feeding
   periods of different years is quite stable.
   Conclusion. We offer the equation W=10.9(L-dm)(3.02) that has acceptable
   coefficients for C. migratorius resource estimations during feeding
   period without carrying out controlled fishing.},

Abstract = {Aim. Analysis of new data on populations of invasive ctenopfores Beroe
   ovata and Mnemiopsis leidyi in the Caspian Sea and assessment of
   adaptation of B. ovata to new habitat conditions.
   Material and methods. The data was obtained in the Dagestan sector of
   the Middle Caspian Sea in September-November 2021. Ctenophores and
   zooplankton were collected by a big cone plankton net (BC) with a 0.5
   m(2) opening and a Juday plankton net (0.1 m(2) opening). Small
   ctenophores, eggs and zooplankton content were determined in samples
   fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4\%.
   Results. In September-October 2021, the Beroe ovata were detected in the
   shelf waters of Dagestan. The total number of ctenophores reached 32
   ind/m(2), biomass - 10 g/m(2). Individuals up to 35 mm in size were
   recorded. The abundance of M. leidyi in areas where B. ovata was found
   3-10 times less often than in areas where it was absent. The habitat of
   Beroe ovata was limited to the southern part of the Dagestan shelf and a
   salinity range of 7.1-5.5 psu.
   Conclusion. In 2021, new data was obtained on the Beroe ovata in the
   Caspian Sea. The detection of B. ovata in the Caspian Sea in 2021
   indicates that the ctenophore overcame winter conditions of the Caspian
   Sea. The fact determines the further evolution of the Caspian Sea
   ecosystem. The parameters of the impact of the new alien on the
   population of M. leidyi were recorded. An analysis of B. ovata
   distribution in the waters of the Dagestan shelf depending on
   environmental conditions was carried out.},

Title = {Factors affecting spatiotemporal behaviour in the European brown hare
   Lepus europaeus: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The European brown hare Lepus europaeus is the most widely distributed
   hare species of the world, being naturally present throughout Eurasia
   and introduced as a game species in most continents. Despite the
   importance of this lagomorph for both management and conservation, a
   quantitative summary of its spatiotemporal behaviour is still lacking.
   Taking advantage of 51 selected studies conducted throughout the native
   range of the hare and spanning the last 40 years, we used meta-analytic
   approaches in order to: 1) investigate home range size in relation to
   ecological factors; 2) test preference across major habitat types; and
   3) provide a quantitative synthesis of hare activity patterns.
   Temporally adjusted home range size of hare populations decreased with
   increasing cropland cover (cereal and non-cereal crops), suggesting that
   home range size gets smaller with increasing food availability, and
   predicting that hare populations living in absence of crops would double
   their mean home range size compared to those inhabiting areas covered
   entirely by cropland. Hare populations where more males were sampled
   showed larger home ranges, in line with the polygynous mating system of
   this species. Hares preferred cropland and grassland over other habitats
   for foraging, thus selecting the two habitats characterised by the
   majority of trophic resources for this species. Yet, habitat types were
   used proportionally to their availability overall, except for the
   general avoidance of human settlements. Hares were mainly nocturnal,
   with the lowest activity during daytime, when activity was about one
   third of that at night, and showed moonlight avoidance, probably to
   limit encounters with nocturnal predators. Our work emphasises the
   importance of open habitats and especially cropland for this lagomorph,
   but also suggests some plasticity in the use of space and time by hares.
   Such plasticity may help this mammal to cope with future environmental
   changes, providing that landscape heterogeneity is maintained.},

Abstract = {In laboratory conditions, ants can combat a pathogen infection by means
   of the medicinal use of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is
   still unknown where they obtain medicinal compounds in the wild and how
   they use them. Due to an upregulation of ROS in response to herbivory,
   aphid-infested plants have been suggested to be a potential source of
   ROS for ants in the wild. We investigated whether infection would cause
   Lasius platythorax ants to change their foraging on extrafloral nectar
   on aphid-infested plants. We found no clear evidence for the ants
   significantly changing their foraging behaviour in response to the
   pathogen, nor for the extrafloral nectar to contain ROS. The aphids in
   our experiment had a relatively high concentration of ROS and future
   research should determine whether predation on aphids could be a
   potential source of both protein and ROS needed to combat a disease.},

Title = {Testing the effectiveness of integrated pest control at protecting whio

Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {The introduction of mammalian predators, particularly stoats (Mustela
   erminea), to New Zealand led to the decline in whio (Hymenolaimus
   malacorhynchos), an endemic riverine duck. Stoat control for whio in the
   South Island has focused on valley floor trapping along waterway margins
   but increasing survival and productivity for whio using this method is
   complicated by irruptive predator dynamics caused by occasional masting
   of beech species (Nothofagaceae). We investigated the effect of
   integrating stoat trapping with pulsed aerial 1080 toxin operations to
   counter predator irruptions on whio survival and productivity in c. 40
   000 ha of beech dominated Kahurangi National Park. We collected data on
   adult female whio survival, probability of breeding, nesting success,
   and duckling survival for seven years through two full beech mast
   events. We found a positive relationship between distance into the
   interior of the treatment block and whio population growth, nesting
   success, duckling, and adult survival. Heavy female whio were more
   likely to breed than light ones, and adult female survival was higher
   during the breeding season than during non-breeding. Nesting success was
   greatest in the breeding season following a 1080 operation. Duckling
   survival was higher at lower river flows. Positive population growth was
   only predicted near the centre of the study area (c. 13 km from the
   edge) with both traps and 1080. We conclude that in the centre of
   treatment blocks at least as large as our study block, integrated pest
   control should be enough to ensure long-term population persistence of
   whio in a beech-dominated system.},

Abstract = {Soil contamination from film debris following the prolonged application
   of mulching film has emerged as a worldwide concern. However, the extent
   that mulching films contribute to soil microplastics, and the spatial
   distribution of soil contamination from film debris remain unclear. In
   this study, the cotton field in Xinjiang (China), which underwent film
   mulching for a prolonged period of 5-30 years, was selected as the
   research location. A total of 360 soil samples were collected, aiming to
   study the spatial distribution characteristics of mulching film debris
   pollution. The samples were extracted using the density flotation method
   combined with stereomicroscopic; the source, composition, abundance, and
   distribution characteristics of soil MPs were identified by the scanning
   electron microscopic, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic
   analyses. In soil mulched for a 30 year period, the abundance of
   microplastics across the studied soil depth (0-60 cm) was 78.51 +/- 2.57
   n/(100 g). The mu-FTIR analyses revealed that the composition of the
   microplastics matched that of polyethylene materials. Therefore, plastic
   mulching could be inferred as a major contributor to microplastic
   pollution in agricultural lands. Overall, it is necessary to study the
   distribution characteristics of plastic film remaining for further study
   of plastic pollution in farmland soils.},

Abstract = {Both fertilizer and plant species richness may affect the soil nematode
   community. However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species
   richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in
   wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium
   fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed
   levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment
   established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that
   fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode,
   bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera
   number, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Margalef richness index
   (SR), the total maturity index (Sigma MI), and structure index (SI), and
   degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed
   species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the
   structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   indicated that the fertilizer's effect was more significant than weed
   species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer
   affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available
   phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03\%; weed
   species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly
   through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07\%. Our results suggest weed
   species richness may relieve the negative effect of fertilizer on the
   diversity of soil nematode community. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

Title = {Biological features of Metcalfa (Metcalfa pruinosa Say, 1830)
   (Homoptera, Flatidae) and the issues of regulation of its abundance in
   the central zone of Krasnodar Territory},

Abstract = {Aim. The study of some biological features of the potentially dangerous
   for the south of Russia species of Metcalfa or citrus flaccid
   planthopper (Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830) (Homoptera, Flatidae) and the
   possibility of regulating its abundance with low-hazard pesticides
   (hazard class 3-4): actara, phytoverm and the biopreparation,
   bitoxibacillin.
   Material and Methods. Metcalfa's monitoring was carried out on trees and
   shrubs in the city of Krasnodar and its environs in various zones of
   anthropogenic load in 2018-2021.
   Results. An initial assessment of the effectiveness of pesticides was
   carried out, as well as the identification of possible sites of the
   presence of Metcalfa and the study of phenology. The hatching of larvae
   of this species occurs in spring from late April to June, one generation
   per year. However, in late August - early October, larvae of younger
   ages were found, which indicates the development of a second incomplete
   generation and confirms the literature data on a possible increase in
   the number of planthopper generations in new areas. Joint colonies of
   Metcalfa with lace beetles were also noted. Monitoring was carried out
   using light traps based on superbright LEDs.
   Conclusion. Based on the results of route surveys in our studies, plants
   from the Rosaceae family turned out to be the most attractive for
   planthoppers, which accounted for about 25\% of the recorded species. At
   the peak of flight, the catchability of light traps in our experiments
   was up to 210. As a result of testing preparations on larvae of younger
   ages, treatment with Aktara (2 l/ha) showed 100\% efficiency; 92-85\% -
   Fitoverm (1 l/ha) and 83-78\% Bitoxibacillin (4 l/ha).},

Title = {Ecological and epidemiological features of the distribution of
   toxoplasmosis in the territory of Dagestan},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {152-158},
Abstract = {Aim. To study the ecological and epidemiological features of the spread
   of toxoplasmosis in the territory of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. A total of 3152 people in the 7-50 years age range
   living in Makhachkala, Kaspiysk, Derbent and rural settlements of
   different climatic and geographical zones of the republic, were examined
   for toxoplasmosis. Among those surveyed were 1817 women and 82 children.
   Disease with toxoplasmosis was diagnosed according to laboratory and
   clinical and epidemiological data. Of the serological research methods,
   RIF (immunofluorescence reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay) were used. Based on the survey results, ecological and
   epidemiological maps were complied
   Results. It was revealed that the inhabitants of lowlands are 1,7 times
   more likely to be infected with toxoplasmosis than mountain settlements.
   The unequal frequency of toxoplasmosis infection in residents of
   mountainous and foothill areas depends not only on the altitude of the
   area above sea level, but also on soil moisture (plains and foothills),
   the intensity of isolation (highlands), as well as contact with infected
   domestic and agricultural animals. Infection with toxoplasma invasion in
   different territories varied within the range of 17.3\%-29.1\%.
   Conclusion. Identification of the sources of toxopiasma invasion was
   undertaken structured around regionally-oriented methods for the
   prevention of the disease. Typifying the sources of toxoplasmosis
   included monitoring: levels of sanitation when in contact with
   insufficiently thermally processed food products; obligatory hand
   washing after working with the soil; contact with pets; special sanitary
   and veterinary control over persons in contact with animals, as well as
   sanitary and medical care of patients and pregnant women.},

Title = {Upwelling study of chlorophyll a content in phytoplankton of the western
   Caspian in 2017 based on remote sensing data},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {159-172},
Abstract = {Aim. Study of upwelling based on spatio-temporal variability of
   chlorophyll a concentration in the western part of the Caspian Sea in
   2017 based on space survey images.
   Materials and methods. Space images were obtained from the specialized
   centers of Ocean Color NASA, Earth Science Data Systems NASA and SATIN.
   Remote sensing data was processed using SeaDAS and ArcGIS programmes.
   Ground data were obtained from the Unified State System of Information
   on the Situation in the World Ocean (ESIMO). ESIMO is an inter-agency
   information system designed to integrate data and services of marine
   systems of Russia and to provide integrated information support to
   maritime activities of the Russian Federation. The database was created
   in ArcGIS and maps compiled accordingly.
   Results. The first upwelling occurred on 9-17 June 2017. The minimum
   water temperature registered in the Makhachkala region was 14 degrees C.
   with an increase in salinity to 12 parts per thousand, over an area of
   1.500 km(2). There was an increase in the content of dissolved oxygen up
   to 9.70 mg/l and a pH of 8.64 was recorded. At first, the concentration
   of chlorophyll a was more than 10 mg/m(3), then it decreased to 2.5
   m/m(3), while at the same time the area of distribution of chlorophyll
   with this indicator significantly increased. For the coastal strip, the
   chlorophyll index was 5 mg/m(3). The second upwelling of medium
   intensity was from 19 June to 1 July 1 2017 with a minimum of t = 17.9
   degrees C. with an increase in salinity of 1 parts per thousand. The
   surface area was 454 km(2). The concentration of chlorophyll a increased
   from 4 to 8-12 mg/m(3), reaching 23 mg/m(3) on 24 June. The third case
   of upwelling was recorded from 26 August to 1 September 2017 and was
   characterized by a decrease in water temperature by 7.4 degrees C (near
   the coast by 17.1 degrees C). The average salinity increase was 0.32
   parts per thousand, while the O-2 concentration was 8 mg/l and the water
   area 500 km(2). A sharp increase in the area and concentration of
   chlorophyll was observed on 29 August 2017. Subsequently, the
   concentration of chlorophyll throughout the entire water area was evenly
   distributed in the range of 1-5 mg/m(3).
   Conclusion. The Caspian Sea is characterized by spatial heterogeneity of
   oceanological parameters, which can be recorded based on the results of
   processing satellite images and their verification using ground data. In
   the western part of the sea, the upwelling is periodic and of different
   scales. In total, on the basis of the capabilities of multifactor
   geoinformation modeling, 3 upwellings were identified and confirmed
   using satellite data.},

Pages = {140-149},
Abstract = {Aim. Considering the high capability of Ilam province in the development
   of health tourism as indicated in its active border crossings with Iraq
   and the response to the recent epidemic, it was deemed necessary to
   identify the risks of air pollution on the health of tourists.
   Materials and Methods. During 2008-2018, data on five primary air
   pollutants during 2008-2018 were identified by literature research and
   by referring to the relevant monitoring organizations. Data analysis was
   performed by the Full permutation polygon synthetic indicator model,
   while Excel and MATLAB software were used to display data.
   Results. The findings of the study revealed that despite the application
   of the Land Use Planning Document, average suspended particulate matter
   of less than 10 microns ranked second after sulphur dioxide (SO2), in
   terms of the contribution to air pollution and instability in Ilam City
   during the 11 years in question (excluding 2008 and 2009).
   Conclusions. The link between air pollution and the development of
   health tourism on the one hand and the emergence of an epidemic on the
   other has recently necessitated a new concept of health, tourism and
   welfare in relation to the environment with the aim of achieving a
   healthy environment for visiting tourists.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Aim. Analyse available literature data about the possibility of
   coronavirus infection with and the severity of the course of infection
   in various animal species in order to evaluate the significance of this
   possibility in the context of preservation of the well-being of both
   wild and domestic animals.
   Discussion. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bat CoV. The
   virus enters the cell by binding to the ACE2 receptor, the affinity for
   which differs depending on the animal species. Infected animals show
   viral RNA and may show clinical symptoms. It is known that the virus
   originated from some animals, while others may be carriers. Moreover, it
   can be that wild as well as domestic and farm animals are in close
   contact with humans. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct a study of
   the degree of threat to humans associated with the persistence of the
   virus in animal communities.
   Conclusion. There is ample literature on the possibility of infection in
   various animals. However, it is not enough to fully understand how
   significant is the role that animals can play in the spread of
   coronavirus infection among humans and how much harm it can bring to
   themselves.},

Title = {In-depth adaptation of winter wheat cultivation technology in the
   Central Chernozem region},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {119-127},
Abstract = {Aim. The purpose of the research is to determine the method of soil
   cultivation and the dose of NPK, based on in-depth adaptation of winter
   wheat cultivation technology, ensuring the minimum cost of producing
   grain of the crop of the required quality in the Central Black Earth
   Region (CBER).
   Materials and Methods. The efficiency of winter wheat production largely
   depends on the adaptation of the technology of its cultivation to soil
   and climatic conditions, which are identified at the level of the
   agroecological province. But the main object of farming systems - the
   soil cover within the agroecological province is distinguished by a high
   territorial diversity in fertility, which is not taken into account when
   developing agricultural technologies and thus lowers the level of their
   adaptability. Therefore, it is proposed to minimize the use of resources
   in intensive technologies due to in-depth adaptation of tillage and
   fertilization in accordance with the initial state of the soil of a
   particular field.
   Results. It was found that for the conditions of the CBER, the optimal
   values of the factors are the dose N19P39K39 and the combined method of
   tillage for winter wheat, which correspond to the minimum cost of grain
   of 5.38 thousand roubles/t with a yield of 3.38 t/ha and a 12\% protein
   content in grain of 3rd class.
   Conclusion. In addressing agricultural problems when there is an
   interaction between the factors, the effectiveness of in-depth
   adaptation increases with the complex optimisation of factors according
   to innovative methodology using the mathematical method of indefinite
   Lagrange multipliers. Comprehensive optimisation of the factors made it
   possible to determine the method of tillage and the dose of fertiliser
   that would ensure the minimum cost of producing grain of a given quality
   under the conditions of the CBER.},

Title = {Specific features of accumulation of heavy metals in the body of

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of this work is the study of the specifics of accumulation
   of heavy metals in the body of gastropod mollusks -slugs (Molluska:
   Limacidae) on the southern slope of the Aragats mountain range, namely,
   conducting a quantitative analysis of heavy metals in the soil of
   different points of the Aragats mountain range and in the body of slugs
   (Vitrinoides monticola armeniaca; Deroceras caucasicum; Limax flavus),
   as well as the principles of biogenic migration of heavy metals
   according to the soil- plant-animal system (slugs) and determining the
   role of slugs in this migration in terrestrial ecosystems.Material and
   Methods. Slugs collected from different points of the southern slope of
   the Aragats mountain range served as material for this study. The
   content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ca, Mo) in the body of the mollusks
   was determined by the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry method: AAS
   extraction \& ISO-8288. The features of the biological accumulation of
   heavy metals in the body of mollusks were also determined.Results.
   Gastropod mollusks (Molluska: Limacidae) actively accumulate heavy
   metals (especially Cu, Zn, Ca) in their bodies and play a certain role
   in their transfer through food chains. Slugs, living in upper soil
   horizons (mesofauna) and under stones and plant litter, actively respond
   to the slightest changes in the environment and are perspective objects
   allowing the detection of deviations in the functioning of soils and the
   natural complex as a whole.Conclusion. Slugs living in the soil are an
   important link of the biogenic migration of heavy metals. An inverse
   relationship was revealed between the total and removable number of
   heavy metals in migration through the system: soil-plant-organism.},

Title = {Age structure and condition assessment of Fagus orientalis Lipsky in the
   Caucasian Ecoregion},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {52-61},
Abstract = {Aim. To determine the age structure and assess the current state of
   Fagus orientalis Lipsky in the Caucasian Ecoregion. Material and
   Methods. The material was collected in beech forests in different
   floristic districts of the Caucasian Ecoregion. The registration of
   individual specimens was carried out on 121 test sites, with a total
   area of 73925 m2. A total of 19936 individuals of Fagus orientalis were
   involved in the analysis. Each individual was assessed by condition and
   assigned to a certain age group. Results. The study of the age structure
   of Fagus orientalis in the beech forests of the Caucasian Ecoregion
   showed a similar pattern of distribution of age group participation in
   all the studied areas studied. The age spectra revealed are left-sided
   and full-membered where individuals of the pre -generative phase
   predominate. For all populations, in general, almost the same share of
   the contribution of individuals of germinal and virginal age groups was
   noted, amounting to about 50\% in total. On average, there are 2906
   individuals per 1 ha, of which 459 have reached the generative phase.
   The condition of individuals of the pre-generative and generative phases
   across all the botanical areas of the Caucasian Ecoregion studied was
   estimated by us at 1.47 points. Conclusions. The study of the age
   structure of populations and the assessment of the condition of
   individuals allows us to assess the influence of certain abiotic and
   biotic factors. Low values of the proportion of post -generative
   individuals are the result of anthropogenic load in easily accessible
   territories. Under the influence of processes of intra-and interspecific
   competition, the share of participation of virginal and post -generative
   groups increases and is especially clearly observed in beech
   elfin-woodlands.},

Title = {The role of ROH in the etiopathogenesis of complex diseases},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of the main directions of
   genetic studies of complex (chronic) human neuropsychiatric diseases and
   to determine the prospects for their genomic studies.Discussion. Complex
   diseases account for more than 90\% of the total human pathology and are
   the main cause of premature death and disability. One of the most urgent
   and severe categories of complex diseases, both for the patients
   themselves and for society, are endogenous mental illnesses, in
   particular, schizophrenia, mental retardation and autism spectrum
   disorders. Despite the fact that genetic and epidemiological studies
   show high heritability rates (up to 70-80\%), the identification of
   predisposition genes remains a challenge. Studies in recent decades have
   contributed to understanding the genetic mechanisms of the pathogenesis
   of such diseases and have significantly advanced our understanding in
   terms of identifying risk loci, possible mechanisms for the transmission
   of genetic risk, and the involvement in the pathogenesis of such
   diseases of not one but of a large number of genes that provide many
   variants of gene expression. However, the mapping of genes that control
   such clinical phenotypes and mutations in them that cause pathogenesis
   remains largely unknown.Conclusion. The finding of the same gene changes
   in neuropsychiatric complex diseases suggests that the genes involved
   converge in biochemical pathways and may be caused by a complex
   interplay of genetic and environmental factors characterized by genetic
   heterogeneity, which is often associated with clinical heterogeneity,
   incomplete penetrance and phenocopies. This is of great importance for
   the development of gene therapy through the identification of drug
   targets for the treatment of these disorders.},

Title = {Movements and habitat connectivity of New Zealand forest birds: a review
   of available data},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {New Zealand's original forested landscape has been greatly fragmented
   since human arrival, limiting connectivity and habitat quality for
   forest-dependent fauna. We review the limited available information
   about forest bird movement behaviour, especially whole-year sociality
   and movement, natal dispersal, and pasture- and water-gap crossing. Most
   small insectivores (17 species) and North Island kokako are territorial
   year-round, but frugivore-nectivores (three species), raptors (two
   species), and volant parrots (four species) can be highly mobile,
   presumably to find scattered food. Natal dispersal is the main behaviour
   by which birds find new habitats and mates, but natal dispersal
   distances are unknown for half the species we review. There is limited
   information about species' ability to cross gaps between forests, and
   more is known about movement over water than pasture. We classify four
   species (North Island kokako, popokotea, South Island tieke, and North
   Island brown kiwi) as strongly gap limited, defined as currently unknown
   to cross water or pasture gaps larger than 500 m. A further eight
   species (mohua, tititipounamu, pipipi, weka, North Island tieke,
   kakaruai, toutouwai, and miromiro) are moderately gap-limited, with
   maximum observed gap-crossing distances of less than 5 km. Pending new
   data, these twelve species have most need of corridors or translocations
   to enable them to establish in new, safe, ecosanctuary sites. Habitat
   connectivity can be increased by strategic planting, but this also risks
   decreasing populations if birds emigrate from safe to unsafe sites. Many
   managed ecosanctuaries are too small to accommodate natal dispersal
   distances expected in continuous forest, so pest control is required at
   larger scale in the long term to restore natural movement patterns.},

Abstract = {The California quail was introduced to New Zealand in 1862 as a game
   bird, and today is held in high regard by recreational hunters. The
   species is widespread through the North and South Islands, except for
   the regions of Westland, Fiordland, and Southland. However, it is
   suspected that populations have been declining in recent decades. Our
   study focused on the California quail population in the Marlborough
   Sounds along six road sections between Manaroa, Picton, and Havelock
   during 2010-2019. Analysis of quail counts using a Generalised Linear
   Model revealed that year (decline from 2010 to 2019), season (highest in
   spring, lowest in winter and Autumn) and vehicle traffic (highest at low
   traffic, lowest at high traffic) all showed significant relationships
   with the mean number of quail counted per survey. Quail numbers also
   showed significant relationships with time of day (highest in evening,
   lowest in afternoon) and road section (highest from Portage to Te Mahia
   and Te Mahia to Linkwater). The decline in quail counted over the
   10-year period was possibly due to loss of suitable habitat through
   forest regeneration, and perhaps also increased predation by certain
   introduced mammals. We recommend future research to further investigate
   the causes of the decline, given that confirmed declines in exotic quail
   populations may have similar implications for native species that also
   prefer open habitats within the Marlborough Sounds region.},

Abstract = {Although efforts to restore floodplain forests are becoming more popular
   in the northeastern United States, best management practices are not
   well defined. In this study, we demonstrate the success of a planting
   effort in western Massachusetts to increase the extent of a floodplain
   forest along the Housatonic River. Over 1700 floodplain-adapted tree
   saplings were planted in an old field and in two hayfields at
   Bartholomew's Cobble, a property located in Sheffield, Massachusetts,
   and individually tagged to follow their growth and survival. Planted
   trees had relatively high rates of survival over a 6 y period,
   especially the two most commonly planted tree species: silver maple
   (Acer saccharinum, 42.5\% survival) and boxelder (Acer negundo, 71.7\%),
   although plantings were more successful in the old field compared to the
   two hayfields. Tree dbh after 6 y differed across fields for silver
   maples and boxelders with those planted within the old meadow
   significantly larger than those planted into hayfields (silver maple dbh
   9.8 cm old field vs. 6.5-6.6 cm hayfields; boxelder dbh 10.4 cm old
   field vs. 4.4-6.6 cm hayfields). By documenting which floodplain-adapted
   tree species were successful in establishing under which conditions, our
   observational study provides valuable insights for future restoration
   efforts.},

Title = {Invasive rats consuming mountain flax nectar - resource competitors and
   possible pollinators?},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The long history of human-mediated species introductions has resulted in
   a multitude of novel interactions around the globe. Many of these
   interactions have been to the detriment of native species. In New
   Zealand, the ship rat (Rattus rattus) is considered culpable for the
   rapid declines in the populations of numerous bird species. While seed
   masts have been implicated in rat population booms, alternative food
   resources, such as floral nectar, may play an underappreciated role in
   rat-bird interactions. Here, we present video footage and nectar volume
   data that indicate likely resource competition between rats and birds
   for floral nectar. Additionally, this footage indicates possible
   pollination services by rats. These findings suggest that attention
   should be paid to nectar as a limited resource that may bolster rat
   populations, as well as attract rats for pollination services.},

Title = {The biogeochemistry and ecological impact of Westland petrels
   (Procellaria westlandica) on terrestrial ecosystems},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Westland petrel (Procellaria westlandica) is a 1200 g medium-sized
   seabird whose breeding colonies are dispersed across 700 ha of forest on
   the western coast of South Island, New Zealand. These birds represent
   the sole landscape-scale lowland remnant of formerly widespread petrel
   and shearwater colonies in mainland New Zealand and provide an
   opportunity to investigate maritime species' impact on terrestrial
   ecosystems characteristic of pre-human New Zealand. This review develops
   a conceptual model of biogeochemical processes influenced by Westland
   petrels from a single burrow to individual colonies and thence to a
   catchment scale. Results show the distinctiveness of the Westland petrel
   system, with colonies moving around the landscape in response to local
   damage by earthquakes and storms. Based on monitored streams in forested
   landscapes elsewhere, storms also control N and P fluxes to streams.
   Non-seabird temperate forests are dominated by mycorrhizal plant-soil
   interactions, but the high N and P status of Westland petrel colony
   soils minimises the role of fungi in soil processes, including trace
   element (Se) uptake. The more N-rich C:N ratio in tree foliage within
   habitat occupied by the colony may provide nutritional support for
   terrestrial herbivorous animals, including those whose ranges extend
   beyond the colony. Overall, the review emphasises the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of the Westland petrel terrestrial ecosystem, and
   highlights potential ecological linkages that connect colonies to the
   wider landscape.},

Title = {Kiwi translocation review: are we releasing enough birds and to the
   right places?},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Translocations of kiwi (Apteryx spp.) are one of the most common and
   growing types of conservation translocations in New Zealand. However,
   their outcomes remain mostly unpublished, which does not allow for
   sharing of lessons learnt from past developments. We reviewed 102 kiwi
   translocations from the 19th century until 2018, and identified factors
   affecting their outcome. North Island brown kiwi (A. mantelli) was the
   most translocated species, but the highest impact of translocations on
   the improvement of conservation status was for the rarest taxa: little
   spotted kiwi (A. owenii), rowi (A. rowi), and Haast tokoeka (A.
   australis `Haast'). Translocations are typically used for creating
   secure populations and, more recently, for ecosystem restoration
   objectives and meta-population management. We developed a set of
   criteria to evaluate the outcome of introductions and reintroductions
   based on demographic parameters alongside current recommendations on
   genetic make-up of translocated populations. These criteria allowed us
   to categorise historical and recent translocations that were carried out
   for a wide array of objectives. Currently, based on these criteria, only
   a few translocated populations can be considered successful in the
   medium-long term: 15+ years following the release of a genetically
   diverse population (40+ unrelated individuals). Most historical
   translocations failed or require further genetic and habitat management.
   However, a majority of kiwi translocations have occurred over the last
   two decades and, while several populations have successfully
   established, for most of them, it is too soon to assess their
   medium-long term outcome. An analysis of factors affecting translocation
   outcomes revealed that, despite ongoing predator control, populations at
   small, unfenced sites on the mainland suffer from dispersal and
   predation, which has negative demographic and genetic consequences.
   Releases to larger mainland sites and predator-free areas have increased
   survival times, which indicates higher chances for a positive
   translocation outcome. Moreover, translocated wild-caught and
   captive-sourced birds survived longer compared to birds from the
   Operation Nest Egg programme, particularly at sites that were not
   predator-free. We highlight the need for genetic considerations in the
   planning and adaptive management of proposed and existing translocated
   populations. Specifically, we suggest that differences in kiwi survival,
   based on the type of released birds and release site's area size and
   predator status, should be considered during translocation planning.
   Similarly, we encourage a standardised monitoring approach, increased
   reporting, and publishing the outcomes of translocations.},

Abstract = {The development of nanotechnology has accelerated the use of silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) in household chemicals and the accumulation of Ag
   in sewage treatment systems. The application of sewage sludge products
   to soils raises concerns over the safety of Ag in the function and
   biogeochemical cycles of the soil belowground ecosystem. Here, we assess
   the potential risk of the accumulation and transfer of Ag under AgNPs
   exposure and its effects on the trophic transfer of nitrogen (N) through
   a soil animal food chain (Folsomia candida-Hypoaspis aculeifer). The
   formation of stable silver sulfide (Ag2S) was also studied via a single
   species test using F. candida. Concentrations of Ag in F. candida
   increased with increasing AgNPs concentration, as did those in the
   predator H. aculeifer, but the Ag bioaccumulation factors of both
   animals were < 1. Folsomia candida body tissue N-15 abundance declined
   markedly compared with that of H. aculeifer. Silver sulfide did have
   adverse effects on the survival and reproduction of F. candida. The Ag
   concentrations of F. candida increased with increasing Ag2S
   concentration in sludge-treated soils. Silver sulfide showed ecotoxicity
   to the collembolan, therefore ecotoxicity resulting from the
   transformation and fate of AgNPs in soils needs to be considered before
   biosolid products are applied to agricultural soils. (C) Higher

   habitat fragmentation, suggesting that the facultative specialist
   behaviour of the species may lead to better toleration of human-altered
   environments. Red fox presence did not affect cortisol levels. However,
   significantly higher cortisol levels were measured in hairs of wildcats
   exposed to golden jackals, suggesting that the potential competition

Title = {Future climates are predicted to alter the potential distributions of
   non-native conifer species in New Zealand},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Non-native conifers constitute a significant threat to the ecology and
   biodiversity of many of New Zealand's native ecosystems and species.
   From the top down, the potential distributions of non-native conifer
   species are governed by climate suitability, which alongside variables
   such as the availability of suitable habitats and a source of propagules
   determines whether an area of land will be susceptible to invasion by a
   given species. Here, we undertook a novel study to quantify potential
   distributions as defined by climate suitability for all 55 non-native
   conifer species in New Zealand using ecological niche modelling. Using
   current and future climate data, we then predicted how climate change
   may affect the potential distributions of these species. For most
   conifer species currently of concern from a management perspective, the
   total potential distribution is predicted to decline in future climates,
   with the largest reductions occurring for Pinus contorta. However, the
   climatically suitable land area for species such as Pinus pinaster and
   Pinus patula is predicted to increase in the future, while for species
   such as Pinus radiata future losses of suitable climate space in the
   North Island are approximately balanced by gains in the South Island.
   Although there is a great deal of variation at the individual species
   level, the vast majority of New Zealand will have climate suitable for a
   non-native conifer species both now and in the future. While data and
   methodological limitations associated with ecological niche modelling
   means we are more confident about increases than decreases in potential
   distributions, our results can be used to guide the management of
   non-native conifers in New Zealand and contribute to invasion risk
   assessments for these species. Our data and methodology can also be used
   to contribute to invasion risk modelling in other areas of these conifer
   species' introduced ranges throughout the Southern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {Black beech (Fuscospora solandri) seedlings were planted in randomly

   to re-establish black beech as a keystone canopy species on ridges and
   headlands that lost their primary forest cover as a result of fires by
   the middle of last century. One hundred and sixty-four of 199 beech
   seedlings (82\%) planted in 2014 survived to 2019. Survival was higher
   in plots that had a low to moderate canopy density, or when plots had
   either low or moderate canopy density, when seedlings had higher levels
   of ambient light. There was weak evidence of a negative relationship
   between seedling growth and the amount of ambient light, attributable to
   apical dieback in some seedlings.},

Abstract = {Aim. To identify features of the accumulation and distribution patterns
   of Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co, Hg, Cd, Pb in organs and tissues of the
   Caspian seal.
   Materials and Methods. Sampling was carried out according to generally
   accepted methods and the determination of heavy metals was performed by
   atomic absorption spectroscopy using an atomic absorption spectrometer
   with electrothermal atomization MGA-915 MD.
   Results. In the body of the Caspian seal, zinc, manganese, chromium,
   cobalt and mercury are mainly deposited in the liver, nickel and cadmium
   in the kidneys, copper in the stomach and lead in adipose tissue. Under
   the same living conditions, females have in most cases higher
   coefficients of accumulation of trace elements than males. Female
   Caspian seals accumulate more copper, mercury and cadmium than males.
   Sexual differences in the accumulation of zinc, nickel, cobalt and lead
   by organs and tissues of the Caspian seal were not detected. With age,
   the Caspian seal has a significant increase in the concentration of
   zinc, copper, mercury and cadmium, and the digestibility of manganese,
   chromium, cobalt and lead decreases.
   Conclusion. Chemical elements are distributed unevenly in the body of a
   seal, depending on the properties of metals and the functional features
   of organs. Significant concentrations of metals are noted primarily in
   organs that are characterized by active metabolic processes on the one
   hand, and on the other are actively involved in processes aimed at
   maintaining homeostasis.},

Title = {The role of protected areas in the formation of a comfortable urban
   environment formation},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-108},
Abstract = {Aim: to determine the importance of protected areas (PA) in the
   formation of a comfortable urban environment formation.
   Methods. The following activities have taken place: collection of the
   route-floristic descriptions, inventory of plantations, analysis of
   regulatory and stock materials, determination of the relative living
   condition of stands and calculation of ecosystem services.
   Results. PAs as unique natural objects have become a counterbalance to
   aggressive urban environments and serve as a tool for stabilising the
   ecological state of a territory as well as for keeping its population
   healthy. For the first time, in accordance with a systematic approach,
   the role of protected areas in different parts of urban life that define
   the comfort of an urban environment was analysed. The network of PAs of
   Khabarovsk includes 29 objects with a total area of 585.45 ha, which
   amounts to 1.51\% of the total city area. The PA's specifics were
   determined according to the urban planning and economic development of
   the territory and were divided into 6 categories: natural recreational
   complexes, nurseries, park zones, natural monuments, nature parks and
   public gardens. According to the systematic approach, we have analysed
   the role of protected areas in the formation of a comfortable urban
   environment for Khabarovsk. The example of the ``Orekhovaya Sopka{''}, a
   protected area of local importance with an ability to intercept water in
   the form of precipitation, made it possible to increase the economic and
   ecological value of the protected urban lands in ecosystem service
   calculations.
   Conclusions. Urban PAs are protected natural objects with multipurpose
   use. The main function of PAs is to form a comfortable urban environment
   which is closely intertwined with architectural and urban planning and
   the economic, social and environmental spheres of urban life. The
   insignificant share of PAs in the total area of Khabarovsk indicates the
   necessity to expand their areas. It is proposed to use the indicator
   ``PA's share in the total area of a city{''} in urban environment
   quality index development.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {228-235},
Abstract = {Aim. To analyze the ecological aspect of the media space discourse in
   the Caspian region and qualitative changes in the parameters of the
   media environment, resulting from the state policy of the Caspian states
   and objective informatisation processes in the region.
   Material and Methods. Systems approach, geopolitical theory, expert
   interviews, content analysis and document analysis.
   Results. Based on the results of the analysis, positive changes in the
   media environment of the Caspian region were identified, which include
   the expansion and deepening of the environmental aspect of the Caspian
   discourse and the quality of the existing resource and infrastructure
   base. The need to continue efforts to create a common media space for
   the Caspian region and its qualitative development is stated.
   Considering the level of complexity of the geopolitical situation in the
   Caspian region and its borders, as well as the experience of
   ``Editorialising the Caspian States{''}, it is advisable to focus on the
   exchange of media content within the framework of non-political topics,
   as military-political topics in the current geopolitical conditions,
   because of the very serious contradictions in the region, cannot serve
   integration purposes. Particular attention should be paid to the
   formation of content that should ``work{''} on an urgent and
   constructive Caspian agenda, especially its environmental aspect.
   Conclusion. The need is stated to consistently saturate the media
   environment with new content within the framework of three cases aimed
   at developing and strengthening humanitarian cooperation between the
   countries of the ``Caspian Five{''} in order to form a space of trust,
   where one of the central places will be occupied by the environmental
   safety of the region.},

Title = {Influence of radioactive isotopes Sr-90, Cs-13(7), Pb-210 on
   environmental objects and their relationship with bovine leukemia in
   ecosystems of the Republic of Dagestan},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Pages = {136-145},
Abstract = {Aim. To conduct studies on the content of radionuclides Sr-90, Cs-13(7),
   Pb-210 and determine the total beta-activity in objects (samples) of the
   external environment, as well as to investigate the effect of
   radioactive isotopes on the spread of bovine leukemia in the Republic of
   Dagestan.
   Materials and Methods. Samples (haylage, natural grass, silage, compound
   feed, milk, etc.) that were obtained from various locations of the
   Republic of Dagestan were used for radiological research. The method of
   research was radiochemical analysis using the universal spectrometric
   complex ``Gamma Plus{''}, etc. For bovine leukemia the principal
   material was the reporting data of the Republican Veterinary Laboratory,
   supplemented by our own research from 1988 to 2008. The research was
   carried out by generally recognized methods in serology and hematology.
   Results. After the studies were conducted, a high content of
   radionuclides Sr-90 and Cs-137 was found in environmental objects from
   1986-198, and the activity of nuclide Pb-210 in the ecosystem of the
   republic increased tenfold compared to 1985. An important indicator such
   as the total beta-activity in the republic also increased in the period
   (from 1986-1988) after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
   station. In 1988, we recorded the maximum number (32.2\%) of infected
   animals with the bovine leukemia virus and in subsequent years the
   percentage of hemo-diseased heads of cattle in the farms of the republic
   increased.
   Conclusion. Thus, there is a causal relationship between the activity of
   radionuclides and the decrease in the immune status of animals, which
   may lead to the increase in the spread of bovine leukemia in the
   republic.},

Abstract = {Aim. In the arid zone of the Central Caucasus it is especially important
   to grow crops with a high adaptive capacity to changing weather and
   climatic conditions. In this regard, the purpose of this research work
   was to determine the influence of hydrothermal factors of the region on
   the pigment complex and the ability of plants to accumulate nitrogen,
   protein content in grain and productivity of various varieties of winter
   wheat.
   Material and Methods. In the experiment, statistical and mathematical
   methods were used comprehensively to determine the influence of weather
   and climatic factors of the region on the pigment complex, the ability
   of plants to accumulate nitrogen, grain quality and yield of 3 varieties
   of winter wheat (Zustrich, Bagheera and Bagrat).
   Results. With the aid of statistical and mathematical analysis, the
   spectrum of changes in the individual reaction of genotypes of various
   varieties of winter wheat (according to chlorophyll, carotenoids,
   nitrogen content in plants, grain quality {[}protein content) and
   productivity) in arid conditions of the region was revealed. As a result
   of the research, it was found that the Bagrat variety optimally realizes
   its potential to neutralize the negative impact of external
   environmental factors. The remaining varieties in the agrocenoses of the
   region had average indicators.
   Conclusion. The varietal reaction of winter wheat to the phases of plant
   vegetation was been established. Varieties of agricultural crops with
   high adaptive stability for economic use in the prevailing conditions of
   precipitation reduction and temperature increase were identified.
   Practical recommendations for optimising plant nutrition and obtaining
   the highest productivity of winter wheat grain are proposed.},

Title = {Haematological profile and genetic variation of brown Caucasian dairy
   cattle in different ecological and geographical zones},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. The rational use of North Caucasus forage lands, a large part of
   which is located in the mountains, is one of the important tasks in
   addressing the issue of improving the efficiency of cattle breeding.
   This appears quite challenging, as the mechanisms of adaptation of farm
   animals, in particular cattle, to the environmental and climatic
   peculiarities of a certain region have not been sufficiently explored.
   Since hematopoietic function of blood is the basis of organism's vital
   functions and genetic polymorphism is the measure of its adaptability,
   the present study is aimed at examining haematological profile and the
   degree of genetic variation in the Brown Caucasian cattle.
   Materials and Methods. Haematological, genetic and statistical methods
   of analysis were used to examine the haematological profile and genetic
   structure of genes GH, PIT-1, PRL in Brown Caucasian dairy cattle, bred
   in different ecological and climatic zones of Dagestan.
   Conclusion. This was the first time that hematopoietic function was
   studied in the context of genetic variation in Brown Caucasian dairy
   cattle bred in the foothills (100-200 m above sea level) and mountains
   (650-1,250 m above sea level). The information obtained gives an idea of
   and an answer to the question about the role of haematological profile
   and the degree of genetic variation in the development of adaptive and
   compensatory mechanisms to specific environmental conditions. The use of
   haematological, molecular and genetic methods allows the further
   exploration of the adaptation traits of Brown Caucasian dairy cattle for
   their further improvement.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {127-135},
Abstract = {Aim. The purpose of the study was to assess the socio-economic security
   of the municipalities of the Voronezh Region on the basis of a developed
   methodology.
   Material and Methods. The information base of the study was made up of
   official data of the Federal State Statistics Service. To measure the
   socio-economic security of the region, the following methods were used:
   comparison of macroeconomic indicators with threshold values; assessment
   of the dynamics of changes in the rates of socio-economic growth of the
   region; cartographic tools.
   Results. The results of the calculations of the integral index of
   socioeconomic security made it possible to identify 5 groups of
   municipalities that have a certain degree of socio-economic security:
   high; medium, below average, low and crisis. It is the crisis situation
   of a number of municipalities that indicates the need to develop certain
   anti-crisis recommendations that contribute to the effective use of
   existing potential and directly develop the internal resources of
   municipalities.
   Conclusion. The assessment conducted of the indicators of socioeconomic
   security of the municipalities of the region will make it possible to
   determine the ``strengths and weaknesses{''} of the regional
   socioeconomic system of the Voronezh region and to develop strategic
   directions for the implementation of a single strategic goal: improving
   the level and quality of life of the population. The authors' approach
   can be used as a basis for further monitoring of socio-economic
   security, which would involve expanding the range of analyzed
   indicators, as well as conducting regular calculations and comparisons.},

Abstract = {Rhizodeposits in rice paddy soil are important in global C sequestration
   and cycling. This study explored the effects of elevated CO2 and N
   fertilization during the rice growing season on the subsequent
   mineralization and retention of rhizodeposit-C in soil aggregates after
   harvest. Rice (Oryza saliva L.) was labeled with (CO2)-C-13 under
   ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 concentrations with and
   without N fertilization. After harvest, soil with labeled rhizodeposits
   was collected, separated into three aggregate size fractions, and
   flood-incubated for 100 d. The initial rhizodeposit-C-13 content of
   N-fertilized microaggregates was less than 65\% of that of
   non-fertilized microaggregates. During the incubation of microaggregates
   separated from N-fertilized soils, 3\%-9\% and 9\%-16\% more proportion
   of rhizodeposit-C-1(3) was mineralized to (CO2)-C-13, and incorporated
   into the microbial biomass, respectively, while less was allocated to
   soil organic carbon than in the non-fertilized soils. Elevated CO2
   increased the rhizodeposit-C-1(3) content of all aggregate fractions by
   10\%-80\%, while it reduced cumulative (CO2)-C-13 emission and the
   bioavailable C pool size of rhizodeposit-C, especially in N-fertilized
   soil, except for the silt-clay fraction. It also resulted in up to 23\%
   less rhizodeposit-C incorporated into the microbial biomass of the three
   soil aggregates, and up to 23\% more incorporated into soil organic
   carbon. These results were relatively weak in the silt-clay fraction.
   Elevated CO2 and N fertilizer applied in rice growing season had a
   legacy effect on subsequent mineralization and retention of
   rhizodeposits in paddy soils after harvest, the extent of which varied
   among the soil aggregates. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

Abstract = {To study the effects of combined Cd and Cu pollution on rhizosphere
   bacterial community. High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the
   response of rhizosphere bacterial communities to heavy-metal stress
   under single and mixed pollution of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). With
   additions of Cd and Cu, the mean diversity index of rhizosphere
   bacterial community was in the order Cu alone > Cd-Cu mixtures> Cd
   alone. In all Cd and Cu treatments, the dominant phyla were
   Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. In the
   additions with different concentrations of Cd-Cu mixtures, LEfSe
   indicated that there were differences in the predominant species of
   rhizosphere bacterial communities. Some genera such as Streptomyces and
   Microbacterium belonging to Actinobacteria as biomarkers were
   significantly enriched in both control and treatments, while some genera
   such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Rhodopseudomonas belonging to
   Proteobacteria as biomarkers were observed to be enriched in the
   additions with single and mixture of Cd and Cu. According to the
   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, the structure of
   rhizosphere bacterial community was different between treatments and the
   CK. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that there were significant
   differences among treatments (p < 0.01), and that the addition of Cu
   might be the primary factor affecting the composition of rhizosphere
   bacterial communities. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

   politus across an urban-rural gradient},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Urban reserves have the potential to retain relatively high
   biodiversity. However, populations of the taxa within them can have
   reduced genetic diversity and, if gene flow between populations is
   inhibited by urbanised surroundings, can become genetically
   differentiated. Here we determine whether differences in population
   genetic differentiation and diversity can be observed in the leaf litter
   inhabiting weevil Geochus politus along the urban-rural gradient
   spanning Waitakere Ranges Regional Parkland and suburbs of West
   Auckland, New Zealand. Nine microsatellite markers were developed and
   screened across 300 individuals from nine sampling locations. Pairwise
   FST values, a principal coordinates analysis, and Bayesian estimates of
   population structure all demonstrated that the most urban site was
   strongly differentiated from the others. This site also had the lowest
   heterozygosity and highest FIS values, potentially indicating a loss of
   genetic variation and a greater degree of inbreeding, although not to a
   dramatic extent. Differentiation was also observed among sampling
   locations within continuous forest, suggesting that both urbanisation
   and other landscape variables are influencing gene flow between these
   locations. This study highlights the potential for urban reserves to
   harbour significant diversity and emphasises the importance of
   maintaining these sites.},

Title = {Spatial patterns and habitat use of penned and hard-released arboreal
   geckos translocated to an offshore island free of introduced mammals},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Temporary penning prior to release is a strategy increasingly being used
   in lizard translocations to improve site fidelity and increase chances
   of translocation success. However, it is yet to be tested on a range of
   lizard taxa. Between 2015 and 2018, 49 individuals of a New Zealand
   endemic arboreal gecko species (ngahere gecko, Mokopirirakau ``southern
   North Island{''}) were translocated to mammal-free Mana Island near
   Wellington as mitigation for a development project. Twenty-five of these
   geckos were tracked for this study with geckos being either
   hard-released (n = 9) or released into a 0.52 ha pen for 10-31 months (n
   = 16). Using radio-telemetry, we compared the behaviour, habitat use,
   dispersal, and home ranges of geckos from both groups in the weeks
   immediately following removal of the pen. Hard-released geckos travelled
   further from their initial release point and between location fixes than
   penned geckos. Hard-released geckos also had a larger home range size
   than penned geckos using both minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel
   methods, albeit with significant variation among individuals within each
   group. Habitat use was similar in both groups, but only hard-released
   geckos used grass, which was unexpected due to the arboreal nature of
   the species. In conclusion, our results support the use of
   penned-releases for translocations of arboreal geckos to restrict
   initial post-translocation dispersal and aid population establishment.},

Abstract = {Aim. To study the methodological aspects of accounting for expenditures
   on environmental safety and environmental restoration, the specifics of
   regulatory regulation of this area of accounting and to identify the
   main trends and problems of accounting methodology in various accounting
   systems.
   Methods. The study was conducted using theoretical system analysis,
   induction, deduction, comparative-descriptive analysis and the general
   scientific method of accounting.
   Results. The authors consider the main concepts in the accounting system
   in relation to the sources of covering the costs of environmental safety
   and environmental restoration, taking into account the current
   regulatory legal acts. Ways of solving the issue related to the need for
   a scientifically-based choice of the model of accounting for the costs
   of environmental safety and environmental restoration and for the
   formation of an effective system of financing these costs for commercial
   companies and private investors are proposed. Conclusions are drawn
   about the need to prepare an accounting standard dedicated to accounting
   for expenses and income in the field of environmental activities and
   environmental safety.
   Conclusion. The authors' proposals regarding the methodology of
   accounting for expenditures on environmental safety and environmental
   restoration will create prerequisites for the formation of a theoretical
   model for financing the ``green economy{''}.},

Abstract = {Aim. To assess the consequences of long-term consumption by pigs of feed
   experimentally contaminated with T-2 toxin in an amount dose to the most
   commonly found in feed.
   Material and Methods. The experiments were carried out on pigs, which
   were fed food contaminated with T-2 toxin in the amount of 200 mkg/kg
   for 45 days. During the experiment, the clinical condition of animals,
   feed and water consumption, the dynamics of live weight, analysis of
   blood parameters, the state of internal organs and tissues and
   statistical processing of the data obtained by conventional methods were
   undertaken.
   Results. Long-term consumption of feed contaminated with mycotoxin T-2
   by pigs did not cause a pronounced clinical picture of toxicosis.
   However, the treated animals had diarrhea and lag in growth and
   development. According to the results of the blood test, it was
   concluded that the toxin suppressed the hematopoiesis process, inhibited
   protein synthesis, reduced resistance and microphagocytic function of
   the body, metabolic disorders and the functioning of most organs and
   systems. Pathological conditions and degenerative changes of cells and
   tissues of internal organs were recorded and mediated by the initiation
   of oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and cytotoxic effect.
   Conclusions. The consumption of feed contaminated with T-2 toxin in a
   dose of 200 mkg /kg by pigs was accompanied by disturbances of metabolic
   processes, functions of organs and systems, manifested by a decrease in
   growth intensity, changes in the blood picture, activity of enzyme
   systems, induction of oxidative stress, immunosuppressive and
   inflammatory reactions and pathomorphological disorders. Thus, the oral
   intake of T-2 toxin, even in small concentrations, was found to have a
   complex negative effect on the body.},

Title = {Floral Resources Used by the Endangered Rusty Patched Bumble Bee (Bombus
   affinis) in the Midwestern United States},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The once-common rusty patched bumble bee (RPBB, Bombus affinis) has
   disappeared from most of its original range in eastern North America. As
   a result of this dramatic population decline, RPBB was listed as
   federally endangered in 2017. Unlike many endangered species, remnant
   populations of the RPBB often occur in urban/suburban parks and natural
   areas. This paper summarizes photographic records of RPBB floral use
   collected largely by volunteer community scientists in the midwestern
   United States, with a focus on Wisconsin, one of the species' remaining
   strongholds. RPBB were documented in 37 of Wisconsin's 72 counties. We
   identified flowers to genus in 772 of 803 digital images (some bees were
   not on flowers). Although 87 plant genera were identified, 76\% of the
   flowers represented just 13 genera. Over half of the flower records
   (54.6\%) were from Monarda, Eutrochium, Veronicastrum, Agastache, or
   Solidago. Incidental surveys from other states show a similar pattern,
   although additional genera have been shown to be used by RPBB. Our
   results support existing recommendations for plantings and habitat
   management favoring specific plant species, generally associated with
   native grasslands and savannas. Because the active period of RPBB covers
   a large part of the growing season, however, we also provide evidence
   for the importance of spring ephemeral woodland wildflowers (e.g.,
   Dicentra, Anemone, Hydrophyllum) and late-flowering species of wetlands
   and wet meadows (e.g., Eutrochium, Eupatorium). A landscape that
   includes woodland, native grassland, and wet meadows provides floral
   resources that support all RPBB life history stages, including
   early-season queens, late-season gynes, and males.},

Abstract = {Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma (pinon-juniper) woodlands in the
   southwestern United States are of high conservation value and are
   threatened by changing climate and increasing frequency of large, severe
   fires. We followed vegetation development after three recent fires
   (1989, 1996, and 2000) in Mesa Verde National Park (MEVE). Two types of
   pinon-juniper vegetation are found in MEVE: sprouting woodlands (SPW),
   dominated by species that resprout after injury, and obligate seeding
   woodlands (OSW), dominated by non-sprouting species. SPW stands showed
   greater resilience than OSW in terms of recovery of pre-fire structure
   and species composition, and vulnerability to invasion by nonnative
   plant species. After all three fires, plant cover increased more rapidly
   in SPW stands; all major pre-fire species were present within 2 y, and
   fewer nonnative species became established. Plant cover developed more
   slowly in OSW stands; nonnative plant species proliferated, in places
   being more abundant than the newly germinating native species. No
   reestablishment of pinon or juniper trees has been observed. If current
   trends persist, some portions of the burned SPW may be converted to a
   persistent shrubland type, while much of the burned OSW may be converted
   to a persistent, novel herbaceous vegetation type with a large component
   of nonnative species. Similar changes after fire can be expected in
   pinon-juniper woodlands like those in MEVE, which are widely distributed
   throughout the region.},

Title = {The Solar Stag of the Chamalals and Tindals and other masonry
   petroglyphs in the upper Andiiskoe Koisu region of Dagestan and their
   relationships to similar phenomena in the mountain communities of the
   Caucasus: Socio-ecological and historical perspectives},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-209},
Abstract = {Aim. Following the discovery of a number of iconographically unique
   masonry petroglyphs depicting a red deer solar stag (i.e. bearing the
   sun between its antlers) in settlements of the Chamalal ethno-linguistic
   group in the upper Andiiskoe Koisu region of the Tsumadinskiy district
   of Dagestan, the aim of the research has been: (1) to survey the region
   to ascertain whether other images of this nature existed and to
   understand the relationship of the corpus to other petroglyphs produced
   within the Avar-Ando-Dido metacultural zone and of neighbouring ethnic
   groups in the Caucasus; (2) to study the evolution and meaning to the
   community of the petroglyphic imagery and (3) to understand the
   mechanisms by which peoples of the Caucasus shared and adapted
   polytheistic belief systems arising from the deep past following their
   conversion to Christianity and Islam.Materials and Methods. Research
   activities involved field surveys of traditional buildings within the
   ethno-linguistic enclaves of the upper Andiiskoe Koisu which might
   contain masonry petroglyphs and their photographic documentation. A
   thorough survey of the scientific literature impacting on this field in
   the Caucasus was undertaken in the libraries and institutions of
   Dagestan, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. This data added to the
   documentation of masonry petroglyphs already undertaken in the Gidatli
   communities of the upper Avarskoe Koisu region.Results. Field surveys
   resulted in the discovery of more petroglyphs of the solar stag
   iconography both within Chamalal territory and that of the neighbouring
   Tindals as well as other petroglyphs of interest in neighbouring
   republics of the North Caucasus. A socio-ecological assessment of local
   habitats which might have sustained both red deer and bezoar goat (the
   principal game animals since human presence in the region) indicated
   that the bezoar goat inhabited the territories of both groups but were
   now rarely found in Chamalal lands. While red deer did inhabit the
   forests of the Tindals, it appears that they never frequented those of
   the Chamalals, who must have travelled to hunt them in forests further
   to the south. Conclusion. The research confirmed the presence of a
   unique corpus of petroglyphic imagery attesting to beliefs in a solar
   stag which may date back to period of man's re-inhabiting the upper
   Andiiskoe Koisu region in the early Holocene. Indigenous beliefs
   relating both to the red deer and the bezoar goat initially represented
   in rock face petroglyphs of the eastern Dagestan piedmonts and rock
   paintings of the mountainous regions were by the late Bronze Age
   represented on masonry blocks used in building in the Avar-Ando-Dido
   metacultural zone. As Christianity spread in Transcaucasia and the Great
   Caucasus Range, including north-western Dagestan, indigenous images
   representing the solar stag were conflated with those of the popular
   Christian cult of the Miracle of Saint Eustace, resulting in the unique
   petroglyphs of the solar stag common to the Chamalals, Tindals and the
   communities of the Gidatli area of the Avarskoe Koisu basin.},

Abstract = {Reduced tillage practices present a tool that could sustainably
   intensify agriculture. The existing literature, however, lacks a
   consensus on how and when reduced tillage practices should get
   implemented. We reanalyzed here an extensive dataset comparing how
   regular tillage practices (i.e., conventional tillage) impacted yield of
   eight crops compared to stopping tillage altogether (i.e., no-tillage
   practice). We observed that aridity and fertilization favored no tillage
   over conventional tillage whereas conventional tillage performed better
   under high fertility settings. We further show that the responses are
   consistent across the crops. Our reanalysis complements the original and
   fills a gap in the literature questioning the conditions under which
   reducing tillage presents a viable alternative to common tillage
   practices. (C) Higher Education Press 2022.},

Title = {The challenging coexistence of forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis and
   timber concessions in central AfricaMots-cles},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With a drastic decrease in their populations over the last decades,
   forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis are facing increasing human
   pressure. Their decline will have serious ecological consequences, as
   they are key actors in shaping ecosystems. Whilst timber concessions
   host many mammal species, the interactions between selective logging and
   forest elephants remain unclear. Through an extensive literature review,
   we discussed the following: 1) the ecological and human factors that
   drive the distribution of forest elephants on a large scale as well as
   in the specific context of logged forests; 2) the contribution of forest
   elephants to the regeneration of timber species; and 3) the damage
   caused by forest elephants to timber species. Although human activities
   have the greatest impact on forest elephant distribution, it is the
   availability of food, water, and minerals that locally determines their
   use of the habitat. Under specific conditions, timber concessions may
   host large populations of forest elephants. As effective seed
   dispersers, forest elephants contribute to the regeneration of at least
   41 timber species, such as Bobgunnia fistuloides (pao rosa), one of the
   most expensive woods on the market. Damage caused by forest elephants is
   diverse and affects a wide range of species. From branch breaking to
   bark stripping, at least 61 timber species are used by forest elephants,
   and little is known about the consequences for the tree's vitality and
   wood quality. The interactions between forest elephants and logging are
   complex and involve many variables, requiring additional research.
   Nevertheless, this review suggests that timber concessions constitute
   key areas for forest elephant conservation, provided that low-impact
   logging and wildlife management are implemented.},

Abstract = {We examined natural regeneration changes in an urban natural area
   forest, the Good Woods, Cobbs Creek Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
   after placement of exclusion fencing to prevent white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and unplanned North American beaver
   (Castor canadensis) felling. Seedlings (stem dbh < 2.5 cm, stump at 15
   cm < 3.0 cm), saplings (stem dbh > 2.5-10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 3.0-11
   cm), and trees (stem dbh > 10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 11 cm) were surveyed
   in 65 permanent 10 m X 10 m plots: 6 y after fencing placement to
   exclude white-tailed deer and 5 mo after the start of beaver felling.
   Overall seedling abundance increased by 5\% while sapling populations
   grew by 20\% and the number of trees expanded by 34\% after white-tailed
   deer exclusion. Red maple (Ater rubrum) seedlings, tulip poplar
   (Liriodendron tulipifera) seedlings, and red oak (Quercus rubra)
   saplings increased significantly while pignut hickory (Carya glabra) and
   white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings decreased significantly.
   Seedling and tree losses to North American beaver felling were small
   (<2\% for all seedlings and <3\% for all trees). However, beaver felling
   caused a greater than 60\% loss of saplings for red maple, black cherry
   (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), and red oak. Less than 30\%
   of the saplings were lost for pignut hickory, white ash, and tulip
   poplar. Urban North American beaver preferences for native species
   saplings paralleled rural beaver in the eastern United States. Our
   results indicate white-tailed deer exclusion fencing is an effective
   management method for increasing natural regeneration of both seedlings
   and saplings in an urban natural area forest when the fencing also
   effectively excludes North American beaver.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In any natural area, the seasonally changing needs and interactions of
   each individual species from the microbiota to plants, invertebrates,
   and vertebrates are largely unknown. Completing individual management
   plans and actions for every species is patently unachievable. Accepting
   this complexity and uncertainty, we submit that returning the formative
   interactions of water, fire, and predation/herbivory are the keys to
   sustaining habitats for all species, even those for which we have
   absolutely no data. We also contend that management of the interactions
   of natural processes that support an entire flora and fauna can be
   resolved with guidance from ``tuning{''} plant species. Tuning plant
   species are those most affected when natural processes are altered.
   Analogous to tuning a violin for the best sound or an engine to run
   smoothly, tuning plant species guide the adjustment of processes. Tuning
   plants can teach us how the interactions of natural processes work in
   ecological systems and give direction for management practices.},

Abstract = {Soil science is an inherently diverse and multidisciplinary subject that
   cannot develop further without the continuous introduction and promotion
   of emerging technologies. One such technology that is widely used in
   biomedicine and similar research fields, microfluidics, poses
   significant benefits for soil research; however, this technology is
   still underutilized in the field. Microfluidics offers unparalleled
   opportunities in soil bacterial cultivation, observation, and
   manipulation when compared to conventional approaches to these tasks.
   This review focuses on the use of microfluidics for bacteria research
   and, where possible, pulls from examples in the literature where the
   technologies were used for soil related research. The review also
   provides commentary on the use of microfluidics for soil bacteria
   research and discusses the key challenges researchers face when
   implementing this technology. We believe that microfluidic chips and
   their associated auxiliary technologies provide a prime inroad into the
   future of soil science research. (C) Higher Education Press 2022},

Title = {Responses of soil microbial carbon use efficiency to warming: Review and
   prospects},
Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an important factor driving
   soil carbon (C) dynamics. However, microbial CUE could positively,
   negatively, or neutrally respond to increased temperature, which limits
   our prediction of soil C storage under future climate warming.
   Experimental warming affects plant production and microbial communities,
   which thus can have a significant impact on biogeochemical cycles of
   terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we reviewed the present research status of
   methods measuring microbial CUE and the response of microbial CUE to the
   changes of biotic and abiotic factors induced by warming. Overall,
   current measurement methods mainly include metabolic flux analysis,
   calorespirometry, stoichiometric model, C-13 and O-18 labeling.
   Differences in added substrate types can lead to an overestimation or
   underestimation on microbial CUE, particularly when using the C-13
   labeling method. In addition, changes in the dominant microbial
   community under warming may also affect CUE. However, there is still
   uncertainty in CUE characteristics of different microorganisms.
   Microbial CUE is generally decreased under warming conditions as
   microbes are subjected to water stress or soil labile organic matter is
   much more depleted compared to ambient conditions. In contrast,
   considering that warming increases soil nutrient availability, warming
   may enhance microbial CUE by alleviating nutrient limitations for
   microbes. In conclusion, the response of microbial CUE to warming is
   more complex than expected. The microbial growth and physiological
   adaptation to environmental stress under warming is one of the main
   reasons for the inconsistence in microbial CUE response. Finally, we
   propose five aspects where further research could improve the
   understanding of microbial CUE in a warmer world, including using new
   technologies, establishing multi-factor interactive experiments,
   building a network of experimental research platform for warming, and
   strengthening studies on response of CUE to warming at different soil
   depths and on different temporal scales. (C) Higher Education Press 2022},

Abstract = {Aim. An assessment and cartographical analysis of landscape-ecological
   stability in agricultural regions of Ural and West Siberia, subjects of
   Asian Russia, using eight steppe areas as an example.
   Material and Methods. An assessment of landscape-ecological stability
   through calculating the coefficient of the ecological stability of a
   landscape on the base of the conjugate analysis of 13 indicators grouped
   into two blocks - stable and unstable landscape components. Monitoring
   of the state of an agricultural area using the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) of crops on the base of Earth remote sensing.
   Results. Specific territorial features and inter-regional relations were
   determined according to separate landscape components. A schematic map
   reflecting the state of ecological stability was formulated; it was
   shown that this rises the more easterly the location.
   Conclusion. The Tyumen region is distinguished by clearly expressed
   ecological stability, which is also well expressed in the Novosibirsk
   region. Most other regions are characterized by a conditionally stable
   state. The Orenburg region's landscapes are in an unstable state. Arable
   lands are characterized by the most instability among unstable
   components of a landscape. The coefficient of landscape ecological
   stability (CESL) is tightly connected with the proportion of tillage in
   a region's total area. It rises with the reduction of a tillage area in
   74\% of cases studied. Withdrawal from cultivation of unstable and
   degraded lands during the intensification of agriculture in highly
   fertile areas and transfer to fodder lands (including protected areas),
   which contribute to an increase in the proportion of stable landscape
   elements, can be considered as the main direction for increasing their
   stability and preserving biological diversity.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {113-126},
Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the study is to group municipalities by the volume (or
   scale) of municipal economies.
   Materials and Methods. On the basis of indicators of the volume of
   agricultural, industrial products, retail trade, investments, the
   cluster differentiation of municipal districts was carried out.
   According to the prevalence and combination of indicators, the sector is
   divided into 8 duster groups: highly developed industrial, highly
   developed commercial, industrial and agricultural, commercial and
   agricultural, trade and logistics, agroindustrial, agricultural,
   depressed underdeveloped and single large oil producing.
   Results. According to the results of clustering, certain peculiarities
   were revealed: more highly developed districts gravitating towards
   administrative urban centers and major transport arteries. In the west
   and east of the mesoregion, two axes of advanced development have
   formed: the South Ural and Altai Siberian.
   Conclusion. In considering the forest-steppe and steppes of the Urals
   and Siberia, they were compared with other natural zones that are part
   of the subjects of the federation studied. Depressed areas are
   concentrated in the centre of the mesoregion: in the Kurgan region and
   in the north of the Omsk region, and also gravitate towards the state
   border with Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Comparison of footprint tracking and pitfall trapping for detecting
   skinks},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Inventory and monitoring of biodiversity requires effective sampling
   tools. Footprint tracking tunnels, developed in New Zealand to monitor
   small mammals, may also be useful for sampling lizards and other
   reptiles but more research is needed to verify this. To that end, we
   compared the detectability of terrestrial skinks using two methods:
   pitfall trapping and footprint tracking. In New Zealand, the former is
   the traditional method for sampling skinks, while the latter is
   routinely used to monitor populations of introduced rodents and
   mustelids. In January 2019, we operated paired grids containing 5 x 5
   arrays of pitfall traps and standard rodent tracking tunnels on Tiwai
   Peninsula in Southland, South Island, and compared the daily proportions
   of traps and tunnels that detected skinks via captures and footprints,
   respectively. Overall, tracking tunnels were approximately twice as
   likely to detect skinks as pitfall traps. Additional research is
   required to: (1) test the relative efficacy of footprint tracking versus
   conventional detection methods on other lizard and reptile species; (2)
   investigate alternative tunnel designs and long-life lures; and, (3)
   calibrate footprint tracking rates against density estimates to assess
   suitability for monitoring.},

Title = {Factors affecting home range size of feral cats: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Managing invasive species requires knowledge of their ecology, including
   distribution, habitat use, and home range. In particular, understanding
   how biotic and abiotic factors influence home range can help with pest
   management decision-making, as well as informing native species
   management. Feral cats, self-sustaining cat populations that live
   independently of people, have caused numerous extinctions and continue
   to adversely affect native species globally. Managing feral cat
   populations requires spatially explicit knowledge to enable strategic
   deployment of management or monitoring devices, understand where native
   species are most likely to be at risk, and to mitigate the spread of
   cat-vectored diseases such as toxoplasmosis. Here, we present a
   meta-analysis of factors that influence feral cat home range size
   including land use types, differing levels of land use heterogeneity,
   and numbers of competitors. Male feral cats had larger home ranges than
   females, but effects of season, competitors, habitat heterogeneity, or
   land use on feral cat home range were not statistically significant,
   possibly due to high variability (male cat home range: 22.1 to 3232 ha;
   female cat home range: 9.6 to 2078 ha). This may reflect the fact that
   cats are generalists and are able to exploit any opportunity. Thus, we
   recommend that these factors and others, such as prey availability and
   composition, should be included in future research, so that the
   variability in home range size can be better understood. Improved
   understanding is vital for improving feral cat management in ecosystems
   where cats have been introduced.},

Title = {Soil inorganic carbon sequestration through alkalinity regeneration
   using biologically induced weathering of rock powder and biochar},
Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) accounts for about half of the C reserves
   worldwide and is considered more stable than soil organic carbon (SOC).
   However, soil acidification, driven mainly by nitrogen (N) fertilization
   can accelerate SIC losses, possibly leading to complete loss under
   continuous and intensive N fertilization. Carbonate-free soils are less
   fertile, productive, and more prone to erosion. Therefore, minimizing
   carbonate losses is essential for soil health and climate change
   mitigation. Rock/mineral residues or powder have been suggested as a
   cheaper source of amendments to increase soil alkalinity. However, slow
   mineral dissolution limits its efficient utilization. Soil
   microorganisms play a vital role in the weathering of rocks and their
   inoculation with mineral residues can enhance dissolution rates. Biochar
   is an alternative material for soil amendments, in particular, bone
   biochar (BBC) contains higher Ca and Mg that can induce even higher
   alkalinity. This review covers i) the contribution and mechanism of rock
   residues in alkalinity generation, ii) the role of biochar or BBC to
   soil alkalinity, and iii) the role of microbial inoculation for
   accelerating alkalinity generation through enhanced mineral dissolution.
   We conclude that using rock residues/BBC combined with microbial agents
   could mitigate soil acidification and SIC losses and also improve
   agricultural circularity. (C) Higher Education Press 2022},

Title = {Soil macrofaunal communities develop a habitat-specific trophic
   structure dependent on the degree of degradation of alpine wetlands},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {416-428},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The alpine wetlands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have degraded in
   recent decades. However, the response of the soil food web to the
   degradation is still unclear. Four habitats including a wet meadow (WM),
   a grassland meadow (GM), a moderately degraded meadow (MDM) and a
   severely degraded meadow (SDM) (sandy meadows) were selected along the
   degrees of degradation. The soil macrofaunal biomass and the
   environmental factors of vegetation and soil were investigated. The soil
   macrofaunal community biomass increased significantly from WM to MDM and
   decreased to a very small amount in SDM, with most taxa disappearing.
   The biomass of the trophic groups of detritivores, herbivores and
   predators exhibited similar responses to soil macrofaunal communities.
   The relative biomass of detritivores increased from WM to MDM, but
   herbivores responded in an opposite manner, resulting in the dominant
   trophic group and trophic structure varying progressively from WM to GM
   to MDM. Soil properties but not vegetation determined the changes in
   trophic groups and trophic structure. The results implied that the
   higher trophic levels (carnivores or omnivores) responded more
   sensitively than the lower trophic levels (herbivores) to alpine wetland
   degradation. Our results also suggested that soil macrofauna have a
   habitat-specific characteristic trophic structure and can be used as
   indicators of soil health conditions. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

Abstract = {The accumulation of soil organic matter and nutrients is an important
   pathway in effectively understanding the mechanisms of plant settlement
   and rock weathering, while the characteristics of soil organic carbon
   (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) under different vegetation remain
   unclear. In this study, the stocks and stoichiometry of soil organic C,
   N and P were determined in different positions and types of vegetation
   on the surface of the Leshan Giant Buddha. We found that the total
   stocks of soil organic C, N and P were 1689.77, 134.6 and 29.48 kg,
   respectively, for the Buddha. The stocks of soil organic C, N and P
   under vascular plants were higher than those under other vegetation,
   with highest values observed under herb. Higher stocks per unit area
   (m(2)) of soil organic C, N and P were found on the left and right arms,
   shoulders, and two platforms. These results provide a full primary
   picture in understanding soil organic C, N and P accumulation and
   distribution on the surface of the Buddha, which could supply the
   fundamental data on weathering management of the Buddha and other
   similar open-air stone carvings. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

Title = {Factors Related to Crappie Indices of Abundance in a Large, Fluctuating
   Canyon Reservoir in Idaho},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {210-224},
Abstract = {Crappie (Pomoxis spp.) populations are challenging to manage due to
   highly variable year-class strength; however, such variability has
   rarely been investigated in western North America, where crappie often
   occupy large, steep-sided reservoirs prone to severe drawdown. We
   investigated the influence that various factors had on crappie
   abundance, as indexed by long-term trawling for larval fish and
   long-term electrofishing for older fish. Our primary findings were that:
   1) autumn age-0 crappie abundance was higher in years when larval
   abundance and reservoir flow were higher in the summer, 2) spring age-1
   crappie abundance was higher in years when fish were larger and more
   abundant entering their first winter, when hydraulic residence time was
   reduced and the reservoir volume was higher during the winter, and when
   predatory-sized smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were more
   abundant in the spring (though the latter relationship was likely not
   causative but rather a parallel response to mutually advantageous
   environmental conditions in the reservoir); and 3) age-0 crappie
   entering their first winter were larger in years with lower summer
   larval crappie abundance and wanner summer water temperature. We
   recommend autumn electrofishing to monitor crappie populations in large
   canyon reservoirs, where shorelines arc often too steep to sample fish
   with trap nets, because it provides an index of age-0 crappie abundance
   and size at the onset of their first winter as well as data on older
   crappie year classes and sympatric species; it also requires less
   sampling effort than summer trawling.},

Title = {Toxin-laced rat carcass baits for stoat elimination},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Stoats are implicated in the severe decline of certain iconic endemic
   species in New Zealand. Stoats are notoriously difficult to control, as
   they are highly cryptic and often neophobic around control techniques
   such as traps and poison baits in tunnels. Stoats are often killed
   through secondary poisoning in both aerial and hand-lay operations
   targeting other mammalian pests. We prototype trialled a novel approach
   to poisoning of stoats: wild-caught ship rats that had consumed (and
   subsequently died from) a lethal dose of 1080 cereal baits in a captive
   facility. Stoats in the treatment area were targeted at food-lured (egg
   mayonnaise) camera trap sites that had multiple stoat visitations prior
   to baiting with toxic rat carcasses. Stoats were recorded taking toxic
   rat carcass baits from 7 out of 15 hand-laid sites. No other species
   were observed taking toxic rat carcasses during the study. The number of
   cameras in the treatment area that detected stoats was significantly
   reduced for 30 days after toxic baiting. There was no significant
   difference in number of cameras that detected stoats during this period
   in the non-treatment area. These results suggest that 94\% of the stoats
   in the treatment area were poisoned using toxin-laced rat carcasses
   within one week of baiting. Toxic rat carcass baits placed at locations
   of known stoat activity may be a highly successful method of eliminating
   individual stoats at very low density.},

Abstract = {Land management decisions have profound impacts on biological
   communities. Various administrative units are likely to implement
   different management decisions, with the result that consistent
   biological patterns that track administrative boundaries may emerge. To
   assess these relationships, we collected data on land cover, disturbance
   evidence, and tree communities in randomized sampling sites located in
   National Park, US Forest Service Wilderness, and US Forest Service
   Non-wilderness distributed across the Great Smoky Mountains National
   Park Protected AreaCentered Ecosystem (GRSM PACE). We examined how
   present-day values for these ecological responses were linked to both
   biophysical site characteristics (as the foundation for ecological
   communities) and jurisdiction type (as categories that integrate the
   combination of dynamic social decisions and management practices since
   initial designation). The variable representing administrative unit,
   jurisdiction type, acted as an umbrella indicator of the management
   trajectory and social influences that have affected a site and emerged
   as an important predictor of groundcover types (grass and litter), tree
   diversity, and wildlife sign at sites across the GRSM PACE. This was an
   exploratory study with limited sample size, so more data are needed to
   explore the mechanisms driving these relationships. These initial
   findings, however, suggest that differences in management activities
   alter the ecological trajectory of sites across the PACE. Given dynamic
   and diverse management practices, our data suggest jurisdiction overlaid
   on biophysical site information may be useful to rapidly assess how
   socially defined landscape activities impact biological responses,
   particularly when both are stressed by global change.},

Title = {Feeding ecology and epizootological value of the Great Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax carbo) during the secondary expansion of the Baikal
   region},

Abstract = {Aim. To research the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo L., 1758)
   ecology during the secondary expansion of the Baikal region.
   Material and Methods. The material for studying cormorant nutrition was
   28 stomachs of harvested birds, visual observations of feeding
   cormorants using optical equipment, as well as regurgitated burps of
   nutrition obtained by a bloodless method when being fed to chicks. 21
   examples of cormorants were the subjects of the parasitological
   research.
   Results. The number of the species has been growing since the beginning
   of the XXI century and, starting from 2020/21, is likely to stabilize,
   remaining at a high level. This indicates the gradual integration of the
   species into the Baikal Lake ecosystem. The main food item of Cormorants
   are the non-commercial fish, Sleeper (Percottus glehni Dyb.), Perch
   (Perca floviatilis L.) and Roach (Rutilus rutilus L.). Parasitological
   studies have revealed 8 species of helminths from three classes with
   varying degrees of invasion. Only one of them, Contracaecum osculatum
   baicalensis (Mosgovoy et Ryjikov, 1950), is endemic and potentially
   dangerous to human health (its infection rate can reach 80\%).
   Conclusion. The Great Cormorant is an obligate, but not a specialized
   ichthyophage, focused on the prevailing fish species. Great Cormorants
   as hosts of ticks, helminths and other ecto- and endoparasites are
   potentially sources of threat to the occurrence and spread, primarily,
   of ornithoses and helminthiasis in the Baikal region and possibly of
   other diseases carried from their wintering places.},

Title = {Do mice matter? Impacts of house mice alone on invertebrates, seedlings
   and fungi at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The advent of mammal-resistant fences has allowed multi-species
   eradications of mammals from ecosanctuaries on the New Zealand mainland.
   However, maintaining eradication of house mice (Mus musculus) has proven
   difficult, and at some fenced reserves they are the only exotic mammal
   present and reach a high population density. Over 5 years we examined
   the impacts of mice alone on biodiversity at Sanctuary Mountain
   Maungatautari by comparing forest blocks with relatively high and low
   numbers of mice. We managed two independently fenced sites within the
   sanctuary to achieve high mouse numbers (up to 46 per hectare) at one
   site and undetectable mouse numbers at the second site. We then reversed
   these treatments by eradicating mice from the first site and allowing
   their numbers to increase at the second. We found strong evidence that
   mice reduced the abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates, in
   particular caterpillars, spiders, weta, and beetles, and reduced the
   mean body size of some taxa. In addition, earthworm abundance, biomass
   and species richness increased with a decreasing mouse population in one
   study block. No significant impact of mice on land snails, seedlings or
   fungi was detected at Maungatautari. Overall, there is substantial
   biodiversity gain from eradicating the full suite of pest mammals other
   than mice. However, mice may be catastrophic in ecosanctuaries that
   focus on the recovery of invertebrates or lizards. We expect that mouse
   control tools will steadily improve so that in the future mice can be
   eradicated and excluded from forest reserves such as Maungatautari.},

Title = {Applying ecological research to improve long-term outcomes of wilding
   conifer management},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Removing wilding conifers (invasive non-native trees in the Pinaceae)
   has become a major focus of conservation and land management in Aotearoa
   New Zealand. Management of wilding conifers has been supported by
   applied research on control methods, generally with a short-term focus
   of removing or containing invasions to prevent further spread. However,
   a focus on short-term management activities may not achieve desired
   longer-term outcomes of restoring economic and environmental values.
   Greater integration of ecological research on wilding conifer impacts
   and legacies with management can help to ensure long-term goals are
   achieved. We review how impacts and legacies of wilding conifers develop
   and persist over time. Several key thresholds or tipping points are
   identified, where prioritising management may avoid state-changes in
   ecosystems. We then review the potential of sites to support different
   land uses after wilding conifers have been controlled, including
   pasture, plantations and native restoration, and develop a decision
   support tree to guide successful transition to these land uses. We find
   that maintaining anthropogenic native tussock grasslands is unlikely to
   be a sustainable goal on most invaded sites without major sustained
   management interventions. Native woody cover is likely more sustainable,
   but often requires additional management of post-removal legacies of
   wilding conifers, including other invasive plants such as sward-forming
   non-native grasses. Shade tolerant wilding conifers, such as
   Douglas-fir, remain a pernicious problem in any effort to prevent
   reinvasion into woody vegetation. Although there are still questions
   about the causes and consequences of wilding conifer invasions,
   ecological research can provide helpful guidance to improve long-term
   outcomes following wilding conifer control.},

Abstract = {Rhizosphere effects play crucial roles in determining soil carbon (C)
   and nitrogen (N) cycling. However, the rhizosphere effect on soil gross
   nitrogen (N) mineralization (N-min) has not been quantitatively assessed
   on the global scale. Here we performed a meta-analysis of compiled data
   from 24 publications and 37 species to synthesize the rhizosphere effect
   on soil gross N-min and its influencing factors. We found that the
   rhizosphere effect significantly enhanced soil gross N-min by 81\% on
   average. Such rhizosphere effect was significantly higher in woody
   species than in non-woody species, and higher in ECM (ectomycorrhizal)
   associated species than in AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) associated
   species. Moreover, the variations of the rhizosphere effect on soil
   gross N-min were correlated with those on soil C mineralization, phenol
   oxidase activity and root biomass rather than with other plant (growth
   form and mycorrhizal association) and climatic (mean annual temperature
   and precipitation) factors. These results support the `microbial
   activation' and `microbial N mining' hypotheses of rhizosphere effects
   and indicate the coupling of soil C and gross N mineralization in the
   rhizosphere. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the
   rhizosphere effect on soil gross N-min among plant growth forms and
   mycorrhizal associations, and improve our mechanistic understanding of
   soil N dynamics in the rhizosphere. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We are only beginning to understand the influence of agricultural
   practices, together with soil properties and geographic factors, affect
   bacterial communities and their influence on the soil processes. Here,
   we quantify how typical agro-practices, i.e., no-tillage, ridge tillage,
   continuous corn cropping, and crop rotation with corn and bean, and the
   corresponding soil physicochemical characteristics affect bacterial
   diversity and community compositions of the rhizosphere and root zone
   soils. Results show that species richness in the rhizosphere was
   significantly higher than that in the root zone soils (p < 0.05),
   typically with more abundant Crenarchaeota and Firmicutes populations
   that are active members for C and N cycling. Specifically, crop rotation
   compared to other agro-practices was able to mediate soil pH value and
   the available P and thereby control the bacterial diversity pattern in
   the rhizosphere (p < 0.05), while tillage practices regulated the
   relative abundance of bacterial populations in root zone soils by
   varying the soil available N (p < 0.05). Analysis of biomarker patterns
   suggests that the observed differences in bacterial functional
   capabilities (e.g., nutrient cycling) are strongly related to the
   physicochemical properties of surrounding soils. Our results highlight
   the importance of soil-plant interaction in shaping soil bacterial
   community structure typically in the rhizosphere and root zone soils and
   also illustrates the challenges in linking soil ecosystem function to
   microbial processes. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

   Systematic Review},

Abstract = {Invasive species are recognized as one of the biggest threats to
   biodiversity and dealing with them is a daunting challenge for protected
   area managers. Prioritization based on multiple criteria has been
   traditionally recommended as essential for the effective management of
   invasive species. A systematic literature review was undertaken to
   assess to what extent the scientific literature provides guidelines for
   implementing priority systems as part of management strategies for
   invasive plants in protected areas. We detected only 27 studies
   published up to 2019 reporting some kind of prioritization. Most of them
   were limited to a list of species built from a combination of biological
   information extracted from literature and data on the extent and effects
   of their presence in the area. Our review also revealed that risk
   analysis has been commonly confounded with prioritization tools. Despite
   the generalized recognition of the impact of invasive plants on
   biodiversity, managers of protected areas lack readily applicable
   support from scientific literature to set up prioritization schemes.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {28-36},
Abstract = {Aim. This research aims to study the Great Tit breeding density,
   depending on the distance from preferred wintering sites with all other
   things being equal. Material and Methods. 36 route counts were carried
   out in 22 locations ranging up to 95 km away from the preferred
   wintering sites. The data was collected in the same weather and climatic
   zone. The route counts were carried out in the wintering season
   (January) and in the breeding season (16 April - 15 May) in 2014-2018.
   To consider the influence of small settlements, where a smaller number
   of tits spends winter in comparison with a large city, sample sites were
   characterized by the population of people living within a radius of 25
   km around the sample site. Results. Most Great Tits prefer to minimise
   the distance from their wintering sites to their nesting sites. The most
   preferred distance of seasonal movement is 10-20 km from a large city,
   the main wintering place for this species. Conclusions. The density of
   the Great Tit population during the nesting period increases
   exponentially with the proximity of wintering sites. When more than 20
   km from wintering sites, the density of the species during the nesting
   period does not change reliably. The maximum immanent density during the
   nesting period is achieved in places of favourable wintering of the
   species, that is, in a metropolis with agglomeration.},

Title = {``University of the People{''} - the third mission of Dagestan State
   University: an innovative approach to sustainability policy},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {182-199},
Abstract = {Aim. To develop an effective and innovative policy approach to Dagestan
   State University's third mandated mission to support sustainable
   community development by acknowledging and enhancing through specialist
   education the undervalued knowledge capital inherent in individuals and
   organizations throughout the community.
   Discussion. Dagestan State University has 90 years of experience in
   providing support for the people of Dagestan in scientific research and
   higher education and is cognizant of the deep reservoir of community
   knowledge and competencies in articulating aspirations for sustainable
   development. On this basis, the university's Institute of Ecology and
   Sustainable Development is instituting an innovative community
   engagement program, the University of the People, to deliver effective
   scientific support for such development through co-creative
   collaborations which draw on and enhance community knowledge in the
   diverse regions of the republic. In consultation with the administration
   and community stakeholders of the alpine Tsumadinskiy district of the
   Dagestan Caucasus, through the present policy document a launch phase of
   the University of the People program has been formulated for 2022 which
   will provide year-long local vocational guidance to schools and an
   annual ``Summer Field Faculty{''} which will undertake research,
   developmental needs analysis and offer in-service specialist training
   opportunities and support for local experts and administrations in
   implementing their desired sustainability initiatives. Following
   literature research and fieldwork in 2020-2021, the first outcome of the
   regional sustainability initiative, ``Conserving the Koisu: Sustaining
   the Mountain Fastness of the Upper Andiiskoe River - A Uniquely
   Surviving Socio-Ecological Continuum in the Dagestan Caucasus{''}, has
   been completed
   Conclusion. Implementation of the University of the People concept has
   the potential to effectively harness the vast resources of traditional
   knowledge of individuals and local bodies in regional sustainable
   development by providing communities with concrete support and
   interaction of university specialists and educators in ecology and
   sustainable development. It is hoped that the program will stimulate and
   enable members of the community to themselves attain tertiary
   qualifications in these fields, who, in turn, will create a future
   knowledge resource for continuing local applications of sustainable
   development principles. The concept has potential for application to
   other societies in the Caspian region which share similar histories and
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Florida freshwater herbaceous marshes are inundated approximately 610

   Sanctuary and Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed Management Area
   treated willows in marshes from 2008 to 2016 with helicopter herbicide
   treatments and mechanical shredding. Our objective was to determine if
   treatments were shifting vegetation closer to a desirable marsh
   community with burnable fuels. Untreated areas were compared with (1)
   all herbicide and all mechanical treatments, (2) imazapyr/glyphosate
   mixes and other herbicides, primarily glyphosate, and (3) three
   imazapyr/glyphosate combination mixing rates. Mechanical treatment areas
   had more desirable vegetation and grasses/sedges than herbicided areas.
   Herbicided areas had more cattails (Typha spp., a nuisance species), and
   less sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) and grasses/sedges than
   untreated areas. Imazapyr/glyphosate and other herbicides (mostly
   glyphosate) had less cover of sawgrass and grasses/sedges than untreated
   areas, and other herbicides also had less desirable species cover than
   untreated areas. Sample size was small, but the strongest
   imazapyr/glyphosate mix had more cattails and the weakest mix had less
   willow than untreated areas, while both had less grasses/sedges than
   untreated areas. Although more expensive and difficult, mechanical
   treatments better retained and/or restored desirable marsh vegetation,
   which was our primary objective. Sawgrass and other grasses and sedges
   are excellent fuels for burning. Mechanical treatments also have
   significantly more cover of grasses and sedges than herbicide
   treatments, increasing the ability to burn hot and frequently.},

Abstract = {The community composition and activity-density of termites can influence
   nutrient cycling and other ecological functions. However, the spatial
   distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in
   tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution
   patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their
   co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) plot, and their
   correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol
   to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding
   groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders,
   soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the
   environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass,
   and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the
   highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil
   feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers
   demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak
   correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most
   of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high
   TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined
   environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and
   distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests. (C)

Abstract = {Aotearoa New Zealand's conservation management has had a strong focus on
   offshore islands, though this investment is at risk from
   human-influenced factors such as biosecurity incursions and wildfire.
   During the last century several wildfires have occurred on Moutohora
   (Whale Island), Bay of Plenty, which is a location for six threatened
   plant and three threatened animal species. Conservation and cultural
   management on Moutohora over the last several decades has restored the
   island to become the most densely vegetated it has been since before
   humans arrived, albeit with a very different composition. The Prometheus
   fire-growth simulation model was used to produce a series of
   deterministic fire extent maps, which were compiled into seasonal burn
   probability maps. The average simulated fire extent was 53.2 ha, with a
   maximum area of 129.9 ha (or approx. 84\% of the entire island), with
   23\% of fires not growing past 0.01 ha. Fires that start in summer, the
   western end of the island, and in manuka and/or kanuka had the highest
   mean and maximum fire extent. Burn probability maps are a key step in
   quantifying the spatial fire risk for important conservation locations
   such as Moutohora.},

Abstract = {Aim. To carry out an ecological and faunistic review of weevils of the
   tribe Baridini Schoencherr, 1836 of Dagestan; study of the ecology and
   chorology of the most harmful species, the green rutabaga baride
   (Aulacobaris coerulescens Scop.).
   Material and Methods. The work was based on observations and materials
   obtained in 1996-2020 in various regions of Dagestan, using classical
   methods of field study of invertebrates. Collection materials and data
   from different authors for the period from 1872 to 2010 were also used.
   Stationary studies of the ecology of Aulacobaris coerulescens Scopoli,
   1763 were conducted on the basis of agricultural cooperatives and
   peasant farms of Buynaksky, Levashinsky, Akushinsky and Gergebilsky
   districts of Dagestan.
   Results. Studies have shown that the fauna of the tribe Baridini in
   Dagestan is represented by 26 species from 8 genera. In zoogeographic
   terms, it is composed of 7 complexes with the main core being formed by
   steppe species. In the attitudinal range, the fauna of lowland Dagestan
   is the richest, where 20 species live. Trophic specialization is
   dominated by broad oligophages; the main food base is the Brassicaceae
   family. The most important agricultural species and dangerous pest of
   cabbage in Dagestan is the green rutabaga baride (Aulacoboris
   coerulescens Scopoli, 1763). The features of its ecology and
   distribution were studied and a phenological table and a map of the
   range were compiled.
   Conclusion. The fauna of the Baridini tribe of Dagestan is rich and
   varied. It is represented by various zoogeographical and ecological
   complexes in all attitudinal zones of Dagestan. Phenological data and a
   distribution map of rutabaga baride can be used to optimize control
   measures and minimize impacts on ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by soil bacteria, for instance
   antimicrobials and siderophores, play a vital role in bacterial
   adaptation to soil and root ecosystems and can contribute to plant
   health. Many SMs are non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides, assembled
   by non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase
   (PKS) and encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Despite their
   ecological importance, little is known about the occurrence and
   diversity of NRPs and PKs in soil. We extracted NRPS- and PKS-encoding
   BGCs from 20 publicly available soil and root-associated metagenomes and
   annotated them using antiSMASH-DB. We found that the overall abundance
   of NRPSs and PKSs is similar in both environments, however NRPSs and
   PKSs were significantly clustered between soil and root samples.
   Moreover, the majority of identified sequences were unique to either
   soil- or root-associated datasets and had low identity to known BGCs,
   suggesting their novelty. Overall, this study illuminates the huge
   untapped diversity of predicted SMs in soil and root microbiomes, and
   indicates presence of specific SMs, which may play a role in inter- and
   intra-bacterial interactions in root ecosystems. (C) Higher Education

Abstract = {This study aims to quantitatively assess the total organic carbon (TOC)
   and total nitrogen (TN) content of reservoir sediments in southwest
   China using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS). FTIRS
   measurements were performed on 187 sediment samples from four reservoirs
   to develop calibration models that relate FTIR spectral information with
   conventional property concentrations using partial least squares
   regression (PLSR). Robust calibration models were established for TOC
   and TN content. The external validation of these models yielded a
   significant correlation between FTIR-inferred and conventionally
   measured concentrations of R-2 = 0.88 for TOC, R-2 = 0.90 for TN. This
   method can be performed with a small sample size and is non-destructive
   throughout the simple measurement process. The TOC and TN content in the
   sediment can be determined with high effectiveness without being overly
   expensive, making it an advantageous method when measuring a large
   number of samples. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

Title = {Canopy Cover and Canopy Heterogeneity Drive Plant Alpha Diversity but
   Not Beta Diversity in a Midwest Oak Savanna},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Midwest oak savannas contain some of the highest plant diversity in the
   United States and are among the rarest terrestrial ecosystems globally.
   Consequently, understanding diversity patterns within these ecosystems
   is important for setting management and restoration goals. This study
   aimed to understand the role of canopy cover and heterogeneity in canopy
   cover in influencing plant alpha and beta diversity within oak savanna
   ecosystems. This study took place in the black oak savannas of the
   Indiana Dunes along the southern shores of Lake Michigan in NW Indiana,
   USA. We sampled twenty-nine 1000 m(2) plots with gradients in canopy
   cover and canopy heterogeneity across the Indiana Dunes to examine the
   influence of canopy cover and canopy heterogeneity on plant diversity.
   Woody plant alpha diversity was highest in areas with a high canopy
   cover (>75\%). C3 graminoids, C4 graminoids, and sedge alpha diversity
   were highest in low canopy cover areas (<25\%). Forb and legume alpha
   diversity were highest with low to intermediate canopy cover (25-50\%
   and 20-35\%). Overall, plant alpha diversity was highest at intermediate
   canopy cover. High canopy heterogeneity was associated with high alpha
   diversity. There was no relationship between canopy cover or canopy
   heterogeneity with beta diversity. However, beta diversity was
   exceptionally high within all sites. An average canopy cover of 25-50\%
   is the optimal cover for promoting high plant diversity across many
   functional groups. Still, low and high canopy cover sites are also
   important for maximizing diversity of some functional groups. Therefore,
   we recommend managing oak savannas for 25-50\% canopy cover to maximize
   diversity, but where opportunities exist in large remnants of oak
   savanna, maintaining some areas with few trees and other areas with
   closed canopies can maximize diversity on a landscape scale.},

Abstract = {Aim. This work aims to study the distribution arid stocks of crayfish on
   the eastern shelf of the Caspian Sea at places where they mostly
   habitat.
   Material and Methods. The studies were implemented in the spring and
   summer of 2019. The material was collected by scuba divers surveying
   routes of transects 100 m(2) in area. Collected crayfish were identified
   at species level, measured, weighed and their fertility was evaluated.
   Their abundance was calculated by estimating the aggregation density
   along the routes (ind/m(2)), with subsequent recalculation for the
   biotope areas, which were identified using data from the Caspian Sea
   satellite monitoring. The stocks were estimated according to the size
   and weight characteristics of collected individuals.
   Results. Two astacid species inhabit the surveyed area: Pontastacus
   eichwald Bott - long-clawed crayfish and Caspiastacus pachypus Rathke -
   thick-clawed crayfish. Certain changes have occurred compared with
   archival data of the 1970s-1990s. The range area has expanded and the
   abundance of C. pachypus has increased. The fertility of both C.
   pachypus and P. eichwald has reduced.
   Conclusion. The crayfish stocks in the surveyed area are of commercial
   importance. The application of satellite survey data greatly increases
   the objectivity of research.},

Abstract = {Conservation across jurisdictional boundaries can help achieve recovery
   goals for species at risk, provide funding for conservation actions by
   private landowners, and reduce regulatory burdens. Habitat crediting
   programs, a type of offsite mitigation, are a relatively new form of
   cross-boundary conservation. To better understand the current status of
   these programs and their perceived strengths and shortcomings for
   species conservation, credit providers (e.g., private landowners), and
   credit purchasers (e.g., federal agencies), we surveyed the literature
   and online resources, and engaged with a small group of professionals
   who have been closely involved with habitat crediting programs. From
   these resources and interactions, we identified nine habitat crediting
   programs in the United States. Those engaged in these programs suggest
   that the programs may provide regulatory relief, a positive return on
   investment for participants, and benefits to species conservation in
   some contexts. However, economic and institutional challenges include
   up-front costs of participation and divergent preferences for short-term
   or permanent contracts. Furthermore, programs tend to measure ecological
   success by monitoring habitat amount and condition rather than species'
   abundance, survival, and reproduction. As such, monitoring is not always
   sufficiently rigorous to assess ecological outcomes and account for
   environmental change. We suggest that habitat crediting programs hold
   promise for meeting multiple objectives for at-risk species, landowners,
   and developers, but their potential often is hampered by high
   transaction costs and a lack of the ecological information needed to
   evaluate success.},

Abstract = {Miller's witch-alder (Fothergilla milleri, Hamamelidaceae) is a newly
   described globally imperiled shrub that is known from disjunct
   populations in coastal Alabama, the panhandle of Florida, and one
   location in Georgia. Little is currently known about the natural history
   or ecology of the species. We conducted inventories of three populations
   of F. milleri in Alabama and Florida. A total of 3060 ramets were found;
   45\% were in one subpopulation <= 0.5 ha in area and 79\% were in one
   population within an area of 4.5 ha. Low ramet counts in few locations
   makes the species particularly vulnerable to extinction due to
   stochastic events. Also, all seed capsules found within the surveys were
   infected by an aphid, which is possibly preventing sexual reproduction
   within the populations. Microsite habitat data indicated F. milleri
   grows in a unique transitional habitat between upland conifer forest and
   wetlands. The sites where extant populations of F. milleri inhabit tend
   to have acidic and well-drained soils with a high sand content. Further,
   many populations were under thick midstory vegetation. Thus, fire or
   other forms of removal may be needed to release those subpopulations
   before they may become shaded out. Lastly, a habitat suitability model
   was developed to better facilitate conservation efforts. However, only
   0.5\% of the study area was within the highest level of suitability.
   Fothergilla milleri is facing multiple threats that could lead to its
   extirpation from the wild, and direct and intense conservation action
   may be necessary to ensure F. milleri remains on the landscape.},

Abstract = {Controlling dissolved phosphorus (DP) loss from high P soil to avoid
   water eutrophication is a worldwide high priority. A greenhouse study
   was conducted in which flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) was
   applied by using different application methods and rates to two
   agricultural soils. Phosphorus fertilizer was incorporated into the
   soils at 2.95 g kg(-1) to simulate soil with high P levels. The FGDG was
   then applied at amounts of 0, 1.5, and 15 g kg(-1) soil on either the
   soil surface or mixed throughout the soil samples to simulate no-tillage
   and tillage, respectively. Ryegrass was planted after treatment
   application. The study showed that FGDG reduced runoff DP loss by 33\%
   and leachate DP loss 38\% in silt loam soil, and runoff DP loss 46\% and
   leachate DP loss 14\% in clay loam soil, at the treatment of 15 g kg(-1)
   FGDG. Mixing applied method (tillage) provided strong interaction with
   higher FGDG. To overall effect, the mixing-applied method performed
   better in controlling DP loss from silt loam soil, while surface-applied
   (no tillage) showed its advantage in controlling DP loss from clay loam
   soil. In practice it is necessary to optimize FGDG concentrations,
   application methods, and DP sources (runoff or leachate) to get
   maximized benefits of FGDG application. The FGDG application had no
   negative effects on the soil and ryegrass. (C) Higher Education Press

Abstract = {Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) is a grass species that can
   dominate wet meadow plant communities. This study investigated if
   grazing by cattle on restored wet meadows suppresses reed canarygrass,
   thereby promoting the restored plant community. This study was conducted
   at two locations in northwest Minnesota, one managed by The Nature
   Conservancy (TNC) and the other a Minnesota Board of Water and Soil
   Resources (BWSR) wetland bank site. Management practices used were a
   patch-burn grazing treatment on the TNC site and a high-density,
   short-duration grazing rotation system on the BWSR site. A pretreatment
   survey of total species canopy coverage was conducted before grazing
   followed by periodic surveys up to 7 y after grazing started. Both the
   patch-burn grazing and the grazing rotation system reduced reed
   canarygrass canopy cover by 49\% compared to non-grazed control sites
   5-7 y after grazing. With a reduction in reed canary grass canopy
   coverage due to grazing, the plant community moved toward a community
   with higher canopy coverage of Carex pellita that met restoration goals.
   Some of the species change was to grasses like Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
   pratensis), which is an exotic, invasive grass in prairies. The changed
   plant community held steady in native plant species richness or had an
   increase in native plant species richness. This study demonstrates
   grazing reduces the cover of reed canarygrass, while meeting restoration
   goals for wet meadows.},

Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Nest characteristics and nest-site choice determine fitness outcomes for
   reptile embryos and resulting hatchlings. Little is known about the
   nesting of Oligosoma suteri, New Zealand's only egg-laying lizard. We
   investigated the physical and thermal environment of nests and available
   microhabitats, including nest-like sites, with the aim of applying this
   information to future search efforts and translocation plans. Nests of
   O. suteri were difficult to locate in known nesting habitat occupied by
   a self-sustaining population; only 0.42 nests were found per person-hour
   of searching during mid-January on Korapuki Island, and several of these
   nests were likely communal. All eggs were partially buried in a fine,
   sandy-silt substrate beneath a rock and were within 2 m of overhanging
   vegetation. Thermal profiles of these nests and three mock nests chosen
   with similar physical characteristics result in incubation lengths
   observed in successful lab-based incubation studies. Our outcomes
   support lab-based evidence that females select nest sites based on
   temperature as temperature data loggers deployed at other parts of the
   beach recorded temperatures that are outside the known successful
   incubation temperatures. We recommend investigating thermal conditions
   at proposed translocation sites, including sites outside the species'
   current range so that predictions can be made regarding population

Abstract = {Forming a landscape-ecological framework is an urgent task supporting
   the adoption of a strategy for the progress of specially protected
   natural territories in Russia by 2030. According to the author, the
   strategy does not fully reflect the specifics of the development of the
   network of territorial nature protection objects in the agricultural
   regions of the country. Aim Substantiate proposals for optimizing the
   network of protected areas. Materials and Methods. Methods of
   cartographic analysis of schemes of physical and geographical zoning,
   generalisation of the results of expedition research, assessment of the
   representativeness of the existing network of protected areas and a
   comparative assessment of the most valuable landscape and natural biotic
   plots were used in the paper. Results. As a result of this study a
   complex of new and promising sites has been identified for inclusion in
   the landscape and ecological framework, which can constitute the natural
   reserve fund of the regions as clusters. The study covers steppe and
   forest-steppe landscapes of southern European and Asian Russia. The
   problem has been considered in the context of subjects relating to
   physical and geographical zoning. Proposals for the modernisation and
   expansion of the network of objects included in the landscape and
   ecological framework were compiled based on expedition studies, combined
   with quantitative and qualitative indicators of natural diversity.
   Conclusions There is a need to modernise the existing network and to
   create new nature reserves based, among other things, on as-yet
   -unrealised projects for the creation of reserves.},

Title = {Features of formation and transformation of fallows and methods for
   their optimisation},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-98},
Abstract = {Aim. The objective of this research was to establish the reasons for
   productivity reduction and changes in the species and quantitative
   composition of phytocenoses of multiple-aged fallows and to develop
   methods for their use optimisation.
   Material and Methods. The research was conducted as a stationary field
   experiment. The fallow was formed since 2004 on the site of a field crop
   rotation. Fallow soil was moderately and heavily washed black earth.
   Results. It was established that the availability of soil with plant
   nutrients in all experimental variants did not differ much during the
   entire period of research. The bases for changes in the fallow
   productivity were not chemical but rather physical soil processes.
   During the first three years of the fallow formation, the soil became
   more firm. The unit weight of the arable layer reached 1.48 g/cm(3),
   hardness reached 24.4 kg/cm(2) and water permeability reached 59
   mm/hour. The soil's ability to recover its initial parameters began
   after 7-10 years and after 30 years of fallow formation, the soil
   firmness was the same as in the steppe area, the unit soil weight
   acquired an equilibrium state, and the water permeability of the soil
   became optimal.
   Conclusion. In the first 3-4 years after the assignment of an area for
   fallow, it is optimal to mow plants twice or three times before their
   seeding, using mowed biomass for green manure or composting. In the next
   4-7 years, moderate grazing or mowing is recommended. Fallows over 8-10
   years old are used for grazing and haying.},

Pages = {102-114},
Abstract = {Aim. To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional
   ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for
   ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network
   and the ecological stability of the region.Material and Methods. Based
   on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the
   ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the
   Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the
   protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and
   calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index
   of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh
   and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and
   corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was
   analyzed.Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and
   their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and
   11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its
   representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation
   were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection
   network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological
   framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and
   66\%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been
   proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species
   included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.Conclusions. The creation of
   new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network
   will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological
   framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make
   significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the
   impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of
   protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will
   help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity
   of the region.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potassium (K) are the three most
   important nutrients applied into agricultural soils, but the impacts of
   their single or combined application on soil fungal community structure
   and stability are still open questions. Using qPCR and Illumina Miseq
   sequencing, the variation of soil fungal communities in response to
   long-term addition of N, P, or K fertilization alone and their
   combinations in a Mollisol field was investigated in this study. In
   addition, the fungal community resistance indices and network structure
   were studied. Results showed that N fertilizations (N, NK, NP and NPK
   treatments) rather than P, K fertilizations (P, K and PK treatments)
   significantly increased fungal abundance, but decreased fungal diversity
   and shifted fungal community structures when compared to
   non-fertilization (NoF). Additionally, N fertilization treatments
   presented lower resistance of fungal communities to environment
   disturbances than those of P, K fertilization treatments. More numbers
   and higher abundances of changed fungal taxa at the genus and OTU levels
   were induced by N fertilizations rather than by addition of P, K
   fertilizers. In addition, N fertilizations induced a more changeable
   fungal network and complex pathogenic subnetwork with many positive
   interactions among responding plant pathogens (RP, the changeable plant
   pathogens induced by fertilizers addition compared to NoF) when compared
   to P, K fertilizations. These RP directly and negatively influenced
   fungal community resistance examined by structural equation modeling
   (SEM), which were indirectly detrimental to soybean yields. Our findings
   revealed that addition of N fertilizers significantly disturbed fungal
   communities and promoted pathogenic interactions, and provided insights
   into the optimization of fertilization strategies toward agricultural
   sustainability. (C) Higher Education Press 2022},

Abstract = {Chlorine-containing disinfectants have been widely used around the world
   for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, at
   present, little is known about the impact of residual chlorine on the
   soil micro-ecological environment. Herein, we treated an experimental
   soil-plant-microbiome microcosm system by continuous irrigation with a
   low concentration of chlorine-containing water, and then analyzed the
   influence on the soil microbial community using metagenomics. After 14-d
   continuous chlorine treatment, there were no significant lasting effect
   on soil microbial community diversity and composition either in the
   rhizosphere or in bulk soil. Although metabolic functions of the
   rhizosphere microbial community were affected slightly by continuous
   chlorine treatment, it recovered to the original status. The abundance
   of several resistance genes changed by 7 d and recovered by 14 d.
   According to our results, the chlorine residue resulting from daily
   disinfection may present a slight long-term effect on plant growth
   (shoot length and fresh weight) and soil micro-ecology. In general, our
   study assisted with environmental risk assessments relating to the
   application of chlorine-containing disinfectants and minimization of
   risks to the environment during disease control, such as COVID-19. (C)

Title = {Sounding out the nest: Unobtrusive localisation of North Island brown
   kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) incubation burrows},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Monitoring breeding outcomes of cryptic nocturnal species such as the
   North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) is an important aim for
   conservation management in New Zealand. While fitting male kiwi with
   radio transmitters enables incubation burrows to be found and monitored,
   it is invasive and expensive. Remote monitoring methods (without
   handling of birds) are preferable. Here we investigate the extent to
   which it is practical to find North Island brown kiwi incubation burrows
   based on remote monitoring, motivated by anecdotal reports that
   incubating males call close to their incubation burrow on first
   emergence. We test this observation, and then use it to demonstrate how
   a combination of acoustic recorders, human listening, and trail cameras
   can be deployed to locate the burrow with minimal disturbance, based on
   the male's first call of the night. Our analysis of an incubating brown
   kiwi male's first call in the evening as a function of distance from the
   burrow shows that for more than half the time monitored he called within
   10 minutes of leaving his burrow and that on these nights, he was
   usually less than 35 m from it. Along with backtracking of kiwi
   footsteps, this enables the localisation of the burrow. We outline a
   workflow for the method based on our experience and discuss how it can
   be made more efficient and usable in the future. Our method facilitates
   the finding of nests, and hence of chicks, without the need for adult
   kiwi to be fitted with transmitters.},

Title = {Attitudes and motivations of New Zealand conservation volunteers},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in Aotearoa New Zealand is of high importance,
   and efforts to protect vulnerable populations from decline has garnered
   broad public support. Conservation efforts have been further highlighted
   with the 2016 announcement of Predator Free 2050, a nationwide goal to
   eliminate key invasive mammalian predators from New Zealand by the year
   2050. Hands-on labour is often needed to complete conservation
   initiatives, and New Zealand conservation volunteers have shown
   themselves to be an abundant, effective, and oft-used workforce.
   However, there is limited knowledge of conservation volunteers on a
   national scale. This exploratory research aimed to determine what
   motivates conservation volunteers in New Zealand, gauge their attitudes
   toward modern-day conservation, and summarise their demographic
   information. Through a nationwide survey of 986 New Zealand conservation
   volunteers in 2018, we found that they have a higher than median age,
   income, education, and are predominantly Pakeha/NZ European and likely
   retired. The median conservation volunteer has volunteered within 10 km
   of home for 10 hours a month for 6 years. The conservation and cultural
   context in New Zealand could be reflected in volunteer motivations and
   attitudes. New Zealand conservation volunteers are motivated by a
   feeling of responsibility, with some referencing the Maori concept of
   kaitiakitanga. There were elements of wanting to right past wrongs and
   volunteers' perceived role as stewards of their local environment.
   Conservation volunteers overwhelmingly agree with the stated goals of
   Predator Free 2050 and are in favour of current and potential future
   methods of pest control. They are, however, significantly less confident
   that Predator Free 2050 goals will be achieved. Conservation volunteers
   contribute to goals like Predator Free 2050 through their significant
   voluntary labour. We hope this research contributes to a better
   understanding of conservation volunteers in New Zealand and leads to
   strengthening the support for these volunteers and the many community
   groups they represent.},

Abstract = {In western North America, nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   frequently threaten native salmonids via competition and hybridization,
   so fisheries managers often implement eradication programs for
   conservation purposes. In conjunction with such programs, managers often
   construct population models to evaluate the effects of different
   management strategies designed to control the undesirable population,
   but such models require demographic data (e.g., age, growth, sex ratios,
   and survival), which are lacking for western brook trout populations.
   Brook trout were sampled from 12 alpine lakes and two streams in Idaho,
   with total length varying from 80 to 380 mm and age varying from 1 to 11
   yrs. Across all waters, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L8 varied
   from 231 to 490 mm (mean = 345 mm) and K varied from 0.15 to 0.76 (mean
   = 0.37). Survival estimates, constructed from age-length keys, were
   corrected for streams with mark-recapture data; for alpine lakes,
   corrections were made via gill net selectivity data. Survival varied
   from 0.30 to 0.56 (mean = 0.45), and except for one waterbody, estimates
   were minimally affected by correcting for capture efficiency. The
   proportion of the population that was male varied from 0.34 to 0.75
   (mean = 0.53). Our results indicate that brook trout population vital
   rates in Idaho were similar to those observed in their native range, and
   were surprisingly similar between alpine lake and stream environments.},

   Material and Methods. Biologically active dipeptide AB-0 and
   tetrapeptide AE-0 were used. Field studies were carried out on
   meadow-brown podzolized gley heavy loamy soil. One month before
   planting, soybean seeds were treated with dipeptide/tetrapeptide of
   concentrations of 0.01 g/l or 0.001 g/l. Hand-tended and
   industrial-level research was carried out. Results. The use of dipeptide
   AB-0 in a hand-tended study had a positive effect on the growth
   processes of soybeans of the Batya variety compared to the control. The
   use of tetrapeptide AE-0 in a hand-tended study increased the weight of
   plants by 7.3-67.0 g and plant height by 3.0-9.0 cm compared to the
   control. The use of dipeptide AB-0 and tetrapeptide AE-0 increased the
   yield of soybeans by a maximum of 81.2-83.7\% compared to the control.
   The use of peptides AB-0 and AE-0 in an industrial-level experiment
   increased the yield by 30.5\% and 18.4\%, respectively, compared with
   the control. Conclusion. The short peptides AB-0 and AE-0 studied had an
   impact on the growth, development and productivity of Batya soybean
   varieties. They can be classified as plant growth regulators.},

Title = {Developmental experience of the geoinformation system for floodplain
   lands of the Don basin},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {151-161},
Abstract = {Aim. The work describes the experience of developing a geographic
   information system for the floodplain lands of the Don basin. Playing a
   large role in the economy, river floodplains provide reproduction of
   hayfields and pastures, fish, waterfowl and birds which live near water,
   and in the arid zone they concentrate forest resources and wild animal
   populations. However, until the present there has been no single
   database that would allow us to analyse the most important
   characteristics of floodplain landscapes.
   Material and Methods. The implementation of the database elements was
   carried out using the following methods. The area of the river basin
   (tributary), the slope and exposure of the sides of the valley, the
   slope of the river bed and the length of the watercourse, the area of
   floodplains, agricultural land on floodplain lands, forest land, the
   tortuosity of the river and the development of the floodplain and the
   number, area and volume of small reservoirs were obtained by processing
   digital terrain models employing functions of the Spatial Analyst module
   and satellite images in automatic mode.
   Results. During this first stage of the study, the authors developed 14
   important characteristics that form the basis of a modern database for
   the floodplains of the Don River Basin and determined algorithms and
   methods for calculating each indicator.
   Conclusion. The creation of a specialized geographic information system
   for the floodplain lands of the Don basin permits the solution of
   particular problems of data unification and the interaction of
   individual electronic atlas modules with each other and with the
   external resources of web-mapping services and databases. The resulting
   atlas should find wide application in the areas of water and land
   management and nature conservation.},

Title = {Acoustic monitoring and occupancy analysis: cost-effective tools in
   reintroduction programmes for roroa-great spotted kiwi},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Monitoring the response of wildlife populations to conservation
   management, such as translocations, is crucially important for assessing
   its effectiveness. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an emerging tool
   for monitoring cryptic and elusive species and is increasingly used in
   the management of kiwi. Inferences from data collected by PAM can be
   largely improved by occupancy analysis. By modelling occupancy, we
   overcome the issue of incomplete detectability, which would otherwise
   lead to underestimating actual site occupancy. Here we demonstrate the
   utility of occupancy analysis in a reintroduction programme for
   roroa-great spotted kiwi (Apteryx maxima, formerly known as A. haastii)
   in the Nina Valley, Lake Sumner Forest Park. We analysed PAM data from
   two survey years, 2012-2013 and 2017-2018 from the Nina Valley and the
   Hawdon Valley, Arthur's Pass National Park, which was the source
   population of the translocated birds. Occupancy estimates increased
   significantly between the two survey years at both study areas, despite
   the translocation of approximately 20\% of known territorial adults
   (four pairs) from the Hawdon Valley to the Nina Valley in 2015.
   Moreover, at least three out of four territories, where adult birds were
   removed, were re-occupied by new pairs within three years. Site
   occupancy increased in the Nina Valley from 0.20 (SE 0.10) to 0.72
   (0.10), and in the Hawdon Valley from 0.63 (0.10) to 0.95 (0.04).
   Detectability varied significantly between study areas and was
   influenced by the length of survey night, breeding/non-breeding season,
   and also wind speed. The differences between the naive and estimated
   occupancy values underscore the benefits of occupancy modelling for
   measuring population response to conservation management. This study
   highlights the utility of using PAM in monitoring translocation
   outcomes: to track changes in occupancy and local distribution, as well
   as assessing impacts on the source population following the birds'
   removal for translocation.},

Title = {A risk to the forestry industry? Invasive pines as hosts of foliar fungi
   and potential pathogens},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Pathogen accumulation on an invasive plant species can occur over time,
   through co-invasion, or adaptation of native pathogen species. While
   accumulated pathogens can reduce the success and spread of an invasive
   species, they can also spill-over into native plant communities or
   valuable non-native populations. Transmission of pathogens may be
   density-dependent, with dense invasive populations creating better
   opportunities for pathogen spread than scattered individuals. Some pine
   species (Pinus) and some other Pinaceae (including Pseudotsuga) are
   extremely invasive trees in New Zealand but trees in the Pinaceae are
   also used extensively within the forestry industry. Little is known
   about the foliar pathogens present on invasive populations and whether
   they pose a risk to industry. We cultured foliar fungi from needles of
   Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus contorta found at both low and high
   densities of invasion. DNA from fungal cultures was extracted and
   sequenced using Sanger sequencing. We cultured fungi from a greater
   proportion of P. menziesii than P. contorta needles and a greater
   proportion of trees from low versus high densities of invasion. The
   richness of foliar fungi decreased as a function of density and P.
   menziesii hosted a greater richness of fungi than P. contorta. We
   observed no change in the richness of pathogens between P. menziesii and
   P. contorta or between low and high density invasions. However, we did
   observe a greater proportion of fungi that were potentially pathogenic
   at high density than at low density. We identified one major widespread
   pathogen (Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii) and a number of opportunistic
   potential pathogens (i.e. Sydowia polyspora, Lophodermium pinastri and
   Alternaria alternata), indicating the possibility of spill-over into
   commercial plantations.},

Abstract = {The introduction of nonnative grazers and plants, as well as alterations
   to native fire regimes in grassland systems, can directly and indirectly
   affect the abundance of arthropods. In this study, we used sweep-net
   sampling at two sites occupied by the critically endangered Florida
   grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus Mearns) in Osceola
   County, Florida, to assess how the abundance of all arthropods (orders
   pooled) and the four most common arthropod orders varied between native
   dry prairie and semi-improved cattle pasture habitat (2015-2016). We
   also examined the role of time since fire and fire season on arthropod
   abundance in both habitat types. The abundance of all arthropods,
   Hemiptera, Orthoptera, and Coleoptera was higher in pasture than dry
   prairie, but the mean body length of Orthoptera was smaller in pasture.
   Fire year and fire season did not affect arthropod abundance when data
   from both sites were combined. However, when examined separately,
   Orthoptera at the dry prairie site were more abundant in habitat burned
   in the current year than previous years, supporting the hypothesis that
   Florida grasshopper sparrows preferentially select recently burned
   prairies because they support greater resource availability. Orthoptera
   at the pasture site showed no significant response to fire year or
   season. This study is important because it is the first to compare
   arthropod prey abundance for Florida grasshopper sparrows across dry
   prairie and pasture habitat and has important implications for
   prescribed fire management.},

Abstract = {With global efforts to restore grassland ecosystems, researchers and
   land management practitioners are working to reconstruct habitat that
   will persist and withstand stresses associated with climate change. Part
   of these efforts involve movement of plant material potentially adapted
   to future climate conditions from native habitat or seed production
   locations to a new restoration site. Restoration practice often follows
   this plant-centered, top-down approach. However, we suggest that
   restoration of belowground interactions, namely between plants and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or rhizobia, is important for restoring
   resilient grasslands. In this synthesis we highlight these interactions
   and offer insight into how their restoration might be included in
   current grassland restoration practice. Ultimately, restoration of
   belowground interactions may contribute to grassland habitat that can
   withstand and respond to future climate uncertainties.},

Title = {Extent and Intensity of Vehicle-use Impacts within a Saltmarsh
   Conservation Area under a Management Strategy},

Abstract = {Saltmarshes provide multiple ecosystem services, and some have been
   preserved as conservation areas. Studies indicate recreation-related
   vehicle use may be significantly degrading them. Saltmarshes have a low
   resistance and resilience to recreation-related trampling impacts;
   however, little is known about those associated with vehicle use under a
   specific management strategy. Drone imagery and GIS spatial analysis
   were used to determine the area and intensity of direct vehicle impacts
   within a New Zealand saltmarsh. The management plan allows vehicle entry
   as long as it does not substantially impact cultural, ecological, or
   mahinga kai (or food cultivation) values. It limits impacts of vehicles
   by meeting two goals: limiting the area of vehicle use to formal road
   corridors, and limiting particularly damaging behaviors of use,
   including entering the saltmarsh when conditions are wet, traveling more
   than 10 km per hour, and using traction equipment. Results demonstrated
   substantial impacts. Tire tracks were present in 66\% of quadrats
   sampled, and were distributed across the length and breadth of the
   saltmarsh, covering 17\% (approximately 207 ha) of the 1225 ha
   saltmarsh. About a third of these quadrats had track covers of 11-50\%.
   Furthermore, particularly damaging vehicle use behaviors were widely
   evidenced, including deeply rutted mud, water channel initiation, and
   substantial loss and fragmentation of vegetation communities. Vehicle
   use is clearly eroding at least some of the cultural, ecological, and/or
   mahinga kai values for which the saltmarsh was conserved. While there
   are many indirect and direct measures for improving the current
   management strategy, none is likely to result in substantial reductions
   in vehicle impacts given the low resistance and resilience of
   saltmarshes to trampling. An alternative strategy that would lead to
   substantial reductions, and eventual recovery of the saltmarsh, would be
   to allow existing recreational activities, but deny vehicle entry.},

Title = {Changes in Nesting Habitat Availability for Piping Plovers at the John

Abstract = {Habitat loss is a major threat to the conservation of endangered
   species. We measured changes in piping plover (Charadrius melodus)
   nesting habitat at five alkali wetlands in The Nature Conservancy's John
   E. Williams Preserve, McLean county, North Dakota, from 1992 to 2021.
   This site has supported nesting by federally threatened piping plovers
   for decades. We measured the amount of non-vegetated (open) shoreline,
   required nesting habitat for plovers, from photo plots at 34 sites
   historically occupied by plovers distributed across the five wetlands.
   Twenty-six of 34 plots had significant negative trends (95\% credible
   intervals not including zero) in nesting area availability. Nesting
   habitat increased significantly at one plot. Seven other plots had no
   detectable trends (i.e., the 95\% credible intervals included zero).
   Mean percent annual change was similar to 1.2\% (60.17 SE) and estimated
   total loss of nesting habitat within plots was similar to 42\%. To
   assess whether plover nesting habitat might have been created at areas
   outside of our plots, we compared total open shoreline habitat over all
   five wetlands in 1992 to that in 2017. We detected a similar to 42\%
   decline in total open shoreline area. Although measurement methods
   differed between 1992 and 2017, we found no evidence that nesting
   habitat was created at non-photo plot areas. In the absence of habitat
   restoration and management the decline in piping plover nesting habitat
   is likely to continue. Climate change projections for North Dakota
   indicate increased annual rainfall, higher CO2 levels, and longer
   growing seasons, all factors likely to promote vegetative growth at
   alkali wetlands like those we studied.},

Title = {Highlighting an Overlooked Hotspot for American Ginseng (Panax

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a globally desired medicinal
   plant that is becoming increasingly difficult to study due to
   harvest-induced rarity. Thus, this species' conservation could be
   greatly improved via species distribution models, making it a model
   organism for studying sampling bias. In an attempt to refine a
   state-derived distribution model for ginseng in Virginia, we conducted
   additional surveys in a biologically diverse yet under-sampled region of
   the state-the Cumberland Mountains-thereby increasing the number of
   documented ginseng occurrences in this region thirteen-fold (N-1 = 16,
   N-2 = 214). Our surveys resulted in the model predicting an increased
   probability of American ginseng occurrence not only statewide (mu(1) =
   0.099, mu(2) = 0.104) but particularly so in the Cumberland Mountains
   (mu(1) = 0.170, mu(2) = 0.278), highlighting a consistently overlooked
   hotspot for biodiversity in Southern Appalachia. We suggest that more
   geographically balanced surveys and reduced overrepresentation of
   heavily protected and managed areas such as National Parks-in addition
   to heeding local knowledge-can be an effective method of mitigating
   geographic bias in predictions from species distribution models.},

Abstract = {Stable isotope analysis of feathers can provide an indirect method to
   investigate the diet and foraging locations of birds during the time the
   feathers were growing. We used the isotopic composition of
   experimentally-induced feathers to investigate the foraging locations of
   the Hutton's shearwater (Puffinus huttoni), an endangered seabird that
   is a breeding endemic to the Kaikoura region of New Zealand. The
   isotopic composition of feathers was first compared with potential prey
   items collected from the near-shore marine environment near the breeding
   colony. By applying trophic fractionation factors (2-4 parts per
   thousand increase in delta N-15 for every 1 \% increase in delta C-13)
   and comparing the isotopic composition of the induced tail feathers and
   sampled prey items, we found that feather isotopic compositions were not
   consistent with a diet based on feeding locally. Both the delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 from zooplankton and fish collected within 8 km of Kaikoura
   were significantly different than the isotopic composition of induced
   feathers and were outside of the range expected for consumed local prey
   items. Instead, we found the isotopic composition of Hutton's shearwater
   feathers was more consistent with feeding on potential prey items in the
   seas north-east and around Banks Peninsula, an area c. 100 km south of
   the breeding colony and where they had been tracked previously. Stable
   isotope analysis can provide insight into the foraging behaviour of
   birds at sea and demonstrates the importance of isotopic research in
   pinpointing foraging locations in seabirds with large geographic ranges.},

Abstract = {The diversity of vegetation configuration is the key to ecological
   restoration in open-pit coal mine dump. However, the recovery outcomes
   of different areas with the same vegetation assemblage pattern are
   completely different after long-term evolution. Therefore, understanding
   the causes of differential vegetation recovery and the mechanism of
   plant succession is of great significance to the ecological restoration
   of mines. Three Pinus tabulaeformis plantations with similar initial
   site conditions and restoration measures but with different secondary
   succession processes were selected from the open-pit coal mine dump that
   has been restored for 30 years. Soil physicochemical properties, enzyme
   activities, vegetation and microbial features were investigated, while
   the structural equation models were established to explore the
   interactions between plants, soil and microbes. The results showed that
   original vegetation configuration and soil nutrient conditions were
   altered due to secondary succession. With the advancement of the
   secondary succession process, the coverage of plants increased from
   34.8\% to 95.5\% (P < 0.05), soil organic matter increased from 9.30 g
   kg(-1) to 21.13 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05), and total nitrogen increased from
   0.38 g kg(-1) to 1.01 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05). The activities of soil urease
   and beta-glucosidase were increased by 1.7-fold and 53.26\%,
   respectively. Besides, the secondary succession also changed the soil
   microbial community structure and function. The relative abundance of
   Nitrospira genus which dominates the nitrification increased 5.2-fold.
   The results showed that urease and beta-glucosidase promoted the
   increase of vegetation diversity and biomass by promoting the
   accumulation of soil organic matter and nitrate nitrogen, which promoted
   the ecological restoration of mine dumps. (C) Higher Education Press

Abstract = {The Buffalo National River is a scenic and ecologically significant
   resource located in the Ozark Plateau of Arkansas, USA. As a
   free-flowing and protected river, the Buffalo offers natural benefits to
   humanity (e.g., food production, carbon storage, recreation), known as
   ecosystem services. Using both market and survey data, we performed the
   first comprehensive valuation of the ecosystem services that the Buffalo
   National River provides to Arkansas residents. The total ecosystem
   services benefits in 2018 USD were valued at \$20.5 million per year
   (\$550/ha). Most of the value was concentrated in cultural services
   (i.e., recreation, aesthetics, cognitive development), which were
   responsible for over 70\% of total value at \$384/ha. Air quality
   regulation and the provisioning of water also made important
   contributions to the total, with values of \$103/ha and \$36/ha,
   respectively. Our study highlights the considerable economic value
   provided by the Buffalo National River in its current state. Recent
   economic activity, in particular intensive agriculture, has threatened
   these services and in the process created conflicts between different
   industries. These values are important to consider when making
   management and policy decisions that affect the region.},

Abstract = {Pectis imberbis is an endangered plant found in the Madrean Archipelago
   ecoregion of southern Arizona. Numerous, potentially interacting
   stressors, such as drought, shifting fire regimes, invasive species, and
   grazing by domesticated and wild ungulates, affect this species and
   region. We used Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to describe dynamics
   of the largest documented P. imberbis population. While collecting
   census data, we quantified impacts of species interacting with P.
   imberbis, including pollinators, Coues deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   couesi), and co-occurring vegetation, and evaluated their impact on P.
   imberbis population vital rates. Despite a large overall size (N= 794),
   the growth rate for this population was below replacement level (lambda=
   0.9519). Browse by Coues deer negatively impacted demographic vital
   rates. Woody species and perennial grasses afforded protection against
   browse, especially for small individuals, but in the absence of browse,
   coincidence with heterospecific vegetation decreased growth, survival,
   and reproduction of P. imberbis. We observed 12 taxa of invertebrates
   interacting with P. imberbis flowers, including native bees, flies, and
   wasps. Seed production by bagged flowers indicated that flowers are
   self-compatible. In summary, we detected a unique interplay between
   deer, which negatively impacted P. imberbis populations via browse, and
   vegetation, which reduced incidence of browse, while simultaneously
   depressing P. imberbis vital rates when no browse occurred. Findings
   suggest that shifts in community dynamics, such as introduction of
   invasive grasses or fluctuations in deer populations, could impact P.
   imberbis population trajectories. Management actions, including
   exclusion of herbivores and removal of invasive grasses, should be
   considered to aid species recovery.},

Abstract = {As one of the last remaining naturally grazed ecosystems on Earth, the
   Serengeti National Park is an ideal location to study the influence of
   migratory mammals on the structure of microbial communities and the
   factors that generate biogeography of soil microbes. Furthermore,
   volcanic inputs generate environmental gradients that may also structure
   microbial communities. We studied 16S rRNA amplicons in a 13-year
   herbivore removal experiment to examine the influence of grazing and
   environmental gradients on the natural distribution of soil microbes.
   Removal of mammalian herbivores shifted microbial community structure,
   with 31 taxa that were significant indicator taxa of the ungrazed
   treatment and three taxa that were indicators of the grazed treatment.
   The abundance of many taxa were correlated with soil texture,
   phosphorus, iron, calcium and rainfall, and the evenness of taxa within
   samples was also correlated with these variables. Bayesian general
   linear mixed effects models with single predictors of multiple, highly
   correlated variables of beta diversity were consistent with a
   significant, but weak (2\%), effect of grazing, and stronger effects of
   phosphorus (14\%). Beta diversity of microbial communities was greater
   in grazed than in ungrazed plots; suggesting that the impacts of grazing
   on community assembly of microbes results from deterministic
   environmental filtering caused by the influence of herbivores on plant
   communities and soil properties rather than stochastic dispersal via
   herds of large mammals. These herbivore effects are superimposed on
   deterministic environmental filtering by natural soil and precipitation
   gradients across the Serengeti. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

Abstract = {Arsenic (As) is broadly distributed due to natural and anthropogenic
   sources, and it is toxic to organisms. This study aimed to investigate
   the proteomic response in earthworm exposed to As3+. Earthworms were
   exposed to As3+ in soil at 5-80 mg kg(-1), and samples were collected
   after 60 days exposure. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used
   to separate the proteins in earthworm homogenate, then differentially
   expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS
   analysis. After 2-DE, 36 DEPs were found and 24 of them were
   successfully identified. 79.2\% of DEPs were upregulated compared to the
   control group. The maximum fold change reached 53.8 in spot 3108 in the
   80 mg kg(-1) As group. Two proteins were not found in the control group
   but found in the As treated groups. Proteins were grouped into
   metabolism, signal transduction, stress-related, transport, regulation,
   and predicted/hypothetical protein categories based on their function.
   The protein-protein interaction between the DEPs indicated that serum
   albumin (ALB) is very important, related to 6 other proteins. Proteins
   were then verified by western blot, the results were in agreement with
   the proteomic analyses. The identification of induced or repressed
   proteins because of As3+ in earthworms is helpful to explore the
   underlying mechanisms of soil arsenic ecotoxicity. (C) Higher Education

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Developmental plasticity, where traits change state in response to
   environmental cues, is well studied in modern populations. It is also
   suspected to play a role in macroevolutionary dynamics, but due to a
   lack of long-term records, the frequency of plasticity-led evolution in
   deep time remains unknown. Populations are dynamic entities, yet their
   representation in the fossil record is a static snapshot of often
   isolated individuals. Here, we apply for the first time contemporary
   integral projection models (IPMs) to fossil data to link individual
   development with expected population variation. IPMs describe the
   effects of individual growth in discrete steps on long-term population
   dynamics. We parameterize the models using modern and fossil data of the
   planktonic foraminifer Trilobatus sacculifer. Foraminifera grow by
   adding chambers in discrete stages and die at reproduction, making them
   excellent case studies for IPMs. Our results predict that somatic growth
   rates have almost twice as much influence on population dynamics than
   survival and more than eight times more influence than reproduction,
   suggesting that selection would primarily target somatic growth as the
   major determinant of fitness. As numerous paleobiological systems record
   growth rate increments in single genetic individuals and imaging
   technologies are increasingly available, our results open up the
   possibility of evidence-based inference of developmental plasticity
   spanning macroevolutionary dynamics. Given the centrality of ecology in
   paleobiological thinking, our model is one approach to help bridge
   eco-evolutionary scales while directing attention toward the most
   relevant life-history traits to measure.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Soils are impacted globally by several anthropogenic factors, including
   chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental
   persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function.
   However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and
   microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored
   the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic
   acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at
   environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week
   microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g(-1) for PFBS) significantly
   increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on
   beta-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS
   concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct
   consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil
   respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this
   effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were
   negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS
   affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and
   certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of
   PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a
   factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in
   terrestrial ecosystem functioning. (C) The Author(s) 2022.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a factor of global change.
   By altering soil inherent properties and processes, ripple-on effects on
   plants and their symbionts can be expected. Additionally, interactions
   with other factors of global change, such as drought, can influence the
   effect of microplastics. We designed a greenhouse study to examine
   effects of polyester microfibers, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and
   drought on plant, microbial and soil responses. We found that polyester
   microfibers increased the aboveground biomass of Affium cepa under
   well-watered and drought conditions, but under drought conditions the AM
   fungal-only treatment reached the highest biomass. Colonization with AM
   fungi increased under microfiber contamination, however, plant biomass
   did not increase when both AM fungi and fibers were present. The mean
   weight diameter of soil aggregates increased with AM fungal inoculation
   overall but decreased when the system was contaminated with microfibers
   or drought stressed. Our study adds additional support to the mounting
   evidence that microplastic fibers in soil can affect the plant-soil
   system by promoting plant growth, and favoring key root symbionts, AM
   fungi. Although soil aggregation is usually positively influenced by
   plant roots and AM fungi, and microplastic promotes both, our results
   show that plastic still had a negative effect on soil aggregates. Even
   though there are concerns that microplastic might interact with other
   factors of global change, our study revealed no such effect for drought.

Abstract = {Differently sized soil aggregates, with non-uniform distribution of
   space and nutrients, provide spatially heterogeneous microenvironments
   for microorganisms and are important for controlling microbial community
   ecology and biogeochemistry in soils. Here, we investigated the
   prokaryotic communities within different aggregate-size fractions:
   macroaggregate ( > 0.25 mm), microaggregate (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt +
   clay ( <0.053 mm). These were isolated from fluvo-aquic soils under
   39-year fertilization strategies: no fertilizer (CK), chemical
   fertilizer (NPK), manure fertilizer (M), and combination of manure and
   chemical fertilizers (MNPK). The results showed that the proportion of
   macroaggregate, soil aggregate-associated organic carbon (SOC) content
   and aggregate stability were all significantly increased by both manure
   and chemical fertilizations. Organic fertilizations (M and MNPK) more
   effectively boosted formation and stability of macroaggregates and
   enhanced SOC concentration than NPK. The distribution patterns of
   microorganisms in aggregates were primarily shaped by fertilization and
   aggregate size. They explained 76.9\% of the variance in bacterial
   community compositions. Fertilizations, especially with organic
   fertilizers primarily transitioned bacterial communities from
   slow-growing oligotrophic groups (e.g., Chloroflexi) dominance to
   fast-growing copiotrophic groups (e.g., Proteobacteria and
   Bacteroidetes) dominance across all aggregate sizes. Macroaggregates
   possessed a more stable bacterial community and efficiency of resource
   transfer, while smaller aggregates increased antagonism and weakened
   mutualism among bacterial communities. Overall, combination of manure
   and chemical fertilizers was crucial for increasing SOC content and
   aggregation, leading to a clear shift in bacterial community structures
   at aggregate scale. (C) Higher Education Press 2021},

Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technology is increasingly used in the study
   of nematode biodiversity. However, the annotation difference of commonly
   used primers and reference databases on nematode community is still
   unclear. We compared two pairs of primers (3NDf/C\_1132rmod,
   NF1F/18Sr2bR) and three databases (NT\_v20200604, SILVA138/18s Eukaryota
   and PR2\_v4.5 databases) on the determination of nematode community from
   four different vegetation types in Changbai Mountain, including mixed
   broadleaf-conifer forest, dark coniferous forest, betula ermanii Cham
   and alpine tundra. Our results showed that the selection of different
   primers and databases influenced the annotation of nematode taxa, but
   the diversity of nematode community showed consistent pattern among
   different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary
   to select appropriate primer and database according to the target
   taxonomic level. The difference in primers will affect the result of
   nematode taxa at different classification levels, so sequencing analysis
   cannot be used for comparison with studies using different primers. In
   terms of annotation effect in this study, 3NDf/C\_1132rmod primers with
   NT\_v20200604 database could provide more information than other
   combinations at the genus or species levels. (c) Higher Education Press

Title = {Influencing factors and partitioning methods of carbonate contribution
   to CO2 emissions from calcareous soils},
Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In calcareous soils, recent studies have shown that soil-derived CO2
   originates from both soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition and soil
   inorganic carbon (SIC) dissolution, a fact often ignored in earlier
   studies. This may lead to overestimation of the CO2 emissions from SOC
   decomposition. In calcareous soils, there is a chemical balance between
   precipitation and dissolution of CaCO3-CO2-HCO3-, which is affected by
   soil environmental factors (moisture, temperature, pH and depth), root
   growth (rhizosphere effect) and agricultural measures (organic materials
   input, nitrogen fertilization and straw removal). In this paper, we
   first introduced the contribution of SIC dissolution to CO2 emissions
   from calcareous soils and their driving factors. Second, we reviewed the
   methods to distinguish two CO2 sources released from calcareous soils
   and quantify the C-13 fractionation coefficient between SIC and
   SIC-derived CO2 and between SOC and SOC-derived CO2, and to partition
   three CO2 sources released from soils with plants and organic materials
   input. Finally, we proposed methods for accurately distinguishing three
   CO2 sources released from calcareous soils. This review helps to improve
   the accuracy of soil C balance assessment in calcareous soils, and also
   proposes the direction of further investigations on SIC-derived CO2
   emissions responses to abiotic factors and agricultural measures. (C)

Title = {Changes of microbiome in response to sugars in a wilt pathogen-infested
   soil},
Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-65},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sugars are frequently and abundantly found in root exudates, but
   influence of specific sugars on the fate of soil-borne pathogens,
   microbiome structure, and particularly microbial interactions are not
   well understood. A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two
   soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium
   oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil
   further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils
   were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results
   show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although
   co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness,
   evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure
   was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were
   negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON
   soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low
   alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked
   networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter
   harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial
   interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the
   keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have
   promoted FON. This may be one of reasons why FON could proliferate
   vigorously after sugar supplementation. (C) Higher Education Press 2022},

Title = {Effect of plant composition on epigeal spider communities in northern
   New Zealand forest remnants},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Te Paki Ecological District (TPED) in northern Northland, New Zealand,
   is well known as an ecologically significant centre of endemism.
   However, due to extensive anthropogenic habitat degradation, native
   forest has been reduced to small, isolated remnants and many of its
   endemic species are threatened with extinction. Epigeal spider
   communities (species living on or near the ground) were surveyed within
   TPED by pitfall trapping at seven native forest remnants differing in
   plant composition and apparent seral stage to investigate how spider
   communities varied within them. Surveys were conducted four times over a
   12-month period coinciding with winter, spring, summer and autumn.
   Changes in spider communities were related to differences in plant
   composition, which were in turn associated with differences in apparent
   seral stage of the vegetation. Spider communities in forests at later
   seral stages were dominated by species such as Rinawa sp., Porrhothele
   sp. and Uliodon sp., whereas Euryopis nana, Cambridgea reinga,
   Stanwellia hollowayi and Hypodrassodes apicus were most prevalent in
   remnants at earlier seral stages. These species could potentially serve
   as useful bioindicators of ecological succession or restoration. Apart
   from soil organic matter content none of the predictor variables tested,
   including plant species richness, were significantly correlated with
   spider richness or diversity. Spider richness and diversity are most
   likely determined by a complex interaction of environmental and temporal
   factors that operate at different spatial scales. This study has
   increased our understanding of the ecological associations of spider
   communities and established that TPED is an important centre of endemism
   for spiders in New Zealand. We have also demonstrated the importance of
   forest remnants as reservoirs of indigenous spider diversity and helped
   resolve several historical taxonomic issues. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   the need for taxonomic research in this region of New Zealand and
   highlight the value of such biodiversity surveys.},

Title = {Current knowledge and potential impacts of climate change on New
   Zealand's biological heritage},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {While global climate change is impacting biota across the world, New
   Zealand's maritime climate is highly variable and relatively mild, so
   climate change is sometimes seen as a minimal threat to species and
   ecosystems especially in comparison to the more immediate threat of
   invasive species. However, climate change will alter rainfall patterns,
   increase the incidence and severity of extreme events, and gradually
   increase temperatures which will all modify terrestrial, freshwater, and
   marine systems. Our comprehensive review of reported climate change
   impacts in New Zealand indicates that most measured impacts to date are
   due to indirect impacts (such as exacerbation of invasive species
   impacts) and most are in the marine realm. Ocean acidification and
   marine heatwaves are particularly problematic for calcareous organisms
   and algae respectively. Other notable impacts include thermal squeeze in
   the alpine zone and impacts of drought on freshwater fish. Very small
   populations of rare and threatened species can be very vulnerable to
   extreme events (e.g. fire, floods). While the evidence for climate
   change impacts is sparse in some regions and for some ecosystems, we
   encourage ongoing monitoring to identify processes of decline that may
   need to be mitigated. We identify five key research needs to improve our
   understanding of the threat of climate change to the biodiversity of
   Aotearoa New Zealand.},

Title = {Understanding farmer behaviour: A psychological approach to encouraging
   pro-biodiversity actions on-farm},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Understanding farmer behaviour and drivers for behaviour change will be
   the key to bringing about practice change, such as increasing management
   and enhancement of native biodiversity on-farm. Farmer participation in
   biodiversity protection and management is a critical challenge for both
   national conservation outcomes and achieving more sustainable farm
   systems. Enhancing native biodiversity provides a mechanism for
   increasing the sustainability of food and fibre production, mitigation
   of environmental emissions, and enhancing the resilience of farm systems
   to weather events and the impacts of climate change. We surveyed 500
   sheep and beef farmers throughout New Zealand using a survey explicitly
   based on the dominant psychological model of volitional behaviour, the
   Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Farmers' attitudes, perception of
   social norms, control beliefs, moral obligation, and perceived
   private-public benefit, regarding the protection and management of
   native biodiversity on-farm, were investigated. We used a combination of
   descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and TPB regression
   modelling of the survey data to understand past pro-biodiversity
   behaviour and future intentions to implement pro-biodiversity behaviours
   on-farm. We found that sheep and beef farmers saw (1) greater public
   than private benefit resulting from the protection and management of
   native biodiversity on-farm; (2) belief in the efficacy of specific
   biodiversity behaviours has a stronger relationship with actual
   behaviour than intentional behaviour; and (3) planning for
   pro-biodiversity behaviours, such as in a farm planning process,
   increases farmer pro-biodiversity behaviour. We conclude there is a need
   to increase farmer understanding of pro-biodiversity practices and
   outcomes for both farmer private and public benefit and the removal and
   dissolution of perceived barriers and constraints preventing more
   pro-biodiversity behaviour on-farm. Based on this research, we recommend
   that policy initiatives should be targeted at (1) illustrating and
   communicating the multiple values of native biodiversity to farm systems
   and farming enterprises (private benefit), and to ecosystem function and
   New Zealand's conservation objectives as a whole (public benefit); (2)
   the specific areas operating as behavioural controls on pro-biodiversity
   behaviour, and (3) integrating native biodiversity considerations into
   farm planning processes.},

Abstract = {Twenty years of monitoring data are assessed for trends in abundance of
   running buffalo clover (Trifolium stoloniferum), an endangered species
   found on the Fernow Experimental Forest in northeastern West Virginia,
   where the clover is found under various forest management intensities.
   Monitored locations were grouped for analysis into sites with common
   disturbance histories. Of the 13 sites, about half (46\%, six sites)
   were found to have statistically significant trends between numbers of
   rooted crowns and time. Three out of eight sites with recent and
   sustained periodic disturbance showed a significant association between
   time and running buffalo clover counts and the trend is positive. Of the
   sites with no management or no recent harvest activity, three were found
   to have negative trends of running buffalo clover counts over time,
   although at only one site was this statistically significant. This
   analysis of monitoring data gives some support for previous findings
   that the number of running buffalo clover rooted crowns is tied to
   disturbance on the skid roads and increased light conditions created by
   periodic harvesting.},

Title = {Effects of Stream Enhancement Structures on Water Temperature in South
   Sister Creek, Oregon},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-151},
Abstract = {We evaluated commonly used methods for monitoring stream restorations to
   inform and improve restoration monitoring and evaluation, using a
   headwater stream in the Oregon Coast Range as a case-study example.
   In-stream restoration projects are seldom monitored both pre- and
   post-restoration. In addition, frequently used low-cost methods may not
   provide sufficient data to effectively assess trends in stream
   temperature. Here, we examined what can be learned from temperature
   loggers installed in the same locations over multiple years in a
   restored stream. In-stream structures were installed between 2007 and
   2011 along a 10-km length of South Sister Creek, Oregon for the purpose
   of enhancing in-stream habitat. Summer stream temperature data were
   collected using Hobo Pro-V temperature-logging thennistors at four
   locations in 2006, prior to restoration, as well as in 2012 and 2013. In
   2013, additional temperature loggers were placed within 80 m of the four
   original loggers to investigate within-reach variability. Although
   median stream temperatures were highest in 2013 at all four multi-year
   sites, 7-day maximum temperatures were 4 to 5 degrees C cooler in
   post-treatment years than in 2006. Inter-annual variability in stream
   temperature was more closely linked to inter-annual variability in air
   temperature and solar radiation than presence of in-stream structures.
   Thermal heterogeneity was greater in reaches with deeper pools than in
   bedrock-dominated reaches. Although in-stream structures can create cool
   microhabitats, they have little influence on mean stream temperature.
   Longer pre-restoration monitoring and sensor deployment in more varied
   in-stream habitats would improve our ability to evaluate restoration
   impacts.},

Volume = {42},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We studied the long-term demographic structure of the endangered
   hemiparasitic plant, Schwalbea americana (American chaffseed), in the
   New Jersey Pine Barrens from 1991 to 2020 in order to address important
   questions about its population biology, life history, and responses to
   management. These included the relative contributions of dormancy,
   recruitment, and other life stages to annual population changes, as well
   as its ecological responses to fire, mowing, and other factors over
   time. Following baseline surveys in 1991, we conducted annual censuses
   from 1993 to 2020 and individualistic plant monitoring from 1999 to
   2020. The Schwalbea population initially exhibited positive growth, with
   major increases observed in the early 2000s, followed by steady,
   long-term declines. We used generalized linear models and mixed effects
   models to analyze the relationships between demographic and
   environmental variables at the population and individual levels,
   respectively. Dormant season prescribed burning and mowing yielded
   significant increases in flowering, stems, and survival, with apparent
   residual benefits in subsequent years following repeated treatments.
   Germination declined to 0\% after 4 y in seed viability experiments, and
   recruitment was more strongly correlated with estimated seed bank sizes
   than with flowering alone. Dormant plants represented an average of 21\%
   of the total population, with 20\% of above ground plants entering
   dormancy annually. Most dormancy events (92\%) were 1-3 y in duration,
   indicating that mortality cannot be distinguished from dormancy for a
   minimum of 3 y after disappearance. Annual survivorship was high (mean =
   88\%), with 9\% of individuals surviving 18 y on average, but differed
   significantly by cohort and increased with management. Significant
   differences were observed in size and flowering by age/stage class.
   However, size alone was insufficient to identify Schwalbea recruits from
   older plants, due to overlap of their lower size ranges. Long-term
   declines in survival and recruitment persisted despite suppression of
   woody succession by hand clipping and intermittent mowing and burning.
   Increased frequency of mowing or burning may be needed to sustain this
   population in the future. The relationships of growth and vital rates to
   other factors are provided, and the benefits of individualistic data for
   informing Schwalbea monitoring and management are discussed.},

Abstract = {Protection and management of tallgrass prairie remnants are critical to
   the continued existence of this rare ecosystem. While effects of
   individual management events (especially fire and grazing) are
   understood relatively well, their combined, long-term effects are more
   difficult to predict. We examined how a large (283 ha) tallgrass prairie
   remnant in Texas responded to changes in management. Previously, the
   site had been hayed annually for similar to 100 y. In 1987, management
   changed to prescribed fire in multiple seasons (average fire return
   interval of 3.5 y) and occasional grazing and haying. From 1996 through
   2020, native species richness increased from 39 +/- 3 to 47 +/- 1
   species on slopes and from 33 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 4 species on summits (mean
   +/- standard error, 7.5 m(2) sample area). The number of specialist
   species (coefficient of conservatism >= 7) remained stable (slopes: 7
   +/- 0.4 to 10 +/- 1; summits: 5 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 1). Forb cover increased
   dramatically (slopes: 44 +/- 3\% to 66 +/- 5\%; summits: 39 +/- 7\% to
   65 +/- 6\%). While overall graminoid cover remained similar, cool-season
   graminoid cover increased (slopes: 4 +/- 2\% to 14 +/- 2\%; summits: 12
   +/- 9\% to 18 +/- 2\%) and warm-season graminoid cover decreased
   (slopes: 49 +/- 4\% to 35 +/- 3\%; summits: 30 +/- 6\% to 26 +/- 3\%).
   Tree and shrub cover remained low (<3\%). The site's large size and the
   repeated use of prescribed fire likely contributed to these outcomes.
   Because fire seasonality can favor either grasses or forbs, burning in
   multiple seasons can increase forb cover and diversity while still
   maintaining grass cover. Prairie remnants should be actively managed to
   avoid woody encroachment and to maintain diversity.},

Abstract = {Chapin Mesa milkvetch (Astragalus schmolliae) is an endemic, obligate
   pinon-juniper woodland species that occupies approximately 2500 ha in
   southwest Colorado. In 2002 a crown fire burned 38\% of the known
   distribution in Mesa Verde National Park. Initially, Chapin Mesa
   milkvetch (CMM) responded positively to the 2002 burn, increasing in
   density compared to unburned areas. Nine years post-fire (2011), the
   density in burned areas was nearly twice that of unburned transects. By
   2013, the pattern had reversed, and by 2019, the juvenile and adult
   population in the burned area was reduced to half that of unburned
   (0.046 plants/m(2) vs. 0.089 plants/m(2)). Recruitment of CMM in burned
   areas in 2019 was near zero: 4 seedlings in 63 burned transects vs. 6079
   seedlings in 105 unburned transects. The downward trend in CMM density
   in the burn is likely associated with intensified competition from the
   dense grass cover. Prior to the burn, the grass cover in the
   to-be-burned area was qualitatively similar to that in present day
   unburned areas, which is 15\%, almost exclusively muttongrass (Poa
   fendleriana), a shallow-rooted bunch grass. In 2019, cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum) and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), seeded in 2002,
   dominated the cover in the burn, averaging 45\% cover, collectively.
   Management practices that assist the recovery of burned pinon-juniper
   woodland (and therefore CMM), as well as preserving the remaining
   old-growth pinon-juniper stands, are likely key to CMM long-term
   survival.},

Abstract = {Understanding current and future biodiversity responses to changing
   climate is pivotal as anthropogenic climate change continues. This
   understanding is complicated by the multitude of available metrics to
   quantify dynamics and by biased sampling protocols. Here, we investigate
   the impact of sampling protocol strategies using a data-rich fossil
   record to calculate effective diversity using Hill numbers for the first
   time on Paleogene planktonic foraminifera. We sample 22,830 individual
   tests, in two different size classes, across a 7 Myr time slice of the
   middle Eocene featuring a major transient warming event, the middle
   Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; similar to 40 Ma), at study sites in the
   midlatitude North Atlantic. Using generalized additive models, we
   investigate community responses to climatic fluctuations. After
   correcting for arty effects of fossil fragmentation, we show a peak in
   generic diversity in the early and middle stages of the MECO as well as
   divergent trajectories between the typical size-selected community (>180
   mu m) and a broader assemblage, including smaller genera (>63 mu m).
   Assemblages featuring smaller genera are more resilient to the climatic
   fluctuations of the MECO than those assemblages that feature only larger
   genera, maintaining their community structure at the reference Hill
   numbers for Shannon's and Simpson's indices. These results raise
   fundamental questions about how communities respond to climate
   excursions. In addition, our results emphasize the need to design
   studies with the aim of collecting the most inclusive data possible to
   allow detection of community changes and determine which species are
   likely to dominate future environments.},

Abstract = {This study compares the delta N-15 values and the trophic position of
   two seabird species throughout the late Holocene in three regions in the
   southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess the hypothesis that the decimation
   of megafauna led to changes in the trophic position of mesopredators.
   Modern and ancient mollusk shells were also analyzed to account for
   changes in the isotopic baseline through time. Results revealed that
   modern Magellanic penguins have higher delta N-15 values than their
   ancient conspecifics in the three regions, after controlling for changes
   in the isotopic baseline. This was also true for modern Imperial shags
   compared with ancient unidentified cormorants/shags from the two areas
   where ancient specimens were recovered (southern Patagonia and the
   Beagle Channel). Such temporal variability might be caused by three
   non-mutually exclusive processes: decreased availability of pelagic
   squat lobster resulting from decreasing primary productivity through the
   late Holocene, increased availability of small fishes resulting from the
   sequential depletion of other piscivores (South American fur seal and
   sea lion and Argentine hake) since the late eighteenth century, and
   modification of the migratory patterns of Magellanic penguins. Although
   disentangling the relative contribution of all those processes is
   impossible at this time, the results reported here demonstrate that the
   ecology of Magellanic penguins and Imperial shags has undergone major
   changes since the late Holocene.},

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},

Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-119},

Abstract = {A dramatic shift from carbonate-rich to chert-rich marine strata
   occurred during the Permian and is frequently attributed to the
   increased activity of siliceous sponges and their biosiliceous
   sedimentation. The first-order ecologic consequences of this transition,
   if any, remain opaque. We analyze fossil occurrence data from the
   Phosphoria Basin (western North America) to test whether the presence of
   siliceous sponges, which are correlated with basin-wide chert strata,
   influenced the recruitment of benthic fauna. Using published lithologic
   descriptions, we categorized fossil collections by formation, facies,
   and lithology and used these data to code detrended correspondence
   analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We also
   analyzed the clustering of taxa into faunal units termed biofacies.
   Results from these analyses indicate that fossil collections occurring
   in chert and carbonate are closely associated in faunal composition and
   community structure. These collections preferentially occur in the
   inner- to mid-ramp facies, in agreement with previous studies. Although
   largely similar in composition, collections of chert and carbonate
   lithology exhibit differences in the frequency and abundance of
   accessory brachiopod taxa (e.g., Composita and Hustedia), possibly a
   result of greater biosiliceous sedimentary input.},

Abstract = {Fungi play an important role in soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in
   many agricultural soil systems. However, the effect of fungi on N2O
   emission in Chinese milk vetch (CMV)-containing soils has not been
   examined sufficiently. This study investigated the contribution of
   bacteria and fungi to soil N2O emission in CMV-amended soils. We
   compared soils from an experimental field in the Fujian Academy of
   Agricultural Sciences that had been treated with 30 000 kg of CMV per
   667 m(2) per year with one that was not treated with CMV. We incubated
   soil using cycloheximide and streptomycin to differentiate fungal and
   bacterial N2O emissions, respectively. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was
   performed to investigate bacterial and fungal abundances in the two
   agricultural soil ecosystems. The contribution of fungi to soil N2O
   emission in CMV-amended soils was greater than that in non-CMV-amended
   paddy soils, with fungi accounting for more than 56\% of the emissions
   in CMV-amended soils. Quantitative PCR showed that the ratio of the
   internal transcribed spacer to 16S rDNA was significantly higher in
   CMV-amended soils than in non-CMV-amended paddy soils. Furthermore, soil
   properties, such as pH (P<0.05) and NH4+ concentration (P<0.05),
   significantly and negatively affected N2O emission by fungi in soil,
   whereas the total organic carbon (P<0.05) and NO3- concentration
   (P<0.05) showed significant positive effects. Fungi may be important
   contributors to N2O production in CMV-amended soils, which may create
   challenges for mitigating N2O production. (C) Higher Education Press

Abstract = {Lead (Pb) pollution is one of the most widespread and harmful
   environmental problems worldwide. Determination of changes in soil
   properties and microbial functional diversity due to land use is needed
   to establish a basis for remediation of soil pollution. This study aimed
   to investigate soils contaminated by Pb from different sources and to
   analyze the functional diversity and metabolism of soil microbial
   communities using Biolog technology. Pb pollution (> 300 mg kg(-1))
   significantly influenced the diversity and metabolic functions of soil
   microbial communities. Specifically, Pb contamination significantly
   reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels and
   catalase activity while increasing invertase activity. Furthermore,
   Biolog EcoPlate assays revealed that Pb pollution reduced the general
   activities of soil microorganisms, suppressing their ability to utilize
   C sources. In Pb-contaminated areas lacking vegetation cover, Shannon,
   Simpson, and McIntosh diversity indices of soil microorganisms were
   significantly reduced. The microbial diversity and biomass C and N
   levels were affected by land use and soil properties, respectively,
   whereas soil enzyme activity was primarily affected by the interaction

Abstract = {Human disturbances to soils can lead to dramatic changes in soil
   physical, chemical, and biological properties. The influence of
   agricultural activities on the bacterial community over different orders
   of soil and at depth is still not well understood. We used the concept
   of genoform and phenoform to investigate the vertical (down to 1 m
   depth) soil bacterial community structure in paired genosoils
   (undisturbed forests) and phenosoils (cultivated vineyards) in different
   soil orders. The study was conducted in the Hunter Valley area, New
   South Wales, Australia, where samples were collected from 3 different
   soil orders (Calcarosol, Chromosol, and Kurosol), and each soil order
   consists of a pair of genosoil and phenosoil. The bacterial community
   structure was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA.
   Results showed that bacterial-diversity decreased with depth in
   phenosoils, however, the trend is less obvious in genoform profiles.
   Topsoil diversity was greater in phenosoils than genosoils, but the
   trend was reversed in subsoils. Thus, cropping not only affected topsoil
   bacteria community but also decreased its diversity in the subsoil.
   Bacterial community in topsoils was influenced by both soil orders and
   soil forms, however, in subsoils it was more impacted by soil orders.
   Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates revealed that cropping
   increased the similarity of bacterial structures of different soil
   orders. This study highlighted the strong influence of agricultural
   activities on soil microbial distribution with depth, which is
   controlled by soil order. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

Abstract = {In well-established flowering plant invasions, floral phenotypes that do
   not attract pollinators are predicted to be eliminated through natural
   selection. We explored this hypothesis in the invasive plant species
   Scotch broom ( Cytisus scoparius), which has yellow flowers frequented
   by a diverse community of bee species, as well as red-tinged flowers
   that are predicted to be pollinated at a significantly lower rate. We
   predicted that plants with the red-flower phenotype will have fewer
   flowers visited, produce fewer seed pods per flower, and produce fewer
   seeds per pod than the yellow-flowered type. To investigate this, we
   measured the proportion of flowers pollinated for red- and
   yellow-flowered phenotypes, observed the number of seed pods produced
   per flower, and counted seeds per pod. Although we found lower
   pollination in the red-flowered phenotype, we did not see differences in
   female fitness. Scotch broom is an invader predicted to be limited in
   fecundity by the rate of pollinator visits and would be expected to lose
   phenotypes that attract fewer pollinators. We found the persistence of a
   less-attractive phenotype, likely because the reduction in male fitness
   is not paired with a reduction in female fitness.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Responses of Wintering Bald Eagles to Changes in Salmon
   Carcass Availability in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {307-316},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Each winter, thousands of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from
   across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed
   on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta).
   However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are
   reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source
   for eagles. The ability of eagles to adjust to these impacts is crucial
   to their survival, and their responses are currently unknown. I
   hypothesized that eagles are responding by redistributing to non-river
   habitat in search of alternative food sources. Specifically, I examined
   the redistribution of over-wintering eagles from river habitat to nearby
   agricultural areas in response to seasonal declines in carcass
   availability. Over two consecutive winters, I conducted weekly eagle
   surveys on a 30-km stretch of the Nooksack River and a 22.5-km stretch
   of farmland northwest of the river. I examined the association between
   salmon carcass distribution and eagle abundance on the Nooksack River,
   and evaluated the temporal relationship between eagle abundance on the
   Nooksack River versus neighboring farmland. I found a strong negative
   association between eagle abundance on the river versus adjacent
   farmland, and observed eagles primarily concentrated near dairy farms
   and waterfowl rafts. My results suggest that eagles are responding to
   declining carcass availability by redistributing to non-river habitat in
   search of alternative food sources, and that a substantial fraction may
   migrate to agricultural areas.},

Title = {Moths can transfer pollen between flowers under experimental conditions},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {To be considered an effective pollinator, a floral visitor must not only
   be able to remove pollen but also transfer this pollen to a receptive
   conspecific stigma. While studies of diurnal pollination are
   commonplace, our understanding of the effectiveness of nocturnal
   pollinators is limited largely because of the difficulties of doing
   these studies at night. As a result of this, the way in which moths
   transfer pollen between flowers has been understudied globally, despite
   many authors suggesting they could be significant contributors to
   pollination. Here, we tested whether moths are capable of transferring
   pollen between flowers under experimental conditions using a fluorescent
   pollen-tracker powder. A flower-feeding taxon (Noctuidae: Ichneutica
   plena) and non-feeding taxon (Hepialidae: Wiseana spp.) were contained
   overnight with flowering shoots of putatively moth-pollinated
   Leptospermum scoparium and Pimelea prostrata (I. plena only), and
   putatively bird-pollinated Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. Moths were able
   to transfer pollen tracker between flowers for both of the putatively
   moth-pollinated species, while no pollen tracker was removed from
   putatively bird-pollinated flowers. Both the feeding and non-feeding
   moth taxa were able to transfer pollen tracker between flowers; however,
   the feeding taxon could be considered a more effective pollinator
   because of the greater proportion of individuals both carrying and
   transferring pollen tracker compared with the non-feeding taxon. This
   study provides experimental evidence that moths may contribute to the
   pollination of L. scoparium and P. prostrata, and suggests a
   reassessment of the pollination ecology for these species is warranted.},

Title = {A partial skeleton provides evidence for the former occurrence of moa
   populations on Rakiura Stewart Island},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The pre-human moa fauna of Rakiura Stewart Island is poorly known, and
   although there is little clear evidence that moa occurred naturally on
   the island, isolated moa bones are often found associated with
   archaeological middens. Here we report the discovery and collection of
   what is likely a naturally deposited partial South Island giant moa
   (Dinornis robustus) skeleton from West Ruggedy Beach, Rakiura,
   radiocarbon dated to 1297-1395 CE (95.4\% CI). The time of death of this
   moa overlaps with the early occupation of the island by Maori. However,
   the discovery of this moa skeleton in a dune environment with the
   presence of an organic rich layer beneath the skeleton, associated
   gizzard stones, and an absence of archaeological material/ features or
   any cut marks on the bones indicating a cultural association, suggests
   this individual likely represents a natural subfossil deposit. We
   discuss the skeleton in the context of other moa remains found on the
   island and comment on the occurrence of moa populations on Rakiura,
   ultimately concluding that this skeleton provides additional evidence
   for the natural occurrence of moa on Rakiura.},

Title = {Seasonal Catch Rates of the Endemic Olympic Mudminnow in Wetland Habitat},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-209},
Abstract = {The Olympic mudminnow (Novumbra hubbsi) is a small freshwater fish,
   endemic to western Washington State. Although the species is listed as a
   Washington sensitive species, the lack of routine monitoring has
   resulted in poor understanding of population dynamics over time needed
   to support management and conservation actions. Olympic mudminnow
   commonly live in wetlands and associated low-gradient channels with
   tannic water and soft substrates, making conventional electrofishing and
   seine sampling approaches challenging and potentially inaccurate.
   Alternatively, minnow traps can easily be set in a wide range of depths
   and habitat types and allow for more systematic, repeated sampling. The
   study purpose was to conduct monthly surveys over a 19-month period to
   help develop standardized sampling methods. Sampling using baited Gee
   minnow traps set overnight was conducted in a wetland complex that flows
   into Eld Inlet in south Puget Sound, Washington. Catch rates of Olympic
   mudminnow were highest in late summer to early autumn (August through
   November) when water depths were low and water temperatures were
   decreasing. Trap mortality was relatively low for both Olympic mudminnow
   and amphibians but increased during warm spring and summer months.
   Eighty percent of the Olympic mudminnow captured were between 44 and 56
   mm total length, and there was no difference in size between males and
   females. Gravid females were observed from October to June. Overall,
   minnow trapping appeared to be an effective method for monitoring
   Olympic mudminnow populations year round; however, sampling in the
   autumn appears to be advantageous because catch rates were high, and
   mortality was low.},

Abstract = {Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora {[}MPR]) is an invasive, nonnative
   plant that has invaded many temperate forests across the eastern United
   States, often outcompeting native plants for sunlight and other
   resources. Herbicides can control MFR, but they can also reduce
   nontarget plant species and threaten aquatic ecosystems. In a black
   cherry-red maple forest in the Erie National Wildlife Refuge in
   Pennsylvania, the US Fish and Wildlife Service introduced prescribed
   goat-browsing as an exploratory control method. In four treatments,
   browsed, browsed/herbicide, cut/herbicide, and an unmanaged reference,
   we evaluated preliminary effects of these treatments on MFR and non-MFR
   herbaceous vegetation. For MFR, the browsed treatment had 56\% lower
   leaf/stem mass ratios and 35\% shorter stem lengths than the reference;
   the leaf/stem ratio in the cut/herbicide treatment was 55\% lower than
   the reference. Stem density was not reduced because goats did not kill
   the MFR plants in this first year of treatment. The herbicide treatment
   had fewer non-MFR plants than the reference treatment. Light levels at
   ground level did not differ among the treatments. Overall, 33\% of trees
   in the browsed treatment were affected by the goats, with 9\% being
   completely girdled; red maple and ironwood were the most commonly
   browsed species. Preliminary results suggest that goats can be an
   effective control for MFR, however long-term success will be best
   evaluated after consecutive treatment seasons. Goats may increase tree
   mortality and shift tree species composition in stands dominated by
   trees with high browsing rates, but effects on diverse stands may be
   less pronounced.},

Title = {The sponge pump as a morphological character in the fossil record},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The timing of early animal evolution remains one of the biggest
   conundrums in biology. Molecular data suggest Porifera diverged from the
   metazoan lineage some 800 Ma to 650 Ma, which contrasts with the
   earliest widely accepted fossils of sponges at 535 Ma. However, the lack
   of criteria by which to recognize the earliest animals in the fossil
   record presents a challenge. The sponge body plan is unchanged since the
   early Cambrian, which makes a sponge-type animal a good candidate for
   the earliest fossils. Here we propose a method for identifying an
   organism as sponge grade by translating the sponge pump character into a
   quantifiable morphological trait. We show that the ratio between the two
   major components of the aquiferous system, the cross-sectional area of
   the osculum (OSA) and the surface area of the whole sponge (SA), is an
   effective metric of the pump character of extant sponges and that the
   slope of this ratio is distinct for three classes of Porifera:
   Demospongiae, Calcarea, and Hexactinellida. Furthermore, this metric is
   effective at distinguishing as sponges both extant taxa and fossils from
   two extremes of the Phanerozoic, the Cambrian and Paleogene. We tested
   this metric on the putative Ediacaran sponge Thectardis avalonensis from
   Mistaken Point, Newfoundland, and found Thectardis fits both with
   Cambrian sponges and with modern demosponges. These analyses show that
   the OSA/SA ratio is a reliable character by which to identify fossils as
   sponge grade, opening up exciting possibilities for classifying new
   fossils as sponges.},

Abstract = {The Ordovician-Silurian (similar to 485-419 Ma) was a time of
   considerable evolutionary upheaval, encompassing both great evolutionary
   diversification and one of the first major mass extinctions. The
   Ordovician diversification coincided with global climatic cooling and
   paleocontinental collision, the ecological impacts of which were
   mediated by region-specific processes including substrate changes,
   biotic invasions, and tectonic movements. From the Sandbian-Katian
   (similar to 453 Ma) onward, an extensive carbonate shelf developed in
   the eastern Baltic paleobasin in response to a tectonic shift to
   tropical latitudes and an increase in the abundance of calcareous
   macroorganisms. We quantify the contributions of environmental
   differentiation and temporal turnover to regional diversity through the
   Ordovician and Silurian, using brachiopod occurrences from the more
   shallow-water facies belts of the eastern Baltic paleobasin, an
   epicontinental sea on the Baltica paleocontinent. The results are
   consistent with carbonate shelf development as a driver of Ordovician
   regional diversification, both by enhancing broadscale differentiation
   between shallow- and deep-marine environments and by generating
   heterogeneous carbonate environments that allowed increasing numbers of
   brachiopod genera to coexist. However, temporal turnover also
   contributed significantly to apparent regional diversity, particularly
   in the Middle-Late Ordovician.},

Abstract = {Dinosaur embryos cause a lot of excitement in the scientific literature
   and are often widely reported because of the general public's interest
   in dinosaur biology. Well-preserved, articulated oviraptorosaur embryos
   in eggs are usually interpreted as representing a stage of development
   close to hatching because of their large size and good level of skeletal
   ossification. Based on this evidence, a recent report suggested that the
   position of the one embryo's head was reminiscent of an avian-like
   hatching position. Here we explore how the developmental stage of
   well-preserved oviraptorosaur embryos can be estimated, rather than
   assumed. This will help in our understanding of their developmental
   biology and its evolutionary consequences. Using quantitative methods
   and comparison with modern crocodilian embryos, we show that all
   articulated oviraptorosaur embryos are small relative to the egg and
   most likely at a stage of development equivalent to around 50\%-60\% of
   the developmental period, that is, not even close to hatching. This
   conclusion is supported by the fact that many elements of the
   crocodilian skeleton are well ossified many weeks before hatching and
   the position of oviraptorosaur embryos' heads was also comparable to a
   crocodilian embryo many days before hatching. Misunderstandings about
   the stage of the developmental biology of these well-preserved
   oviraptorosaur embryos hampers our understanding of the true nature of
   their reproductive biology. We urge a more conservative approach to
   their interpretation. This is important, because misunderstandings in
   the minds of the public about dinosaur biology are hard to counter once
   poorly evidenced ideas have been reported around the world.},

Abstract = {Conodonts were a highly diverse and abundant vertebrate group whose
   fossils are found in marine Paleozoic and Triassic strata around the
   world. They inhabited environments ranging from lagoons to open oceans
   and are represented by a wide variety of dental morphologies. Conodonts
   may have filled many different ecological niches and represent a
   significant proportion of nekton before the Devonian. Despite this, very
   little is known about trophic ecology of conodonts. While morphological
   diversity suggests a complex trophic structure within conodont
   communities, there is little evidence to support dietary niche
   partitioning among conodonts. We tested the hypothesis that individual
   conodont taxa occupied different trophic niches, using Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca
   ratios preserved in the dental elements of assemblages from Silurian
   strata of Gotland, Sweden. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca have been shown to vary in
   vertebrate skeletal tissues depending on trophic positioning, although
   biological and environmental conditions can affect these ratios.
   Environmental influences were minimized by examining entire conodont
   communities from a tropical epeiric sea and by measuring strontium
   isotope ratios using thermal ionization mass spectrometry in the most
   metropolitan taxon (Ozarkodina confluens). Composition of white matter,
   a tissue unique to conodonts, was also analyzed using microprobe
   analysis, revealing significantly lower Sr concentrations than in
   surrounding lamellar tissue, suggesting taxon-specific histology should
   be considered when analyzing conodonts for geochemical data. Excluding
   taxa with highly variable quantities of white matter, the results show
   that each taxon preserves different Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios with limited
   overlap, indicating variation in trophic positioning.},

Abstract = {Status of several large-river darter species is uncertain because of
   difficulties sampling deep-water habitats. We characterized the darter
   (Family: Percidae) community in main and side channel macrohabitats of
   the upper Mississippi River using a small-mesh benthic trawl at sites in
   five navigation pools and a portion of the lower St. Croix River
   encompassing nearly 200 river kilometers in 2016 and 2017. We captured
   six darter species in conjunction with a survey to assess crystal darter
   (Crystallaria asprella) (state endangered) status and estimated density
   (n/700 m(2)) and population size for selected species in navigation
   pools. No crystal darter were collected in 83 trawl tows, including tows
   made at historical crystal darter locations. However, a total of 154
   western sand darter (Atnmocrypta dam) (globally vulnerable) were
   captured with density estimates ranging among pools from 1.0 to 9.6 in
   main channel and 1.0 to 5.0 in side channel macrohabitats. The largest
   population estimate was 33,286 (95\% confidence limit: 17,974-52,725)
   for western sand darter in all side channels in Pool 7. A total of 71
   river darter (Percina shumardi) were captured with zero caught in some
   pools to a maximum mean density of 17.5/700 m(2) in Pool 3. Highest
   population size was 14,829 (8260-25,127) for river darter in the lower
   St. Croix River. A total of 43 logperch (Percina caprodes) and 143
   johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum) were captured but exhibited clumped
   spatial distributions that hindered population estimates. Only three mud
   darter (Etheostotna asprigene) and one slenderhead darter (Percina
   phoxocephala) were captured in deep-water habitats. Crystal darter
   absence supports continued state endangered classification. However, our
   density and population estimates for western sand darter and river
   darter represent the first such estimates for the upper Mississippi
   River and perhaps the world and should be used as baselines for future
   comparisons.},

Title = {Co-flowering Plant Densities Affect Bee Visitation to a Focal Plant
   Species, but Bee Genera Differ in Their Response},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The relative densities of co-flowering plant species can affect
   pollinator foraging behavior, i.e., bee choice of which plants to visit
   in a foraging path. Because animal-pollinated plants depend on
   sequential pollinator visits to conspecifics for successful
   reproduction, understanding the relationship between relative densities
   of co-flowering plants and bee visits within a foraging path is
   necessary to determine whether co-flowering species facilitate or
   compete for bee visitation. We examined the role of relative
   co-flowering plant species densities in determining bee visits to two
   focal plant species (Astragalus scaphoides and Penstemon albertinus)
   within foraging paths by following individual bees in natural
   multispecies co-flowering plant communities. We found that conspecific
   and heterospecific plant density influenced the proportion of visits to
   the focal plant species during foraging bouts, but effects of density
   differed among bee groups. Considering all bees, Lupinus spp.
   facilitated visits to A. scaphoides while Castilleja spp. competed with
   A. scaphoides for visits. When three bee groups, Bombus,
   Anthophora/Eucera, and ``small bees,'' were modeled separately, Bombus
   consistently visited A. scaphoides more than expected regardless of its
   density and P. albertinus less than expected at intermediate densities.
   Anthophora/Eucera exhibited a nonlinear response to A. scaphoides floral
   density but visited P. albertinus in direct proportion to its density.
   ``Small bees'' visited both plants in direct proportion to their
   densities. Our results highlight that bee groups should be treated
   separately in models of pollinator visitation behavior, and that the
   composition and density of the co-flowering plant community may impact
   reproductive success of focal plant species.},

Abstract = {Increasingly large high-severity wildfires in dry forests of the western
   United States have led to concern about how best to regenerate new
   forests after wildfires. Harvesting fire-killed trees, burning woody
   debris, and tree planting are commonly used reforestation strategies.
   This study evaluated the effects of a novel forest restoration approach
   that involved masticating un-merchantable dead trees and spreading the
   woody debris generated across the site to prevent erosion from the 2007
   Angora Fire in Lake Tahoe, California. Woody material covered 82\% of
   the site after treatment, with an average depth of 6.6 cm, and volume of
   190 tonnes per hectare. We found that this treatment reduced shrub
   regrowth, compared to an untreated area nearby, and that shrub regrowth
   was inversely related to fuel depth. Seven years after the fire, shrub
   cover averaged only 50\% on treated plots compared to 92\% on untreated
   plots. The tallest shrubs averaged 69 cm in height on the treated site
   compared to 114 cm on nearby untreated sites. Tree seedlings planted on
   the treated site averaged 141 cm in height, well above the height of the
   shrubs. Advantages of this approach include controlling erosion while
   reducing drought stress, reducing the potential for weed introduction,
   and reducing the need for herbicide to control shrub competition.
   Although leaving a layer of woody material where new trees have been
   planted does constitute a fire hazard, so too does a vigorous shrub
   layer. Managers should consider and weigh these factors when deciding on
   a postfire reforestation strategy.},

Title = {The structure of the nonmarine fossil record: predictions from a coupled

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Presented here is a coupled model of the nonmarine fossil record, based
   on a geometric model of deposition, a random-branching model of
   evolution, and an ecological model based on an elevation gradient. This
   model provides testable predictions about the stratigraphy and fossil
   occurrences in coastal nonmarine settings under three scenarios of
   sea-level change. A slow relative rise in sea level causes a declining
   ratio of channel to floodplain deposits, plus changes in community
   composition that reflect an upward increase in elevation relative to sea
   level. A rapid relative rise in sea level drives increasing aggradation
   rates, decreases the ratio of channel to floodplain deposits, and
   triggers a shift from higher-elevation (more inland) to lower-elevation
   (more coastal) communities. A fall in sea level produces an
   unconformity, manifested by valleys separated by interfluves. The
   resumption of deposition following the sea-level fall causes an abrupt
   shift in community composition across the unconformity, reflecting the
   duration of the hiatus and the increased elevation relative to sea
   level. This produces a cluster of first and last occurrences at the
   unconformity, and it is the only sequence-stratigraphic source of such
   clusters in a nonmarine system, in contrast to the multiple mechanisms
   for generating these clusters in marine systems. A central prediction of
   these models is that the nonmarine fossil record preserves systematic
   changes in community composition that reflect elevation (or
   equivalently, distance from shore). Diagnosing these gradients in
   ancient systems is a promising avenue of future research.},

Abstract = {Relaxed clock models are fundamental in Bayesian clock dating, but a
   single distribution characterizing the clock variation is typically
   selected. Hence, I developed a new reversible-jump Markov chain Monte
   Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm for drawing posterior samples between the
   independent lognormal (ILN) and independent gamma rates (IGR) clock
   models. The ability of the rjMCMC algorithm to infer the true model was
   verified through simulations. I then applied the algorithm to the
   Mesozoic bird data previously analyzed under the white noise (WN) clock
   model. In comparison, averaging over the ILN and IGR models provided
   more reliable estimates of the divergence times and evolutionary rates.
   The ILN model showed slightly better fit than the IGR model and much
   better fit than the autocorrelated lognormal (ALN) clock model. When the
   data were partitioned, different partitions showed heterogeneous model
   fit for ILN and IGR clocks. The implementation provides a general
   framework for selecting and averaging relaxed clock models in Bayesian
   dating analyses.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The end-Cretaceous (K/Pg) mass extinction event is the most recent and
   well-understood of the ``big five{''} and triggered establishment of
   modern terrestrial ecosystem structure. Despite the depth of research
   into this event, our knowledge of upper Maastrichtian terrestrial
   deposits globally relies primarily on assemblage-level data limited to a
   few well-sampled formations in North America, the Hell Creek and Lance
   Formations. These assemblages disproportionally affect our
   interpretations of this important interval. Multiple investigations have
   quantified diversity patterns within these assemblages, but the
   potential effect of formation-level size-dependent taphonomic biases and
   their implications on extinction dynamics remains unexplored. Here, the
   relationship between taphonomy and body size of the Hell Creek Formation
   and Lance Formation dinosaurs and mammals are quantitatively analyzed.
   Small-bodied dinosaur taxa (<70 kg) are consistently less complete,
   unlikely to be articulated, and delayed in their description relative to
   their large-bodied counterparts. Family-level abundance (particularly
   skeletons) is strongly tied to body mass, and the relative abundance of
   juveniles of large-bodied taxa similarly is underrepresented. Mammals
   show similar but nonsignificant trends. The results are remarkably
   similar to those from the Campanian-aged Dinosaur Park Formation,
   suggesting a widespread strong taphonomic bias against the preservation
   of small taxa, which will result in their seemingly depauperate
   diversity within the assemblage. This taphonomically skewed view of
   diversity and abundance of small-bodied taxa amid our best late
   Maastrichtian samples has significant implications for understanding
   speciation and extinction dynamics (e.g., size-dependent extinction
   selectivity) across the K/Pg boundary.},

Title = {The taphonomic clock in fish otoliths},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {154-170},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Paleobiological and paleoecological interpretations rely on constraining
   the temporal resolution of the fossil record. The taphonomic clock, that
   is, a correlation between the alteration of skeletal material and its
   age, is an approach for quantifying time-averaging scales. We test the
   taphonomic clock hypothesis for marine demersal and pelagic fish
   otoliths from a 10-40 m depth transect on the Mediterranean
   siliciclastic Israeli shelf by radiocarbon dating and taphonomic
   scoring. Otolith ages span the last similar to 8000 yr, with
   considerable variation in median and range along the transect. Severely
   altered otoliths, contrary to pristine otoliths, are likely to be older
   than 1000 yr. For pelagic fish otoliths, at 30 m depth, taphonomic
   degradation correlates positively with postmortem age. In contrast, no
   correlation occurs for demersal fishes at 10 and 30 m depth, mostly
   because of the paucity of very young pristine (<150 yr) otoliths,
   possibly due to a drop in production over the last few centuries.
   Contrary to molluscan and brachiopod shells, young otoliths at these
   depths are little affected and do not show a broad spectrum of
   taphonomic damage, because those that derive from predation are excreted
   in calcium- and phosphate-rich feces forming an insoluble crystallic
   matrix that increases their preservation potential. At 40 m depth, all
   dated otoliths are very young but rather damaged because of locally
   chemically aggressive sediments, thus showing no correlation between

Abstract = {Genetic analyses have become increasingly powerful, more readily
   available to biologists, and have made ever more degraded DNA
   potentially useful. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are a
   relatively new ``class{''} of markers that show promise for use with
   degraded or archived samples. We sequenced a panel of 298 SNPs from
   Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tissue in three comparative
   studies to determine the effect of DNA quality at sampling, time in
   archive, and tissue type and preservation method on SNP genotyping
   success using logistic regression. The first study evaluated pristine
   DNA from live adults sampled at three hatcheries and archived up to 6
   years. The second study compared samples from carcasses with varying
   levels degradation (i.e., condition) and archived up to 15 years. The
   third study compared heart and fin samples preserved either in ethanol
   or on paper from carcasses with varying levels of degradation and
   processed within 6 months. Genotyping success for fresh tissue did not
   decline over the 6-year archive period at two of the three hatcheries,
   suggesting sample handling techniques may be more influential than time
   in archive. Genotyping success of archived carcass samples depended more
   on carcass condition than time in archive. Heart tissue genotyped
   consistently more often than fin samples from all but poor condition
   carcasses. Based on these results, we make tissuesampling
   recommendations for different intended purposes. We also provide simple,
   post-collection sample handling procedures that can increase genotyping
   success regardless of tissue or preservation method.},

Abstract = {The puma Puma concolor is the fourth largest wild felid and the most
   widespread native terrestrial mammal of the Americas. We synthesised
   published literature documenting the biotic interactions of pumas, in
   order to: 1) advance our understanding of the ecological roles pumas
   play in natural systems, and 2) support strategic decision-making about
   conservation investments, public education, and whole-ecosystem
   conservation management. We divided puma biotic interactions into five
   categories: 1) diet and prey regulation, 2) fear effects on prey
   (including trophic cascades), 3) effects via carrion production, 4)
   effects on other carnivores, and 5) ecosystem services. We reviewed 162
   studies that met our search criteria, which described 543 ecological
   interactions between pumas and 485 other species. Puma diet and prey
   regulation was the most common research topic. The geographic
   distribution of research was highly skewed towards the USA and Canada,
   and research in Tropical moist forests was underrepresented. We found a
   steep increase in the number of scientific publications exploring the
   biotic interactions associated with pumas over time, but publications
   that reported effect sizes or measured the strength of interactions did
   not increase as quickly. We noted numerous gaps in our knowledge of puma
   biotic interactions and found few well-controlled studies of prey fear
   effects, trophic cascades, or ecosystem services. We conclude that pumas
   are influential ecological actors in natural systems and important
   brokers of energy and nutrients throughout ecosystems in the Western
   Hemisphere, linking disparate species from many trophic levels.
   Ultimately, we found evidence for investing in and prioritising the
   protection and restoration of puma populations to conserve biodiversity
   in the Americas.},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels in the western US are under-studied compared to their
   eastern cousins, and no western species receive federal protection.
   Mussel distribution throughout Oregon's rivers and streams is poorly
   documented, and there are limited historical records to inform
   assessments of whether, and by how much, current populations may have
   declined. We launched a long-term project to characterize freshwater
   mussel populations throughout the Willamette River basin. Surveys were
   conducted in the mainstem Willamette River and a major tributary, the
   Middle Fork Willamette, during three years. A two-stage sampling process
   was used; transects were surveyed qualitatively, and then 0.25 m(2)
   quadrats were placed randomly in transects for quantitative surveys.
   Mussels visible at the substrate surface were counted using viewing
   scopes and snorkeling, and scuba diving in deeper water. To facilitate
   detection of juveniles (< 3.50 cm long) and calculation of the burial
   factor, some quadrats were double sampled; mussels visible at the
   surface were counted, then the substrate was excavated to a depth of 10
   to 20 cm, and all mussels (surface and buried) were counted and their
   shell length measured. Dense western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata)
   populations were found at all locations, but they differed greatly in
   length class structure, density, and presence of juveniles. Some sites
   also contained small numbers of floaters (Anodonta spp.), and notably, a
   single western ridgemussel (Gonidea angulata) was found in a highly
   urbanized reach. These surveys provide baseline data on the current
   status of several freshwater mussel populations in the Willamette River
   basin.},

Title = {Case Report of Traumatic Rib Fracture in Mammoth from Frenchman

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {A deformed rib from a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) was found
   among more than 100 mammoth bones excavated from an alfalfa field at the
   Tonnemaker Hill Farm in the Frenchman Hills north of Royal City, Grant
   County, Washington. The mammoth remains were deposited within
   -fine-grained Missoula flood sediments sometime after 16 ka. We
   performed a detailed examination of the rib, including computerized
   tomography imaging, and investigated the possible etiology of the
   deformity. The deformity consists of hypertrophic bone formation
   localized toward the distal (sternal) end of the rib. The circumference
   of the lesion is nearly twice that of the medial circumference of the
   rib diaphysis. This lesion is consistent with an incompletely healed
   fracture or a fracture nonunion with pseudarthrosis (false joint)
   formation. Gross examination and computerized tomography scan images of
   the proximal aspect of the rib, as well as cursory inspection of the
   other skeletal remains, have yet to reveal definitive evidence of other
   bony abnormalities. We surmise, therefore, that this fracture was the
   consequence of blunt force trauma in a healthy animal. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of a rib fracture with incomplete healing or
   false joint formation in a M. columbi individual in the Pacific
   Northwest. We suspect the incidence of rib fractures among M. columbi
   was greater than the Pacific Northwest literature suggests and encourage
   examination of existing collections for evidence of similar findings.
   The incidence and frequency of such injuries may provide insight into M.
   columbi behavior.},

Pages = {173-187},
Abstract = {Sculpins (family Cottidae) are a group of small nongame fishes, native
   to Idaho's colder streams, and have value for biodiversity and as
   indicators of water quality. We analyzed abiotic and biotic data,
   including habitat characteristics and presence of co-occurring trout and
   char (family Salmonidae) species, from 115 streams from the northern
   Idaho Pan-handle to identify the physical characteristics and biotic
   communities of the streams associated with sculpin presence (or absence)
   and population density. For comparison. and to determine if the results
   of the northern dataset could be attributed to the rest of the state, a
   second dataset from state-wide sampling was also analyzed, as was a
   subset of both datasets that had no observations of non-native brook
   trout and rainbow trout. Sculpins were more likely to be present and in
   higher densities in streams with abundant riffle microhabitats that were
   mostly free of sediment (identified as Rosgen channel types B, C, and F
   for northern Idaho and types B and C for the entire state). More
   sculpins were also found in streams lacking brook trout and rainbow
   trout. Knowledge of sculpin habitats and the impacts of non-native
   salmonids may be useful in interpreting water quality evaluations, as
   well as in improving native fisheries restoration projects and fisheries
   management for Idaho streams.},

Title = {Isolation by Distance and Proximity to Urban Areas Affect Genetic

Abstract = {The English sole (Parophrys vetulus, family Pleuronectidae) is an
   abundant ground fish used as a sentinel of marine pollution in the
   inland marine waters of Washington and Oregon. We used 15 microsatellite
   loci to evaluate patterns of genetic variability within and among 17
   collections of sole from coastal sites and within the southern Salish
   Sea. Over 470 alleles were identified in 15 loci, and high levels of
   genetic richness, as estimated by expected heterozygosity (HE) and
   allele richness (AR), were detected. Fish sampled from coastal areas at
   the northern end of our study area had the lowest values of genetic
   richness, in contrast to collections at the southern end. The level of
   differentiation among all collections was low: mean FST value was
   0.0006. Nineteen comparisons had statistically significant FST values
   (mean FST of 0.0029) and involved comparisons involving three locations
   associated with urban areas (Port Gardner {[}Everett, WA], Sinclair
   Inlet {[}Bremerton, WA], and Commencement Bay {[}Tacoma, WA]). A
   statistically significant, but weak, isolation-by-distance pattern was
   seen in the five coastal collections over 1,100 km of coastline. In the
   Salish Sea collections, the pattern of differentiation was patchy and
   marked by several distinctive collections in close proximity to urban
   areas. The pattern of differentiation in the Salish Sea parallels
   differences seen in ecotoxicological characteristics of the English sole
   that inhabit separate urban embayments differing in pollution
   characteristics. Future work can focus on evaluating the stability and
   meaningfulness of this subtle variability in a time of local and global
   environmental changes.},

Abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction occurred alongside a large swath of
   environmental changes that are often invoked as extinction mechanisms,
   even when a direct link is lacking. One way to elucidate the cause(s) of
   a mass extinction is to investigate extinction selectivity, as it can
   reveal critical information on organismic traits as key determinants of
   extinction and survival. Here we show that machine learning algorithms,
   specifically gradient boosted decision trees, can be used to identify
   determinants of extinction as well as to predict extinction risk. To
   understand which factors led to the end-Permian mass extinction during
   an extreme global warming event, we quantified the ecological
   selectivity of marine extinctions in the well-studied South China
   region. We find that extinction selectivity varies between different
   groups of organisms and that a synergy of multiple environmental
   stressors best explains the overall end-Permian extinction selectivity
   pattern. Extinction risk was greater for genera that had a low species
   richness, narrow bathymetric ranges limited to deep-water habitats, a
   stationary mode of life, a siliceous skeleton, or, less critically,
   calcitic skeletons. These selective losses directly link the extinctions
   to the environmental effects of rapid injections of carbon dioxide into
   the ocean-atmosphere system, specifically the combined effects of
   expanded oxygen minimum zones, rapid warming, and potentially ocean
   acidification.},

Abstract = {We examine temporal and spatial variation in morphology of the ammonoid
   cephalopod Discoscaphites iris using a large dataset from multiple
   localities in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of the U.S. Gulf and
   Atlantic Coastal Plains, spanning a distance of 2000 km along the
   paleoshoreline. Our results suggest that the fossil record of D. iris is
   consistent with no within-species net accumulation of phyletic
   evolutionary change across morphological traits or the lifetime of this
   species. Correlations between some traits and paleoenvironmental
   conditions as well as changes in the coefficient of variation may
   support limited population-scale ecophenotypic plasticity; however,
   where stratigraphic data are available, no directional changes in
   morphology occur before the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. This
   is consistent with models of ``dynamic{''} evolutionary stasis. Combined
   with knowledge of life-history traits and paleoecology of scaphitid
   ammonoids, specifically a short planktonic phase after hatching followed
   by transition to a nektobenthic adult stage, these data suggest that
   scaphitids had significant potential for rapid morphological change in
   conjunction with limited dispersal capacity. It is therefore likely that
   evolutionary mode in the Scaphitidae (and potentially across the broader
   ammonoid clade) follows a model of cladogenesis wherein a dynamic
   morphological stasis is periodically interrupted by more substantial
   evolutionary change at speciation events. Finally, the lack of temporal
   changes in our data suggest that global environmental changes had a
   limited effect on the morphology of ammonoid faunas during the latest
   Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {Woodpeckers require trees and snags with decayed wood in order to
   excavate nest and roost cavities, and interior wood hardness is
   considered an important factor determining where a woodpecker can create
   a cavity. In most ecosystems, saprophytic fungi are responsible for the
   decay and softening of wood, and are thought to be important in
   providing soft wood for woodpecker cavity excavation. We conducted a
   study of cellulose-degrading enzymes in the wood surrounding woodpecker
   nest cavities. We measured wood hardness, percent wood density loss
   (PWDL), and activity of cellobiase (an extracellular fungal cellulase
   that degrades cellulose) within wood surrounding the nest cavities of
   the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), black-backed woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus),
   and hairy woodpecker (D. villosus) in Oregon and Washington. We found
   that mean wood hardness was significantly lower, and cellobiase and PWDL
   were significantly higher, at nest cavities than controls for each
   woodpecker species. Wood hardness was higher and cellobiase lower at
   nests of black-backed woodpecker than northern flicker, but did not
   differ among the other woodpecker species. Our results suggest that
   increased amounts of cellobiase result in softer wood due to the
   increased decay caused by higher fungal enzyme activity and that
   measuring cellobiase can be used to estimate wood decay without directly
   measuring wood hardness. All four woodpecker species selected nest
   substrates with softer wood and higher fungal enzyme activity than
   controls. This supports findings from previous studies of the importance
   of saprophytic fungi for woodpecker cavity excavation.},

Abstract = {Pheromone parsimony is widespread within the longhorned beetles
   (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which share a number of highly conserved
   volatile pheromone motifs. This parsimony reflects their life histories,
   ecology, and distribution. We conducted field bioassays testing
   attraction of cerambycids to 12 volatile pheromone lures at sites in
   both northern and southern Idaho over a period of three years. Our
   overall goals were to investigate the role of volatile pheromones in the
   geographic distribution of cerambycid species, interactions within
   cerambycid communities in reproductive isolation, and to identify
   attractive pheromones that can be used to develop lures for monitoring
   cerambycids. This study focused on the genus Tragosoma (subfamily:
   Prioninae). Trapping results suggested a regional split between
   populations of T. harrisii LeConte and T. soror Laplante within Idaho,
   with the more abundant of the two species at our sites being T. harrisii
   in northern Idaho and T. soror in southern Idaho. We found the flight
   periods of T. harrisii and T. soror overlapped, suggesting that flight
   period is not being used by these two species as a mechanism to prevent
   inter-specific cross-attraction among their populations in Idaho. Our
   results increase understanding of the ecology of Tragosoma species, and
   the role of pheromones and flight period phenology in maintaining
   reproductive isolation, and will aid in development of lures for
   monitoring cerambycids.},

Abstract = {A length-frequency sample (n = 295) from a fossil population of the
   Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni Hall, 1838, assembled and
   analyzed by J. L. Cisne in 1973 is here reexamined using methods of
   length-frequency analysis commonly used in fishery science and marine
   biology. Theoretical considerations and the empirical data at hand
   suggest that the growth of T. eatoni was not ``linear,{''} but
   asymptotic, as is the growth of most Recent marine invertebrates. The
   parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (L-infinity = 41 mm, K
   = 0.29 yr(-1)) suggest that T. eatoni, which apparently lived in a
   challenging environment, grew somewhat more slowly than the extant
   marine isopod Ceratoserolis trilobitoides (Eights, 1833), used here as
   Recent analogue to T. eatoni. This trilobite probably lived up to 10
   years, rather than the suggested 4 years, and its mortality rate was
   15\%-20\% per year rather than 30\%-40\% per year. These represent the
   first estimates of trilobite absolute growth characteristics using
   methods known to accurately model growth in extant water-breathing
   ectotherms. These provide a baseline for trilobite growth that can be
   used to make inferences about growth in other species. The approach used
   here may also be applied to other trilobites for which suitable
   length-frequency data exist.},

Title = {Understanding the appearance of heterospory and derived plant
   reproductive strategies in the Devonian},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {496-512},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution of different spore size classes, or heterospory, is a
   fundamental reproductive innovation in land plants. The appearance of
   heterospory is particularly notable during the Devonian, when most known
   origins of the trait occur. Here we provide a perspective on the
   evolution of heterospory during this time interval, particularly from
   the late Early Devonian through the Middle Devonian (Emsian to Givetian
   Stages; 408-383 Ma), which shows an unusually high concentration of
   heterospory origins. We use theoretical considerations and compilations
   of fossil and extant spore sizes to suggest that the basic features of
   most heterosporous lineages, large spores and gametophytes that mature
   within the spore wall, are difficult to evolve in combination, because
   large spores disperse poorly but small spores cannot support a
   functional gametophyte developing within their walls; evolving spores
   between 100 and 200 microns in diameter appears to represent a
   particularly important barrier for the evolution of heterospory. We then
   discuss why this barrier may have been lower in the Devonian, noting
   that the appearance and spread of heterospory is coincident with the
   emergence of peat-accumulating wetland habitats. We suggest that more
   widespread wetland habitats would have generally lowered barriers to the
   evolution of heterospory by reducing dispersal limitation in larger
   spores. Ultimately, we suggest that the initial evolution of heterospory
   may be explained by major changes in sedimentology, thought to have been
   driven by plant evolution itself, that increased the diversity of
   terrestrial depositional environments and led to a greater number of
   habitats where large spores could be successful.},

Title = {A test of Bergmann's rule in the Early Triassic: latitude, body size,

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The ecogeographic rule known as Bergmann's rule suggests that there is a
   positive relationship between body size and latitude when comparing
   closely related taxa. The underlying mechanism or mechanisms to explain
   this pattern vary as widely as the taxa that seem to follow it, which
   has led to skepticism over whether Bergmann's rule should be considered
   a rule at all. Despite this, Bergmann's rule is widespread among modern
   birds, mammals, beetles, and some amphibians, but far fewer extinct taxa
   have been subjected to tests of Bergmann's rule. To examine whether
   Bergmann's rule is detected in extinct taxa, we compared body-size
   proxies in Lystrosaurus recovered from Early Triassic-aged strata in
   Antarctica, South Africa, India, and China. Our results reveal that
   average body size is largest at mid-northern paleolatitudes (similar to
   45 degrees N) instead of the highest southern paleolatitudes (similar to
   70 degrees S). Additionally, maximum body size is consistent across the
   Northern and Southern Hemispheres, indicating that Bergmann's rule did
   not apply for Lystrosaurus during the Early Triassic. To test potential
   sample size biases in our results, we used rarefaction and subsampling
   to show that only the Karoo Basin is well sampled and that large
   individuals are exceedingly rare, except in the Turpan-Junggar Basin of
   Xinjiang, China. Taken together, our results suggest that Lystrosaurus
   had the potential to reach large body sizes in each of the latitudinally
   widespread geologic basins studied here, but that local conditions may
   have allowed individuals at mid-northern paleolatitudes a greater chance
   of reaching a large size compared with southern congeners that suffered
   increased mortality when young or at a small size.},

Title = {Latitudinal influences on bryozoan calcification through the Paleozoic},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-283},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Bryozoans are active non-phototrophic biomineralizers that precipitate
   their calcareous skeletons in seawater. Carbonate saturation states
   varied temporally and spatially in Paleozoic oceans, and we used the
   Bryozoan Skeletal Index (BSI) to investigate whether bryozoan
   calcification was controlled by seawater chemistry in Paleozoic
   trepostome and cryptostome bryozoans. Our results show that cryptostome
   bryozoan genera were influenced by ocean chemistry throughout the
   Paleozoic and precipitated the most calcite at lower latitudes, where
   carbonate saturation states are generally higher, and less in
   midlatitudes, where carbonate will be relatively undersaturated.
   Trepostome bryozoan genera show a similar but weaker trend for the
   Ordovician to Devonian, suggesting that, like the cryptostomes, they
   were unable to metabolically overcome falling saturation states and
   simply precipitated less robust skeletons at higher latitudes.
   Carboniferous to Triassic trepostomes differ, however, and show a trend
   toward increased calcification at higher latitudes, indicating an
   ability to overcome unfavorable carbonate saturation states. Analysis of
   Permian trepostomes at the species level indicates this is most
   pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere, where calcification is matched by
   increased feeding capacity. It is proposed that this increased feeding
   capacity allowed trepostomes to metabolically overcome unfavorable
   carbonate saturation states. The differing responses of trepostome and
   cryptostome bryozoans to carbonate saturation states suggest that
   bryozoans should not be considered as a single group in marine
   extinctions linked to ocean chemistry changes. Likewise, it would
   suggest that modern stenolaemate and gymnolaemate bryozoans should be
   treated separately when considering their response to modern ocean
   chemistry changes.},

Title = {Dispersals from the West Tethys as the source of the Indo-West Pacific
   diversity hotspot in comatulid crinoids},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-52},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Conspicuous centers of biodiversity are frequently attributed to local
   conditions that promote speciation or resistance to extinction, but
   recent diversification studies indicate this mode of explanation might
   not be very general, so it may be fruitful to revisit the role of
   dispersal in concentrating biodiversity. Here we consider the processes
   underlying the marine diversity hotspot in the Indo-West Pacific among
   comatulid crinoids, suspension-feeding echinoderms conspicuous on modern
   tropical reefs. We used ancestral-range reconstruction on a phylogeny of
   extant crinoids, assembled a new occurrence database of fossil
   comatulids and interrogated it with probabilistic preservational models,
   and developed a morphological character matrix to estimate the
   relationships among living and fossil comatulids. Ancestral-range
   reconstruction on a phylogeny of extant comatulids recovers an origin
   outside the Indo-Pacific and elevated dispersal into it. A new
   occurrence database records the comatulid clade spreading out gradually
   from origin in the Early Jurassic of the West Tethys. Comatulids do not
   appear in their modern hotspot until the Oligocene, and taphonomic
   analyses show these results cannot be explained solely as a result of
   inadequate sampling in Asia and Oceania. Finally, phylogenetic analyses
   demonstrate that deeply nested crown-group comatulids had originated
   before the clade became well established in the East Tethys, implying
   many independent dispersals into the modern hotspot. These consilient
   results suggest a biodiversity hotspot that owes its existence to
   dispersals out of the ancient West Tethys rather than to elevated in
   situ diversification.},

Abstract = {The number of individuals of species varies, but estimating abundance,

   multispecies occupancy and detection are modeled as a means to estimate
   relative species abundance and relative population densities. The
   modeling framework is suited for temporal samples of fossil communities
   with repeated sampling including multiple species with similar
   preservation potential. We demonstrate our modeling framework using a
   fossil community of benthic organisms to estimate relative species
   abundance dynamics and changing relative population densities of focal
   species in nine (geological) time intervals over 2.3 Myr. We also
   explore potential explanatory factors (paleoenvironmental proxies) and
   temporal autocorrelation that could provide extra information on
   unsampled time intervals. The modeling framework is applicable across a
   wide range of questions on species-level dynamics in paleoecological
   community settings.},

Abstract = {Trace fossils record foraging behaviors, the search for resources in
   patchy environments, of animals in the rock record. Quantification of
   the strength, density, and nature of foraging behaviors enables the
   investigation of how these may have changed through time. Here, we
   present a novel approach to explore such patterns using spatial point
   process analyses to quantify the scale and strength of ichnofossil
   spatial distributions on horizontal bedding planes. To demonstrate the
   utility of this approach, we use two samples from the terminal Ediacaran
   Shibantan Member in South China (between 551 and 543 Ma) and the early
   Cambrian Nagaur Sandstone in northwestern India (between 539 and 509
   Ma). We find that ichnotaxa on both surfaces exhibited significant
   nonhomogeneous lateral patterns, with distinct levels of heterogeneity
   exhibited by different types of trace fossils. In the Shibantan, two
   ichnotaxa show evidence for mutual positive aggregation over a shared
   resource, suggesting the ability to focus on optimal resource areas.
   Trace fossils from the Nagaur Sandstone exhibit more sophisticated
   foraging behavior, with greater niche differentiation. Critically, mark
   correlation functions highlight significant spatial autocorrelation of
   trace fossil orientations, demonstrating the greater ability of these
   Cambrian tracemakers to focus on optimal patches. Despite potential

Title = {Bivalve body-size distribution through the Late Triassic mass extinction
   event},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {420-445},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The synergic relationship between physiology, ecology, and evolutionary
   process makes the body-size distribution (BSD) an essential component of
   the community ecology. Body size is highly susceptible to environmental
   change, and extreme upheavals, such as during a mass extinction event,
   could exert drastic changes on a taxon's BSD. It has been hypothesized
   that the Late Triassic mass extinction event (LTE) was triggered by
   intense global warming, linked to massive volcanic activity associated
   with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. We test the effects of the
   LTE on the BSD of fossil bivalve assemblages from three study sites
   spanning the Triassic/Jurassic boundary in the United Kingdom. Our
   results show that the effects of the LTE were rapid and synchronous
   across sites, and the BSDs of the bivalves record drastic changes
   associated with species turnover. No phylogenetic signal of size
   selectivity was recorded, although semi-infaunal species were apparently
   most susceptible to change. Each size class had the same likelihood of
   extinction during the LTE, which resulted in a platykurtic BSD with
   negative skew. The immediate postextinction assemblage exhibits a
   leptokurtic BSD, although with negative skew, wherein surviving species
   and newly appearing small-sized colonizers exhibit body sizes near the
   modal size. Recovery was relatively rapid (similar to 100 kyr), and
   larger bivalves began to appear during the pre-Planorbis Zone, despite
   recurrent dysoxic /anoxic conditions. This study demonstrates how a mass
   extinction acts across the size spectrum in bivalves and shows how BSDs
   emerge from evolutionary and ecological processes.},

Abstract = {We know that the fossil record is incomplete. But how incomplete? Here
   we very coarsely estimate the completeness of the mammalian record in
   the Miocene, assuming that the duration of a mammalian species is about
   1 Myr and the species diversity has stayed constant and is structurally
   comparable to the taxonomic diversity today. The overall completeness
   under these assumptions appears to be around 4\%, but there are large
   differences across taxonomic groups. We find that the fossil record of
   proboscideans and perissodactyls as we know it for the Miocene must be
   close to complete, while we might know less than 15\% of the species of
   artiodactyl or carnivore fossil species and only about 1\% of primate
   species of the Miocene. The record of small mammals appears much less
   complete than that of large mammals.},

Title = {Dietary and body-mass reconstruction of the Miocene neotropical bat
   Notonycteris magdalenensis (Phyllostomidae) from La Venta, Colombia},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {137-153},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With 14 species recorded, the Miocene La Venta bat fauna is the most
   diverse bat paleocommunity in South America. It includes the oldest
   plant-visiting bat in the New World and some of the earliest
   representatives of the extant families Phyllostomidae, Thyropteridae,
   and Noctilionidae. La Venta's Notonycteris magdalenensis is an extinct
   member of the subfamily Phyllostominae, a group of modern Neotropical
   animalivorous bats, and is commonly included in studies of the evolution
   of Neotropical bats, but aspects of its biology remain unclear. In this
   study, we used multivariate dental topography analysis (DTA) to
   reconstruct the diet of N. magdalenensis by quantitatively comparing
   measures of molar complexity with those of 25 modern noctilionoid
   species representing all major dietary habits in bats. We found clear
   differences in molar complexity between dietary guilds, indicating that
   DTA is potentially an informative tool to study bat ecomorphology. Our
   results suggest N. magdalenensis was probably an omnivore or
   insectivore, rather than a carnivore like its modern relatives
   Chrotopterus auritus and Vampyrum spectrum. Also, we reconstructed the
   body mass of N. magdalenensis to be similar to 95 g, larger than most
   insectivorous bats, but smaller than the largest carnivorous bat (V.
   spectrum). Our results confirm that N. magdalenensis was not a
   specialized carnivore. It remains to be demonstrated that the
   specialized carnivory ecological niche was occupied by the same lineage
   of phyllostomines from at least the middle Miocene. Combining our diet
   and body-mass reconstructions, we suggest that N. magdalenensis exhibits
   morphological pre-adaptations crucial for the evolution of specialized
   carnivory.},

Title = {The Phanerozoic aftermath of the Cambrian information revolution:
   sensory and cognitive complexity in marine faunas},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {397-419},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Cambrian information revolution describes how biotically driven
   increases in signals, sensory abilities, behavioral interactions, and
   landscape spatial complexity drove a rapid increase in animal cognition
   concurrent with the Cambrian radiation. Here, we compare cognitive
   complexity in Cambrian and post-Cambrian marine ecosystems, documenting
   changes in animal cognition after the initial Cambrian increase. In a
   comparison of Cambrian and post-Cambrian Lagerstatten, we find no strong
   trend in the proportion of genera possessing two types of macroscopic
   sense organs (eyes and chemoreceptive organs such as antennae, feelers,
   or nostrils). There is also no trend in general nervous system
   complexity. These results suggest that sophisticated information
   processing was already common in early Phanerozoic ecosystems,
   comparable with behavioral evidence from the trace fossil record. Most
   taxa capable of complex information processing in Cambrian ecosystems
   were panarthropods, whereas mollusks and chordates made up larger
   proportions afterward. In both the Cambrian and the present day,
   ecological occupation of diverse habitat tiers and feeding modes is
   possible with even simple nervous systems, but ecological lifestyles
   requiring rapid, regular movement are almost exclusively associated
   within brain-bearing taxa, suggesting a connection with fast
   information-processing abilities and bodily responses. The overall rise
   in cognitive sophistication in the Cambrian was likely a unique event in
   the history of life, although some lineages subsequently developed more
   elaborate sensory systems and/or larger brains.},

Title = {Ontogeny in the steinmanellines (Bivalvia: Trigoniida): an intra- and

   Neuquen Basin as a case study},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Despite the paleontological relevance and paleobiological interest of
   trigoniid bivalves, our knowledge of their ontogeny-an aspect of crucial
   evolutionary importance-remains limited. Here, we assess the intra- and
   interspecific ontogenetic variations exhibited by the genus Steinmanella
   Crickmay (Myophorellidae: Steinmanellinae) during the early
   Valanginian-late Hauterivian of Argentina and explore some of their
   implications. The (ontogenetic) allometric trajectories of seven species
   recognized for this interval were estimated from longitudinal data using
   3D geometric morphometrics, segmented regressions, and model selection
   tools, and then compared using trajectory analysis and allometric
   spaces. Our results show that within-species shell shape variation
   describes biphasic ontogenetic trajectories, decoupled from ontogenetic
   changes shown by sculpture, with a gradual decay in magnitude as
   ontogeny progresses. The modes of change characterizing each phase
   (crescentic growth and anteroposterior elongation, respectively) are
   conserved across species, thus representing a feature of Steinmanella
   ontogeny; its evolutionary origin is inferred to be a consequence of the
   rate modification and allometric repatterning of the ancestral ontogeny.
   Among species, trajectories are more variable during early ontogenetic
   stages, becoming increasingly conservative at later stages.
   Trajectories' general orientation allows recognition of two
   stratigraphically consecutive groups of species, hinting at a
   potentially higher genus-level diversity in the studied interval. In
   terms of functional morphology, juveniles had a morphology more suited
   for active burrowing than adults, whose features are associated with a
   sedentary lifestyle. The characteristic disparity of trigoniids could be
   related to the existence of an ontogenetic period of greater shell
   malleability betrayed by the presence of crescentic shape change.},

Title = {The wild boar Sus scrofa in northern Eurasia: a review of range
   expansion history, current distribution, factors affecting the northern

Abstract = {The wild boar Sus scrofa is one of the most widely distributed large
   mammal species in the world, existing on all continents except
   Antarctica. In the late 20th Century, its geographical range expanded
   naturally and through intentional releases. Despite the environmental,
   social, and economic importance of the wild boar, its current
   distribution in northern Eurasia remains uncertain, and the factors that
   limit and promote expansion in northern ecosystems are unknown. We aimed
   to summarise the history of wild boar range expansion and current
   distribution in the countries of northern Eurasia. We also assess the
   relative importance of climate (both harshness and warming), habitat
   (both current diversity and possible change), predators, releases,
   supplementary feeding, and hunting in limiting or promoting the
   distribution and range expansion of the species. We review hunting
   management and other regulations that may affect further northward
   expansion. Information on wild boar expansion and distribution was
   collated from available scientific publications, official statistics,
   volunteer reports, and expert knowledge. The effects of natural factors
   (climate harshness, habitat variation, predators) and anthropogenic
   factors (climate warming, habitat change, releases, supplementary
   feeding, hunting) on wild boar distribution were assessed using
   estimates (scores) provided by experts from the target regions. The wild
   boar in Europe is distributed up to 64 degrees N. In Asia, the northern
   distributional limit is up to 61 degrees N. The species' northern
   distributional limit is further north in the west than in the east of
   the geographic range. Experts regarded climate harshness, habitat, and
   hunting as the most important factors limiting wild boar distribution.
   Important factors that promote the expansion of the wild boar's range
   include climate warming and supplementary feeding. Our analysis of the
   official approaches to wild boar management suggests that the northern
   Eurasian countries do not have a united approach to the challenge of
   wild boar expansion. Collaboration between managers, policymakers, and
   researchers is needed for monitoring the wild boar distribution and
   range expansion throughout northern Eurasia. This data collection is
   especially important now, as parts of Europe and Asia are facing the
   challenge of African swine fever as well as other human-wildlife
   conflicts related to increasing wild boar populations.},

Title = {Variation in red fox Vulpes vulpes diet in five continents},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},

Pages = {328-342},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Understanding variation in the diet of widely distributed species can
   help us to predict how they respond to future environmental and
   anthropogenic changes.
   2. We studied the diet of the red fox Vulpes vulpes, one of the world's
   most widely distributed carnivores. We compiled dietary data from 217
   studies at 276 locations in five continents to assess how fox diet
   composition varied according to geographic location, climate,
   anthropogenic impact, and sampling method.
   3. The diet of foxes showed substantial variation throughout the
   species' range, but with a general trend for small mammals and
   invertebrates to be the most frequently occurring dietary items.
   4. The incidence of small and large mammals and birds in fox diets was
   greater away from the equator. The incidence of invertebrates and fruits
   increased with mean elevation, while the occurrence of medium-sized
   mammals and birds decreased.
   5. Fox diet differed according to climatic and anthropogenic variables.
   Diet richness decreased with increasing temperature and precipitation.
   The incidence of small and large mammals decreased with increasing
   temperature. The incidence of birds and invertebrates decreased with
   increasing mean annual precipitation. Higher Human Footprint Index was
   associated with a lower incidence of large mammals and a higher
   incidence of birds and fruit in fox diet.
   6. Sampling method influenced fox diet estimation: estimated percentage
   of small and medium-sized mammals and fruit was lower in studies based
   on stomach contents, while large mammals were more likely to be recorded
   in studies of stomach contents than in studies of scats.
   7. Our study confirms the flexible and opportunistic dietary behaviour
   of foxes at the global scale. This behavioural trait allows them to
   thrive in a range of climatic conditions, and in areas with different
   degrees of human-induced habitat change. This knowledge can help us to
   place the results of local-scale fox diet studies into a broader context
   and to predict how foxes will respond to future environmental changes.},

Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Bears, Ursidae, are considered omnivores, except for giant pandas
   Ailuropoda melanoleuca and polar bears Ursus maritimus. However,
   omnivory includes a wide range of dietary variation and trophic
   positions, making bear dietary ecology unclear. We inferred bear trophic
   positions from delta N-15 (parts per thousand) values and examined their
   correlation with diets reported in the literature, including frequency
   of human-bear conflicts (livestock predation and crop damage incidents).
   Overall, N-15 signatures were consistent with diet estimates. Bear
   species with higher N-15 signatures differed more from each other,
   including cases of large regional intraspecific variance, than bear
   species with lower N-15 signatures. Bear trophic position and frequency
   of reports of human-bear conflicts were uncorrelated, suggesting that
   livestock predation by bears is an opportunistic behaviour rather than a
   response to food availability dynamics.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {313-328},

Abstract = {The rise of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and extinction of nearly
   all jawless vertebrates (agnathans) is one of the most important
   transitions in vertebrate evolution, but the causes are poorly
   understood. Competition between agnathans and gnathostomes during the
   Devonian period is the most commonly hypothesized cause; however, no
   formal attempts to test this hypothesis have been made. Generally,
   competition between species increases as morphological similarity
   increases; therefore, this study uses the largest to date morphometric
   comparison of Silurian and Devonian agnathan and gnathostome groups to
   determine which groups were most and least likely to have competed. Five
   agnathan groups (Anaspida, Heterostraci, Osteostraci, Thelodonti, and
   Furcacaudiformes) were compared with five gnathostome groups
   (Acanthodii, Actinopterygii, Chondrichthyes, Placodermi, and
   Sarcopterygii) including taxa from most major orders. Morphological
   dissimilarity was measured by Gower's dissimilarity coefficient, and the
   differences between agnathan and gnathostome body forms across early
   vertebrate morphospace were compared using principal coordinate
   analysis. Our results indicate competition between some agnathans and
   gnathostomes is plausible, but not all agnathan groups were similar to
   gnathostomes. Furcacaudiformes (fork-tailed thelodonts) are distinct
   from other early vertebrate groups and the least likely to have competed
   with other groups.},

Title = {Scale dependence of drilling predation in the Holocene of the northern
   Adriatic Sea across benthic habitats and nutrient regimes},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {462-479},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Predation has strongly shaped past and modern marine ecosystems, but the
   scale dependency of patterns in drilling predation, the most widely used
   proxy for predator-prey interactions in the fossil record, is a matter
   of debate. To assess the effects of spatial and taxonomic scale on
   temporal trends in the drilling frequencies (DFs), we analyzed Holocene
   molluscan assemblages of different benthic habitats and nutrient regimes
   from the northern Adriatic shelf in a sequence-stratigraphic context.
   Although it has been postulated that low predation pressures facilitated
   the development of high-biomass epifaunal communities in the eastern,
   relatively oligotrophic portion of the northern Adriatic shelf, DFs
   reaching up to 30\%-40\% in the studied assemblage show that drilling
   predation levels are comparable to those typical of late Cenozoic
   ecosystems. DFs tend to increase from the transgressive systems tract
   (TST) into the highstand systems tract (HST) at the local scale,
   reflecting an increase in water depth by 20-40 m and a shift from
   infralittoral to circalittoral habitats over the past 10,000 years. As
   transgressive deposits are thicker at shallower locations and highstand
   deposits are thicker at deeper locations, a regional increase in DFs
   from TST to HST is evident only when these differences are accounted
   for. The increase in DF toward the HST can be recognized at the level of
   total assemblages, classes, and few abundant and widespread families,
   but it disappears at the level of genera and species because of their
   specific environmental requirements, leading to uneven or patchy
   distribution in space and time.},

Abstract = {The fossil record is notoriously imperfect and biased in representation,
   hindering our ability to place fossil specimens into an evolutionary
   context. For groups with fossil records mostly consisting of
   disarticulated parts (e.g., vertebrates, echinoderms, plants), the
   limited morphological information preserved sparks concerns about
   whether fossils retain reliable evidence of phylogenetic relationships
   and lends uncertainty to analyses of diversification, paleobiogeography,
   and biostratigraphy in Earth's history. To address whether a fragmentary
   past can be trusted, we need to assess whether incompleteness affects
   the quality of phylogenetic information contained in fossil data.
   Herein, we characterize skeletal incompleteness bias in a large dataset
   (6585 specimens; 14,417 skeletal elements) of fossil squamates (lizards,
   snakes, amphisbaenians, and mosasaurs). We show that jaws + palatal
   bones, vertebrae, and ribs appear more frequently in the fossil record
   than other parts of the skeleton. This incomplete anatomical
   representation in the fossil record is biased against regions of the
   skeleton that contain the majority of morphological phylogenetic
   characters used to assess squamate evolutionary relationships. Despite
   this bias, parsimony- and model-based comparative analyses indicate that
   the most frequently occurring parts of the skeleton in the fossil record
   retain similar levels of phylogenetic signal as parts of the skeleton
   that are rarer. These results demonstrate that the biased squamate
   fossil record contains reliable phylogenetic information and support our
   ability to place incomplete fossils in the tree of life.},

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},

Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {186-209},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The concept of evolvability-the capacity of a population to produce and
   maintain evolutionarily relevant variation-has become increasingly
   prominent in evolutionary biology. Paleontology has a long history of
   investigating questions of evolvability, but paleontological thinking
   has tended to neglect recent discussions, because many tools used in the
   current evolvability literature are challenging to apply to the fossil
   record. The fundamental difficulty is how to disentangle whether the
   causes of evolutionary patterns arise from variational properties of
   traits or lineages rather than being due to selection and ecological
   success. Despite these obstacles, the fossil record offers unique and
   growing sources of data that capture evolutionary patterns of sustained
   duration and significance otherwise inaccessible to evolutionary
   biologists. Additionally, there exist a variety of strategic
   possibilities for combining prominent neontological approaches to
   evolvability with those from paleontology. We illustrate three of these
   possibilities with quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental
   biology, and phylogenetic models of macroevolution. In conclusion, we
   provide a methodological schema that focuses on the conceptualization,
   measurement, and testing of hypotheses to motivate and provide guidance
   for future empirical and theoretical studies of evolvability in the
   fossil record.},

   and developmental evidence contradicts their hypothesis, and we test
   their handwing gliding model, finding it aerodynamically implausible. We
   conclude that the traditional view of bat evolution (that flight and

Title = {Distribution, Relative Abundance, and Length of Sculpins in the Elwha

Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Dam removal often shows positive effects for many fish species,
   especially migratory species. In contrast, information regarding the
   effects on less migratory species is lacking. The Elwha River,
   Washington had two hydroelectric dams removed from 2011 to 2014, which
   resulted in the loss of two reservoirs. Because of glacial history, the
   Elwha River system has a depauperate freshwater fish fauna, including
   just two sculpin species (coastrange sculpin {[}Cottus aleuticus] and
   prickly sculpin {[}C. asper]). Both species exhibit a similar migratory
   life history strategy, which includes a planktonic larval stage that
   drifts downstream to a nursery area (e.g., lake, large river, or
   estuary), followed by an upriver movement pattern. Due to these
   characteristics, Elwha River dam removal and loss of the reservoirs may
   have had important effects on these two sculpin species. We sampled
   sculpins with longitudinal electrofishing surveys in 2018 and 2019 to
   evaluate their current distribution, relative abundance, and body size.
   These metrics were generally similar to other river systems in the
   Pacific Northwest, with fewer and larger migratory sculpins upstream.
   Additionally, we compared our findings to pre-dam surveys. After dam
   removal, sculpins in upstream reaches were less abundant and had a
   smaller range of sizes. This suggests the population characteristics of
   sculpins in the Elwha River has changed, but it is unclear how indirect
   effects, such as anadromous salmonid (Salmonidae) increases, may
   influence their overall abundance. This study also provides a baseline
   to monitor sculpin population changes in the future.},

Title = {Riverscape View of Fish Assemblages, Habitat, and Stream Temperatures
   During Summer Low Flows in the Chehalis River, Washington},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-172},
Abstract = {The Chehalis River is a coastal river in southwestern Washington State
   where decision makers are considering options to reduce flood damage and
   improve freshwater habitats. This study focused on the mainstem river
   above and below the location of a potential dam, one of the
   flood-reduction options being considered. Our objectives were to
   describe spatial patterns of fish species, physical habitat, and stream
   temperature, and identify associations between fish species and the
   physical environment at two spatial scales. Data were collected in
   spatially continuous reaches following a ``riverscape{''} approach, and
   patterns in the data were described using three different ordination
   techniques. Most of the variation in fish species composition occurred
   at the sub-basin scale (entire study area), with additional but minor
   patterns at the reach (1-km) scale. At the sub-basin scale, fish species
   composition was organized in an upstream (salmonid) to downstream
   (cyprinid) replacement pattern and was best explained by the combination
   of river location, habitat, and temperature. At the reach scale,
   physical habitat and stream temperature differentiated juvenile trout
   versus coho salmon in the salmonid-dominated upstream extent of our
   study area, and dace versus shiner in the cyprinid-dominated downstream
   extent. We conclude that salmon and steelhead are particularly
   vulnerable to habitat loss upstream of the proposed dam because they
   disproportionately use this area as summer rearing habitat. Protection
   and restoration of headwater areas, such as our study area in the
   Chehalis River, will be critical to support salmonid populations into
   the future.},

Abstract = {The rapid and accurate taxonomic identification of fossils is of great
   significance in paleontology, biostratigraphy, and other fields.
   However, taxonomic identification is often labor-intensive and tedious,
   and the requisition of extensive prior knowledge about a taxonomic group
   also requires long-term training. Moreover, identification results are
   often inconsistent across researchers and communities. Accordingly, in
   this study, we used deep learning to support taxonomic identification.
   We used web crawlers to collect the Fossil Image Dataset (FID) via the
   Internet, obtaining 415,339 images belonging to 50 fossil clades. Then
   we trained three powerful convolutional neural networks on a
   high-performance workstation. The Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture
   achieved an average accuracy of 0.90 in the test dataset when transfer
   learning was applied. The clades of microfossils and vertebrate fossils
   exhibited the highest identification accuracies of 0.95 and 0.90,
   respectively. In contrast, clades of sponges, bryozoans, and trace
   fossils with various morphologies or with few samples in the dataset
   exhibited a performance below 0.80. Visual explanation methods further
   highlighted the discrepancies among different fossil clades and
   suggested similarities between the identifications made by machine
   classifiers and taxonomists. Collecting large paleontological datasets
   from various sources, such as the literature, digitization of dark data,
   citizen-science data, and public data from the Internet may further
   enhance deep learning methods and their adoption. Such developments will
   also possibly lead to image-based systematic taxonomy to be replaced by
   machine-aided classification in the future. Pioneering studies can
   include microfossils and some invertebrate fossils. To contribute to
   this development, we deployed our model on a server for public access at
   www.ai-fossil.com.},

Title = {Influence of phylogeny on the estimation of diet from dental morphology
   in the Carnivora},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Because teeth are the most easily preserved part of the vertebrate
   skeleton and are particularly morphologically variable in mammals,
   studies of fossil mammals rely heavily on dental morphology. Dental
   morphology is used both for systematics and phylogeny as well as for
   inferences about paleoecology, diet in particular. We analyze the
   influence of evolutionary history on our ability to reconstruct diet
   from dental morphology in the mammalian order Carnivora, and we find
   that much of our understanding of diet in carnivorans is dependent on
   the phylogenetic constraints on diet in this clade. Substantial error in
   estimating diet from dental morphology is present regardless of the
   morphological data used to make the inference, although more extensive
   morphological datasets are more accurate in predicting diet than more
   limited character sets. Unfortunately, including phylogeny in making
   dietary inferences actually decreases the accuracy of these predictions,
   showing that dietary predictions from morphology are substantially
   dependent on the evolutionary constraints on carnivore diet and tooth
   shape. The ``evolutionary ratchet{''} that drives lineages of
   carnivorans to evolve greater degrees of hypercarnivory through time
   actually plays a role in allowing dietary inference from tooth shape,
   but consequently requires caution in interpreting dietary inference from
   the teeth fossil carnivores. These difficulties are another reminder of
   the differences in evolutionary tempo and mode between morphology and
   ecology.},
