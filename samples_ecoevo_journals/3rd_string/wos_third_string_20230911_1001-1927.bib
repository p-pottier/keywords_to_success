Abstract = {Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones involved in moulting and development
   of arthropods. Blood samples of 32 individual bats of eight
   insectivorous species were analysed for the presence of ecdysteroids,
   using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Nine ecdysteroids
   were detected. The spectrum of these ecdysteroids was similar in bat
   species which take their preferred food items from the same insect
   order. The spectrum of blood-borne ecdysteroids was broader in the
   autumn than in the summer, and higher concentrations of
   20-hydroxyecdysone (the most common ecdysteroid) occurred in samples
   from large bat species than from small ones. Ecdysteroids may have
   anabolic effects on insectivorous bats and may also affect their
   blood-feeding arthropod parasites.},

Abstract = {The evolution of thermometabolism in pseudosuchians (Late Triassic to
   the present) remains a partly unsolved issue: extant taxa (crocodilians)
   are ectothermic, but the clade was inferred ancestrally endothermic.
   Here we inferred the thermometabolic regime of two neosuchian groups,
   Goniopholididae (Early Jurassic to Late Cretaceous) and Dyrosauridae
   (middle Cretaceous to late Eocene), close relatives of extant
   crocodilians, in order to elucidate the evolutionary pattern across
   Metasuchia (Early Jurassic to the present), a clade comprising Neosuchia
   (Early Jurassic to the present) and Notosuchia (Middle Jurassic until
   the late Miocene). We propose a new integrative approach combining
   geochemical analyses to infer body temperature from the stable oxygen
   isotope composition of tooth phosphate and paleohistology and
   phylogenetic comparative methods to infer resting metabolic rates and
   red blood cell dimensions. dagger Dyrosaurus and dagger Goniopholis
   share with extant crocodilians similar lifestyles, body forms, bone
   tissue organization, body temperatures, metabolic rates, and red blood
   cell dimensions. Consistently, we infer ectothermy for dagger Dyrosaurus
   and dagger Goniopholis with the parsimonious implication of neosuchians
   and metasuchians being primitively ectothermic.},

Title = {Paleodiet of Lamini camelids (Mammalia: Artiodactyla) from the

Abstract = {Camelids (Camelidae) were a diverse and widely distributed group in
   South America during the Pleistocene. According to the fossil record,
   three species inhabited southern Brazil in the recent past: Hemiauchenia
   paradoxa, Lama guanicoe, and Vicugna vicugna. The analysis of carbon and
   oxygen stable isotope ratios in bioapatite provides insight into the
   paleobiology of nonliving animals and the environment they used to
   inhabit. We applied this tool to investigate the diet of camelids from
   two geological localities in southern Brazil: Touro Passo and Santa
   Vitoria Formations (H. paradoxa, n = 7; L. guanicoe, n = 6; V. vicugna,
   n = 4). Carbon stable isotopes from enamel, dentin, and bone indicated
   that H. paradoxa and L. guanicoe had diets comprising mostly C-3
   grasses, but the latter showed a broader diet due to one individual with
   a mixed diet, whereas V. vicugna had a mixed C-3-C-4 diet. These
   different foraging behaviors may have minimized interspecific
   competition and favored niche partitioning and the coexistence of
   related species. Combined oxygen and carbon isotope data showed a
   consistent diet according to climate, probably due to the greater
   availability in glacial periods of cool-season grasses, which mainly use
   the C-3 photosynthetic pathway. Given their adaptations to grazing, the
   climate amelioration, followed by the loss of grasslands, likely had a
   great impact on camelid populations, leading to their extinction in
   southern Brazil. These results, therefore, contribute to the
   understanding of the dynamics of paleocommunities in this region.},

Abstract = {Classic similarity indices measure community resemblance in terms of
   incidence (the number of shared species) and abundance (the extent to
   which the shared species are an equivalently large component of the
   ecosystem). Here we describe a general method for increasing the amount
   of information contained in the output of these indices and describe a
   new ``soft{''} ecological similarity measure (here called ``soft
   Chao-Jaccard similarity{''}). The new measure quantifies community
   resemblance in terms of shared species, while accounting for
   intraspecific variation in abundance and morphology between samples. We
   demonstrate how our proposed measure can reconstruct short ecological
   gradients using random samples of taxa, recognizing patterns that are
   completely missed by classic measures of similarity. To demonstrate the
   utility of our new index, we reconstruct a morphological gradient driven
   by river flow velocity using random samples drawn from simulated and
   real-world data. Results suggest that the new index can be used to
   recognize complex short ecological gradients in settings where only
   information about specimens is available. We include open-source R code
   for calculating the proposed index.},

Title = {Permian-Triassic phylogenetic and morphologic evolution of

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-119},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Rhynchonellida is a major group of brachiopods that survived the
   ``big five{''} mass extinctions and flourished after the
   Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) crisis. However, phylogenetic and character
   evolution in the Rhynchonellida across the P/Tr transition is poorly
   understood. In view of the widespread homoplasy across this order, we
   employ a tip-dated Bayesian analysis to reconstruct phylogenetic
   relationships for late Permian-Triassic rhynchonellides. The same data
   were also analyzed using three other methods: undated Bayesian,
   equal-weighting, and implied-weighting parsimony. Compared with trees
   generated by other methods, those constructed by tip-dating best account
   for the homoplasy in this group and are closer to previous assumptions
   on the evolution of this order. Based on the analyses of multiple trees,
   the major increase in lineage richness occurred in the Early and early
   Middle Triassic. Also, richness in the Anisian almost reached the
   highest level seen in the Triassic. According to fossil records, a
   pronounced reduction in shell size and in the development of
   ornamentation occurred after the P/Tr extinction, which is largely due
   to the loss of large and highly sculptured genera and the
   diversification of small-sized and weakly ornamented genera.
   Ancestral-state estimation of shell size and development of
   ornamentation, coupled with comparisons of other characters, indicate
   that the Early-Middle Triassic mature ``small-sized taxa{''} may have
   characters displayed by juveniles of their ancestors. This suggests that
   for these genera, paedomorphosis was possibly a strategy to survive and
   diversify in the harsh environment after the P/Tr extinction.},

   question by examining chemosensory system evolution in Drosophila.
   Drosophila prolongata males show a massively increased number of
   chemosensory bristles compared to females and males of sibling species.
   This increase is driven by sex-specific transformation of ancestrally
   mechanosensory organs. Consistent with this phenotype, the Pox neuro
   transcription factor (Poxn), which specifies chemosensory bristle
   identity, shows expanded expression in D. prolongata males. Poxn
   expression is controlled by nonadditive interactions among widely
   dispersed enhancers. Although some D. prolongata Poxn enhancers show
   increased activity, the additive component of this increase is slight,
   suggesting that most changes in Poxn expression are due to epistatic
   interactions between Poxn enhancers and trans-regulatory factors.
   Indeed, the expansion of D. prolongata Poxn enhancer activity is only
   observed in cells that express doublesex (dsx), the gene that controls
   sexual differentiation in Drosophila and also shows increased expression
   in D. prolongata males due to cis-regulatory changes. Although expanded
   dsx expression may contribute to increased activity of D. prolongata
   Poxn enhancers, this interaction is not sufficient to explain the full
   expansion of Poxn expression, suggesting that cis-trans interactions
   between Poxn, dsx, and additional unknown genes are necessary to produce
   the derived D. prolongata phenotype. Overall, our results demonstrate
   the importance of epistatic gene interactions for evolution,
   particularly when pivotal genes have complex regulatory architecture.},

Title = {Morphometric analysis of Skiagia-plexus acritarchs from the early

   phenotypic plasticity},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Cambrian evolutionary radiations are marked by spectacular biotic
   turnovers and the establishment of increasingly tiered food chains. At
   the base of these food chains are primary producers, which in the
   Cambrian fossil record are chiefly represented among organic-walled
   microfossils. The majority of these microfossil remains have
   traditionally been attributed to an informal category of incertae sedis
   called ``acritarchs,{''} based entirely on form taxonomy. Acritarch form
   taxa have been intensely used for biostratigraphy and in large-scale
   studies of phytoplankton diversity. However, both prospects have been
   challenged by cases of taxonomic inconsistencies and oversplitting
   arising from the large phenotypic plasticity seen among these
   microfossils. The acritarch form genus Skiagia stands as an ideal case
   study to explore these taxonomic challenges, because it encompasses a
   number of form species widely used in lower Cambrian biostratigraphy.
   Moreover, subtle morphological differences among Skiagia species were
   suggested to underlie key evolutionary innovations toward complex
   reproductive strategies. Here we apply a multivariate morphometric
   approach to investigate the morphological variation of Skiagia-plexus
   acritarchs using an assemblage sourced from the Buen Formation (Cambrian
   Series 2, Stages 3-4) of North Greenland. Our analysis showed that the
   species-level classification of Skiagia discretizes a continuous
   spectrum of morphologies. While these findings bring important taxonomic
   and biostratigraphic hurdles to light, the unequal frequency
   distribution of life cycle stages among Skiagia species suggests that
   certain elements of phytoplankton paleobiology are nonetheless captured
   by Skiagia form taxonomy. These results demonstrate the value of using
   morphometric tools to explore acritarch phenotypic plasticity and its
   potential ontogenetic and paleoecological drivers in Cambrian
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Carnivore conservation translocations are assumed to provide numerous
   ecological benefits, including conservation of the translocated
   carnivores, regulation of prey species and restoration of ecosystems.
   Reviews of mammalian carnivore conservation translocations and resultant
   ecosystem effects have focussed on large carnivores. We reviewed global
   terrestrial carnivore conservation translocations across all taxa,
   including taxonomic bias, problems influencing their population
   establishment and their ecosystem effects. We obtained data from 536
   conservation translocations of 54 species of terrestrial mammalian
   carnivore (order Carnivora and family Dasyuridae, 30 g-196 kg),
   comprising mostly Mustelidae, Canidae, and Felidae species. A third of
   all projects translocated carnivores into South Africa and a third into
   fenced reserves. Significant bias occurred relative to threat status,
   with over-representation of Mustelidae and Canidae conservation
   translocations relative to the number of threatened species in each
   family. Additionally, conservation translocations of small carnivores
   were generally under-represented compared to those of large carnivores.
   Seventeen percent of small carnivore conservation translocations failed,
   compared with 25\% of large carnivore conservation translocations;
   failure was primarily due to reported anthropogenic mortality. Effects
   on resident prey species or ecosystems of carnivore conservation
   translocations were rarely investigated. We found no significant
   relationship between the carnivore family or size and effects on prey or
   ecosystems; however, prey impacts were frequently attributed to Felidae,
   and ecosystem effects were frequently attributed to Canidae and Felidae.
   Challenges to translocations of mammalian carnivores include threats to
   resident threatened prey species and difficulties in monitoring the
   ecological effects of carnivore conservation translocations. Poor
   postrelease monitoring and a lack of empirical studies remain persistent
   problems, contributing to the poor understanding of ecosystem effects
   following carnivore conservation translocations.},

Title = {Unravelling the historical biogeography of the European rabbit

Abstract = {Understanding the biogeography of species in space and time is essential
   for the development of evidence-based conservation and management plans.
   In this paper we propose a biogeographical spatial modelling approach
   based on the favourability function, and developed under a fuzzy logic
   framework, to unravel the historical biogeography of the two European
   wild rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus (Oca) and
   Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus (Occ), in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We
   first reviewed published and unpublished information (PhD theses,
   scientific papers, technical reports, etc.) on the occurrence of each
   rabbit subspecies throughout the IP. We compiled data from 201 Iberian
   rabbit populations and from genetic information of 4348 rabbits that was
   used to identify subspecies. Only populations in which all rabbits
   surveyed belonged to one subspecies were considered in the modelling
   procedure. We modelled rabbit subspecies' distribution separately for
   populations in which nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences were
   available. We employed a trend surface analysis developed by logistic
   regressions, which applied the favourability function and fuzzy logic
   operations. Using our approach we indentify the expansion cores from
   which both rabbit subspecies would have expanded after isolation during
   the last glaciations. Furthermore, we reveal the possible existence of a
   competitive exclusion zone between both rabbit subspecies that may have
   prevented their further expansion. Finally, our study shows that the Oca
   subspecies is distributed in north-western areas previously attributed
   to Occ. This assessment of the actual and historical distribution of
   each rabbit subspecies may allow more specific conservation
   interventions, as the two subspecies are not just genetically distinct
   but also ecologically and behaviourally different. Our methodological
   approach could be useful in unravelling the historical biogeography of
   other lesser-known species.},

Abstract = {Directional asymmetry is a systematic difference between the left and
   right sides for structures with bilateral symmetry or a systematic
   differentiation among repeated parts for complex symmetry. This study
   explores factors that produce directional asymmetry in the flower of
   Iris pumila, a structure with complex symmetry that makes it possible to
   investigate multiple such factors simultaneously. The shapes and sizes
   of three types of floral organs, the falls, standards, and style
   branches, were quantified using the methods of geometric morphometrics.
   For each flower, this study recorded the compass orientations of floral
   organs as well as their anatomical orientations relative to the two
   spathes subtending each flower. To characterize directional asymmetry at
   the whole-flower level, differences in the average sizes and shapes
   according to compass orientation and relative orientation were computed,
   and the left-right asymmetry was also evaluated for each individual
   organ. No size or shape differences within flowers were found in
   relation to anatomical position; this may relate to the terminal
   position of flowers in Iris pumila, suggesting that there may be no
   adaxial-abaxial polarity, which is very prominent in many other taxa.
   There was clear directional asymmetry of shape in relation to compass
   orientation, presumably driven by a consistent environmental gradient
   such as solar irradiance. There was also clear directional asymmetry
   between left and right halves of every floral organ, most likely related
   to the arrangement of organs in the bud. These findings indicate that
   different factors are acting to produce directional asymmetry at
   different levels. In conventional analyses not recording flower
   orientations, these effects would be impossible to disentangle from each
   other and would probably be included as part of fluctuating asymmetry.},

Title = {Testing the niche variation hypothesis in pinnipedsPalabras clave},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {497-506},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Individual trophic specialisation (ITS) has many important consequences
   for ecological and evolutionary processes. An old hypothesis
   highlighting the relevance of ITS is the niche variation hypothesis
   (NVH), which proposes that populations composed of trophically
   specialised individuals have a wider population niche than populations
   composed of more generalist individuals. Pinnipeds are a good model to
   test the NVH because they are mostly generalist species, living in dense
   colonies, and exhibiting variation in trophic niche width among
   populations. We tested the NVH in pinnipeds using longitudinal isotopic
   data: published delta C-13 and delta N-15 data obtained from sequential
   sections of whiskers (vibrissae) from individuals belonging to 14
   populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   evaluating the NVH by using longitudinal isotopic data. We compiled
   studies that published raw data on delta C-13 and delta N-15 for
   pinniped whisker segments to estimate the within-individual and the
   between-individuals components of variance, the total niche width (TNW),
   and ITS. One-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 or delta N-15) and
   multi-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses were used.
   Also, we tested whether an evolutionary component would affect the
   degree of ITS among pinniped species with different levels of shared
   ancestry. Our results indicate that, in line with the NVH, pinniped
   populations composed of more specialised individuals tend to show wider
   trophic niches. When analysing each sex separately, the hypothesis is
   supported for females but not for males. We believe that physiological
   and behavioural differences between sexes may explain this result. In
   females, high TNW is mainly related to greater differentiation among
   individuals, while in males, it is mainly related to high diversity of
   resources consumed by all individuals.},

Title = {Effective hawkmoth pollination in the primarily bee-pollinated Salvia
   daiguii-an example of adaptive generalization},

Abstract = {Many plants exhibit floral traits that are directed to specific
   pollinator groups. Nevertheless, they can also attract less-adapted
   pollinators and gain benefits under certain conditions, resulting in
   adapted generalization. This may be the case in Salvia daiguii
   (Lamiaceae), an endangered, bee-pollinated species native to the
   Tianmenshan National Forest Park, China. The flower appears
   phenotypically specialized to bees but is also visited by Macroglossum
   bombylans. In the present study, we test whether the moth is an
   effective pollinator of S. daiguii. We quantified and compared the
   frequency of flower visits by bees and moths and the number of pollen
   grains deposited on the stigma after a single visit. We also recorded
   the movements of pistils and stamens of S. daiguii and the behavior of
   the hawkmoth at the flowers. We found that Apis cerana was the
   predominant pollinator, depositing an average of 4.74 pollen grains on
   the stigma after a single visit. However, as the style bends downward
   during anthesis and reaches the same level as the anthers, Macroglossum
   individuals hovering around the flowers were also able to effectively
   transfer pollen to the stigma. On average, 1.38 pollen grains were
   deposited on the stigma during a single visit. We demonstrate for the
   first time that the hawkmoth is an effective secondary pollinator in the
   primarily bee-pollinated S. daiguii. Style bending allows a nectar thief
   to become a secondary pollinator. The extent of pollinator
   generalization is thus increased without affecting the fundamental
   phenotype adapted to bees as the main pollinators.},

Abstract = {Herbivory pressure is an important ecological aspect to determine
   quantitative variation in plant defenses, such as the number of
   extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and their nectar amount and quality.
   Extrafloral nectaries can attract ants, which can be considered a type
   of induced plant defense. Besides, plants tend to invest more in defense
   when they are more vulnerable to herbivores. Therefore, we aimed to
   elucidate if Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae), a common Cerrado
   tree species, when subjected to damage (by manual leaf cutting and
   experimental fire) would produce a greater number of EFNs and changes
   its nectar quality on newly produced leaves in comparison with plants
   not subjected to these treatments. Leaf damage was performed
   artificially directly on the plant branches and at the entire plant
   canopy (by means of scissors or fire events). Extrafloral nectary
   density was higher in new leaves produced after the treatment
   application (artificial herbivory and fire) in comparison with plants
   under control treatment. The amount of nectar was also higher under
   treatments in comparison with control, with a significant change on
   nectar quality in plants subjected to the treatments of artificial
   herbivory. The results provided support for the hypothesis that EFNs are
   an inducible defensive strategy in S. adstringens, confirming the
   existence of phenotypic plasticity given environmental pressures.},

   compared avian diversity in beach, saltmarsh, shrub, a Juniperus

   forest at nearby Mashomack Preserve. Maritime forest was highest in bird
   species richness followed by saltmarsh, interior forest, shrub, and
   beach. Habitat variables best explaining avian species richness were
   sand cover, vegetation cover, visibility, and height of nearest
   vegetation. The peninsular shape of the maritime forest supported
   greater edge habitat compared to the interior forest, encouraging
   greater avian diversity. This study provides baseline information for
   the conservation of a rare maritime ecosystem.},

Title = {Competitive overlap between martens Martes americana and Martes caurina
   and fishers Pekania pennanti: a rangewide perspective and synthesis},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Competition is a major determinant of where species occur and how
   species interact. Among carnivorans, interspecific competition is
   particularly apparent, as many of these species have evolved to be
   efficient killers. Theoretically, phylogenetically related carnivorans
   that occupy seasonal habitats, share common resources, and differ in
   body size by a factor of 2.5-10x should exhibit the most interference
   competition. Fishers Pekania pennanti and martens Martes americana and
   Martes caurina are members of the subfamily Guloninae (Mustelidae,
   Carnivora) that occupy forests throughout northern North America. These
   taxa occur sympatrically throughout much of their range, utilise similar
   habitats, and consume similar prey; fishers and martens also differ in
   body size by a factor 2-5x. Consequently, these two taxa appear to be
   locked in particularly strong interspecific competition and should
   attempt to limit competitive overlap. We review the current knowledge of
   this dyadic interaction in the framework of ecological niches and niche
   partitioning. In particular, we explore the three critical niche axes of
   diet, space, and time. We found that, in contrast to the traditional
   view of them being highly specialised, both martens and fishers are
   dietary generalists; however, they also appear to be specialists in
   complexity, at least in space and habitats. Collectively, martens and
   fishers exhibit high degrees of diet and habitat niche overlap across
   their ranges, and this overlap is likely to have the greatest fitness
   consequences for the smaller and subordinate martens. Nevertheless,
   fine-scale habitat and prey partitioning, and especially partitioning
   along snow clines, seem to be the mechanisms by which these two taxa can
   coexist. We predict that rapid ecological change - especially from
   increasingly homogenised forests and prey communities, as well as from
   declining snow cover and snowpack due to climate warming - is likely to
   destabilise marten-fisher coexistence. As the climate continues to
   change, fishers and martens are likely to experience distributional and
   numerical shifts and increased isolation at their southern range
   boundaries, and vulnerable populations - especially of martens - will be
   driven to local extirpation.},

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-98},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Constraining patterns of growth using directly observable and
   quantifiable characteristics can reveal a wealth of information
   regarding the biology of the Ediacara biota-the oldest macroscopic,
   complex community-forming organisms in the fossil record. However, these
   rely on individuals captured at an instant in time at various growth
   stages, and so different interpretations can be derived from the same
   material. Here we leverage newly discovered and well-preserved
   Dickinsonia costata Sprigg, 1947 from South Australia, combined with
   hundreds of previously described specimens, to test competing hypotheses
   for the location of module addition. We find considerable variation in
   the relationship between the total number of modules and body size that
   cannot be explained solely by expansion and contraction of individuals.
   Patterns derived assuming new modules differentiated at the anterior
   result in numerous examples in which the oldest module(s) must decrease
   in size with overall growth, potentially falsifying this hypothesis.
   Observed polarity as well as the consistent posterior location of
   defects and indentations support module formation at this end in D.
   costata. Regardless, changes in repeated units with growth share
   similarities with those regulated by morphogen gradients in metazoans
   today, suggesting that these genetic pathways were operating in
   Ediacaran animals.},

Abstract = {The repeated return of tetrapods to aquatic life provides some of the
   best-known examples of convergent evolution. One comparison that has
   received relatively little focus is that of mosasaurids (a group of Late
   Cretaceous squamates) and archaic cetaceans (the ancestors of modern
   whales and dolphins), both of which show high levels of craniodental
   disparity, similar initial trends in locomotory evolution, and global
   distributions. Here we investigate convergence in skull ecomorphology
   during the initial aquatic radiations of these groups. A series of
   functionally informative ratios were calculated from 38 species, with
   ordination techniques used to reconstruct patterns of functional
   ecomorphospace occupation. The earliest fully aquatic members of each
   clade occupied different regions of ecomorphospace, with basilosaurids
   and early russellosaurines exhibiting marked differences in cranial
   functional morphology. Subsequent ecomorphological trajectories notably
   diverge: mosasaurids radiated across ecomorphospace with no clear
   pattern and numerous reversals, whereas cetaceans notably evolved toward
   shallower, more elongated snouts, perhaps as an adaptation for capturing
   smaller prey. Incomplete convergence between the two groups is present
   among megapredatory and longirostrine forms, suggesting stronger
   selection on cranial function in these two ecomorphologies. Our study
   highlights both the similarities and divergences in craniodental
   evolutionary trajectories between archaic cetaceans and mosasaurids,
   with convergences transcending their deeply divergent phylogenetic
   affinities.},

Abstract = {The effects of overdispersion and zero inflation (e.g., poor model fits)
   can result in misinterpretation in studies using count data. These
   effects have not been evaluated in paleoecological studies of predation
   and are further complicated by preservational bias and time averaging.
   We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty
   from overdispersion and zero inflation in estimates of specimen and
   predation trace counts. We demonstrate its application using published
   data on drilling predators and their prey in time-averaged death
   assemblages from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our results indicate
   that estimates of predation frequencies are underestimated when zero
   inflation is not considered, and this effect is likely compounded by
   removal of individuals and predation traces via preservational bias.
   Time averaging likely reduces zero inflation via accumulation of rare
   taxa and events; however, it increases the uncertainty in comparisons
   between assemblages by introducing variability in sampling effort. That
   is, there is an analytical cost with time-averaged count data,
   manifesting as broader confidence regions. Ecological inferences in
   paleoecology can be strengthened by accounting for the uncertainty
   inherent to paleoecological count data and the sampling processes by
   which they are generated.},

Abstract = {Covariation among discrete phenotypes can arise due to selection for
   shared functions, and/or shared genetic and developmental underpinnings.
   The consequences of such phenotypic integration are far-reaching and can
   act to either facilitate or limit morphological variation. The
   vertebrate brain is known to act as an ``organizer{''} of craniofacial
   development, secreting morphogens that can affect the shape of the
   growing neurocranium, consistent with roles for pleiotropy in
   brain-neurocranium covariation. Here, we test this hypothesis in cichlid
   fishes by first examining the degree of shape integration between the
   brain and the neurocranium using three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics in an F-5 hybrid population, and then genetically mapping
   trait covariation using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We
   observe shape associations between the brain and the neurocranium, a
   pattern that holds even when we assess associations between the brain
   and constituent parts of the neurocranium: the rostrum and braincase. We
   also recover robust genetic signals for both hard- and soft-tissue
   traits and identify a genomic region where QTL for the brain and
   braincase overlap, implicating a role for pleiotropy in patterning trait
   covariation. Fine mapping of the overlapping genomic region identifies a
   candidate gene, notch1a, which is known to be involved in patterning
   skeletal and neural tissues during development. Taken together, these
   data offer a genetic hypothesis for brain-neurocranium covariation, as
   well as a potential mechanism by which behavioral shifts may
   simultaneously drive rapid change in neuroanatomy and craniofacial
   morphology.},

Title = {Evolution of the therian face through complete loss of the premaxilla},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {103-118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The anatomical framework of the jawbones is highly conserved among most
   of the Osteichthyes, including the tetrapods. However, our recent study
   suggested that the premaxilla, the rostralmost upper jaw bone, was
   rearranged during the evolution of therian mammals, being replaced by
   the septomaxilla at least in the lateral part. In the present study, to
   understand more about the process of evolution from the ancestral upper
   jaw to the therian face, we re-examined the development of the therian
   premaxilla (incisive bone). By comparing mouse, bat, goat, and cattle
   fetuses, we confirmed that the therian premaxilla has dual developmental
   origins, the lateral body and the palatine process. This dual
   development is widely conserved among the therian mammals.
   Cell-lineage-tracing experiments using Dlx1-CreER(T2) mice revealed that
   the palatine process arises in the ventral part of the premandibular
   domain, where the nasopalatine nerve distributes, whereas the lateral
   body develops from the maxillary prominence in the domain of the
   maxillary nerve. Through comparative analysis using various tetrapods,
   we concluded that the palatine process should not be considered part of
   the ancestral premaxilla. It rather corresponds to the anterior region
   of the vomerine bone of nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, the present
   findings indicate that the true premaxilla was completely lost during
   the evolution of the therian mammals, resulting in the establishment of
   the unique therian face as an evolutionary novelty. Reconsideration of
   the homological framework of the cranial skeleton based on the
   topographical relationships of the ossification center during embryonic
   development is warranted.},

Title = {Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican
   cavefish},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with
   various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most
   organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship
   between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in
   our understanding of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus,
   consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at
   least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that
   inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application
   of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping
   have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of
   complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with
   surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye
   degeneration, insomnia, albinism, and enhanced mechanosensory function.
   The interfertility of different populations from the same species
   provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between
   evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and
   morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships
   between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to
   test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed
   differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex
   between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship
   between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for
   locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex, and
   morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body
   length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between
   increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were
   few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and
   morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie
   the evolution of the measured behavioral and morphological traits. Taken
   together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genetic
   underpinnings of naturally occurring variation in morphological and
   behavioral traits.},

Abstract = {Laportea bulbifera (Ulticaceae) is a monoecious plant that has a unique
   sexual expression: female flowers form on the upper part and male
   flowers on the lower part on an individual shoot. Therefore, for the
   seed reproduction, pollen needs to be transferred from the lower (male)
   to the upper (female) flowers. Our observations of male flowers
   confirmed that pollen was dispersed upward by ``explosive wind
   pollination.{''} A male flower has five stamens, and when the petals are
   open, the stamens are caught in a pistillode. With the growth of the
   stamens, they are released from the pistillode and then straightened
   with a spring-like movement of the filament. At the same time, the
   anthers dehisce, and the pollen is dispersed. The explosive release of
   pollen from the anthers and light wind in the habitat (forest edge or
   gap) contributes to wind pollination in L. bulbifera.},

Abstract = {Melastomataceae is a megadiverse family with records of transitions from
   specialized to generalized pollination systems for several species.
   These transitions are associated with the colonization of new,
   unpredictable and/or impoverished pollinator habitats or habitats where
   specialized pollinators are scarce (e.g., in highland environments). The
   bee species diversity is low in highlands. Therefore, autonomous
   breeding systems such as apomixis and self-pollination emerge in these
   environments. In this paper, we studied the floral traits associated
   with the generalization of pollination systems and registered the floral
   visitors of two species in the Colombian Andes: Miconia cataractae and
   M. elaeoides. We investigated the breeding system of M. elaeoides. Both
   species presented small flowers, short anthers of medium pore size, and
   nectar-producing stomata on the base of the anthers. Miconia cataractae
   produced an average of 1.62 mu l nectar/flower, a sugar concentration of
   6.78\%, whereas M. elaeoides produced 0.09 mu l nectar/flower, a sugar
   concentration of 6.13\%. We recorded a wide diversity of pollinators for
   both species, mainly insects from the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera.
   Miconia elaeoides presented a mixed breeding system and was also capable
   of setting fruits by apomixis. We conclude that flower and anther
   morphology, combined with nectar production, thus represent convergent
   traits resulting in a generalist pollination system shared by M.
   cataractae and M. elaeoides. Here, we presented the first generalist
   pollination system recorded for Miconia (and the Melastomataceae) in the
   Andes, the first report for a species from the small-pored section
   Amblyarrhena, and the first report for a species from the large-pored
   section Cremanium in Colombia.},

Abstract = {Calanthe amamiana is a terrestrial orchid that thrives on the shady
   forest floors of broad-leaved forests on Amami Island, central Ryukyus,
   Japan. Here, I report on the floral and pollination biology of this
   critically endangered orchid based on a 7-year study conducted in the
   species' natural habitats. As the nectarless flowers are probably
   self-compatible but are unable to autonomously self-pollinate, they need
   to attract pollen vectors by deceit for pollination. To advertise
   themselves, the flowering inflorescences, which comprise a few to dozens
   of flowers, use whitish floral colors that are comparatively conspicuous
   against the shaded background. The exclusive pollinator was the
   long-horned bee Eucera okinawae, which nests in soils of the forest
   floor, although bee abundance varied considerably among study years.
   Natural fruit-set ratios were generally low but showed interannual
   variation. The annual fruit-set ratios were positively correlated with
   annual bee abundance, thereby suggesting that under natural conditions,
   the orchid is pollinator-limited. Given that C. amamiana is dependent
   exclusively on E. okinawae for pollination and is also probably
   pollinator-limited, conservation plans for this orchid should take into
   consideration the welfare of long-horned bees. In particular, as
   nectariferous flowers were unavailable within broad-leaved forests, to
   satisfy the foraging requirements of long-horned bees, conservation
   managers should be cognizant of conservation values of flowering plants
   distributed in sun-lit sites near orchid habitats, and manage those in
   an appropriate manner.},

Abstract = {Hermaphroditism is cost-effective because a common investment in reward
   and attractive structures yields benefits through both male and female
   reproductive success. However, the advantage is accompanied by an
   increased risk of self-pollen deposition, which is generally
   disadvantageous. Hermaphroditic plants reduce self-pollen deposition by
   separating sporophylls (a term applied to the stamens and carpels)
   either spatially (herkogamy) or temporally (dichogamy). In
   movement-assisted dichogamy, both sporophylls show coordinated motion in
   opposite directions. However, the effectiveness of this movement in
   reducing self-pollen deposition may be compromised at the point when the
   sporophylls cross each other and are close enough to interfere,
   resulting in a transition phase problem. The solution to this problem
   lies in the details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the sporophylls in
   relation to their reproductive maturity. We studied these details across
   the floral lifetime of a protandrous shrub, Clerodendrum infortunatum
   (Lamiaceae), in rainforest fragments of the Western Ghats, India. We
   took photos of flowers at regular time intervals and measured sporophyll
   angles from the images. We also carried out a field experiment to
   determine stigma receptivity. We found that the stigma lobes remained
   narrowly opened at transition, and the stigma surfaces remained
   non-receptive. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of dichogamy
   is maximized through two properties of the transition phase: physical
   resistance to self-pollen deposition by narrow stigma lobe opening and
   chemical non-receptivity of the stigma during this phase. This study
   emphasizes the importance of accessory adaptations in movement-assisted
   dichogamy to tackle the transition phase problem.},

Title = {Efficient pollination and high reproductive success in two Brazilian

Abstract = {The pollination process and breeding system of Pachygenium bonariense
   and Pachygenium pteryganthum were documented for native populations from
   Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The flowers secrete nectar (on average with
   65\% to 67\% of the concentration of total sugars), which is concealed
   into an incurved spur. Both species are pollinated by native, large
   Apidae bees, and the pollinaria adhere under the ventral surface of
   their labrum while bees try to reach the nectar. P. bonariense is
   pollinated by native bumblebees Bombus (Fervidobombus) morio and P.
   pteryganthum by females of oil-gathering Centris (Melacentris) sp. Both
   orchid species are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent (i.e.,
   unable to set fruit and seed in the absence of pollinators). They also
   displayed high natural reproductive success (from 22\% to 90\%) and
   Nilsson's male efficiency factors ranging from 2.2 to 3.6, suggesting
   that, during our observations, more than one flower was pollinated for
   each flower acting as the pollen donor. To enrich the discussion,
   additional unpublished data on the pollination and breeding system of
   other orchid species of the Pelexia clade (the Spiranthinae group
   containing the studied species) are also presented and briefly
   illustrated. A phylogenetic framework of the clade is used to ascertain
   well-supported evolutionary scenarios for pollination-related floral
   traits (viscidium, protandry and a group of pollinators). The
   characteristic ``dorsally adhesive{''} viscidium can be considered a
   synapomorphy for the subclade formed by the genera Cyclopogon, Veyretia,
   Sarcoglottis, Pachygenium, Pelexia and Brachystele, with a reversal to
   the plesiomorphic condition (ventrally adhesive) at the latter genus.
   Pollination by bees is likely the rule within the subclade and may be
   regarded as plesiomorphic for the whole Spiranthinae subtribe.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plant species with aerial seed banks are commonly referred to as
   ``serotinous,{''} an adaptation in which seed release happens in
   response to an environmental trigger. Individuals of Ariocarpus
   kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae), a specially protected species, store some
   seeds on the plant over 1 year. We examined the seed retention time, the
   release mechanism, and the germination behavior of this species in
   Central Mexico. Flowers produced in a population of A. kotschoubeyanus
   were monitored, and the number of fruits retained or expelled was
   determined to calculate the serotiny degree (the number of seeds
   retained in the tubercules of the plant divided by the total number of
   seeds produced per plant). The seed retention in previous years was
   estimated for 30 individuals. The dynamics of retained seeds in the
   mother plant (seed age in ``rings{''}) were determined from the annual
   average production of tubercules per individual, using observations for
   5 years. A germination test employing the seeds collected from recently
   formed fruits and those obtained from different rings was conducted. We
   observed that 86.6\% of the plants showed seed retention (aerial seed
   bank) in some ring of the aerial stems. The serotiny degree was 37.3,
   having 32.68 seeds per plant. Seeds retained in the ``rings{''} from 1-
   to 24-year-old plants had a higher germination proportion (between 0.40
   and 0.73) than fresh seeds (0.13). Seeds increase their germination
   proportion with age; thus, seed retention by tubercules (serotiny)
   represents a reproductive strategy to conserve germplasm until favorable
   conditions to germinate are present.},

Abstract = {Although germination sensu stricto and germination-dormancy balance are
   essential to each other, few reports demonstrate the effects of their
   relationship on patterns of seed-seedling transition. We studied this
   relationship by using diaspores of Paepalanthus chiquitensis, a
   threatened everlasting flowering species. We assessed three aspects: (a)
   water dynamics in germinating diaspores, (b) thermal stimulation (35,
   40, 50, 60 and 70 degrees C for 30 min) and (c) imbibition (4 hr) in
   growth stimulators (100, 200 or 300 mg center dot L-1 GA(3); 0.1\%
   KNO3). Our findings demonstrate that there are no barriers in the
   diaspore for diffusion. Additionally, there is high variability in
   diaspore permeability, and the germination of the species has two steps
   divided into five stages. These stages were defined by inflections on
   velocity in water dynamics, which ranged from -0.05 to 0.05 g center dot
   hr(-1), where only the last stage (Phase V) is associated with the
   second step of germination sensu stricto. The imbibition phase was the
   shortest germination phase (1.3 hr), whereas the predominantly
   biochemical phase was the longest (5 days after sowing {[}DAS]).
   Germinability was high (77.5-86.5\%), with high daily embryo protrusion
   (2.46-3.03 diaspores center dot day(-1)). Protocorm emergence marked the
   end of the first step of germination sensu stricto (9 DAS), and first
   protocorm rupture (11 DAS) marked the end of the second step. The growth
   stimulus only concentrated the germination process, showing that the
   diaspores do not have primary dormancy. Knowing these diaspores'
   peculiarities during germination sensu stricto avoids a false positive
   statement on the existence of diaspore dormancy.},

Title = {Comparing the Effectiveness of Fitch and Sherman Traps in a Grassland
   Ecosystem},

Abstract = {Many studies of rodents rely on the use of live trapping. Comparative
   studies of trap type provide researchers with information that can
   inform their trapping design, yet relatively few comparative studies
   include economical mesh traps, such as Fitch traps. I compared the
   effectivess of Sherman box traps and Fitch mesh traps for rodent
   sampling in a grassland ecosystem. Between 2016 and 2017, I set 120 trap
   stations with both Fitch and Sherman traps for a total of 6000 trap
   nights at a single tallgrass prairie-restoration site in northern
   Illinois. I compared trap effectivess overall and for each species
   captured. Fitch traps were significantly better at capturing ground
   squirrels than Sherman traps and comparable to Sherman traps at
   capturing voles and jumping mice. These results demonstrate Fitch traps
   provide a viable alternative to Sherman traps for sampling at this
   location and indicate they should be considered in future comparative
   studies to further assess their effectiveness, especially in grasslands.},

Title = {Agroecosystem Ecology of Northern Deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Peromyscus leucopus (White-Footed Deermouse) and Peromyscus maniculatus
   ( North American Deermouse) are 2 widespread rodent species in North
   America, with North American Deermice more ecologically diverse and
   widely distributed than White-footed Deermice. Commonly, White-Footed
   Deermice are ecological generalists, and North American Deermice are
   ecological specialists. In the Inner Bluegrass Region of Kentucky, these
   2 species are sympatric in agroecosystems habitats, including the
   University of Kentucky North Farm. This farm was the most trapped
   location in central Kentucky from 1950 to 1968, with results indicating
   the White-Footed Deermoouse was the more common of these species.
   Trapping from 1995 to 2015 found that North American Deermice were
   caught rarely. Our study examined agroecosystems habitats at the UK
   North Farm, including all perennial and annual habitats, to determine
   the relative abundance and habitat use by both these species. In our
   study, North American Deermice was the most commonly captured species;
   it was trapped rarely in perennial habitats but much more frequently in
   annual crops. Perennial clover fields and Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) were
   the 2 exceptions; however, these are short crops with exposed soil
   between rows. Essentially, North American Deermice were observed in the
   agricultural equivalent of early successional habitat. In contrast,
   White-Footed Deermice were captured in both perennial and annual
   habitats, but more commonly in perennial habitats, the exception being
   annual Salvia hispanica (Chia) fields where dense, green plants produced
   a thick canopy. Overall, the best predictor of habitat for North
   American Deermice was bare, exposed soil, whereas the best predictor for
   White-Footed Deermice was dense growth and overhead cover.},

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {262-294},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There are few undisturbed, freshwater habitats remaining in the
   populated areas of the United States. Aquatic organisms, such as
   dragonflies (Odonata), have therefore either had to adapt to disturbed
   and modified secondary habitats, such as farms, golf courses,
   storm-water remediation basins, and community-park ponds, or risk
   extirpation. The species that readily adapt to these habitats are
   usually widespread common species. However, other aquatic habitats
   inadvertently created at abandoned work sites often evolve distinctive
   characteristics over time that provide refuge for species rarely or
   never found at deliberately created pond habitats. For 17 years, we have
   monitored the diverse Odonata fauna at several floristically distinct
   ponds formed in depressions left from the dredging of the Chesapeake and
   Delaware Canal in the 1960s. Among the species found are ones not known
   elsewhere locally or ones found in unusual abundance at 1 or more of the
   ponds, though infrequently encountered regionally. These dredge-spoil
   ponds are important for conserving regional Odonata biodiversity by
   providing unique habitats in an increasingly urbanized environment.},

Abstract = {New York's Adirondack alpine zone harbors many rare vascular plants
   threatened by climate change, atmospheric deposition, and damage from
   recreational use. Here, we report on the results of population
   monitoring at 6-year intervals of 15 alpine areas. We sampled 366, 360,
   and 369 randomly placed plots in 2006-2007, 2013, and 2018-2019,
   respectively. Ten species were found in at least 5\% of the plots, with
   Trichophorum cespitosum (Deer's Hair Club Sedge; 60\% of plots) and
   Huperzia appressa (Mountain Firmoss; 42\%) most frequent. Of these 10
   species, 5 showed significant increases in density over time and 3 had
   no significant change in density. The 5 species showing increases also
   had densities positively correlated with metrics of current or former
   physical disturbance, such as exposure to western slopes and proximity
   to hiking trails. These data suggest many rare alpine plants are
   maintaining population levels; environmental heterogeneity and hiker
   education in the alpine zone may be contributing to this pattern.},

Title = {Coyote diet in North America: geographic and ecological patterns during
   range expansion},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {480-496},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coyotes Canis latrans have expanded their geographic range by 40\% in
   the last 120 years, raising questions about their ecological impacts in
   the newly colonised areas. Despite a wealth of local knowledge on coyote
   diet in North America, we have little information about how and why diet
   might vary throughout the species' range. We conducted the first
   rangewide meta-analysis of coyote diet by investigating how ecoregion,
   coyote mass, environmental conditions, presence of top predators and
   alternative food items are related to coyote dietary diversity, as well
   as consumption of small mammals, lagomorphs, vegetation and ungulates.
   Using data from 93 studies, we used generalised linear mixed models to
   determine which variables best explained coyote dietary patterns.
   Coyotes were generally more carnivorous in temperate forests than in
   other ecoregions, primarily due to greater ungulate consumption. Dietary
   diversity was most influenced via a negative effect of mammal
   consumption; coyote diet was more diverse in the spring and where human
   footprint was greater. There was minor variation in small mammal
   consumption, but lagomorph consumption was greater in spring and winter
   and when coyotes were larger. Vegetation consumption was greatest in
   summer and autumn. Ungulate consumption was positively related to coyote
   mass, snow cover and the presence of grey wolves Canis lupus. Both
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors were related to coyote diet. Larger
   coyotes ate larger foods, which parallels the relationship between mass
   and prey size across the carnivore guild. Wolves and humans have
   opposing effects on coyote diet. Coyotes seem to prioritise eating wild
   mammals, though more work is needed to quantify scavenging.
   Collectively, our findings emphasise the need for continued local or
   regional studies to understand the highly variable ecological effects of
   coyotes within the diverse ecosystems they currently inhabit and are
   poised to inhabit.},

Abstract = {Ediacaran embryo-like spherical fossils exhibit diverse cell adhesion
   patterns resembling partial cleavage-stage embryos of living animals.
   Two three-celled specimens characterized by a pair of small cells
   overlying a large cell have been recovered from the Ediacaran Zhenba
   microfossil assemblage. Their cell adhesion pattern is highly comparable
   to a phenomenon reported from the Weng'an biota that was interpreted as
   fossil embryos undergoing discoidal cleavage. However, our specimens
   contain fewer cells and thus probably represent developmental precursors
   of the Weng'an counterparts. Additionally, new material shows several
   anatomical features that are inconsistent with an embryo interpretation,
   including (1) an unusually large volume of ``blastomeres,{''} (2) a
   putative nucleus preserved within the large ``yolk cell,{''} and (3)
   completely separated cells. Collectively, the Zhenba embryo-like
   specimens permit a reconstruction of the consecutive developmental
   sequence from single-celled individuals to the three-celled individuals,
   leading us to interpret the newly found specimens as products of
   abnormal development of Ediacaran embryo-like organisms whose affinity
   remains unresolved.},

Title = {Breaking constraints: The development and evolution of extreme fin

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {109-124},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The developmental process establishes the foundation upon which natural
   selection may act. In that same sense, it is inundated with numerous
   constraints that work to limit the directions in which a phenotype may
   respond to selective pressures. Extreme phenotypes have been used in the
   past to identify tradeoffs and constraints and may aid in recognizing
   how alterations to the Bauplane can influence the trajectories of
   lineages. The Bramidae, a family of Scombriformes consisting of 20
   extant species, are unique in that five species greatly deviate from the
   stout, ovaloid bodies that typify the bramids. The Ptericlinae, or
   fanfishes, are instead characterized by relatively elongated body plans
   and extreme modifications to their medial fins. Here, we explore the
   development of Bramidae morphologies and examine them through a
   phylogenetic lens to investigate the concepts of developmental and
   evolutionary constraints. Contrary to our predictions that the fanfishes
   had been constrained by inherited properties of an ancestral state, we
   find that the fanfishes exhibit both increased rates of trait evolution
   and differ substantially from the other bramids in their developmental
   trajectories. Conversely, the remaining bramid genera differ little,
   both among one another and in comparison, to the sister family
   Caristiidae. In all, our data suggest that the fanfishes have broken
   constraints, thereby allowing them to mitigate trade-offs on distinctive
   aspects of morphology.},

Abstract = {Pinus rigida (Pitch Pine)-Quercus ilicifolia (Scrub Oak) barrens require
   active management to maintain, but the effects of forest management on
   snakes and game birds is poorly understood. We conducted vegetation
   surveys and examined incidental encounter data of a variety of snake and
   game bird species on a managed pine barren in Montague, MA, from 2008 to
   2018. We recorded 73 observations, including 44 Coluber constrictor
   constrictor (Northern Black Racer) and 7 Aleleagris gallopavo (Wild
   Turkey) nests. All of our observations were in managed habitats (Scrub
   Oak, treated Pitch Pine, and powerline corridors) which had low (<30\%)
   tree canopy cover. Observed densities of Northern Black Racers did not
   significantly vary among these open-canopy habitats, or with time since
   treatment between 2 to 8 years since initial harvest in treated Pitch
   Pine. We did not conduct extensive surveys in unmanaged, closed-canopy
   Pitch Pine forests; thus, we were unable to determine the relative use
   by racers and game birds of unmanaged versus managed habitats.
   Nevertheless, snakes and game birds were using and nesting in the
   managed habitats at least to some extent. Our findings on racers and
   game birds from this study are preliminary, but combined with results
   from other studies, they suggest that ecosystem management in pine
   barrens can benefit snakes and game birds, along with a wide variety of
   other taxa.},

Title = {Plant Responses to Climate Change and an Elevational Gradient in Mont
   Megantic National Park, Quebec, Canada},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {11},
Pages = {4-28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With steep climatic gradients over short distances, montane ecosystems
   provide exceptional opportunities to study ecological responses to
   climate and other environmental changes. Here we present a summary and
   synthesis of 10 years of research on this theme in a protected area in
   southern Quebec, Canada (Parc National du Mont Megantic), with
   ecological conditions closely similar to the northern Appalachians.
   During the similar to 150 years since European settlement, anthropogenic
   disturbance has reduced the abundance of certain taxa (e.g., Picea
   {[}spruce]), while favoring other taxa that thrive during succession
   (e.g., Betula {[}birch], Acer {[}maple]). In more recent decades,
   climate warming (similar to 0.21 degrees C per decade) appears to have
   prompted upward elevational range shifts for many plant species,
   although such responses lag behind changes in climate itself.
   Experimental studies with seeds and seedlings of Acer saccharum (Sugar
   Maple) suggest that upward range expansion might be constrained by
   non-climatic factors such as belowground properties and seed predators,
   while escape from insect herbivores might actually accelerate range
   expansion. Similar studies with understory plants have not revealed
   clear evidence of non-climatic constraints on range limits, although
   some preliminary data presented here suggest a possible role of a lack
   of microsites with rich, moist soil at high elevation. Current studies
   focus on the lower elevational range limits of species restricted to
   mountaintops, such as certain lichens. Vegetation and flowering
   phenology are also sensitive to climate, and we have found that earlier
   springs are associated with decreased potential gene flow across
   populations at different elevations; ongoing studies will determine how
   differential sensitivity of herbs vs. trees might influence the duration
   of a high light period in spring in the understory. Overall, we have
   found clear signals of plant responses to long-term anthropogenic
   disturbances and recent climatic warming, but considerable uncertainty
   remains about how climatic and non-climatic factors will interact to
   determine the future of this montane ecosystem.},

Title = {Florivory in two Chamaecrista species: Are secretory trichomes effective

Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Florivory in Chamaecrista varies in occurrence, intensity, and the
   floral structures affected. As flowers are multifunctional units, the
   type of damage can impact reproductive success in different ways.
   Oil-resin-secreting trichomes, present in the sepals of Chamaecrista
   species, section Absus, are suggested to inhibit florivory. We recorded
   florivory in Chamaecrista cathartica and Chamaecrista catharticoides in
   order to determine the frequency of damage, floral whorls most damaged,
   impact on reproduction, and effectiveness of secretory trichomes in
   inhibiting florivory. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual do
   Ibitipoca, Brazil. Twenty individuals of each species were monitored
   monthly over two bloom periods to record the flowering intensity, rates
   of florivory, and fruit set and to determine the effectiveness of
   trichomes in inhibiting florivory. The two species had different
   flowering patterns, annual for C. cathartica and continuous for C.
   catharticoides, both more intense during summer. Florivory occurred
   mainly in the winter and affected floral structures unevenly, resulting
   in loss of different floral functions. Florivory reduced the fruit set
   of both species, but C. catharticoides was considerably more impacted.
   The diversity of damaged structures in C. catharticoides resulted in
   direct (reduced female and male fitness due to loss of ovules and pollen
   grains) and indirect (loss of floral resources and reduced floral
   attractiveness) impacts. Damage to the tubular petal could further
   result in loss of specialized pollination mechanisms mediated by this
   structure. Secretory trichomes on the abaxial surface of sepals
   inhibited florivory of buds and herbivory of early-developing fruits.},

Title = {Thyroid hormone shapes craniofacial bones during postembryonic zebrafish
   development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {61-76},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Changing the shape of craniofacial bones can profoundly alter ecological
   function, and understanding how developmental conditions sculpt skeletal
   phenotypes can provide insight into evolutionary adaptations. Thyroid
   hormone (TH) stimulates metamorphosis and regulates skeletal
   morphogenesis across vertebrates. To assess the roles of this hormone in
   sculpting the craniofacial skeleton of a non-metamorphic vertebrate, we
   tested zebrafish for developmental periods of TH-induced craniofacial
   shape change. We analyzed shapes of specific bones that function in prey
   detection, capture and processing. We quantified these elements from
   late-larval through adult stages under three developmental TH profiles.
   Under wild-type conditions, each bone progressively grows allometrically
   into a mature morphology over the course of postembryonic development.
   In three of the four bones, TH was required to sculpt an adult shape:
   hypothyroidism inhibited aspects of shape change, and allowed some
   components of immature shape to be retained into adulthood. Excess
   developmental TH stimulated aspects of precocious shape change leading
   to abnormal morphologies in some bones. Skeletal features with
   functional importance showed high sensitivities to TH, including the
   transformator process of the tripus, the mandibular symphysis of the
   lower jaw, the scutiform lamina of the hyomandibula, and the anterior
   arm of the pharyngeal jaw. In all, we found that TH is necessary for
   shaping mature morphology of several essential skeletal elements; this
   requirement is particularly pronounced during larval development.
   Altered TH titer leads to abnormal morphologies with likely functional
   consequences, highlighting the potential of TH and downstream pathways
   as targets for evolutionary change.},

   development, and human pathology. One of the most stunning examples of
   craniofacial diversification is the adaptive radiation of birds, in
   which the beak serves essential roles in virtually every aspect of their
   life histories. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) provides an
   exceptional opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings of
   craniofacial variation because of its unique balance of experimental
   accessibility and extraordinary phenotypic diversity within a single
   species. We used traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify
   craniofacial variation in an F-2 laboratory cross derived from the
   straight-beaked Pomeranian Pouter and curved-beak Scandaroon pigeon
   breeds. Using a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus
   scans and multi-locus modeling, we identified a set of genetic loci
   associated with complex shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton,
   including beak shape, braincase shape, and mandible shape. Some of these
   loci control coordinated changes between different structures, while
   others explain variation in the size and shape of specific skull and jaw
   regions. We find that in domestic pigeons, a complex blend of both
   independent and coupled genetic effects underlie three-dimensional
   craniofacial morphology.},

Abstract = {We assessed Alosa pseudoharengus (Alewife) upstream passage during
   2016-2019 spawning runs using radio frequency identification (RFID)
   tracking through a periodically submerged and a constantly submerged
   top-hinged tide gate in the LaPlanche and Missaquash rivers,
   respectively, on the Chignecto Isthmus, Canada. First detection of
   individuals tagged in previous years (i.e., returnees) revealed
   synchronous upstream run timing in both rivers during 2015 and 2018.
   Greater delays of migrants attempting passage through the periodically
   submerged tide gate prompted temporary removal of 1 flapper door during
   2016-2019 runs. During a 7-day period following door removal, the number
   of individuals passing per day increased 4- to 6-fold during 2016-2017
   and less than 2-fold during 2018-2019. More than 80\% of returnees
   passed the periodically submerged gate following door removal,
   decreasing mean delay to less than that of migrants attempting passage
   of the constantly submerged gate. Most individuals passed the
   periodically submerged gate during mid-flood daily tide phases and none
   passed during low-tide outflow due to high water velocities. Passage of
   the constantly submerged gate occurred during all tide phases, with 77\%
   passing during ebb and low tides. The constantly submerged tide gate
   provided greater windows of opportunity, resulting in relatively shorter
   delays compared to the periodically submerged tide gate. Long-term
   monitoring in this study highlighted the effectiveness of temporary
   and/or adaptive mitigation when addressing issues in river connectivity
   and fish passage.},

Abstract = {Species that respond to ecosystem change in a timely, measurable, and
   interpretable way can be used as sentinels of global change. Contrary to
   a pervasive view, we suggest that, among Carnivora, small carnivores are
   more appropriate sentinels than large carnivores. This reasoning is
   built around six key points: that, compared to large carnivores, small
   carnivores 1) are more species-rich and diverse, providing more
   potential sentinels in many systems; 2) occupy a wider range of
   ecological niches, exhibiting a greater variety of sensitivities to
   change; 3) hold an intermediate trophic position that is more directly
   affected by changes at the producer, primary consumer, and tertiary
   consumer levels; 4) have shorter life spans and higher reproductive
   rates, exhibiting more rapid responses to change; 5) have smaller home
   ranges and are more abundant, making it easier to investigate fine-scale
   management interventions; 6) are easier to monitor, manage, and
   manipulate. Therefore, we advocate for incorporating a middle-out
   approach, in addition to the established top-down and bottom-up
   approaches, to assessing the responses of ecosystems to global change.},

Title = {Adverse effects of Diptera flies on northern ungulates: Rangifer, Alces,
   and Bison},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-437},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Flies (Diptera) damage ungulates far beyond the injury of their bite
   wounds: they are vectors of diseases and cause ungulates to lose
   foraging opportunities due to avoidance behaviour. We can use the
   behavioural and physiological responses of bison Bison spp.
   (Artiodactyla: Bovidae), caribou/reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), and moose/elk Alces alces (Artiodactyla:
   Cervidae) to assess the impacts of flies on these ungulates. Ungulates
   rely on morphological and physiological resistance to flies at low
   intensities of exposure. However, as fly exposure increases, ungulates
   begin to react with behavioural avoidance in addition to increasing
   their physiological response. Rangifer tarandus are highly sensitive to
   flies and respond quickly to their presence by avoidance behaviours that
   incur fitness costs through reduced body mass. Alces alces are less
   reactive to fly exposure, enduring the presence of flies and maintaining
   a low loss of fitness, sometimes dying from the cumulative effects of
   exposure. Bison spp. may use a facultative strategy that depends upon
   the prevalence of flies and associated diseases in their environment.
   Among these strategies, variables such as the type of fly bite, presence
   and degree of infection, and heritability of resistance affect
   individual host survival. Relationships between flies and ungulates can
   integrate multiple scales of organisation in the ecosystem to reflect
   system stability. Climate change is predicted to alter the species
   composition and seasonal phenology of flies and the associated effects
   of wounding and vector-borne disease on ungulate populations that are
   central to the functions of Arctic and temperate ecosystems in the
   Northern Hemisphere.},

Title = {Creating morphological diversity in reptilian temporal skull region: A
   review of potential developmental mechanisms},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {15-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Reptilian skull morphology is highly diverse and broadly categorized
   into three categories based on the number and position of the temporal
   fenestrations: anapsid, synapsid, and diapsid. According to recent
   phylogenetic analysis, temporal fenestrations evolved twice
   independently in amniotes, once in Synapsida and once in Diapsida.
   Although functional aspects underlying the evolution of tetrapod
   temporal fenestrations have been well investigated, few studies have
   investigated the developmental mechanisms responsible for differences in
   the pattern of temporal skull region. To determine what these mechanisms
   might be, we first examined how the five temporal bones develop by
   comparing embryonic cranial osteogenesis between representative extant
   reptilian species. The pattern of temporal skull region may depend on
   differences in temporal bone growth rate and growth direction during
   ontogeny. Next, we compared the histogenesis patterns and the expression
   of two key osteogenic genes, Runx2 and Msx2, in the temporal region of
   the representative reptilian embryos. Our comparative analyses suggest
   that the embryonic histological condition of the domain where temporal
   fenestrations would form predicts temporal skull morphology in adults
   and regulatory modifications of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in osteogenic
   mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating
   morphological diversity in the temporal skull region of reptiles.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {158-170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Stripe patterns are a striking example for a repeatedly evolved color
   pattern. In the African adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes, stripes
   evolved several times independently. Previously, it has been suggested
   that regulatory evolution of a single gene, agouti-related-peptide 2
   (agrp2), explains the evolutionary lability of this trait. Here, using a
   comparative transcriptomic approach, we performed comparisons between
   (adult) striped and nonstriped cichlid fishes of representatives of Lake
   Victoria and the two major clades of Lake Malawi (mbuna and non-mbuna
   lineage). We identify agrp2 to be differentially expressed across all
   pairwise comparisons, reaffirming its association with stripe pattern
   divergence. We therefore also provide evidence that agrp2 is associated
   with the loss of the nonstereotypic oblique stripe of Mylochromis mola.
   Complementary ontogenetic data give insights into the development of
   stripe patterns as well as vertical bar patterns that both develop
   postembryonically. Lastly, using the Lake Victoria species pair
   Haplochromis sauvagei and Pundamilia nyererei, we investigated the
   differences between melanic and non-melanic regions to identify
   additional genes that contribute to the formation of stripes. Expression
   differences-that most importantly also do not include agrp2-are
   surprisingly small. This suggests, at least in this species pair, that
   the stripe phenotype might be caused by a combination of more subtle
   transcriptomic differences or cellular changes without transcriptional
   correlates. In summary, our comprehensive analysis highlights the
   ontogenetic and adult transcriptomic differences between cichlids with
   different color patterns and serves as a basis for further investigation
   of the mechanistic underpinnings of their diversification.},

Abstract = {Understanding climate change and air pollution impacts on the

   in size and spatial distribution post deglaciation, these alpine
   ecosystems survived the Hypsithermal warming period with less change
   than lower-elevation ecosystems. They are low for their latitude and
   below physiologically limited treeline. More-recent data support and
   expand on earlier researchers' hypotheses that wind and moisture, not
   temperature, explains the continued existence of alpine ecosystems in

Title = {Reproductive biology of Myrtillocactus geometrizans (Cactaceae) flowers

Abstract = {In columnar cacti, a higher production of reproductive structures on
   branches oriented towards the Equator has been explained by their higher
   interception of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) as well as
   resource availability. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect
   of orientation on diverse aspects of the reproductive biology of
   Myrtillocactus geometrizans. Phenology was studied in north- and
   south-facing branches. Floral cycle events, floral visitors,
   reproductive traits associated with sexual and attraction functions, and
   reproductive success were estimated from reproductive structures with
   contrasting orientation. Pollination experiments were conducted to
   evaluate the effect of orientation on mating system. Our results showed
   that south-facing branches had a longer duration of the mature fruit
   phenophase. Moreover, flower synchrony, production of reproductive
   structures, and floral traits associated with the male (number of
   anthers and pollen grains per floral bud), female (number and size of
   ovules and dimensions of both ovary and ovary cavity), and attraction
   (petal size) functions had higher values in south-facing flowers. The
   beginning and ending of the male function and the end of flower anthesis
   occurred earlier in south-facing flowers. Diversity of floral visitors
   was similar between orientations, except for beetles whose abundance was
   greater in flowers oriented towards the south. North- and south-facing
   flowers had a mixed mating system, with similar reproductive success.
   Our results showed strong differences in the reproductive biology of an
   intertropical columnar cactus, probably in response to the uneven PAR
   interception and resource availability in branches and flowers with
   contrasting orientation.},

Title = {Intraspecific facial bite marks in tyrannosaurids provide insight into
   sexual maturity and evolution of bird-like intersexual display},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Intraspecific aggression, or agonism, is a widespread intrasexual
   selective behavior important to understanding animal behavioral ecology
   and reproductive systems. Such behavior can be studied either by direct
   observation or inferred from wound/scar frequency in extant species but
   is difficult to document in extinct taxa, limiting understanding of its
   evolution. Among extant archosaurs, crocodylians display extensive
   intrasexual aggression, whereas birds show extreme visual/vocal
   intersexual display. The evolutionary origin of this behavioral
   divergence, and pattern in non-avian dinosaurs, is unknown. Here we
   document the morphology, frequency, and ontogeny of intraspecific facial
   bite lesions (324 lesions) in a large sample of tyrannosaurids (202
   specimens, 528 elements) to infer patterns of intraspecific aggression
   in non-avian theropods. Facial scars are consistent in position and
   orientation across tyrannosaurid species, suggesting bites were
   inflicted due to repeated/postured behavior. Facial scars are absent in
   young tyrannosaurids, first appear in immature animals (similar to 50\%
   adult skull length), are present in similar to 60\% of the adult-sized
   specimens, and show aggressor:victim size isometry. The ontogenetic
   distribution of bite scars suggests agonistic behavior is associated
   with the onset of sexual maturity, and scar presence in approximately
   half the specimens may relate to a sexual pattern. Considered in a
   phylogenetic context, intraspecific bite marks are consistent and widely
   distributed in fossil and extant crocodyliforms and non-maniraptoriform
   theropods, suggesting a potential plesiomorphic behavior in archosaurs.
   Their absence in maniraptoriform theropods, including birds, may reflect
   a transition from honey cranial ornamentation and crocodylian-like
   intrasexual aggression to avian-like intersexual display with the
   evolution of pennaceous feathers.},

   investigated the mycorrhizal fungi association and nutritional mode of
   Cheirostylis liukiuensis, which is suspected to be a partial
   mycoheterotrophic plant, due to its characteristic reduced underground
   organs, low-light growth environment, and some fully mycoheterotrophic
   species in the phylogenetically related genera. Molecular analysis of
   the dominant mycobiont and stable isotope analysis suggested that C.
   liukiuensis is a partial mycoheterotrophic plant predominantly associate
   with non-ectomycorrhizal Ceratobasidiaceae fungi. As examples of partial
   mycoheterotrophic orchids exploiting non-ectomycorrhizal rhizoctonia are
   still limited, this study provides valuable information on the
   nutritional modes of green orchids.},

Abstract = {Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode model for the developmental
   genetics of morphological polyphenism, especially at the level of
   individual cells. Morphological polyphenism in this species includes an
   evolutionary novelty, moveable teeth, which have enabled predatory
   feeding in this species and others in its family (Diplogastridae). From
   transmission electron micrographs of serial thin sections through an
   adult hermaphrodite of P. pacificus, we three-dimensionally
   reconstructed all epithelial and myoepithelial cells and syncytia,
   corresponding to 74 nuclei, of its face, mouth, and pharynx. We found
   that the epithelia that produce the predatory morphology of P. pacificus
   are identical to Caenorhabditis elegans in the number of cell classes
   and nuclei. However, differences in cell form, spatial relationships,
   and nucleus position correlate with gross morphological differences from
   C. elegans and outgroups. Moreover, we identified fine-structural
   features, especially in the anteriormost pharyngeal muscles, that
   underlie the conspicuous, left-right asymmetry that characterizes the P.
   pacificus feeding apparatus. Our reconstruction provides an anatomical
   map for studying the genetics of polyphenism, feeding behavior, and the
   development of novel form in a satellite model to C. elegans.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary events may impact the geological carbon cycle via transient
   imbalances in silicate weathering, and such events have been implicated
   as causes of glaciations, mass extinctions, and oceanic anoxia. However,
   suggested evolutionary causes often substantially predate the
   environmental effects to which they are linked-problematic when carbon
   cycle perturbations must be resolved in less than a million years to
   maintain Earth's habitability. What is more, the geochemical signatures
   of such perturbations are recorded as they occur in widely distributed
   marine sedimentary rocks that have been densely sampled for important
   intervals in Earth history, whereas the fossil record-particularly on
   land-is governed by the availability of sedimentary basins that are
   patchy in both space and time, necessitating lags between the
   origination of an evolutionary lineage and its earliest occurrence in
   the fossil record. Here, we present a simple model of the impact of
   preservational filtering on sampling to show that an evolutionary event
   that causes an environmental perturbation via weathering imbalance
   should not appear earlier in the rock record than the perturbation
   itself and, if anything, should appear later rather than simultaneously.
   The Devonian Hangenberg glaciation provides an example of how
   evolutionary events might be more fruitfully considered as potential
   causes of environmental perturbations. Just as the last samplings of
   species lost in mass extinction are expected to come before the true
   environmental event, first appearance should be expected to postdate the
   geological expression of a lineage's environmental impact with important
   implications for our reading of Earth history.},

Title = {The chondrichthyan fossil record of the Florida Platform
   (Eocene-Pleistocene)},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {622-654},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As of September 2019, the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) had
   a curated collection of 117,449 chondrichthyan specimens from Florida,
   spanning the Eocene through the Pleistocene. Herein, I evaluate the
   completeness of the chondrichthyan fossil record from Florida based on
   the FLMNH collection, while analyzing patterns in taxonomic and
   ecomorphological diversity. At least 70 chondrichthyan taxa were
   recognized, representing 10 orders, 26 families, and 42 genera; of
   which, 20 taxa represent first occurrences from Florida. A sample of
   107,698 specimens was organized into 12 time bins to analyze taxonomic
   and ecomorphological diversity, with an expectation that diversity
   patterns would correspond with global climate events (e.g., the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition and the middle Miocene climatic optimum).
   However, diversity patterns were obscured by pervasive sampling bias,
   attributable to variable collection methods, research prioritizations,
   and regional lithologic controls. Sampling is particularly poor for
   smaller specimens and older geologic units (e.g., the Paleogene).
   Despite incomplete sampling of the Florida chondrichthyan fossil record,
   there was an apparent turnover along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal
   Plains from a lamniform- to carcharhiniform-dominated chondrichthyan
   fauna that occurred during the Eocene. This turnover corresponded with
   the extinction of many lamniform taxa with grasping-dominated dentition
   types (e.g., Brachycarcharias, Jaekelotodus, and Macrorhizodus).
   Selachian taxa that survived the late Eocene extinctions were
   predominantly represented by cutting-dominant dentition types. As
   cutting aids in the dismemberment of prey, this may reflect a
   macroevolutionary trend toward active predation and scavenging on larger
   prey, such as marine mammals, teleost fish, and other sharks.},

Title = {Applying the Prigogine view of dissipative systems to the major
   transitions in evolution},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {711-728},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ilya Prigogine's trinomial concept is, he argued, applicable to many
   complex dissipative systems, from physics to biology and even to social
   systems. For Prigogine, this trinomial-functions, structure,
   fluctuations-was intended to capture the feedback-rich relations between
   upper and lower levels in these systems. The main novelty of his vision
   was his view of causation, in which the causal arrow runs downward from
   dissipative structures to their components or functions. Following this
   insight, some physicists and biophysicists are beginning to apply terms
   formerly used mainly in biology, such as evolution, adaptation,
   learning, and life-like behavior, to physical and chemical
   nonequilibrium systems. Here, instead, we apply Prigogine's view to
   biology, in particular to evolution, and especially the major
   transitions in evolution (MTE), arguing that at least the hierarchical
   transitions-the transitions in individuality-follow a trajectory
   anticipated by the trinomial. In this trajectory, formerly free-living
   organisms are transformed into ``functions{''} within a larger organic
   ``structure.{''} The Prigogine view also predicts that, consistent with
   available data, the increase in number of hierarchical levels in
   organisms should accelerate over time. Finally, it predicts that, on
   geological timescales, ecosystems and Gaia in particular will tend to
   ``de-Darwinize{''} or ``machinify{''} their component organisms.},

Title = {Developmental change during a speciation event: evidence from planktic
   foraminifera},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Studies in extant populations have shown that plasticity in
   developmental trajectories can contribute to the origin of novel traits
   and species divergence via the expression of previously cryptic
   variation in response to environmental change. Finding evidence for
   plasticity-led evolution in the fossil record remains challenging due to
   the poor preservation of developmental stages in many organisms.
   Planktic foraminifera are ideally suited for addressing this knowledge
   gap, because adult organisms in species in which development has been
   studied retain information about all the ontogenetic stages they have
   undergone. Here we map changes in the developmental trajectories of 68
   specimens in the Globorotalia plesiotumida-tumida lineage of planktic
   foraminifera from the late Miocene until Recent using high-resolution
   computer tomography techniques. Our unique dataset shows that the
   transition from the ancestral G. plesiotumida to the descendant G.
   tumida is preceded by an increased variability in total cumulative
   volume-an important indicator of reproductive success in this taxon. We
   also find that the transition interval is marked by a distinct shift in
   developmental trajectory, which supports a rapid lineage division rather
   than gradual change. We suggest that high levels of
   plasticity-particularly in the early stages of development-have
   contributed to divergence in the ancestral morphology when subjected to
   a global cooling trend in the late Miocene. The large variation in
   developmental trajectories that we uncover within our samples emphasizes
   the need for high-throughput approaches in studies of ontogenetic change
   in the fossil record.},

Title = {The role of heterotopy and heterochrony during morphological
   diversification of otocephalan epibranchial organs},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {79-91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Epibranchial organs (EBOs), found in at least five of the eight
   otomorphan families, are used to aggregate small prey inside the
   buccopharyngeal cavity and range in morphological complexity from a
   singular, small slit on the pharyngeal roof to several, elongated soft
   tissue tubes. Despite broad phylogenetic representation, little is known
   about the origin, development, or evolution of EBOs. We hypothesize that
   both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of
   EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a
   foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy,
   a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can
   have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received
   relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental
   mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan
   fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa
   mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus
   (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys
   molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described.
   Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we
   illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are
   responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan
   EBOs. Importantly, we also identify conserved developmental patterns
   that further our understanding of how EBOs may have first originated and
   evolved across actinopterygian fishes.},

Title = {Rivers as a potential dispersing agent of the invasive tree Acacia
   dealbata},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Background The silver wattle Acacia dealbata is a fast-growing tree from
   Australia that has become naturalised in different regions of the world,
   attaining invasive status in most of them. In Chile, A. dealbata reaches
   large abundances along banks and floodplains of invaded fluvial systems,
   suggesting that rivers may act as a vector for seed dispersal. As
   hydrochory has not been documented previously in this species, the aim
   of this study is to evaluate the potential for water dispersal of seeds
   of this invasive tree along rivers. Methods Seed samples from rivers
   were collected at three sites along two A. dealbata-invaded rivers
   within the Cachapoal basin, central Chile. Number of seeds collected was
   contrasted versus hydraulic and local conditions with RDA. Seed buoyancy
   and sedimentation velocity were determined and compared between sites
   with an ANCOVA. Finally, the probability of seed germination after long
   periods of immersion in water was assessed, simulating transport
   conditions in the flow. Germination results were tested with a GLM.
   Results Results indicate that increasing abundance of A. dealbata seeds
   in the flow is related to the level of turbulence of the flow. Seeds
   display high floatability but their sedimentation velocity is high when
   they do sink. Finally, silver wattle seeds can germinate after long
   periods (many weeks) of immersion in water; however, their probability
   of germination depends to a large extent on whether seeds are scarified
   or not. Conclusions Based on the evidence collected, we suggest that the
   seeds of A. dealbata have the necessary traits to be dispersed by
   rivers, this being the first research testing this hypothesis. The
   success of hydrochory of A. dealbata would depend on river flow
   turbulence, and whether there are natural mechanisms for scarifying the
   seeds either before or during transport. The proposed methodology can be
   used to assess river hydrochory for any tree species.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Lachesillidae is one of the largest families of bark lice and includes
   more than 420 described species, in 26 genera and three subfamilies.
   This family belongs in the suborder Psocomorpha, infraorder
   Homilopsocidea. The classification of Lachesillidae is based on male and
   female genital morphologies, but questions remain regarding the
   monophyly of the family and some of its genera. Here, we used whole
   genome and transcriptome data to generate a 2060 orthologous gene data
   matrix of 2,438,763 aligned bp and used these data to reconstruct the
   phylogenetic relationships of species of Lachesillidae and relatives.
   Taxon sampling included 24 species from Lachesillidae and 23 additional
   species belonging to related families from the infraorders
   Homilopsocidea and Caeciliusetae. Phylogenetic relationships
   reconstructed with maximum likelihood and coalescent-based analyses
   indicated paraphyly of Lachesillidae, and monophyly of the tribe
   Graphocaeciliini and the genus Lachesilla were also never recovered.
   Instability was observed in the position of Eolachesilla chilensis,
   which was recovered either as sister to Elipsocidae or to Mesopsocidae
   species, so we cannot conclusively determine the position of this genus
   within the Homilopsocidea. Given our results, a reclassification is
   necessary, but more taxon sampling of other species in Mesopsocidae and
   Peripsocidae would be useful to add to a tree in future before proposing
   a new classification.},

Title = {Nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA as a potential problem for

Abstract = {The use of mitochondrial markers for taxonomic identification and
   biodiversity monitoring is not without risks or limitations. Most
   importantly, the natural transfer of DNA from the mitochondria to the
   nucleus generates nonfunctional nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA
   (NUMTs). Their abundance and size vary significantly among taxa, and
   NUMTs have been reported to complicate molecular studies based on
   mitochondrial markers in several insect orders, most prominently in
   Orthoptera. The significance of this phenomenon in Odonata has not yet
   been properly addressed. Here, we present a complete mitochondrial
   genome and a draft nuclear genome of Leucorrhinia albifrons (Odonata:
   Libellulidae), as well as NUMT and cox1 sequences from the related
   species Leucorrhinia dubia. We document the presence of NUMTs in the L.
   albifrons nuclear genome and in nuclear genomes of two other Odonata
   species available in public databases. Our results show that NUMTs can
   have a serious impact on barcoding, phylogenetic, population and
   phylogeographic studies of Odonata, especially when the barcode is
   located in the cox1 gene, the most frequently used molecular marker for
   Odonata. We suggest that nad1 should be used alone or in combination
   with cox1 to minimize unintended confusion with NUMTs. Finally, we
   present a mitophylogenomic analysis of Odonata and document several
   cases of misidentified mitochondrial genomes belonging to species
   different from those indicated in public databases. In conclusion, our
   findings represent an important step for future metabarcoding studies of
   Odonata based on mitochondrial DNA markers.},

Abstract = {We apply integrative taxonomy to solve a historical taxonomic impasse in
   a flat wasp group (Hymenoptera, Bethylidae). The phylogeny of Epyrinae
   is inferred with parsimony analyses under equal and implied weights,
   maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference using the nuclear markers 18S
   and 28S, the mitochondrial genes 16S, cytochrome oxidase subunit I and
   cytochrome B and 232 morphological characters. This is the first
   phylogenetic study to examine all 42 epyrine genera, including junior
   synonyms and extinct taxa, applying a combined molecular and
   morphological approach. This study considered 186 terminal taxa with 166
   representing the ingroup taxa and 20 outgroup taxa. All resulting trees
   of the combined analyses recovered Anisepyris Kieffer, Aspidepyris
   Evans, Bakeriella Kieffer, Disepyris Kieffer, Laelius Ashmead and
   Trachepyris Kieffer as monophyletic; Chlorepyris Kieffer, Epyris
   Westwood, Formosiepyris Terayama and Holepyris Kieffer are
   non-monophyletic. Calyozina Enderlein is recovered as an independent
   lineage in implied weights, Bayesian and maximum likelihood topologies.
   Here, we describe three new genera and revalidate six genera, five of
   them junior synonyms of Epyris and one of Holepyris. In addition, we
   analysed the presence/absence of a sulcus between the
   mesoscuto-scutellar foveae and the shape of mesoscuto-scutellar foveae
   as the most important taxonomic characters for Epyrinae using ancestral
   state reconstruction. Finally, we provide a checklist of all species of
   Epyrinae, compiled via direct observation of the type, illustrations, or
   literature and an updated and illustrated taxonomic key for all epyrine
   genera.},

Title = {Phylogeny and phylogeography of Diestramima cave crickets (Orthoptera:

Abstract = {Cave crickets (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae) are an understudied family
   with poor dispersal abilities and broad distributions, which makes them
   ideal for investigations of historical biogeography. Within
   Rhaphidophoridae, Diestramima is the largest genus of the tribe
   Diestramimini, and most species are endemic to China. It was divided
   into three subgenera based only on morphological characteristics, and no
   molecular evidence has been previously reported. Here, we reconstruct
   the phylogeny and phylogeography of Diestramima based on three
   mitochondrial (COI, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear fragments
   (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA). A total of 114 samples representing 28
   morphological species were sampled from China. Molecular phylogenies
   were reconstructed using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood and
   four approaches (ABGD, jMOTU, GMYC and bPTP) were employed to delimit
   species. Phylogenetic analyses highly supported the monophyly of
   Diestramima, but did not support the classification system consisting of
   three subgenera. Species delimitation methods suggested 28 species,
   among which six new species were described: Diestramima furcata Zhu \&
   Shi sp. n., Diestramima spinata Zhu \& Shi sp. n., Diestramima
   qionglaiensis Zhu \& Shi sp. n., Diestramima taiwanensis Zhu \& Shi sp.
   n., Diestramima longifolia Zhu \& Shi sp. n., Diestramima sichuanensis
   Zhu \& Shi sp. n. Divergence time estimation and reconstruction of
   ancestral areas indicated that Diestramima may have originated from
   Southern Yunnan at 17.72 Ma (95\% highest probability density:
   14.71-21.05 Ma) in the early Miocene. The initial divergence within the
   genus was likely to be correlated with geographical isolation. Most
   speciation events have occurred since the Pliocene, possibly driven by
   multiple dispersal and vicariance events and influenced by the uplift of
   the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau and climate change. ZooBank URL: . . . . .

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Rare or endangered species largely contributing to global biodiversity
   are essential components of ecosystems. Because genetic diversity
   depends not only on apparent population size but also demographic
   processes, the conservation priority of endangered species based on
   population genetics needs to be assessed by comparison with common
   congeners and demographic events. In this study, we performed population
   genetic analysis for Gentiana yakushimensis Makino, a rare and
   endangered plant species with an isolated distribution on Yakushima
   Island, Japan. We performed comparison of genetic diversity with the
   congener (Gentiana triflora Pall. var. japonica {[}Kusn.] H.Hara),
   demographic inference, and bottleneck test based on genome-wide single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. The result was that G. yakushimensis had an
   extremely low genetic diversity level and a high inbreeding coefficient
   level compared with those of the congener. The population of G.
   yakushimensis was estimated to experience an expansion during the Last
   Glacial Maximum and a recent bottleneck by the demographic inference and
   the bottleneck test. Therefore, the low level of genetic diversity of
   this species might have resulted from the impact of the recent
   bottleneck and the long-term maintenance of a small population size. Due
   to the long lifespan of the genus Gentiana, the current level of genetic
   diversity probably does not reflect a large part of recent demographic
   events, which requires long-term monitoring of changes in genetic
   diversity to identify the time lag between the reduction in apparent
   population size and genetic diversity as a future outlook.},

Title = {First record of potential bird pollination in the holoparasitic genus
   Orobanche L.},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Pollinators play an important role in the reproduction of zoophilous
   plants. A shift in pollinators has often been observed for oceanic
   island plants, probably because of the differences in fauna. In this
   study, we obtained data on pollinator shifts from insects to birds in
   Orobanche boninsimae (Orobanchaceae), a holoparasitic plant species
   endemic to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, oceanic islands in the
   Pacific. We observed pollination and measured seed viability in O.
   boninsimae and its continental sister species O. coerulescens. We found
   that two passerine birds, the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus)
   and bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis squameiceps), visited the flowers and
   sucked the nectar of O. boninsimae, while only insects visited those of
   O. coerulescens. Viable seeds were produced under pollinator-excluded
   treatments in the two Orobanche species, indicating that the seeds were
   produced by automatic self-pollination and/or apomixis. These results
   suggest that O. boninsimae may be pollinated by birds and can produce
   seeds by automatic self-pollination/apomixis. This is the first record
   of visitation of the genus Orobanche by birds. Studies of pollination
   systems in native plants on the Bonin Islands are few compared to those
   on other oceanic islands, and O. boninsimae may provide a valuable
   example of pollinator shifts in the Bonin Islands.},

Title = {Effects of the egg incubation environment on turtle carapace development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-169},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developing organisms are often exposed to fluctuating environments that
   destabilize tissue-scale processes and induce abnormal phenotypes. This
   might be common in species that lay eggs in the external environment and
   with little parental care, such as many reptiles. In turtles,
   morphological development has provided striking examples of abnormal
   phenotypic patterns, though the influence of the environment remains
   unclear. To this end, we compared fluctuating asymmetry, as a proxy for
   developmental instability, in turtle hatchlings incubated in controlled
   laboratory and unstable natural conditions. Wild and laboratory
   hatchlings featured similar proportions of supernumerary scales (scutes)
   on the dorsal shell (carapace). Such abnormal scutes likely elevated
   shape asymmetry, which was highest in natural nests. Moreover, we tested
   the hypothesis that hot and dry environments cause abnormal scute
   formation by subjecting eggs to a range of hydric and thermal laboratory
   incubation regimes. Shape asymmetry was similar in hatchlings incubated
   at five constant temperatures (26-30 degrees C). A hot (30 degrees C)
   and severely Dry substrate yielded smaller hatchlings but scutes were
   not overtly affected. Our study suggests that changing nest environments
   contribute to fluctuating asymmetry in egg-laying reptiles, while
   clarifying the conditions at which turtle shell development remains
   buffered from the external environment.},

Title = {The effects of inbreeding depression and pollinator visitation on the

Abstract = {The evolutionary transition from outcrossing in heterostylous morphs to
   selfing in homostylous morphs has occurred in many plant lineages.
   Homostylous variants with a low degree of herkogamy may increase the
   reproductive advantage of autonomous self-pollination when there is
   little inbreeding depression and/or low pollinator visitation. Oxalis
   corniculata, a self-compatible perennial herb derived from a tristylous
   ancestor, is reported to have two floral morphs. Homostyled plants are
   broadly distributed in Japan, whereas long-styled plants are reported to
   occur only in coastal areas. We examined the hypothesis that a
   reproductive advantage in avoiding inbreeding depression and/or frequent
   pollinator visits enables long-styled plants to live in some areas.
   Studies on floral variation revealed that the degree of herkogamy varied
   widely and continuously within and among populations. Homostyled and
   long-styled morphs were functionally defined based on the ability of
   autonomous self-pollination. Homostyled plants were widely distributed,
   whereas long-styled plants were found in and around the two coastal
   populations and relatively inland populations. Pollination experiments
   provided no evidence of inbreeding depression in either homostyled or
   long-styled plants. Pollinator visitation frequency was higher in the
   two coastal populations than in the other populations. Thus,
   reproductive disadvantage in long-styled plants lacking autonomous
   self-pollination has reduced in the two coastal populations, and
   long-styled plants may be maintained due to a competitive advantage of
   large seed size. In contrast, we recorded no comparable frequencies of
   pollinator visitation in other populations containing long-styled
   plants, indicating that there are other factors contributing to the
   maintenance of long-styled plants in these areas.},

Title = {Floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of Justicia
   betonica L. (Acanthaceae): An assessment of its low reproductive success
   in West Bengal, India},

Abstract = {Besides its importance as an ornamental plant, Justicia betonica L. is
   also used as a medicinal plant for the treatment of several human
   disorders. However, the population size and abundance of the plant
   species are very low in Indian states, including West Bengal. The
   breeding system and pollination ecology of J. betonica are still
   unclear. Therefore, some reproductive aspects were investigated in order
   to provide important information for the sustainability of the species.
   The flowering duration spanned from December to May, with its peak in
   February-March. Flower opening time was much earlier (5.00-8.00 a.m.) on
   a hot day (in April-May) than on a cold day (10.00 a.m.-12.00 p.m. in
   December-January). The time of anther dehiscence coincided with the
   flower opening time; however, the stigma became receptive later. The
   plant species is self-compatible but dependent on pollinators for fruit
   and seed sets. Members of different insect groups like ants, bees,
   butterflies, flies, moths and wasps visit the flowers. Among them,
   Allorhynchium metallicum and Halictus acrocephalus are the primary
   pollinators (based on the ``relative pollinator service{''}). The plant
   species showed a significant pollination deficit (coefficient of
   pollination deficit {[}D] = 0.32) in the open condition. Larvae of the
   florivorous moth Gatesclarkeana erotias significantly reduced
   reproductive success by eating their floral parts, ovules and immature
   seeds. In conclusion, combining the pollination deficit and the feeding
   activity of phytophagous insects (moth larvae) may reduce the
   reproductive fitness of J. betonica in the study regions.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to local pollination regimes and secondary contact of
   allopatrically differentiated populations with respect to pollination
   ecology may result in geographical variation in floral traits. We
   examined the contributions of these two processes in Isodon shikokianus,
   which showed remarkable geographical variation in corolla tube length in
   western Japan. Corolla tube length varied among 17 study populations
   located within a relatively narrow area, and covaried with altitude and
   distribution of two bumblebee pollinators with different tongue lengths:
   the longer corolla was found at lower altitudes where the long-tongued
   pollinator was more abundant, and vice versa. Additionally, bumblebee
   species preferentially visited flowers that fit their tongue lengths.
   Population genetic analysis based on 11 microsatellite loci revealed
   that populations with long and short corolla tubes constituted
   genetically distinct groups. Migration rates were low between the
   groups, but high within each group. These results indicate that two
   genetically differentiated groups made secondary contact and hybridized,
   and gene flow between the groups was limited. Thus, the geographical
   variation in corolla tube length in I. shikokianus may be a result of
   past allopatric differentiation and subsequent secondary contact of
   populations with different corolla tube lengths. The variation in
   corolla tube length within a narrow area may be maintained by selection
   owing to the altitudinally structured pollinator assemblages.
   Altitudinal differences in relative abundance of two pollinators and
   their assortative visitation with respect to corolla tube length may
   contribute to reproductive isolation between the two groups.},

Title = {Productivity correlates positively with mammalian diversity

Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},

Volume = {52},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mammals can influence ecosystem functioning through essential ecological
   processes. In patchy landscapes, mammalian diversity can be correlated
   with ecosystem productivity through its effect on resource availability.
   However, mammals comprise species with contrasting habitat use and
   requirements, and it is unknown whether the diversity-productivity
   relationship changes as a function of the mammal species' traits. We use
   meta-analytical techniques to quantify the effect and assess whether
   mammal species richness and abundance correlates positively with
   productivity. Further, we assess whether the diversity-productivity
   relationship is influenced by the species' body mass (<1 kg: small, and
   >1 kg: large, and mixed small and large), the vertical strata explored
   by the species (terrestrial, arboreal, and mixed terrestrial and
   arboreal species), and the species' feeding guild (herbivore, omnivore,
   insectivore, and mixed feeding guilds). In total, 53 studies fitted the
   eligibility criteria worldwide, comprising 285 different effect sizes
   representing the magnitude of the mammal diversity-productivity
   relationship in six biogeographical realms. Ecosystem productivity was
   quantified with various surrogate variables, such as soil nutrients,
   annual rainfall, above-ground production, evapotranspiration, net
   primary production, plant cover, and elevation. The relationships
   between productivity measures and both mammal species richness and
   abundance were significant and positive. Mammal diversity correlated
   positively with ecosystem productivity, for mammal species differing in
   body mass, the vertical strata explored by species (except arboreal
   mammals), and feeding guilds (except insectivorous mammals). Overall,
   this result supports the view that diversity in the entire mammal
   community is positively related to increasing productivity. Sites with
   greater ecosystem productivity are usually associated with more
   resources and higher ecosystem carrying capacity, which provide greater
   resilience to human disturbance than less productive sites. Thus,
   quantifying productivity can help researchers to identify critical areas
   for restoration and to propose effective guidelines for mammal
   conservation.},

Title = {16S rRNA gene sequences of Candidatus Methylumidiphilus
   (Methylococcales), a putative methanotrophic genus in lakes and ponds},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {25-30},
Abstract = {A putative novel methanotrophic genus, Candidatus Methylumidiphilus
   (Methylococcales), was recently shown to be ubiquitous and one of the
   most abundant methanotrophic genera in water columns of
   oxygen-stratified lakes and ponds in boreal and subarctic areas.
   However, it has probably escaped detection in many previous studies that
   used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing due to insufficient database
   coverage, as previously analysed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
   affiliated with Ca. Methylumidiphilus do not contain 16S rRNA genes.
   Therefore, we screened MAGs affiliated with the genus for their 16S rRNA
   gene sequences in a recently published lake and pond MAG data set. Among
   66 MAGs classified as Ca. Methylumidiphilus (with completeness over 40\%
   and contamination less than 5 \%) originating from lakes in Finland,
   Sweden and Switzerland as well as from ponds in Canada, we found 5 MAGs,
   each containing one 1532 bp sequence spanning the V1-V9 regions of the
   16S rRNA gene. After removal of sequence redundancy, this resulted in 2
   unique 16S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences represented 2 different
   putative species: Ca. Methylumidiphilus alinenensis (GenBank accession
   OK236221) and another unnamed species of Ca. Methylumidiphilus (GenBank
   accession OK236220). We suggest that including these 2 sequences in
   reference databases will enhance 16S rRNA gene-based detection of
   members of this genus from environmental samples.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {19-24},
Abstract = {The pteropod (pelagic snail) Limacina helicina antarctica is a dominant
   grazer along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and plays an
   important role in regional food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling.
   For the first time, we examined the gut microbiome and feeding ecology
   of L. h. antarctica based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences of gut
   contents in the WAP during austral summer. Eukaryotic gut contents of L.
   h. antarctica indicate that this species predominantly feeds on diatoms
   and dinoflagellates, supplementing its diet with ciliates and
   foraminifera. Mollicutes bacteria were a consistent component of the gut
   microbiome. Determining the gut microbiome and feeding ecology of L. h.
   antarctica aids in identifying the underlying mechanisms controlling
   pteropod abundance and distribution in a region of rapid environmental
   change.},

Abstract = {Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle) is a species that congregates in
   communal roosting sites during the non-breeding periods of its life
   cycle. Wildlife agencies are directed to protect roosts, but their
   nocturnal usage and remote locations make them challenging to identify
   and monitor. We remotely identified and ground-truthed roost sites using
   satellite telemetry data. We delineated 13 confirmed roosts and another
   34 suspected roosts. Volunteers observed 12 roosts with ground surveys
   and confirmed 92\% were in use by eagles during their first observation.
   These results suggest use of eagle-tracking data to remotely identify
   communal roosts is a promising tool for finding and protecting eagle
   roosting habitat. This method can be complemented with volunteer surveys
   to confirm ongoing roost use.},

Title = {Woody Plant Communities after 40 Years of Pollution Control and
   Restoration in Smelter-denuded Landscapes},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-96},
Abstract = {Restoration of degraded ecosystems requires assessing the status of the
   recovery and identifying key factors limiting the recovery. Nearly 4
   decades of the reduction in smelter emissions, soil amelioration, and
   planting of similar to 10 million trees and shrubs have led to extensive
   revegetation of emission-denuded landscapes in the Sudbury area, ON,
   Canada. To evaluate the state of recovery and identify factors affecting
   it, we surveyed woody plants and environmental correlates (soil pH, soil
   nutrient content, and soil metal content) along gradients of historical
   smelting impacts. Species richness declined from reference sites to
   high-impact sites, with impact sites having 23-33\% fewer species
   compared to reference sites. Species composition varied along gradients
   of historical smelting impacts, with the difference attributable to low
   abundances or absences of one third of the 43 species found in the
   reference sites. Species richness and composition were associated with
   soil toxicity (as measured by metal content and pH) but not soil
   nutrients. However, the negative relationships between soil toxicity and
   plant community were attributable to the mediation effect of canopy
   cover, rather than the direct effect of soil toxicity. Sixty three
   percent of species that were uncommon or absent in impact sites (Abies
   balsamea {[}Balsam Fir], Acer pensvlvanicum {[}Striped Maple], Acer
   spicatum {[}Mountain Maple], Betula alleghaniensis {[}Swamp Birch],
   Fraxinus nigra {[}Black Ash], Gaultheria procumbens {[}American
   Wintergreen], Linnaea borealis {[}Twinflower], Lonicera canadensis
   {[}Fly Honeysuckle], Lonicera hirsute {[}Hairy Honeysuckle], and Ostrya
   virginiana {[}American Hophornbeam]) were shade-tolerant and declined
   with declining canopy cover. These species were reported to be absent or
   uncommon in impact sites nearly 4 decades ago. Together, these results
   suggest that woody plant community has undergone limited recovery and
   that the recovery is hampered by poorly developed canopy cover rather
   than direct soil toxicity or nutrient deficiency. Accordingly, strategic
   interventions of canopy cover-mediated processes (e.g., shading and soil
   moisture) is needed to facilitate the recovery of the woody plant
   community in the smelter-denuded landscapes.},

Title = {The impact of protected areas on poverty: evidence from Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the causal relationship between protected
   areas and poverty in Chile from 1982 to 2002. Chile is part of the
   coalition of countries committed to protecting 30\% of the planet by
   2030; a decision that implies increasing the number of protected areas
   in the country. As a result of this decision, grows the national debate
   about the potential impacts of protected areas on the economy and
   society. By estimating the causal effect of protected areas on poverty,
   we aim to contribute to this debate in Chile. We use panel data and a
   quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect. We find that
   establishing a protected area covering at least 17\% of a unit's
   terrestrial area causes a reduction of 0.216 standard deviations in the
   poverty index. This result is not sensitive to arbitrary implementation
   choices. Additionally, we show that the effect is driven by the
   Patagonia region, the part of Chile with the largest amount of new
   protected areas during the time frame of this study. Besides showing the
   benefits of protected areas to society, we hope the findings presented
   here might also be used to attract new investments and financial support
   to protected areas currently underfunded in Chile.},

Title = {Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a
   Patagonian channel used intensely by aquaculture: the influence of a
   geomorphological constriction},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food
   production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms
   through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly
   understood. A better understanding of the relationship between
   zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in
   Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability
   of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the
   Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of
   two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a
   geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture
   farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12
   h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background
   of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial
   dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities
   and in water column variables were identified between the two sections
   of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we
   found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species
   richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between
   sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward
   asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified
   in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time
   periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition
   were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time
   scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the
   asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier
   favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic
   variables between the two sections of the channel.},

Abstract = {Populations of freshwater gastropods are decreasing globally. To
   investigate one aspect of decline, we exposed the benthic dwelling
   hermaphroditic snail Planorbella (= Helisoma) trivolvis (Say) (Marsh
   Rams-horn) to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Marsh Rams-horn is a
   simultaneous hermaphrodite, suggesting that disruption of reproductive
   success is independent of snail interaction and more dependent on
   internal controls. We examined the impact of exposure to PCBs on
   mortality, reproductive success, and tissue hormone concentrations.
   Exposure to Aroclor (R) 1254 in concentrations found in natural habitats
   caused higher mortality and reduced reproductive success. Additionally,
   tissue estrogens were significantly elevated while testosterone remined
   unchanged in PCB-exposed snails. Given the importance of hermaphroditic
   freshwater gastropods in ecosystems, worldwide population decline, and
   ubiquity of PCBs, identifying the impact of exposure informs our ability
   to combat population loss.},

Title = {Reproductive aspects and pollination biology in endoparasitic Pilostyles
   thurberi (Apodanthaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {40-53},

Abstract = {Biotic pollination is typically a mutualism between plants and their
   pollinators, where each partner receives a benefit. However, plants can
   resort to various reproductive strategies to attract pollinators. Within
   angiosperms, a group of plants known as endoparasites is comprised of
   only flowers or inflorescences. These plants exhibit various
   reproductive strategies, such as different sexual systems and
   attractants, and most are dependent on animals for pollination. In the
   endoparasitic plants of the family Apodanthaceae, unisexual flowers are
   predominant, resulting in dependence on pollinators. Pilostyles thurberi
   is characterized by small flowers, but limited information exists about
   its reproductive strategies. This study investigated various
   reproductive aspects of P. thurberi. We described and compared its
   hosts, sexual flower arrangement, floral concentration, rewards, and
   reproductive success in different populations. Furthermore, we
   determined whether the floral display operates as an attractant by
   monitoring pollinators for two years. Our results revealed that P.
   thurberi has unisexual flowers with male, female, and mixed sex
   arrangements. Bees and wasps are the effective pollinators and are
   attracted by the floral display independently of flower sex. This study
   was the first to record the production of small amounts of crystallized
   nectar by the nectary disk of both floral sexes. Moreover, the findings
   were compared with those of other endoparasitic plants, such as
   Cytinaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Rafflesiaceae, and other Apodanthaceae. It
   is necessary to continue studying the plant-pollinator interactions and
   reproductive strategies of parasitic plants such as Apodanthaceae, since
   not much evidence on how they reproduce and survive in the wild exists.},

Title = {First report of Avicennia germinans (Acanthaceae) as a larval host of

Abstract = {Herbivory is considered an important biotic interaction in mangroves.
   Nevertheless, detailed information on specific plant-herbivore
   interactions that might have considerable influence in ecological and
   evolutionary processes is still very poor and fragmented. Herbivory
   damage was quantified during December 2015 in seedlings and trees in
   monospecific stands of Avicennia germinans in Laguna Madre of
   Tamaulipas, Mexico. The use of this mangrove species as a larval host is
   well documented; however, this is the first report for Junonia
   litoralis. These lepidopteran larvae consumed, on average, 10.2\% of the
   leaf area; but herbivory was higher on seedlings (mean 15\%) than on
   trees (mean 2.3\%). These values are comparable to estimations of 10\%
   mean herbivory damage in other field studies. This indicates that
   herbivores cause greater damage in seedlings than in trees. Herbivore
   activity by J. litoralis only occurred in A. germinans and did not
   affect associated herbs or shrubs of other species. The close
   interaction between J. litoralis and A. germinans may have profound
   implications for ecological and evolutionary processes of mangroves and
   enables a better understanding of ecosystem function and its
   conservation. Further studies are needed to investigate such
   interactions and their implications including long-term monitoring of
   interstitial salinity and leaf chemistry at different stages of growth
   and maturity of the host species.},

Title = {Phytosociological study of fringe communities of Sardinia (Italy)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-139},
Abstract = {Question: This study represents the first contribution to the
   description and ecological characterization of fringe communities of
   Sardinia (Italy), and aimed: 1) to describe Sardinian fringe communities
   from a floristic vegetational point ; 2) to provide a syntaxonomic
   scheme, confirming or not the applicability of the most recent
   framework, proposed at the European scale, also in a Mediterranean
   insular context (Sardinia); 3) to verify if there is a correspondence
   among fringe communities and potential natural vegetation in the study
   area. Study area: Sardinia, the second largest island of the
   Mediterranean basin (Italy). Methods: 65 phytosociological plots
   realized using the Braun-Blanquet approach; for each of them,
   bioclimatic indices were derived from the available Bioclimatic map of
   Sardinia; Raunki??r life-forms were considered as species functional
   traits. Furthermore, by using Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) we
   calculated for each relev?? an abundance-weighted mean indicator value.
   Main vegetation types were identified through a Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis (HCA) and NMDS ordination. A permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance was used to test the overall significance in EIVs
   distribution differences among the clusters obtained from HCA. Results:
   we found a total amount of 139 vascular plant species. Hierarchical
   clustering detected the presence of seven interpretable clusters, well
   differentiated in terms of floristic composition, geographic
   distribution, bioclimatic characters and EIVs, and in terms of their
   inclusion in different vegetation series. Conclusions: we describe 5 new
   associations, four of them included in the new alliance Digitalido
   purpureae-Pteridion aquilini (Melampyro-Holcetalia mollis order,
   Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class), clearly differentiated with
   respect to other alliances described from both the eastern and the
   western side of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another new association was referred
   to the Epilobietea angustifolii class (Galio-Alliarietalia order).},

Abstract = {Pulsatilla cernua is an endangered species in Japan and its seeds are
   often stored for long periods. However, the shelf life of these seeds is
   unclear. We conducted germination tests using P. cernua seeds that had
   been stored in a refrigerator at approximately 6 degrees C for up to 31
   years. Germination tests were conducted at 25 degrees C under dark
   conditions. We assessed seed weight, number of germinated seeds,
   seedling development, and time to germination over a 30-day period for
   each collection year. The highest germination rate was from seeds
   collected in the current year (2019; 82.7\%). Germination rates remained
   high in seeds that had been stored for up to 7 years (>46\%). However,
   there was a marked decline in germinability after the eighth year of
   storage and germination was not observed in seeds that had been stored
   for longer than 15 years. Approximately 20\% of current-year seeds and
   seeds that had been stored for up to 6 years developed into seedlings,
   but no seedlings developed from seeds that had been stored for 7 years
   or longer. The germination rate and the time to germination decreased
   and increased, respectively, with storage time. These results show that
   the shelf life of P. cernua seeds in cold storage at 6 degrees C is
   approximately 6 years. To facilitate the ex situ conservation of this
   species, the germinability of stored seeds at lower temperatures and
   under other germination test conditions should be explored in future
   studies.},

Title = {Dormancy and viability of Ferocactus peninsulae (Cactaceae) seeds},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-181},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Knowledge on seed dormancy is crucial for the understanding of plant
   population dynamics, as it controls seed germination and seed bank
   formation. Dormant seeds have high potential to establish in soil seed
   banks, but such information within Cactaceae is scarce, although it is
   essential for conservation programs. The aim of this study was to
   determine if seeds of Ferocactus peninsulae showed any kind of dormancy
   and to test their germination capacity after storage. This was assessed
   with 15 seed sowing experiments done over 4 years with seeds stored
   under room conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C). We demonstrated the
   existence of physiological dormancy in F. peninsulae seeds that is
   broken with an after-ripening period. Germination was low during the
   first 3 months of storage (d = 0.206) but increased after 10 months of
   storage (d = 0.654), and seeds maintained their viability at 48 months
   (d = 0.707). Also, their speed of germination increased with storage
   time. Ferocactus peninsulae seeds are positively photoblastic, and the
   requirement for light for germination persisted over all experiments.
   The results provide crucial information for propagation and conservation
   research and may allow us to infer that F. peninsulae seeds are able to
   form a persistent soil seed bank, as they maintained their viability
   after dormancy is released.},

Title = {The social system of the lava lizard, Microlophus atacamensis: the
   interplay between social structure and social organization},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background Animal social systems can be described through four main
   components: social structure, social organization, mating system, and
   care system. Social structure describes the relationships between
   individuals in a population, while social organization describes the
   group composition, size, and spatiotemporal variation of a population.
   We use the frameworks of social structure and social organization to
   study the social system of Microlophus atacamensis, a lizard found in
   the rocky intertidal zone along the Chilean coast. The area M.
   atacamensis inhabits poses specific challenges stemming from their use
   of two distinct habitat types in the intertidal zone: they forage in the
   cool areas near the water's edge and use large rocks in more inland
   areas for basking and refuge. Methods Our assessment of their social
   system focused on two separate populations: one to characterize social
   structure by means of focal observations and social network analysis,
   and a second to assess social organization via home range and core area
   analyses. Further, we examined the social system in two habitat types
   that comprise the intertidal zone: cobble fields and interspersed large
   rocks. Results Social network analysis revealed an interconnected
   network with a few highly central individuals. Body size influenced the
   outcomes of aggressive interactions, with interactions being more common
   in cobble fields where males had more associates and more repeated
   interactions than females. Spatial analyses revealed that the social
   organization of M. atacamensis is characterized by (1) high home range
   overlap, specifically in the cobble fields and (2) relatively exclusive
   core areas dispersed across both habitat types. Conclusion A social
   system is composed of both cooperative and competitive behaviors. While
   our study focused on competitive interactions, the extent and influence
   of cooperative behaviors is still unclear and merits future research. We
   suggest that M. atacamensis has a variable social system in which
   territoriality on large rocks affects access to stationary resources in
   that habitat (e.g., basking sites and refuges), while competition in the
   cobble fields could lay the foundation for a system of dominance
   relationships controlling access to variable food resources in cobble
   field areas of the intertidal zone.},

Title = {Intraspecific differentiation of Allium canadense var. canadense
   (Amaryllidaceae) across the North American Coastal Plain},

Abstract = {Polyploidy increases genetic variation in plants, leading to adaptations
   allowing expansion into novel habitats and increased genetic
   differentiation among populations isolated by barriers to dispersal.
   Allium canadense var. canadense is a polyploid taxon distributed within
   the North American Coastal Plain (NACP) biodiversity hotspot. It is the
   only one of six varieties in a species complex of wild onions native to
   North America that exhibits bulbils responsible for vegetative
   reproduction, which may lead to low levels of genetic variation within
   populations. Despite its threatened/endangered status in the northeast
   United States and noxious weed listing in Arkansas, USA, little is known
   about intraspecific differentiation among populations which may be
   impacted by riverine barriers or seasonal latitudinal gradients. We used
   sequences of one nuclear (ITS) and two chloroplast (trnL-F and
   rpl32-trnL) DNA regions generated from eight populations in the NACP and
   one population in Kansas, USA to examine genetic diversity and
   population structure of A. canadense var. canadense. A total of 12 ITS
   ribosomal and 10 chloroplast DNA haplotypes were identified.
   Phylogenetic analyses indicated two major lineages which corresponded to
   the genealogical relationships identified in the population structure
   analyses. Significant genetic subdivision among populations was detected
   across all populations by analysis of molecular variance. Overall,
   geographic structuring is apparent among populations of A. canadense
   var. canadense and populations showed moderate levels of gene diversity.
   These findings are indicative of the complex nature of polyploids and
   their contribution to genetic diversity among populations with mating
   systems that might otherwise have no phylogeographic structure.},

Title = {A global review of the conservation threats and status of mustelids},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-424},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The family Mustelidae is the largest among the order Carnivora. While we
   know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of
   information about many mustelids. We first investigated the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
   species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook
   a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of
   identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which
   species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as ``the
   proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are
   impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon{''}. We analysed 1003
   published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication,
   geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and
   subthreats identified. The majority of species (62\%) were classified as
   Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found
   to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The
   species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72\% of
   studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few
   species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the
   tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting,
   fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by
   the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the
   proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The
   nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between
   species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus
   towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of
   threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate
   change must also be central to prevent declines.},

Title = {Phytosociological study of arable weed communities across small scale
   agricultural landscape in Swaziland},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-38},
Abstract = {Aims: Using a multi-criteria evaluation comprised of fidelity, cluster,
   and additive partitioning analyses, this work described the composition
   and diversity of arable weed communities in five agro-ecological regions
   of Swaziland. Spatial scales at which diversity components (a, and y)
   were most relevant in describing weed vegetation were studied. Study
   area: Swaziland. Methods: The data set for analyses was obtained using
   both multi-stage systematic and random sampling of 117 small scale
   farmers' fields. The affinities of 40 weed species identified in the
   study to different zones were determined using phi coefficient of
   association, a statistically defined measure of fidelity. Agglomerative
   hierarchical cluster analysis was based on standardized species ranks
   from a consensus of phi, indicator value index, and relative abundance
   index. The Euclidean distance measure and Ward's method for group
   linkage were used to yield cluster solutions for each region. Species
   diversity was expressed as the proportional contribution to diversity at
   three scale levels, i.e. plot, field, and region, using the hierarchical
   additive partitioning approach. Results: Eighteen species were
   diagnostic to particular regions amongst which only two species appeared
   in two contiguous regions to which they were characteristic. The weed
   vegetation was characterised by three to four clusters with a group of
   taxa co-occurring in the same cluster across the five regions. A major
   part of weed diversity was mainly explained by beta-diversity at
   regional scale (35.0-67.8\%) than between fields (12.0-15.0\%) or
   sampling plots (0.1-2.8\%). Diversity within fields (alpha-diversity)
   was between 5.0 and 8.2\% in the five regions. Conclusion: The nested
   approach adopted where weed species were described and enumerated
   individually, in clusters, and, at different spatial scales could inform
   subsequent work towards diversification and scale of weed management
   approaches or tools in small scale agriculture.},

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The associated species to Senecio glaucus in the newly reclaimed desert
   near to Wadi El-Assiuty of the Eastern Desert at Assiut Governorate,
   Egypt were investigated over two years (2018 and 2019). The allelopathic
   potential of S. glaucus against two crop plants (Triticum aestivum and
   Eruca sativa) was also evaluated. Floristically, 65 species within 59
   genera and 22 families were recorded (21 perennials and 44 annuals).
   Four families Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae captured
   about 54\% of this flora. Therophytes are the predominant life form
   followed by phanerophytes. Chorological analysis revealed that
   cosmopolitan and Saharo-Arabian elements constitute the main bulk of the
   total flora of the studied area. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct
   groups. Stands of group A characterized by the absence of S. glaucus and
   highest species diversity. Stands of group B, C and D included the
   associated species of S. glaucus and characterized by the dominance of
   cosmopolitans, grasses and salt tolerant species. The ordination
   techniques revealed the significant difference between group A and the
   others and showed the strong correlation between its flora with organic
   matter. The other three groups were highly correlated with coarse soil
   texture and total salts. Thirteen species were absent from stands of
   groups B, C and D in which S. glaucus was dominant. Phytochemical
   analysis of S. glaucus showed the prevalence of total phenolics and
   flavonoids in its shoots, while terpenoids were the highest in its
   flowers. All fractions of the plant components completely prevented
   germination of E. sativa seeds but exerted different magnitude of
   inhibition on germination of T. aestivum caryopses (especially with
   MeOH, capitula and shoot extracts). Estimation of phytotoxicity revealed
   that aqueous, ethyl acetate and capitula extracts significantly
   inhibited the germination of wheat caryopses and reduced the elongation
   rates of hypocotyl and epicotyl, and hence the whole length of
   seedlings.},

Title = {Vegetation diversity in East African wetlands: Cocktail algorithms
   supported by a vegetation-plot database},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-219},
Abstract = {Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems for biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem service provisioning, yet threatened by
   degradation and conversion into croplands. Conservation and land use
   management require data on vegetation structure and dynamics. The
   presented work is a response to a lacking consistent classification of
   East African wetland vegetation. Location: Namulonge valley in Uganda
   and Kilombero floodplain in Tanzania. Methods: We sampled 431 4
   m(2)-plots along land use intensity and flooding duration gradients. A
   floristic classification using the cocktail method was performed in a
   two-step approach. We developed definitions for vegetation units, using
   plot observations from the study sites in a first step and revised them
   in a second step by adding data from a vegetation-plot database and
   complied the definitions to an expert system for classification.
   Resulting vegetation units were analyzed regarding their life form
   composition, for which we implemented a classification based on life
   span and growth form. Following a literature review, the identified
   vegetation units were assigned either to existing phytosociological
   associations or proposals. Results: We recognize eight units of marsh
   and reed vegetation (class Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea) and five units of
   weed and pioneer vegetation under semi-aquatic conditions (class
   Oryzetea sativae). Five of these associations were previously described
   in the bibliographic references. The remaining eight are newly described
   in this work. The associations contrast in their life form composition
   with the five Oryzetea sativae associations dominated by obligate
   annuals and the Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea associations dominated by
   either reed plants or lacking a dominating life form. Conclusions: The
   developed expert system enables a comparison of wetland vegetation in
   the East African region and will support vegetation science and informed
   decision making about land use management and conservation. The two-step
   approach of revising a classification developed for single wetlands with
   a database is promising for data-scarce regions.},

Abstract = {Host traits partly determine the abundance and species richness of
   epiphytes in tropical forests. It has been proposed that older trees
   with rough bark and evergreens often house more individuals and more
   epiphytic species than those with thin, smooth, and peeling bark, which
   harbor few epiphytes. We hypothesize (i) that epiphytes are more
   abundant and species-rich in the more shaded forest, which is related to
   bark roughness, and (ii) that epiphytes are distributed in the middle of
   the host, where microenvironmental conditions are more favorable to
   survival. We evaluated abundance, species richness, and vertical
   distribution of epiphytes in two tropical dry forests, according to the
   deciduousness and basal area of the trees. Moreover, we selected the
   most abundant epiphytes to test whether their distribution is related to
   a specific bark type and examine their vertical distribution in two dry
   forests. We distinguished a high abundance and species richness of
   epiphytes in the deciduous forest, although basal area and host species
   richness were higher in the semi-deciduous forest. In both forests, we
   found a positive relationship between epiphyte abundance and basal area.
   Higher abundance of epiphytes was related to the predominance of
   Tillandsia schiedeana, a drought-adapted species, in both forests.
   Unexpectedly, epiphytes abundantly colonized Bursera simaruba, a host
   with peeling bark and a very branched crown, where small individuals of
   T. schiedeana colonized abundantly toward the top of the crown. Our
   results show the importance of the tropical dry forest, particularly, B.
   simaruba, in maintaining epiphyte diversity in terms of T. schiedeana
   colonization.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most severe threats for ecosystems
   worldwide. Lakes can be studied as indicators of climate change. The
   prokaryotic compartment of lakes is affected by climate change, and the
   metabolic processes of prokaryotes could both attenuate or exacerbate
   the negative impacts of climate change on the ecosystem. However, in
   contrast to studies on the impact of global warming on eukaryotes,
   prokaryotes have been rarely studied in the context of climate change.
   In our study, we tested the impact of short-term temperature increases
   on taxonomic and physiological bacterial diversity and their
   relationships. We conducted an experiment with different temperature
   treatments using mesocosms filled with lake water from the same water
   reservoir. We monitored physicochemical parameters for 2 wk and examined
   taxonomic diversity using Illumina next-generation sequencing and
   metabolic diversity using 31 carbon sources by the Biolog EcoPlate (R)
   method. We showed that a continuous increase in water temperature for 14
   d significantly affected the taxonomic structure of bacteria that
   inhabit lake water. Even when the water temperature was within the
   temperate zone of 26 to 29 degrees C, a slight increase in biodiversity
   in the first few days was observed, and after 14 d, the change in
   temperature drastically decreased biodiversity. In the case of
   physiological diversity, the differences were relatively small.
   Similarly, we did not find a statistically significant correlation
   between the taxonomic and physiological diversity of lake bacteria in
   the context of climate change. This may indicate redundancy of aquatic

Title = {Effects of Non-native Shrubs on Caterpillars and Shrubland-Dependent
   Passerines Within Three Transmission Line Rights-of-Way in Southeastern
   New Hampshire},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1-43},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Caterpillars (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera: Symphyta) are a critical food
   that breeding passerines use for raising young and serve as an important
   source of carotenoids that support nestling growth and feather
   pigmentation. When non-native, invasive plants grow abundant enough to
   reduce native plant diversity they can cause a reduction in caterpillar
   abundance. The goal of this study was to determine whether a reduction
   in caterpillars caused by non-native, invasive shrubs affects nestling
   health and/or the reproductive success of a shrubland-dependent
   passerine, Geothlypis trichas trichas (Common Yellowthroat). I first
   quantified caterpillar abundance on the dominant native and nonnative
   shrubs comprising Common Yellowthroat territories in shrubby
   transmission-line rights-of-way and estimated total caterpillar
   abundance in each territory based on the shrub species composition. I
   then determined if differences in shrub species composition and
   caterpillar abundance affected: (1) adult Common Yellowthroat
   reproductive success, (2) nestling Common Yellowthroat diet composition,
   or (3) nestling Common Yellowthroat growth rate, plasma carotenoids, and
   carotenoid-based plumage color. Non-native, invasive shrubs did not
   reduce caterpillar abundance until they comprised >55\% of the shrub
   volume and significantly reduced the diversity and abundance of native
   shrubs in bird territories. Differences in caterpillar abundance among
   sites did not result in differences in Common Yellowthroat productivity,
   but where non-native shrubs comprised >= 55\% of the shrub volume,
   adults increased their frequency of feeding visits to nestlings and fed
   nestlings the greatest proportion of non-caterpillar prey. Daily surveys
   of shru-bland bird presence/absence at study sites indicated that most
   shrubland-dependent bird species were absent where non-native shrubs
   comprised >= 55\% of the shrub cover; such conditions likely equated to
   habitat loss for bird species less able than Common Yellowthroats to
   adapt to low shrub diversity and low caterpillar abundance.},

Title = {Bumble Bee (Bombus spp.) Abundance in New York Highway Roadsides across
   Levels of Roadside Mowing and Road Traffic},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-72},
Abstract = {Bombus spp. (Bumble bees) face population declines, in part due to
   habitat loss. Roadside rights-of-way (ROWs) are potential habitats;
   however, they are highly disturbed due to roadside mowing and on-road
   traffic. We investigated whether these factors are associated with
   variation in abundance of bumble bees in highway roadside ROWs across
   New York State. We used sweep netting and photography along 30 highways
   with different mowing pattern (control, reduced) and traffic level (low,
   medium, high) treatments in 2019 and 2020. Very few bumble bees were
   observed (98\% of n = 916 observations found 0). This result was
   potentially due to insufficient foraging plants or nesting areas.
   Further investigation is needed to understand how highway roadside ROWs
   can be high quality habitat for bumble bees.},

Abstract = {Didynamous stamens are separated into two pairs of different length, and
   the implication of this arrangement has not been well understood. The
   functional advantages of didynamous stamens were investigated in
   Brandisia hancei. Change of stamens during floral aging was recorded;
   the quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains were
   tested; the anther arrangement was manipulated into four types based on
   stamen category and number, and fruit set and number of seeds per fruit
   were measured. Didynamous stamens exhibited staggered anther
   arrangement, and pollen sacs dehisced gradually. There was no difference
   for quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains between the
   two pairs of anthers. Seed production after the removal of one long and
   one short stamen was higher than that of two long or two short stamens.
   Through prolonging pollen presentation and promoting delayed
   self-pollination, staggered arrangement and sequential dehiscence of
   anthers in didynamous stamens facilitate reproductive fitness of B.

Title = {Plant community assemblages and environmental drivers in the mountainous

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {263-274},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is
   influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate,
   topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire
   and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant
   communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and
   determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial
   distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was
   firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and
   refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE
   programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the
   most important environmental variables influencing the spatial
   distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data
   were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid
   databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the
   remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020
   was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in
   nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis
   showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be
   significant at a 95\% confidence level and positively correlated with
   the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but
   negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710,
   p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly
   positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r <
   0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well
   as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance
   in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies
   for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and
   also to monitor vegetation change over time.},

Title = {Nitrate availability modulates induced defenses in Phaeocystis globosa
   against protozoan grazers},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Colony formation by Phaecoystis has been widely considered an induced
   defense mechanism against various grazers and contributes to the
   occurrence of algal blooms in nitrate-enriched waters. However, the
   effects of nitrate availability on these induced defenses against
   protozoan grazers remain unclear. Four P. globosa strains isolated from
   4 off-coast areas of the South China Sea were exposed to grazing cues
   associated with the ciliate Euplotes vannus and the heterotrophic
   dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina under nitrate-sufficient and
   nitrate-deficient conditions to evaluate whether nitrate availability
   modulates the expression and costs of induced defenses. Except for one
   strain exposed to ciliate cues under nitrate-deficient conditions, all
   strains expressed defensive responses to grazing cues. Colony numbers
   consistently increased in the presence of grazing cues regardless of
   nitrate availability, although the amplitude of the increase was greater
   under nitrate-deficient conditions. Negative linear relationships were
   observed between colony numbers and population growth rates for 2
   strains under nitrate-deficient conditions, suggesting increased
   energetic costs of defenses. The other 2 strains that did not exhibit
   negative relationships between colony numbers and growth nevertheless
   exhibited decreased cellular particulate organic carbon, particulate
   organic nitrogen, and chlorophyll a content in addition to smaller
   cellular diameters, suggesting that P. globosa can save energetic costs
   by adjusting physiological processes and cell sizes. These results
   suggest that nitrate availability strongly modulates the expression of
   induced grazing defenses and substantially influences the partitioning
   of cells into colonial or solitary forms in Phaeocystis, thereby also
   modulating their ecological roles in local food webs.},

Title = {Bacterioplankton composition as an indicator of environmental status:
   proof of principle using indicator value analysis of estuarine
   communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Increasing awareness of environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic
   activities highlights the need to determine indicators of environmental
   status that can be routinely assessed at large spatial and temporal
   scales. Microbial communities comprise the greatest share of biological
   diversity on Earth and can rapidly reflect recent environmental changes
   while providing a record of past events. However, they have rarely been
   targeted in the search for ecological indicators of habitat types,
   environmental conditions, or environmental changes. Here, as a proof of
   principle, we analysed the bacterioplankton community composition of 4
   estuaries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, and looked for
   indicators of groups of samples defined using partition techniques,
   according to primary physicochemical variables typically monitored to
   infer water quality. Indicator value analysis (IndVal) was conducted to
   identify indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs; analogous to
   species in other fields of ecology) in each group. These
   bacterioplankton-based indicators exhibited a high capacity to predict
   the group membership of the samples within each estuary and to correctly
   assign the samples to the appropriate estuary in a combined data set,
   employing different machine learning techniques. The indicators were
   composed of OTUs belonging to several bacterial phyla, which responded
   significantly and differentially to the environmental variables used to
   define the groups of samples. Moreover, the predictive values of these
   bacterial indicators were generally higher than those of other
   biological assemblages commonly used for environmental monitoring.
   Therefore, this approach appears to be a promising tool to complement
   existing strategies for monitoring and conservation of aquatic systems
   worldwide.},

Title = {Syntaxonomy and ecology of mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan
   (Middle Asia)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Aims: In this paper we propose the first syntaxonomic classification for
   the mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan with some remarks on
   their environmental variability. Methods: Altogether 120 relev??s were
   sam-pled using the standard, seven-degree cover-abundance scale of
   Braun-Blanquet, in 2015???2021. They were clas-sified by the modified
   TWINSPAN method using the four step interval scale with cutoff levels of
   0\%, 2\%, 5\% and 10\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster
   heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi
   coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) was used to determine the rela-tionship between the sampled plots,
   vegetation units and major gradients in species composition. Results:
   Plant communities known so far as ??hiblyak and including xeric and
   mesophilic shrublands seral or marginal to broad-leaved forests in the
   nemoral zone of the Irano-Turanian region are described herein.
   Numerical analyses of vegetation data allowed distinguishing five
   associations representing the Ranunculo tenuilobi-Cotoneasteri-on
   hissarici alliance. The new associations include: Eremuro
   comosi-Rhuidetum coriariae, Calophacetum gran-diflorae, Fraxinetum
   raibocarpae, Pruno sogdianae-Crataegetum turkestanicae, Aflatunio
   ulmifoliae-Caraga-netum turkestanicae. For the latter association, two
   habitat variants (with Ferula clematidifolia and Malus sieversii) are
   proposed. The main factors determining the species composition of the
   studied vegetation include: elevation, mean annual temperature and sum
   of annual precipitation. Conclusions: The research results herein
   presented fill the gap in knowledge about the shrubland vegetation of
   Tajikistan. Studies in neighbouring coun-tries and a focus on subalpine
   scrubs in dry habitats are needed to complete the classification of
   shrubland vegetation of Middle Asia.},

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Background: A team of 3 scientometrists led by John Ioannidis published
   in 2020 an extensive and updated database (ca. 6.9 million researchers
   in 22 disciplines and 176 sub-disciplines), ordering them according to a
   composite bibliometric index that measures their whole trajectory
   (career-long) impact and their annual impact at year 2019. They reported
   the top 100,000 scientists (1.45\% across all disciplinary fields) or
   the top 2\% of each subfield discipline, thus publishing the ranking of
   ca. 150,000 researchers worldwide.
   Methods and findings: We filtered that information for the disciplinary
   and sub-disciplinary areas corresponding to Ecology and identified a
   total of 14 ecologists with residence in Chile that appear in either of
   those two worldwide rankings. We report their measured productivity as
   both whole trajectory (career-long) and as annual impact at year 2019.
   We attribute their high registered productivity to their training at the
   doctoral level in prestigious foreign universities, their academic
   positions in internationally recognized Chilean universities, and their
   participation in state-funded research centers of scientific excellence.
   Exceptions to the rule are presented.
   Conclusions: The 14 ecologists identified with the scientometric
   algorithm proposed by Ioannidis and coworkers include, but are not
   restricted, to the most cited ecologists in Chile. We put forth possible
   reasons for some puzzling omissions from these rankings.},

Title = {A study of composition and diversity variation of avifauna along with

Abstract = {Background Agroforestry is an integrated land-use system that plays a
   great role in the conservation of landscape biodiversity. The study
   aimed to assess the composition and diversity of avian species along
   with different habitat types of agroforestry in Kibet Town, Southern
   Ethiopia. Methods Four habitat types of agroforestry system which are
   home gardens, live fences, parkland, and eucalyptus woodlot were
   identified. Line transects were used for bird surveys. The Shannon
   diversity index (H `) and species evenness index (E) were used to
   compare diversity among habitat types. A similarity percentages (SIMPER)
   test was carried out to identify the main species and feeding guild that
   typified each habitat type. The overall significance was assessed with
   the ANOSIM test using PAST (version 4.03). Results A total of 50 bird
   species belonging to 28 families and 10 orders were recorded. Order
   Passeriformes (67.3\%) had the highest number of species. Bird community
   composition differed among habitat types. The dissimilarity was mainly
   due to White-browed robin-chat (Cossypha heuglini), Streaky seed-eater
   (Serinus striolatus), Village Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), African
   Paradise-Flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis), and Black-Headed Paradise
   Flycatcher (T. rufiventer). The finding also revealed that insectivore
   was the dominant feeding guild. Conclusions The present study shows
   evidence that more insectivore bird species use different types of
   agroforestry as habitat and foraging sites. So, any concerned bodies who
   have engaged in avian conservation should give special consideration to
   this modified landscape.},

Abstract = {Many insect-pollinated plants use floral scent signals to attract and
   guide the effective pollinators, and temporal patterns of their floral
   scent emission may be tuned to respond to the pollinator's activity and
   pollination status. In the intimate nursery pollination mutualism
   between monoecious Glochidion trees (Phyllanthaceae) and Epicephala
   moths (Gracillariidae), floral scent signals mediate species-specific
   interactions and influence the moth's efficient pollen-collecting and
   pollen-depositing behaviors on male and female flowers, respectively. We
   tested the hypotheses that both sexes of flowers of
   Epicephala-pollinated Glochidion rubrum exhibit a diel pattern of scent
   emission matching the activity period of the nocturnally active
   pollinator, and that female flowers change the chemical signal after
   pollination to reduce further visits and oviposition by the pollinator.
   We investigated the diel change of floral scent emissions during two
   consecutive days and the influence of pollination on the floral scent by
   conducting hand-pollinations in the field. The total scent emission of
   male and female flowers was higher at night than in the day, which would
   be expected from the nocturnal visitations of Epicephala moths. Some
   compounds exhibited a clear nocturnal emission rhythm. Hand-pollination
   experiments revealed that emission of two compounds, nerolidol and
   eugenol, drastically decreased in pollinated flowers, suggesting that
   these compounds may function as key attractants for the pollinator;
   however, the total scent emission of the female flower was not
   influenced by hand-pollination. The pattern of the floral scent emission
   of G. rubrum may be optimized to attract nocturnal pollinators and
   reduce oviposition.},

Abstract = {Planidia are free-living, mobile first-instar larvae that are notable in
   their ability to transition across different larval stages of their
   host, and for completing their development on the host prepupa as
   ectoparasitoids, effectively acting as larval-pupal external
   koinobionts. Chalcidoid taxa with a planidium form a monophyletic group,
   the planidial larva clade (PLC). We conducted a phylogenomic study of
   the PLC using anchored hybrid enrichment data. Phylogenetic analyses
   support the backbone relationship of PLC as: (Eutrichosomatinae,
   ((Philomidinae, Chrysolampinae), (Perilampinae, Eucharitidae))).
   Although excluded from the main analyses, the genus Jambiya, based on
   only 11 loci recovered, was placed as the sister of Chrysolampinae +
   Philomidinae or Perilampinae + Eucharitidae. Our results demonstrate
   that Perilampidae (Philomidinae, Chrysolampinae and Perilampinae) are
   paraphyletic. Divergence dating based on four node calibrations based on
   fossils suggests that the PLC arose approximately 111 Ma and the
   evolution of ant parasitism at least 64 Ma. Host associations, direct
   versus indirect hyperparasitism, ability to attack a host within a
   cocoon, soft versus hard planidial forms and mobility of the planidium
   were explored using a likelihood-based ancestral state reconstruction
   method. A revised higher-level classification of the PLC is proposed,
   with Eutrichosomatinae elevated to Eutrichosomatidae (stat. rev.),
   Chrysolampinae and Philomidinae placed in Chrysolampidae (stat. rev.),
   Perilampidae (stat. rev.) restricted to what was referred to as
   Perilampinae, and Eucharitidae maintained with four subfamilies, with
   Akapalinae (unknown biology) as sister group to the core Eucharitidae,
   all of which are ant parasitoids. Jambiya is treated as an incertae
   sedis taxon within the planidial clade.},

Abstract = {I conducted a survey of individuals of Viola rotundifolia Michx.
   (Roundleaf Yellow Violet) during the spring and summer of 2021 in order
   to determine flowering and fruiting phenologies and to assess the extent
   to which individuals display chasmogamous (open) and cleistogamous
   (closed) flowering and fruiting at Ricketts Glen State Park in
   northeastern Pennsylvania. A total of 171 plants were marked and
   observed weekly. The majority of plants (73\%) displayed chasmogamous
   flowering, with 65\% displaying chasmogamous flowering exclusively.
   Cleistogamous flowering was displayed by 27\% of the plants, with 19\%
   being exclusively cleistogamous. Both conditions were displayed by 8\%
   of the plants, and 8\% remained vegetative. Among the plants assessed,
   20 chasmogamous and 7 cleistogamous capsules were excised and removed,
   presumably by a small mammal or slug.},

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {We examined aspects of the ecology of an isolated population of
   critically imperiled Enneacanthus chaetodon (Blackbanded Sunfish) in the
   only known extant locality in Maryland and made comparisons with an
   abundant and widespread sympatric congener, E. gloriosus (Bluespotted
   Sunfish). For Blackbanded Sunfish, we found population sizes were small,
   with abundance and age structure fluctuating throughout the course of
   the 9 years of observation, very low genetic diversity, and elevated
   levels of inbreeding. Habitat associations revealed a strong association
   of Blackbanded Sunfish with aquatic vegetation. We estimated a lifespan
   of 3-4 years for Blackbanded Sunfish, based on modal decomposition of
   length-frequency histograms. Bluespotted Sunfish exhibited much more
   stable population dynamics, larger population size, and a longer
   lifespan of 4-5 years. Our results indicate isolated Blackbanded Sunfish
   populations exhibit a clear susceptibility to environmental
   stochasticity and are unlikely to persist without intervention. More
   broadly, our results suggest that the long-term persistence of this
   species in much of its range is likely dependent on increasing
   connectivity between existing populations. (re)establishing populations
   in viable localities, maintaining suitable habitat, and reducing

Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In this work, we focused on the functional characterization of
   unicellular eukaryotic assemblages that had previously been
   taxonomically characterized by 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a
   eutrophic coastal site with marked plankton blooms. Biological traits of
   different functional groups were assigned to the retrieved operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). The traits included size, trophic strategy, the
   presence of spines, mucilage production, colony formation, motility,
   spore formation, and potential harmfulness. Functional diversity indices
   were calculated and compared to analogous taxonomic diversity indices,
   indicating a strong positive coupling of richness and dominance and a
   negative coupling of evenness, even at a low taxonomic resolution (at
   the family/genus/species level). Biological trait trade-offs and
   co-occurrences of specific traits were evident during the succession of
   plankton blooms. The trophic strategy dominating in the assemblages
   frequently alternated between autotrophy, mixotrophy, and a few recorded
   cases of parasitism. Given that there was no indication of nutrient
   limitation, we suggest that biotic pressures force marine eukaryotes to
   exploit narrow niches by adopting specific strategies/traits that favour
   their survival. These traits act by increasing resource acquisition
   potential and via predator avoidance. This leads to a unique succession
   of blooms in the system, characterized by adaptations of the bloom taxa
   that are a direct response to the preceding assemblage.},

Title = {Substrate diversity affects carbon utilization rate and threshold
   concentration for uptake by natural bacterioplankton communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {95-108},
Abstract = {Y Persistence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environments
   may in part be explained by high diversity and low concentrations of
   carbon substrates. However, changes in dissolved substrate quality can
   modify aquatic bacterial community composition and rate of carbon
   uptake. The aim of this study was to test if the presence of multiple
   simple substrates affects the turnover of organic carbon. Natural
   bacterial communities were grown in continuous cultures supplied with
   either individual carbon substrates-salicylic acid (SA), tryptophan
   (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr)-or a combination of the 3 substrates.
   Concentrations were tracked using fluorescence spectroscopy, and
   steady-state concentrations of a few nanomolar were reached. Bacterial
   growth efficiency was dependent on which carbon sources were present and
   reached an intermediate level in the combined treatment. The bacterial
   community maintained steady-state concentrations of Trp that were lower
   in the combined treatment than in the individual substrate treatment. In
   addition, steady-state concentrations were reached faster during growth
   on combined carbon substrates, although the maximum utilization rate of
   each individual compound was lower. However, the steady-state
   concentration of total carbon (sum of carbon content of SA, Trp and Tyr)
   was higher in the combined culture than in the individual substrate
   treatments, and seemed to be determined by the carbon substate for which
   the bacteria had the lowest affinity. The results from this study
   indicate that persistence of dissolved organic carbon can in part be
   explained by vast substrate diversity, which raises the threshold
   concentration for utilization by natural bacterial communities.},

Title = {A systematic map of demographic data from elephant populations
   throughout Africa: implications for poaching and population analyses},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The crisis facing Africa's elephant populations is a notorious example
   of ongoing wildlife declines caused by illegal harvesting. Targeted
   conservation interventions require detailed knowledge about changes in
   population sizes and the effect of illegal activities. However,
   accurately quantifying poaching intensity is a difficult task: commonly
   calculated from ranger-based carcass-encounter data, the proportion of
   illegally killed elephants (PIKE) is a function of poaching and
   background mortality. Hence, at constant poaching intensity, PIKE
   decreases with increasing natural mortality and also with hunting,
   management interventions, and other anthropogenically induced deaths.
   Natural mortality is often more difficult to quantify with accuracy than
   mortality due to illegal killing, as elephants that die naturally are
   more likely to be missed than those taken by poachers. In recent
   analyses, constant background mortality rates were assumed. Yet, for
   example climate-driven fluctuations in natural mortality, if not
   quantified and accounted for, may lead to biased estimates of poaching
   intensity. Varying background mortality rates can be accounted for in
   the analysis of PIKE, but this requires near-complete counts of natural
   and management-related deaths and hunting records. Carefully developed
   population models, which simulate population dynamics and demographic
   changes while accounting for variation in environmental conditions and
   management strategies, are alternatives. However, successful calibration
   of such models requires integrating comprehensive demographic data. We
   systematically review the scientific and `grey' literature on African
   elephant demography with the objective of facilitating poaching and
   population analysis possibilities through an inventory of information
   relevant to demography. Our screening of 10900 publications resulted in
   the review of relevant information provided by 431 studies from 420
   study sites throughout Africa. From these, we extracted demographic data
   collected between 1900 and 2017, and collated them in the newly created
   African Elephant Demographic Database (AEDD;
   10.6084/m9.figshare.19387085). We found 37 natural mortality estimates
   from five different study sites. Other mortality data, demographic
   rates, and age- and sex-structured population data were substantially
   more abundant, both temporally and spatially. This new collection of
   demographic rates, age- and sex-structured population data, and
   cause-partitioned mortality estimates identifies spatial and temporal
   data gaps and provides prior information needed for African elephant
   population models. Closing these data gaps and subsequent analyses of
   realistic population models may aid elephant conservation via improved
   policies, legislation, and protection.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the virus 2019-nCoV, a
   single-stranded RNA virus. During the infection and transmission
   processes, the virus evolves and mutates rapidly, though the disease has
   been quickly controlled in Wuhan by `Fangcang' hospitals. To model the
   virulence evolution, in this paper, we formulate a new age structured
   epidemic model. Under the tradeoff hypothesis, two special scenarios are
   used to study the virulence evolution by theoretical analysis and
   numerical simulations. Results show that, before `Fangcang' hospitals,
   two scenarios are both consistent with the data. After `Fangcang'
   hospitals, Scenario I rather than Scenario II is consistent with the
   data. It is concluded that the transmission pattern of COVID-19 in Wuhan
   obey Scenario I rather than Scenario II. Theoretical analysis show that,
   in Scenario I, shortening the value of L (diagnosis period) can result
   in an enormous selective pressure on the evolution of 2019-nCoV.},

Title = {Historical account and current ecological knowledge of the southernmost
   lizard in the world, Liolaemus magellanicus (Squamata: Liolaemidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Background The systematics of Liolaemus magellanicus has been relatively
   well researched, but despite its recognition as the southernmost lizard
   in the world, scant attention has been paid to the discovery,
   distribution, biogeography, and ecology of this lizard at the southern
   tip of South America. I hereby research such aspects and collate the
   most relevant information reported in the primary literature. Methods
   and Results I conducted a selective review of the history of discovery,
   distributional records, biogeography, and ecological features of L.
   magellanicus, as recorded in mainstream journals and landmark monographs
   and books. I specifically omitted the work on the systematics of the
   species and genus because its complexity warrants separate treatment. I
   found scattered references to this lizard starting with the chronicles
   of several overseas expeditions (British, French, and Swedish), with
   Darwin, Jacquinot and Guichenot, and Anderson and Ohlin acting as
   informers; and culminating with Skottsberg, a traveler, and Bridges, an
   early settler in Tierra del Fuego Island. Modern treatment of this
   species started with Hellmich in the 1930s and Donoso-Barros in the
   1960s in Chile, and with Cei in Argentina in the 1960s and has continued
   chiefly in the latter country until today. Discussion I propose this
   species as a model ectothermic vertebrate that may serve to test
   hypotheses about: (a) Resource allocation strategies to deal with a
   harsh environment that affords limited opportunities for foraging and
   reproductive activities of a lizard. (b) Behavioral strategies for
   dealing with thermoregulation, food, and mate acquisition, and care -if
   any-of offspring. (c) Its place within the rather impoverished food web
   of which this species forms part of. This relatively new species, which
   persisted in glacial refuges before being cut off into two
   subpopulations-one mainlander, another islander-also offers fertile
   ground for testing population genetic, evolutionary, and phylogeographic
   hypotheses. I think that biogeographers, systematists, evolutionists,
   physiologists, and ecologists should take advantage of this uniquely
   positioned species in the southernmost margin of the world.},

Title = {Effects of landscape configuration on the occurrence and abundance of an
   arboreal marsupial from the Valdivian rainforest},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background Habitat fragmentation and degradation processes affect
   biodiversity by reducing habitat quantity and quality, with differential
   effects on the resident species. However, their consequences are not
   always noticeable as some ecological processes affected involve
   idiosyncratic responses among different animal groups. The Valdivian
   temperate rainforests of southern Chile are experiencing a rapid
   fragmentation and degradation process despite being a biodiversity
   hotspot. Deforestation is one of the main threats to these forests.
   There inhabits the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, an iconic
   species from the Valdivian rainforest, it is the only extant
   representative of the ancient Microbiotheria order, and it is currently
   threatened by habitat loss. Here we tested the effects of habitat
   configuration on D. gliroides occurrence and abundance along 12
   landscapes of southern Chile with different disturbance levels. Methods
   We estimated D. gliroides occurrence and abundance using camera traps
   and related those metrics with landscape configuration indices obtained
   from FRAGSTATS (i.e., forest \%, connectivity, patch number, contiguity,
   and distance to the nearest patch) using Bayesian linear mixed models.
   Results We found that D. gliroides occurrence was not influenced by
   landscape configuration, while its abundance was positively influenced
   by forest contiguity. Conclusions Although this arboreal marsupial is
   present in disturbed forests, its restricted movement capabilities and
   high dependency on the forest three-dimensional structure may affect its
   long-term persistence. We urge to rethink native forest conservation and
   management policies to improve habitat connectivity with possible
   positive consequences for native fauna.},

Title = {Microalgal characterization during a mucilaginous bloom on deep
   gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo MPA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in frequency, but despite an
   extreme increase in research on this topic, general knowledge on HABs is
   still scarce. Mucilaginous algal blooms, in particular, are ever more
   present and can heavily affect marine ecosystems. Gorgonians appear
   significantly affected, as their branches are easily entangled (pelagic
   aggregates) and overgrown (benthic aggregates) by mucilage. Moreover,
   their proximity to the bottom makes them susceptible to benthic anoxia.
   In the present study, we investigated the mucilaginous bloom that
   affected the gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo Marine
   Protected Area (MPA) (NE coast of Sardinia) in summer 2020. We focused
   mainly on the characterization of dominant benthic microalgae,
   identifying those responsible for the bloom. Sampling was performed
   considering the colonies of Paramuricea clavata present on hard
   substrata along 2 transects near the Secca del Papa, in the B Zone of
   the MPA. The characterization of the microalgal community and the count
   of the most abundant species (>10 cells ml-1) were carried out using the
   Utermohl sedimentation method. The community was mainly composed of
   diatoms (Bacillariophyta) belonging to the genera Pseudo-nitzschia,
   Nitzschia and Cylindrotheca. C. closterium appeared to be the most
   abundant species. These results confirm the importance of diatoms during
   Tyrrhenian mucilaginous blooms, which could be particularly harmful to
   gorgonians.},

Title = {Effects of nutrient enrichments on oligotrophic phytoplankton
   communities: a mesocosm experiment near Hawai'i, USA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {167-183},
Abstract = {A large-volume mesocosm-based nutrient perturbation experiment was
   conducted off the island of Hawai'i, USA, to investigate the response of
   surface ocean phytoplankton communities to the addition of
   macronutrients, trace metals, and vitamins and to assess the feasibility
   of using mesocosms in the open ocean. Three free-drifting mesocosms
   (similar to 60 m(3)) were deployed: one mesocosm served as a control (no
   nutrient amendments); a second (termed +P) was amended with nitrate (N),
   silicate (Si), phosphate (P), and a trace metal + vitamin mixture; and a
   third (termed-P) was amended with N, Si, and a trace metal + vitamin
   mixture but no P. These mesocosms were unreplicated due to logistical
   constraints and hence differences between treatments are qualitative.
   After 6 d, the largest response of the phytoplankton community was
   observed in the +P mesocosm, where chlorophyll a and C-14-based primary
   production were 2-3x greater than in the -P mesocosm and 4-6x greater
   than in the control. Comparison between mesocosm and `microcosm'
   incubations (20 l) revealed differences in the magnitude and timing of
   production and marked differences in community structure with a reduced
   response of diatoms in microcosm treatments. Notably, we also observed
   pronounced declines in Prochlorococcus populations in all treatments,
   although these were greater in microcosms (up to 99\%). Overall, this
   study confirmed the feasibility of deploying free-drifting mesocosms in
   the open ocean as a potentially powerful tool to investigate ecological
   impacts of nutrient perturbations and constitutes a valuable first step
   towards scaling plankton manipulation experiments.},

   and K-means clustering) we identified a consensus delimitation of the
   vegetation type. NMDS ordination, analysis of diagnostic, constant and
   dominant species, and Didukh indicator values were used to characterize
   its species composition and habitat conditions. Results: Altogether 58
   relev??s from Western Ukraine and Romania were classified to a tall herb
   -dominated vegetation type that we identified with the association
   Trollio-Clematidetum recti T??uber et Weber 1976 described from Romania.
   We assigned it to the alliance Geranion sanguinei. It differs from other
   communities of this alliance in its preference for shady slopes, greater
   stand height and considerable representation of mesophilous and montane
   species. It is confined to calcareous bedrock with high soil pH and high
   mineral richness. Conclusions: We suggest that the studied tall
   herb-dominated vegetation is a specific steppe type, confined to
   relatively moist and nutrient rich sites in the peri-Carpathian area.
   Analogous vegetation occurs in the Alps, Balkans, hemiboreal Europe,
   South Urals and Western Siberia. Its species composition and
   biogeographical relationships provide further support for the hypothesis
   that steppe meadows of Central Europe, including tall herb-dominated
   stands, are linked to the Pleistocene and early-Holocene forest-steppe
   of temperate Eurasia.},

Title = {Community Structure of Terrestrial Vertebrates in a Restored Meadow
   Habitat in Pennsylvania: Assessing the Potential Prey Base for Eastern

Abstract = {We sampled the vertebrate community of a 20-ha conservation easement in
   Venango County, PA, from April through August 2021. The restoration and
   management efforts on this easement were designed to improve the meadow
   habitat for one of the few remaining populations of Sistrurus catenatus
   (Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake) in Pennsylvania, and our sampling
   efforts were focused on evaluating the potential prey base available to
   the rattlesnakes at this site. We identified 9 amphibian species, 10
   reptile species, and 11 small mammal species. For amphibians, Anaxyrus
   americanus (American Toad) was the most abundant species, accounting for
   32.6\% of the total, followed by Notophthalmus viridescens (Red-Spotted
   Newt) with 30.6\% of total abundance. Thamnophis brachystoma
   (Short-Headed Gartersnake) comprised more than half (53.7\%) of all
   reptiles sampled, followed by Thamnophis sirtalis (Eastern Gartersnake;
   22.7\%). Peromyscus leucopus (White- Footed Mouse) was the most abundant
   mammal species, accounting for 37.4\% of all mammals surveyed, followed
   by Microtus pennsylvanicus (Eastern Meadow Vole; 24.8\%). Mammals had
   the greatest species richness (S = 11), while reptiles had the greatest
   total abundance (TA = 361), and amphibians had the greatest species
   evenness (E = 0.799). Species accounts for Venango County indicate that
   we sampled 40.9\% (9/22), 37.0\% (10/27), and 21.2\% (11/52) of the
   known amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian species, respectively, within
   this restored meadow habitat. Our results suggest that the restoration
   efforts on this easement study site have been extremely effective in
   creating meadow habitat that supports a diversity of prey species for
   the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake.},

Abstract = {High-elevation habitats are a limited yet critical component of the
   northeastern landscape that provide important habitat and climate change
   adaptation values. This study examines the extent, conservation status,
   condition, and ecological values of high-elevation areas (defined as
   greater than 823 m {[}2700 ft] in elevation) in New England and New
   York. We identified a total of 765 distinct areas at least 4 ha (10 ac)
   in size. We assessed these areas for their level of conservation, the
   extent of development and recent timber harvesting, and 14 ecological
   values. We developed a quantitative scoring system that allowed us to
   rank areas for their conservation value and identify the most
   significant unconserved areas. While 86\% of high-elevation land across
   the region has some form of conservation protection, significant areas
   remain unconserved, particularly in the Western Mountains region of
   Maine. We discuss the importance of additional high-elevation
   conservation to regional climate-change adaptation and the potential for
   mountains to serve as climate change refugia.},

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {11},
Pages = {156-179},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Permanent, fishless, alpine and subalpine ponds are extremely rare in
   New England, and amphibians occupying these ponds are unique
   bioindicators of environmental change because they are subject to
   different ecological pressures compared with lowland populations.
   Further, alpine and montane ecosystems are expected to undergo rapid
   change in the coming decades. Therefore, uncoupling the interacting
   effects of temperature, precipitation, and ice-out on breeding efforts
   may identify specific ecological mechanisms driving reproduction of
   amphibians. The reproductive phenology of amphibians in climatically
   extreme alpine environments in the eastern United States is historically
   under-reported and remains poorly understood. To evaluate the
   reproductive phenology of amphibians near the upper extreme of their
   vertical distribution in the White Mountains, NH, we digitally recorded
   amphibian calls between 2010 and 2020 at 3 permanent, fishless ponds:
   Hermit Lake (1180 m), Eagle Lake (1278 m), and Lakes of the Clouds (1546
   m). Our study revealed dynamic changes in species assemblages and
   provides the first report of Hyla versicolor (Gray Tree Frog) in a
   subalpine context (at Hermit Lake). We analyzed the calling phenology of
   the earliest breeding North American anuran, Rana sylvatica (Wood Frog),
   and found differences in calling phenology among the 3 ponds and
   temporary changes in calling phenology correlated with interpolated
   daily weather parameters. We stress the need for further research to
   understand both short- and long-term, weather-driven reproductive
   dynamics in amphibian phenology in high mountains and their correspondin
   g demographic effects.},

Abstract = {Pteridinium simplex is an iconic erniettomorph taxon best known from
   late Ediacaran successions in South Australia, Russia, and Namibia.
   Despite nearly 100 years of study, there remain fundamental questions
   surrounding the paleobiology and paleoecology of this organism,
   including its life position relative to the sediment-water interface,
   and how it fed and functioned within benthic communities. Here, we
   combine a redescription of specimens housed at the Senckenberg
   Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum Frankfurt with field observations of
   fossiliferous surfaces, to constrain the life habit of Pteridinium and
   gain insights into the character of benthic ecosystems shortly before
   the beginning of the Cambrian. We present paleontological and
   sedimentological evidence suggesting that Pteridinium was semi-infaunal
   and lived gregariously in aggregated communities, preferentially
   adopting an orientation with the long axis perpendicular to the
   prevailing current direction. Using computational fluid dynamics
   simulations, we demonstrate that this life habit could plausibly have
   led to suspended food particles settling within the organism's central
   cavity. This supports interpretation of Pteridinium as a macroscopic
   suspension feeder that functioned similarly to the coeval erniettomorph
   Ernietta, emblematic of a broader paleoecological shift toward benthic
   suspension-feeding strategies over the course of the latest Ediacaran.
   Finally, we discuss how this new reconstruction of Pteridinium provides
   information concerning its potential relationships with extant animal
   groups and state a case for reconstructing Pteridinium as a colonial
   metazoan.},

Title = {Why the long teeth? Morphometric analysis suggests different selective

Abstract = {Neogene and Pleistocene African suids displayed convergent evolutionary
   trends in the third molar (M3) morphology, with increasingly elongated
   and higher crowns through time. While these features can prevent
   premature loss of masticatory functionality and potentially increase
   long-term reproductive success, changes in dental occlusal traits such
   as enamel complexity and thickness can also improve chewing efficiency
   and increase short-term energetic return. While both long-term and
   short-term benefits can contribute to the thriving of a lineage, the
   selective pressures associated with each category can be different. To
   examine how crown elongation correlates with these functional occlusal
   traits, we selected M3s of Kolpochoerus, Notochoerus, and
   Metridiochoerus from Kenya and South Africa, dated between 3.0 Ma and
   0.4 Ma. To account for dental wear, we used micro-computed tomography
   imaging of unworn/slightly worn M3s to simulate wear progression within
   each tooth. We compared morphometric representatives of occlusal enamel
   complexity and thickness among the specimens following their respective
   wear trajectories. We found that M3 elongation correlates with higher
   occlusal complexity and thinner enamel in Notochoerus and
   Metridiochoerus lineages through time. In Kolpochoerus, enamel
   complexity and thickness were generally maintained through time, despite
   M3 elongation. The differences in M3 morphometric trends suggest that
   Kolpochoerus likely experienced a different set of selective pressures
   on functional occlusal traits compared with Notochoerus and
   Metridiochoerus. The shared evolutionary trends of M3 specialization
   among Notochoerus and Metridiochoerus suggest similar selective
   pressures on their chewing efficiency and the possibility of a dietary
   niche overlap in more xeric habitats.},

Title = {Fossilized pollen malformations as indicators of past environmental
   stress and meiotic disruption: insights from modern conifers},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Pollen malformations have been proposed as a paleoenvironmental stress
   proxy. However, the frequency and variability of pollen malformations
   under near-optimal conditions and environmental stress, as well as their
   developmental origins, remain unclear. To bridge these gaps, we compared
   pollen malformation frequencies and assemblages of 14 extant conifer
   genera of Pinaceae and Podocarpaceae producing saccate (winged) grains
   grown under near-optimal conditions. These baseline pollen yields were
   compared with those produced by Pinus mugo `Columnaris' cultured under
   an abiotic stress-three experimentally heightened ultraviolet-B
   radiation (UV-B) regimes proposed for the end-Permian crisis. We
   additionally reviewed previous cytological literature of abnormal
   microsporogenesis in conifers. Under near-optimal conditions,
   malformations comprise 10\% of yields in the naturally trisaccate
   Dacrycarpus dacrydioides. We detected no phylogenetic pattern in
   malformation assemblages of the baseline comparisons. UV-B-irradiated P.
   mugo produced significantly higher malformation frequencies and
   different assemblage compositions when compared with baseline bisaccate
   lineages. We propose that pollen malformations originate during the
   meiotic and tetrad stages of microsporogenesis and present a framework
   for the ontogeny of different malformation types seen in the fossil
   record. Malformations comprising >3\% of bisaccate pollen yields can be
   used as a paleoenvironmental stress proxy, but rare, naturally
   trisaccate lineages are not suitable for such assessments. Furthermore,
   heightened UV-B not only increases pollen malformation production, but
   also alters the types of abnormalities trees produce. Different
   environmental stresses may therefore leave behind distinct fingerprints
   in the fossil record.},

Abstract = {Deep learning algorithms and particularly convolutional neural networks
   are very successful in pattern recognition from images and are
   increasingly employed in biology. The development of automated systems
   for rapid and reliable species identification is vital for insect
   systematics and may revolutionize this field soon. In this study, we
   demonstrate the ability of a convolutional neural network to identify
   species based on habitus photographs with expert-level accuracy in a
   taxonomically challenging group where a human-based identification would
   require notorious genitalia dissections. Using the economically
   important and polymorphic plant bug genus Adelphocoris Reuter
   (Heteroptera: Miridae) as a model group, we explore the variability in
   the performance of 11 convolutional neural models most commonly used for
   image classification, test the role of class-imbalance on the model
   performance assessment and visualize areas of interest using three
   interpretation algorithms. Classification performance in our experiments
   with collection-based habitus photographs is high enough to identify
   very similar species from a large group with an expert-level accuracy.
   The accuracy is getting lower only in the experiments with an additional
   dataset of Adelphocoris and other live plant bugs photographs taken from
   the Web. Our article demonstrates the importance of comprehensive
   institutional insect collections for bringing deep learning algorithms
   into service for systematic entomology using affordable equipment and
   methods.},

Abstract = {We examined the phylogeny and intrageneric classification of eristaline
   hoverfly genera from the Afrotropical Region using mitochondrial
   genomes. Genome skimming was used to obtain (nearly) full mtDNA and
   nuclear rDNA (18S, 28S) genomes of 120 museum vouchers from eight genera
   and 98 species. Phylogenetic reconstructions of mitogenomes and
   mitogenomes + nuclear rDNA yielded comparable phylogenies while that of
   rDNA only resulted in poorly resolved phylogenies. Phylogenetic analyses
   focused on six genera and supported the monophyly of the genera
   Chasmomma Bezzi, Eristalinus Rondani, Mesembrius Rondani and Syritta Le
   Peletier \& Serville, whereas Simoides Loew was not monophyletic and
   rendered Phytomia Guerin-Meneville paraphyletic. We therefore synonymize
   Simoides with Phytomia. Within Chasmomma, two species-groups that differ
   in the colour and the shape of the hind femora (Chasmomma femoratum and
   Chasmomma nigrum species-groups) were supported. Within Eristalinus, the
   monophyly of the subgenera Merodonoides Curran and Eristalodes Mik was
   supported, but not of the subgenus Eristalinus Rondani. Within Syritta,
   the monophyly of three out of the five species-groups tested was
   rejected. This approach illustrates the importance of integrative and
   iterative approaches in taxonomy and shows that genomic data may not
   only clarify the systematic relationships among hoverfly genera and
   species, but also offer perspectives into the evolution of morphological
   and ecological variation within the family.},

   environment. Private grounds were never accessed without prior consent
   by the owners and were visited with national recruited staff and as part
   of the ongoing projects on pest control and biodiversity of the
   institutions. IITA is a non-profit international organization and a
   member of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
   (CGIAR) Consortium. Research work in Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria is based
   on bilateral agreements in the form of memorandums of understanding
   (MoU) signed by the ministries of agriculture of all respective
   governments (more information can be found on ), in which research work
   in the field is an integral part of IITA's contracted mandate. In Togo,
   IITA has a close partnership with the National Plant Protection Service
   and the University of Lome through which material was obtained.
   Therefore, no specific permissions were required for the collected
   hoverflies. In Uganda, collecting permits were obtained from the Uganda
   Wildlife Authority (UWA/COD/96/05) and the Uganda National Council for
   Science and Technology (UNCST) (NS642). Permits for collecting in Malawi
   were obtained from the Forestry Research Institute of Malawi (FRIM).
   Collecting in Kenya was conducted under permit no. RESEA/1/KFS/VOL
   II/(34). Collecting in South Africa was conducted under a licence
   provided by the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to Burgert Muller
   and under permt MPB. 5573 provided by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks
   Agency. None of the collected species occur on red lists or are
   considered to be endangered/threatened, neither is any ranked in IUCN

Abstract = {Accurately documenting aquatic insects is of the utmost importance given
   recent proposals for a paradigm shift in conservation to protect
   less-charismatic species that are necessary for ecosystem functioning.
   We used both field techniques and molecular methods to assess
   biodiversity in a stream in southwest Virginia. We used emergence traps
   to collect organisms that emerged from the stream as reproducing adults
   over a 4-week period and collected environmental samples (e.g., water,
   sediment) to sequence the DNA found in the samples. Emerging aquatic
   insect abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time. More
   family richness was detected using environmental DNA (eDNA) than
   traditional field sampling; however, many families detected using field
   techniques were not recovered using eDNA, furthering support that both
   protocols are necessary for fully documenting biodiversity. We did not
   have much success in identifying eDNA sequences to species with high
   sequence similarity, suggesting that invertebrate biodiversity of
   southwest Virginia is not well-documented in open-source DNA sequence
   databases. In addition to documenting insect biodiversity, we measured
   the levels of heavy metals in the stream sediment. Sediment values for
   cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury and lead were within regulatory
   limits and were not significantly correlated with biodiversity measures.},

Title = {Breaking the constraint on the number of cervical vertebrae in mammals:
   On homeotic transformations in lorises and pottos},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {196-210},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mammals almost always have seven cervical vertebrae. The strong
   evolutionary constraint on changes in this number has been broken in
   sloths and manatees. We have proposed that the extremely low activity
   and metabolic rates of these species relax the stabilizing selection
   against changes in the cervical count. Our hypothesis is that strong
   stabilizing selection in other mammals is largely indirect and due to
   associated pleiotropic effects, including juvenile cancers. Additional
   direct selection can occur due to biomechanical problems (thoracic
   outlet syndrome). Low metabolic and activity rates are thought to
   diminish these direct and indirect effects. To test this hypothesis
   within the primates, we have compared the number of cervical vertebrae
   of three lorisid species with particularly low activity and metabolic
   rates with those of more active primate species, including with their
   phylogenetically closest active relatives, the galagids (bushbabies). In
   support of our hypothesis, we found that 37.6\% of the lorisid specimens
   had an abnormal cervical count, which is a higher percentage than in the
   other nine primate families, in which the incidence varied from zero to
   2.2\%. We conclude that our data support the importance of internal
   selection in constraining evolvability and of a relaxed stabilizing
   selection for increasing evolvability. Additionally, we discuss that
   there is no support for a role of the muscularized diaphragm in the
   evolutionary constraint.},

Title = {Burrowing constrains patterns of skull shape evolution in wrasses},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {73-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolution of behavioral and ecological specialization can have
   marked effects on the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Head-first
   burrowing has been shown to exert powerful selective pressures on the
   head and body shapes of many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. In
   wrasses, burrowing behaviors have evolved multiple times independently,
   and are commonly used in foraging and predator avoidance behaviors.
   While recent studies have examined the kinematics and body shape
   morphology associated with this behavior, no study to-date has examined
   the macroevolutionary implications of burrowing on patterns of
   phenotypic diversification in this clade. Here, we use three-dimensional
   geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to study
   the evolution of skull shape in fossorial wrasses and their relatives.
   We test for skull shape differences between burrowing and non burrowing
   wrasses and evaluate hypotheses of shape convergence among the burrowing
   wrasses. We also quantify rates of skull shape evolution between
   burrowing and non burrowing wrasses to test for whether burrowing
   constrains or accelerates rates of skull shape evolution in this clade.
   We find that while burrowing and non burrowing wrasses exhibit similar
   degrees of morphological disparity, for burrowing wrasses, it took
   nearly twice as long to amass this disparity. Furthermore, while the
   disparities between groups are evenly matched, we find that most
   burrowing species are confined to a particular region of shape space
   with most species exhibiting narrower heads than many non-burrowing
   species. These results suggest head-first burrowing constrains patterns
   of skull shape diversification in wrasses by potentially restricting the
   range of phenotypes that can perform this behavior.},

Title = {A detailed redescription of the mesoderm/neural crest cell boundary in

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The morphology of the mammalian chondrocranium appears to differ
   significantly from those of other amniotes, since the former possesses
   uniquely developed brain and cranial sensory organs. In particular, a
   question has long remained unanswered as to the developmental and
   evolutionary origins of a cartilaginous nodule called the ala
   hypochiasmatica. In this study, we investigated the embryonic origin of
   skeletal elements in the murine orbitotemporal region by combining
   genetic cell lineage analysis with detailed morphological observation.
   Our results showed that the mesodermal embryonic environment including
   the ala hypochiasmatica, which appeared as an isolated mesodermal
   distribution in the neural crest-derived prechordal region, is formed as
   a part of the mesoderm that continued from the chordal region during
   early chondrocranial development. The mesoderm/neural crest cell
   boundary in the head mesenchyme is modified through development,
   resulting in the secondary mesodermal expansion to invade into the
   prechordal region. We thus revealed that the ala hypochiasmatica
   develops as the frontier of the mesodermal sheet stretched along the
   cephalic flexure. These results suggest that the mammalian ala
   hypochiasmatica has evolved from a part of the mesodermal primary
   cranial wall in ancestral amniotes. In addition, the endoskeletal
   elements in the orbitotemporal region, such as the orbital cartilage,
   suprapterygoid articulation of the palatoquadrate, and trabecula, some
   of which were once believed to represent primitive traits of amniotes
   and to be lost in the mammalian lineage, have been confirmed to exist in
   the mammalian cranium. Consequently, the mammalian chondrocranium can
   now be explained in relation to the pan-amniote cranial configuration.},

Title = {Disturbed virus-bacteria dynamics in Otsuchi Bay (Japan) after the
   mega-earthquake and tsunami in March 2011},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {31-41},
Abstract = {On 11 March 2011, a mega-earthquake followed by a huge tsunami hit a
   large area of the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan, and caused widespread
   disturbances in marine ecosystems; however, the impacts on
   virus-bacteria systems have not yet been elucidated. To investigate
   whether virus-bacteria interactions were affected by the earthquake and
   tsunami, we analyzed time series data of viral and bacterial abundances
   in Otsuchi Bay. Data were collected every 2 mo, from July 2011 to
   September 2015. Bacterial abundance exhibited a recurrent seasonal cycle
   with high abundance during the warm season. The seasonal trend of
   viruses generally followed that of the bacteria, yielding an average
   virus to bacteria ratio (VBR) of 10.8 +/- 3.6 (mean +/- SD; n = 432). A
   notable exception was found at the first 2 sampling times (July and
   September 2011) when the VBR was consistently low, with an average value
   of 5.9 +/- 1.2 (n = 32). The average VBR during these time periods was
   substantially lower than the VBR observed in the same season of
   subsequent years. An analysis of the subset of data collected in the
   warm season of 2011 and 2012 revealed that the viral abundance and VBR
   were negatively correlated with turbidity. These results support the
   hypothesis that viruses were scavenged by non-host particles from the
   resuspended sediments and damaged catchment. The earthquake and tsunami
   thus exerted a prolonged impact, over several months, on the
   virus-bacteria dynamics in Otsuchi Bay.},

Title = {Biogeography of reef water microbes from within-reef to global scales},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {81-94},
Abstract = {Seawater microorganisms play an important role in coral reef ecosystem
   functioning and can be influenced by biological, chemical, and physical
   features of reefs. As coral reefs continue to respond to environmental
   changes, the reef seawater microbiome has been proposed as a
   conservation tool for monitoring perturbations. However, the spatial
   variability of reef seawater microbial communities is not well studied,
   limiting our ability to make generalizable inferences across reefs. In
   order to better understand how microorganisms are distributed at
   multiple spatial scales, we examined seawater microbial communities in
   Florida Reef Tract and US Virgin Islands reef systems using a nested
   sampling design. On 3 reefs per reef system, we sampled seawater at
   regular spatial intervals close to the benthos. We assessed the
   microbial community composition of these waters using ribosomal RNA gene
   amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed that reef water microbial
   communities varied as a function of reef system and individual reefs,
   but communities did not differ within reefs and were not significantly
   influenced by benthic composition. For the reef system and inter-reef
   differences, abundant microbial taxa were found to be potentially useful
   indicators of environmental difference due to their high prevalence and
   variance. We further examined reef water microbial biogeography on a
   global scale using a secondary analysis of 5 studies, which revealed
   that microbial communities were more distinct with increasing geographic
   distance. These results suggest that biogeography is a distinguishing
   feature for reef water microbiomes, and that development of monitoring
   criteria may necessitate regionally specific sampling and analyses.},

Abstract = {We conducted observational and experimental studies of the endangered
   hemiparasitic plant species Schwalbea americana (American Chaffseed,
   hereafter Schwalbea) in the New Jersey pine barrens to better understand
   its association with fine-scale environmental conditions. Spatial
   analyses of Schwalbea coordinates revealed a clustered distribution and
   analyses of environmental variables found clear associations of
   Schwalbea clusters with various soil, water, and plant community
   conditions, including several grass and composite (Asteraccae) species,
   especially Chrysopsis mariana (Maryland Golden aster) and Schizachyrium
   scoparium (Little Bluestem). Subsequent experiments found soil from
   adjacent areas completely inhibited Schwalbea germination, and greater
   growth and survival occurred when planted with composites than with
   grass or woody host species. These factors appeared to explain the
   failures of past propagation and restoration efforts, which did not
   reflect these microhabitat preferences.},

Title = {Extinction and replacement events shaped the historical biogeography of
   Arctic mammals in Europe: new models of species response},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {507-518},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The historical biogeography of the terrestrial mammals in Europe has
   been widely studied on the basis of fossil records and molecular makers.
   However, to date, only one model of species' responses to
   glacial-interglacial cycles during the glacial episodes of the
   Quaternary, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum, has been
   proposed: the `expansion-contraction model'. The `expansion-contraction
   model' is more appropriate for thermophilous and temperate species than
   for Arctic species. We hypothesise that the responses of cold-adapted
   species to the temperature fluctuations during glacial cycles cannot be
   explained by this model. In this review, we synthesise and describe, for
   the first time, the historical biogeography of various cold-adapted
   terrestrial mammalian taxa (small mammals, herbivores, and carnivores)
   in Eurasia during the last glaciation (especially during the Last
   Glacial Maximum), and identify mechanisms underlying their response to
   glacier pulsation and severe climate fluctuations. We formulate the
   paradigm for the biogeography of cold-adapted mammalian taxa in Europe,
   and identified three response models to glacial-interglacial cycles: 1)
   `extinction and genetic diminution' for Lasiopodomys gregalis,
   Dicrostonyx spp. and Lemmus lemmus, 2) `extinction and replacement' for
   Alopex lagopus, Gulo gulo and Rangifer tarandus, and 3) `contraction and
   gene transfer' for Lepus timidus and Martes zibellina. Knowledge of past
   biogeography is essential for understanding how cold-adapted taxa are
   responding to anthropogenic climate warming, and for on-going
   biodiversity and habitat conservation in the Anthropocene. There is no
   doubt that cold-adapted, Arctic species are suffering the most from
   global warming.},

Title = {Fox Vulpes vulpes population trends in Western Europe during and after
   the eradication of rabies},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-359},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Over several decades, Western Europe experienced an outbreak of sylvatic
   rabies, eliminated through an EU programme involving large-scale red fox
   vaccination campaigns. While much work has been done on the dynamics of
   the virus and on the efficiency of vaccination campaigns, very little
   attention has been paid to the impact on the large-scale dynamics of the
   fox population. As Western Europe has now been free of rabies for about
   15-20 years, the aims of this review are to characterise the impact of
   rabies during the outbreak itself and to increase understanding of how
   fox populations evolved thereafter. The rabies-free populations in the
   UK are also integrated as a comparative control. Trends in fox
   populations are based on a review of available data, mainly hunting
   statistics and a few other methods. The benefits and biases of these
   methods are also discussed. During the rabies epizootic, fox populations
   experienced a significant decline and stabilised at lower densities than
   observed in the past. A demographic explosion followed the vaccination
   campaigns, and fox populations became larger than had been observed
   before the epizootic. Rabies vaccination was not the direct cause of
   this demographic explosion, as rabies-free areas experienced it also.
   The causes are more to be sought in environmental modifications induced
   by humans. This demographic explosion was followed by the emergence of
   urban fox populations throughout Europe. Moreover, the new higher
   densities favoured the outbreak of other diseases, though their impact
   was more limited. Around the 2000s, rural fox populations appeared to
   reach densities close to carrying capacity and populations stabilised.
   However, subsequently, with some exceptions, Western European fox
   populations seem to be experiencing a decline. The ecological
   consequences of these changes in fox population density may reach the
   many prey species and competitors of the red fox.},

Abstract = {We compared embryogenesis of five species of domesticated even-toed and
   one odd-toed ungulate and used a phylogenetic framework to contextualize
   such comparison. Organ systems that occur relatively earlier in
   embryogenesis generally have more time to develop and therefore are
   found to be more mature at birth when compared to structures that appear
   later in development. We hypothesized that the less mature the animals'
   organs are at birth, the more they are susceptible to artificial
   selection. The horse had the most mature organs at birth, followed by
   cattle, reindeer, sheep/goat, and pig. This pattern of maturity could be
   observed almost during the entire development. Heterochronic shifts
   among species were observed only after fur starts to develop. Changes in
   the fur coloration are one of the first observable signs of
   domestication and the heterochrony of this trait may be related to the
   effects on neural crest-derived pigment cells by artificial selection.
   The six ungulate species also differ in the relative duration of their
   weaning period and the potential extent of its artificial shortening. We
   put all these traits in the context of their inherited evolutionary
   characteristics and artificial domestication process. Related to their
   altriciality, carnivoran domesticates, which also belong to Scrotifera,
   are less mature at birth than all domesticated ungulates. Although we
   detected clear character correlations to life history traits, it is
   impossible based on the present data, to trace specific exaptations to
   the domestication process. We hypothesize a deep time developmental
   penetration of adult characters into embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {For centuries, it has been understood that the final size of adult
   holometabolous insects is determined by the end of the larval stage, and
   that once they transform to adults, holometabolous insects do not grow.
   Despite this, no previous study has directly tested these ``old
   truths{''} across holometabolous insects. Here, we demonstrate that
   final adult size is set at the end of the last larval stage in species
   representing each of the four orders of holometabolous insects: the
   fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera), the tobacco hornworm
   Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera), the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus
   (Coleoptera), and the Florida carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus
   (Hymenoptera). Furthermore, in both D. melanogaster and C. floridanus,
   we show that the size of adult individuals fluctuates but does not
   significantly change. Therefore, our study finally confirms these two
   basic assumptions in the biology of insects, which have for centuries
   served as the foundation for studies of insect growth, size, and
   allometry.},

Abstract = {In modern vertebrates, the craniofacial skeleton is complex, comprising
   cartilage and bone of the neurocranium, dermatocranium and
   splanchnocranium (and their derivatives), housing a range of sensory
   structures such as eyes, nasal and vestibulo-acoustic capsules, with the
   splanchnocranium including branchial arches, used in respiration and
   feeding. It is well understood that the skeleton derives from neural
   crest and mesoderm, while the sensory elements derive from ectodermal
   thickenings known as placodes. Recent research demonstrates that neural
   crest and placodes have an evolutionary history outside of vertebrates,
   while the vertebrate fossil record allows the sequence of the evolution
   of these various features to be understood. Stem-group vertebrates such
   as Metaspriggina walcotti (Burgess Shale, Middle Cambrian) possess eyes,
   paired nasal capsules and well-developed branchial arches, the latter
   derived from cranial neural crest in extant vertebrates, indicating that
   placodes and neural crest evolved over 500 million years ago. Since that
   time the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton has evolved, including
   different types of bone, of potential neural crest or mesodermal origin.
   One problematic part of the craniofacial skeleton concerns the evolution
   of the nasal organs, with evidence for both paired and unpaired nasal
   sacs being the primitive state for vertebrates.},

Abstract = {The cross-border mobility of malaria cases poses an obstacle to malaria
   elimination programmes in many countries, including Nepal. Here, we
   develop a novel mathematical model to study how the imported malaria
   cases through the Nepal-India open-border affect the Nepal government's
   goal of eliminating malaria by 2026. Mathematical analyses and numerical
   simulations of our model, validated by malaria case data from Nepal,
   indicate that eliminating malaria from Nepal is possible if strategies
   promoting the absence of cross-border mobility, complete protection of
   transmission abroad, or strict border screening and isolation are
   implemented. For each strategy, we establish the conditions for the
   elimination of malaria. We further use our model to identify the control
   strategies that can help maintain a low endemic level. Our results show
   that the ideal control strategies should be designed according to the
   average mosquito biting rates that may depend on the location and
   season.},

Title = {Aligning terrestrial habitat typology of Lebanon with EUNIS habitat
   classification},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {233-244},
Abstract = {The absence of nationally accepted typology to classify and describe
   habitats has been an obstacle to the development of coordinated research
   in this field and to the implementation of conservation actions;
   therefore, a classification of the natural and semi-natural terrestrial
   habitat types existing in Lebanon is presented and adapted to the
   hierarchical structure of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS)
   habitat classification. The harmonisation with an international
   classification system is essential to facilitate communication and
   research throughout the Mediterranean Basin. A total of 1597 sites
   surveyed throughout Lebanon between 2013 and 2020 were classified and
   described based on the analysis of the physiognomic parameters and
   specific composition of their vegetation. The analysis yielded 190
   habitat types for Lebanon, including 12 coastal habitats (category N),
   35 related to inland surface waters (C), 6 wetland habitats (Q), 20
   grasslands (R), 54 scrublands and heaths habitats (S), 27 types of
   woodlands (T), 17 inland unvegetated habitats (U), and 19 vegetated
   man-made habitats (V). Sixty-one habitats characteristic of Lebanon, not
   previously included in the EUNIS classification, were described and
   proposed in this typology. Those habitats include shrublands (23),
   woodlands (18), coastal habitats (6), wetlands (1), grasslands (9),
   sparsely vegetated habitats (2) and man-made vegetation (2).},

Title = {Growth rate mediates hidden developmental plasticity of female yellow
   dung fly reproductive morphology in response to environmental stressors},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {3-15},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding how environmental variation influences even cryptic traits
   is important to clarify the roles of selection and developmental
   constraints in past evolutionary divergence and to predict future
   adaptation under environmental change. Female yellow dung flies
   (Scathophaga stercoraria) typically have three sperm storage
   compartments (3S), but occasionally four (4S). More spermathecae are
   thought to be a female adaptation facilitating sperm sorting after
   mating, but the phenotype is very rare in nature. We manipulated the
   flies' developmental environment by food restriction, pesticides, and
   hot temperatures to investigate the nature and extent of developmental
   plasticity of this trait, and whether spermatheca expression correlates
   with measures of performance and developmental stability, as would be
   expected if 4S expression is a developmental aberration. The
   spermathecal polymorphism of yellow dung fly females is heritable, but
   also highly developmentally plastic, varying strongly with rearing
   conditions. 4S expression is tightly linked to growth rate, and weakly
   positively correlated with fluctuating asymmetry of wings and legs,
   suggesting that the production of a fourth spermatheca could be a
   nonadaptive developmental aberration. However, spermathecal plasticity
   is opposite in the closely related and ecologically similar Scathophaga
   suilla, demonstrating that overexpression of spermathecae under
   developmental stress is not universal. At the same time, we found
   overall mortality costs as well as benefits of 4S pheno- and genotypes
   (also affecting male siblings), suggesting that a life history trade-off
   may potentially moderate 4S expression. We conclude that the release of
   cryptic genetic variation in spermatheca number in the face of strong
   environmental variation may expose hidden traits (here reproductive
   morphology) to natural selection (here under climate warming or food
   augmentation). Once exposed, hidden traits can potentially undergo rapid
   genetic assimilation, even in cases when trait changes are first
   triggered by random errors that destabilize developmental processes.},

Title = {Phylogeny of Membracoidea (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha) based on
   transcriptome data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The suborder Auchenorrhyncha ({''}true hoppers{''}) comprises nearly
   half of known Hemiptera, with >43,000 known species of sap-sucking
   herbivores distributed worldwide, including many important agricultural
   pests and vectors of plant disease. More than half of the known
   Auchenorrhyncha belong to superfamily Membracoidea (leaf- and
   treehoppers), which has been a source of phylogenetic contention for
   many years. To construct an improved backbone phylogeny of this
   superfamily, we obtained transcriptome data for multiple representatives
   of all 5 previously established extant families and nearly all
   subfamilies to test their monophyly and relationships. 138 taxa (132
   Membracoidea and 6 outgroups) were sampled with an emphasis on families
   Cicadellidae and Membracidae, which were paraphyletic as previously
   defined by most authors, several problematic subfamilies (Aphrodinae,
   Eurymelinae, Ledrinae, Nicomiinae, Stegaspidinae and Tartessinae). We
   analysed different combinations of data sets (amino acid, complete
   nucleotide and degeneracy-coded nucleotide) using different modelling
   schemes. The resultant trees based on different analyses are congruent
   in most nodes. Discordant nodes mainly pertain to relationships among
   cicadellid subfamilies and tribal relationships within Aphrodinae and
   Eurymelinae. Analyses of gene- and site concordance factors and quartet
   scores indicate that this instability is largely attributable to an
   overall lack of informative characters across genes and sites rather
   than strongly supported conflict among genes. According to the congruent
   nodes, we make the following revisions: combine Stegaspidinae and
   Centrotinae into a single subfamily, Centrotinae sensu lato; restore
   Stenocotini from Tartessinae to its original position in the Ledrinae;
   and transform Holdgatiella Evans from Nicomiinae to Melizoderinae. In
   addition, to solve the paraphyly of both Cicadellidae and Membracidae, a
   preferred option would be to combine all five previously recognized
   families into a single family, Membracidae sensu lato; the other option
   could be to render Cicadellidae monophyletic by excluding
   Megophthalminae and Ulopinae from Cicadellidae and elevating them to
   status as separate families.},

Title = {Unusual lophophore innervation in ctenostome Flustrellidra hispida
   (Bryozoa)},

Abstract = {Since ctenostomes are traditionally regarded as an ancestral clade to
   some other bryozoan groups, the study of additional species may help to
   clarify questions on bryozoan evolution and phylogeny. One of these
   questions is the bryozoan lophophore evolution: whether it occurred
   through simplification or complication. The morphology and innervation
   of the ctenostome Flustrellidra hispida (Fabricius, 1780) lophophore
   have been studied with electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry with
   confocal laser scanning microscopy. Lophophore nervous system of F.
   hispida consists of several main nerve elements: cerebral ganglion,
   circumoral nerve ring, and the outer nerve ring. Serotonin-like
   immunoreactive perikarya, which connect with the circumoral nerve ring,
   bear the cilium that directs to the abfrontal side of the lophophore and
   extends between tentacle bases. The circumoral nerve ring gives rise to
   the intertentacular and frontal tentacle nerves. The outer nerve ring
   gives rise to the abfrontal neurites, which connect to the outer groups
   of perikarya and contribute to the formation of the abfrontal tentacle
   nerve. The outer nerve ring has been described before in other
   bryozoans, but it never contributes to the innervation of tentacles. The
   presence of the outer nerve ring participating in the innervation of
   tentacles makes the F. hispida lophophore nervous system particularly
   similar to the lophophore nervous system of phoronids. This similarity
   allows to suggest that organization of the F. hispida lophophore nervous
   system may reflect the ancestral state for all bryozoans. The possible
   scenario of evolutionary transformation of the lophophore nervous system
   within bryozoans is suggested.},

Title = {Microbial diversity in marine sediments of two hydrocarbon reservoir

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Microbes are the main drivers of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and
   other elements in marine sediments. The distribution of microorganisms,
   particularly at the centimeter scale, demonstrates the critical role of
   the local biogeochemical environment. The Atlantic Ocean has enormous
   hydrocarbon reserves, yet microbial diversity in hydrocarbon reservoir
   areas, a unique habitat for microorganisms, remains poorly studied. We
   investigated microbial diversity of sediments from the Gulf of Guinea
   and the Namibia Slope, 2 oil and gas reservoir areas of the eastern
   Atlantic Ocean. Microbial diversity was paired with geochemical analyses
   and provided valuable information in understanding and interpreting the
   bacterial and archaeal community structure. Environmental factors,
   especially dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and SO42-, drove the
   microbial community structure in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Methane
   oxidation may be coupled with the reduction of sulfate on the
   continental slope of the Gulf of Guinea, or with nitrate reduction on
   the Namibia Slope. The sediments there provide a suitable habitat for
   microbes. However, the composition of microbial communities varied among
   sites. The microbial diversity and richness in the Gulf of Guinea was
   high, which may correspond to the high concentration of metal ions. The
   metabolism of Gammaproteobacteria may respond to the concentration of
   SO42- and DIC. Asgardarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota could play an
   important role in carbon reactions, and the abundance and metabolism of
   Lokiarchaeota may be related to the concentration of metal ions. These
   findings revealed the microbial diversity and represented a baseline of
   the microbial communities and constriction in this critical area.},

Abstract = {Among the germination affecting factors, germination ecology (GME) and
   seed cleaning stage (SCS) are not well investigated. Hence, this study
   was initiated to evaluate the GME and SCS effect on the seed germination
   performance of two indigenous bamboo species. Pure and impure seed
   samples were taken from the cold room which is adjusted to 5 ??C. Then
   they were sown on prepared media under different conditions. Then the
   GP, MGT, and PV data were computed and then subjected to ANOVA. The
   ANOVA showed that the interaction effect of genotype, GME treatments,
   and SCS was very high (P ??? 0.0001) significant for all studied
   parameters. The germination pattern differences were also observed in
   SCS and GME treatments for both species. Signifi-cantly higher GP (59\%)
   and PV (8.4) were recorded in pure seeds sowed on paper at ambient
   temperature (T1) for O. abyssinica. On the same GME, Y. alpina gave the
   maximum GP (38\%) and PV (2.3) using pure seed. However, significantly
   higher MGT (9) was recorded on GME T1 and T2 using impure seed. Hence,
   pure seed sowed on paper at ambient temperature is advisable for in
   vitro germination test. However, GME having sand media at optimum
   temperature is recommended due to cost-effectiveness and is applicable
   at the community level for seedling production.},

Abstract = {The evolution and distribution of mountain biota are closely linked with
   mountain formation and topographic complexity. Here we explore the
   diversification of cold-tolerant mayflies of the subgenus Epeorus
   (Caucasiron) in the south-eastern Greater Caucasus, an area of dynamic
   changes in topography since the Miocene, driven by the convergence of
   the Greater and Lesser Caucasus. We hypothesized that orogenic processes
   promoted the diversification of E. (Caucasiron) and that the resultant
   diversification pattern followed the timing and progress of mountain
   formation along the range. A new evolutionary lineage of E. (Caucasiron)
   distributed in the central-eastern Greater Caucasus was found and
   described as Epeorus (Caucasiron) tripertitus sp.n. It consists of three
   clades clearly differentiated based on mitochondrial sequence data, but
   indistinguishable by morphological traits. Based on a time-calibrated
   phylogeny using mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (EF, wg, 28S)
   markers, we found that a gradual allopatric diversification of the
   ancestral population of E. (C.) tripertitus sp.n. dated to a period
   lasting from the late Miocene to the Pleistocene spread eastward along
   the range. This pattern corresponded with the process of topographic
   deformation which started in the central part of the range in the
   Miocene and progressed to the east during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. The
   results implied the dominant role of mountain building on the biotic
   diversification of this region and continuing recent speciation in the
   south-eastern part of the mountains.},

Title = {Dense sampling of taxa and characters improves phylogenetic resolution

   Deltocephalinae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {We analysed a phylogenomic dataset comprising 730 terminal taxa and
   >160,000 nucleotide positions obtained using anchored hybrid enrichment
   of genomic DNA for a sample of deltocephaline leafhoppers and outgroups.
   Maximum likelihood analyses of concatenated nucleotide and amino acid
   sequences as well as coalescent gene tree analysis, yielded
   well-resolved phylogenetic estimates that were highly congruent with
   most branches receiving maximum support. Some topological incongruence
   occurs among the trees resulting from different analyses, mainly
   distributed among very short branches at intermediate levels in the
   phylogeny, pertaining to relationships among some tribes and multi-tribe
   lineages restricted to particular continents. Coalescent gene tree
   analysis revealed extensive gene tree conflict at these nodes,
   suggesting that certain relationships may remain difficult to resolve
   consistently even with genome-scale datasets and dense taxon sampling.
   Ancestral character state reconstruction of feeding preference indicates
   that grass specialization has been acquired three or fewer times in some
   highly diverse but relatively derived lineages. Molecular divergence
   time estimation suggests that the earliest divergences in the subfamily
   occurred during the Cretaceous but that most modern tribes did not
   appear until after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary and that grass
   specialist lineages generally diversified and spread at the same time as
   grasslands were becoming widespread globally. These analyses also show a
   high level of global biogeographic structure, with several large
   lineages of primarily arboreal deltocephalines restricted to particular
   regions or continents and long-distance dispersal among continents
   occurring primarily among grass-specialist lineages. The results
   represent a major improvement over previous analyses of this diverse
   subfamily, which were based on 152 or fewer taxa and data from
   morphology and partial sequences of two genes.},

Title = {A quick evaluation of ecological restoration based on arthropod
   communities and trophic guilds in an urban ecological preserve in Mexico
   City},

Abstract = {Background Restoration practices usually emphasize on the structural
   part of the biodiversity; also, most studies have focused on plants and
   very few have been conducted on arthropods and its function after
   restoration. The Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve (PSAER) is a
   protected area immersed in Mexico City and it has been drastically
   affected by different anthropogenic disturbances. The aim of this study
   was to compare the relative diversity, richness, and abundance of
   species level identification, but also the composition through an
   analysis of ordination of taxonomic (species, family, and order level)
   and functional (trophic guild) traits of arthropods in three sites
   subjected to ecological restoration within the PSAER. Restored sites
   were also compared to conserved and disturbed sites, to evaluate whether
   restoration efforts are effective at the reserve. Methods Arthropods
   were sampled using pan traps during September 2013 in 11 sites (three
   restored, four conserved and four disturbed) inside the PSAER. All
   sampled species were taxonomically identified at species of
   morphospecies (inside a family) and assigned to a trophic guild.
   Differences in diversity, richness and abundance were evaluated through
   effective number of species, comparisons of Chao's1 estimated richness
   and a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively. Both taxonomic
   and trophic guild composition were evaluated using a multivariate
   analysis and a post hoc test. Results We found some differences in
   richness, abundance, and diversity between sites, but not a clear
   pattern of differentiation between restored to disturbed sites. The NMDS
   showed differences at species and order level, and with trophic guilds,
   among site types. Families were not useful to differentiate types of
   sites. Regarding guilds, predators were more abundant in conserved
   sites, while phytophagous insects were more abundant in disturbed sites.
   Conclusions Species and order level were useful to identify differences
   in communities of arthropods in sites with different management. The
   trophic guild approach provides information about the functional state
   of the restored sites. Nevertheless, our quick evaluation shows that
   restoration efforts at PSAER have not been successful in differentiate
   restored to disturbed sites yet.},

Abstract = {I observed mobbing of Glaucomys volans (Southern Flying Squirrel), upon
   removal and release from nesting boxes designed for them, by various
   bird species (1-9 total individual birds) on 33 occasions during winter
   surveys for the squirrels in southeast Ohio. I observed instances of
   mobbing by 1-3 species of primary and/or secondary cavity-nesting
   songbirds and woodpeckers. Mobbing behavior included flights within 1-2
   m of a flying squirrel briefly positioned on a tree trunk as well as
   vocalizations. Mobbing episodes lasted 5-180 seconds, which largely
   depended on the amount of time a flying squirrel remained visible before
   retreating into a natural cavity. In light of the mobbing response
   reported here, perhaps more consideration should be given to the
   potential impacts that Southern Flying Squirrels may have on bird
   communities.},

Abstract = {In June 2020, we monitored a nest in Southampton, MA, that contained 2
   Dumetella carolinensis (Gray Catbird) and 3 Turdus migratorius (American
   Robin) eggs. Females of both species alternately incubated the mixed
   clutch, and 2 catbird and 2 robin young successfully hatched and fledged
   from the nest. Adults of both species provided both intra- and
   interspecific parental care (e.g., nestling provisioning, brooding, and
   nest sanitation). The catbirds, in particular, often did not
   preferentially provision their own young. In fact, following earlier
   fledging of the catbird young, an adult catbird continued to visit the
   nest to care for the robin nestlings, including fecal sac removal on at
   least 2 occasions. After the 2 robin young fledged, we did not observe
   any crossover post-fledging care. Our study represents the most detailed
   and protracted account among the very few documented cases of nest
   sharing between these species.},

Title = {A Preliminary Study of Foraging Habitat Use by Nesting Barn Swallows in
   Massachusetts},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-107},
Abstract = {Hirundo rustica (Barn Swallow) belongs to a suite of aerial insectivores
   that are showing serious population declines in northeastern North
   America. Various causes of these declines have been postulated,
   especially including agricultural intensification, declining insect
   populations, and/or increased mortality associated with climate changes.
   In this study, we examined foraging behavior of Barn Swallows nesting in
   a large breeding colony located in western Massachusetts. Swallows
   foraged primarily within 1 km of their nesting site. Most of the nearby
   agricultural areas used by foraging swallows were broadly characterized
   as pasture/hay or cultivated land uses; we found no significant
   difference in foraging activity levels between these habitat categories.
   In addition to the availability of suitable nesting structures,
   successful conservation of Barn Swallows likely requires that breeding
   colonies have access to nearby fields which provide foraging
   opportunities. Further study is needed to clarify specific habitat
   management that will enhance populations of flying insects preyed upon
   by swallows and other aerial insectivores.},

Abstract = {Marine transport has the potential to alter the geographic range of
   microorganisms through ballast water movement. Recent
   culture-independent studies investigated the bacteriome of ballast
   water, but no prior studies have examined the mycobiome. Here were
   examined 60 ballast and harbor samples from 4 major ports and 5 ocean
   samples using culture-independent techniques to determine (1) the
   composition of harbor and ballast water mycobiomes; (2) if ballast
   contained human and environmentally relevant fungal pathogens; and (3)
   the potential risk of introduction to coastal ecosystems. Results
   indicate that ballast water and harbor water contain a diverse mycobiome
   and that ballast water may contain fungal taxa that are relevant human
   and marine fish pathogens. Fungal genera were identified that contain
   known coral and coastal plant pathogen species; however, species-level
   identification of these potential pathogens could not be conclusively
   resolved. Ballast and harbor mycobiomes contained similar taxa,
   suggesting that environmental filtering may not inhibit the spread of
   fungal taxa between these ecosystems. This study highlights the
   potential risks of ballast movement and suggests further research of the
   ballast mycobiome is needed.},

Abstract = {In this study, a model for the spread of cyst echinococcosis with
   interventions is formulated. The disease-free and endemic equilibrium
   points of the model are calculated. The control reproduction number R-c
   for the model is derived, and the global dynamics are established by the
   values of R-c. The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically
   stable if and only if R-c < 1. For R-c > 1, using Volterra-Lyapunov
   stable matrices, it is proven that the endemic equilibrium is globally
   asymptotically stable. Sensitivity analysis to identify the most
   influential parameters in the dynamics of CE is carried out. To
   establish the long-term behaviour of the disease, numerical simulations
   are performed. The impact of control strategies is investigated. It is
   shown that, whenever vaccination of sheep is carried out solely or in
   combination with cleaning or disinfecting of the environment, cyst
   echinococcosis can be wiped out.},

Abstract = {We fit an SARS-CoV-2 model to US data of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We
   conclude that the model is not structurally identifiable. We make the
   model identifiable by prefixing some of the parameters from external
   information. Practical identifiability of the model through Monte Carlo
   simulations reveals that two of the parameters may not be practically
   identifiable. With thus identified parameters, we set up an optimal
   control problem with social distancing and isolation as control
   variables. We investigate two scenarios: the controls are applied for
   the entire duration and the controls are applied only for the period of
   time. Our results show that if the controls are applied early in the
   epidemic, the reduction in the infected classes is at least an order of
   magnitude higher compared to when controls are applied with 2-week
   delay. Further, removing the controls before the pandemic ends leads to
   rebound of the infected classes.},

Abstract = {This study examines species composition, diversity and plant community
   distribution along environmental gradients of Tulu Lafto Forest (here
   after called TLF) in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone of Oromia National
   Regional State, western Ethiopia. Seventy-five quadrats of 400 m(2) were
   systematically laid following altitudinal gradient. A complete list of
   trees, shrubs, lianas and herbs including vascular epiphytes were made
   from each quadrat. Environmental variables including soil samples were
   collected, recorded and analyzed for each quadrat. In the forest, 230
   plant species belonging to 188 genera and 79 families were identified.
   Out of these, 16 species are endemic to the flora of Ethiopia and
   Eritrea and 56 were new records for Wollega (WG) floristic region.
   Asteraceae and Fabaceae are the top species rich plant families. Cluster
   analysis and ordination methods identified 3 plant community types
   mainly influenced by topographic, edaphic and anthropogenic factors. TLF
   exhibited an intermediate Afromontane type suggesting the need to revise
   the existing vegetation classification in the country.},

Abstract = {We investigate a mosquito population suppression model, which includes

   assuming the release waiting period T is larger than the sexual lifespan
   (T) over bar of Wolbachia-infected males, we derive four thresholds: the
   CI intensity threshold s(h){*}, the release amount thresholds g{*} and
   c{*}, and the waiting period threshold T{*}. From a biological view, we
   assume s(h) > s(h){*} throughout the paper. When g{*} < c < c{*}, we
   prove the origin E-0 is locally asymptotically stable iff T < T {*}, and
   the model admits a unique T-periodic solution iff T >= T {*}, which is
   globally asymptotically stable. When c >= c{*}, we show the origin E-0

Abstract = {This article is concerned with the dynamics of malaria infection model

   which characterize the stability of the disease free equilibrium and
   infection equilibrium (with or without immune response). In addition,
   fluctuations occur when the model undergoes Hopf bifurcation as the
   delay passes through a certain critical value tau(0). In this case,
   periodic oscillation appears near the positive steady state, which
   implies the recurrent attacks of disease. Finally, numerical simulations

   estuary during seasonal hypoxia},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {61-79},
Abstract = {Eutrophication and hypoxia markedly alter trophic dynamics and nutrient
   cycling in estuarine water columns, but little is known about the
   microbial communities that drive and interact with these changes. Here
   we studied microbial plankton (bacteria, archaea, protists and
   micro-metazoans) in a large temperate estuary where bottom hypoxia
   occurs every summer due to warmer temperatures, stratification, and
   oxidation of organic matter fueled by nutrient enrichment. We used
   high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes (V4 region) and
   quantified multiple abiotic and biotic factors in surface and bottom
   waters during the summer of 2019. The conditions associated with the
   intensification of hypoxia in bottom waters as the summer progressed
   were linked to significant changes in the diversity, community structure
   and potential functioning of microbial communities. Under maximum
   hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration: 0.9-3.1 mg 1(-1)), there were
   increased proportions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacterivorous
   and parasitic protists, and copepod nauplii. Sequence proportions of AOA
   (Nitrosopumilus) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospinaceae) were
   significantly correlated with the concentration of oxidized N species
   (nitrite plus nitrate, which peaked at 14.4 mu M) and the proportions of
   nauplii DNA sequences and biomass. Our data support a tight coupling of
   biogeochemical and food web processes, with rapid oxidation of ammonia
   and accumulation of oxidized N species as hypoxia intensifies during the
   summer.},

   relationships and future perspectives},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-298},
Abstract = {Aims: We aimed to detect the environmental drivers conditioning plant
   diversity and to predict how modifications in habitat conditions and
   ongoing global warming could lead to vegetation changes or biodiversity
   losses in a region especially rich in peatlands despite its relatively
   low latitude. Study area: The study area was located in the Northern
   Apennines, Northern Italy (about 44 degrees 45' N; 10 degrees 20' E).
   The vegetation study was carried out at 12 peatland sites where 206
   plots were set up. Species composition in the 206 plots were recorded in
   the field and classified with cluster analysis. Data on hydrology, water
   chemistry and peat chemistry were collected at a subset of 127 plots and
   statistically analysed by a multivariate ordination method. Species
   richness and evenness were calculated for all plots. Relationships
   between species composition and environmental variables were analysed by
   stepwise multiple regression. Results: The cluster analysis defined 17
   vegetation units. Water table depth represented the major environmental
   factors accounting for vegetation patterns, with the vegetation units
   being grouped in four main blocks based on vegetation physiognomy and
   species composition: Sphagnum hummocks, Sphagnum lawns, fens and pools.
   Water chemistry and peat chemistry both presented moderate variations
   among the vegetation units with mean water pH ranging from 4.9 to 6.3.
   Concentrations of major cations in the pore water showed that all of the
   habitats investigated were influenced by telluric water, with no
   evidence of ombrotrophic conditions. Species richness and evenness both
   presented poor relations with the environment while responses of
   individual species to environmental factors were more informative on
   vegetation changes triggered by climate change. Conclusions: Prolonged
   drought events associated with high temperature in summer months are
   expected to exert a strong impact on peatland vegetation. The main
   effect of climate change on the vegetation of the peatlands investigated
   consists in the spreading of vascular plants at the expense of Sphagnum
   mosses.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we are concerned with an epidemic model with quarantine
   and distributed time delay. We define the basic reproduction number R-0
   and show that if R-0 <= 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally
   asymptotically stable, whereas if R-0 > 1, then it is unstable and there
   exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We obtain sufficient conditions for
   a Hopf bifurcation that induces a nontrivial periodic solution which
   represents recurrent epidemic waves. By numerical simulations, we
   illustrate stability and instability parameter regions. Our results
   suggest that the quarantine and time delay play important roles in the
   occurrence of recurrent epidemic waves.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {596-618},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {SIRS models capture transmission dynamics of infectious diseases for
   which immunity is not lifelong. Extending these models by a W
   compartment for individuals with waning immunity, the boosting of the
   immune system upon repeated exposure may be incorporated. Previous
   analyses assumed identical waning rates from R to W and from W to S.
   This implicitly assumes equal length for the period of full immunity and
   of waned immunity. We relax this restriction, and allow an asymmetric
   partitioning of the total immune period. Stability switches of the
   endemic equilibrium are investigated with a combination of analytic and
   numerical tools. Then, continuation methods are applied to track
   bifurcations along the equilibrium branch. We find rich dynamics: Hopf
   bifurcations, endemic double bubbles, and regions of bistability. Our
   results highlight that the length of the period in which waning immunity
   can be boosted is a crucial parameter significantly influencing long
   term epidemiological dynamics.},

Abstract = {We monitored the reproduction, dispersal, and regeneration of a wild
   population of Castanea dentata (American Chestnut), established from 4
   seed-bearing trees planted in a western Maine forest in 1982. The
   40-year-old parent trees, sourced from wild stock of a relict population
   in northern Michigan, show no obvious signs of blight and have been
   producing viable seeds now for >20 years. Over the course of 2 surveys
   conducted in 2019 and 2020, we mapped and measured 1348 offspring,
   varying in size from seedlings to nearly mature trees. As of October
   2020, the natural spread of this population had expanded to at least 370
   m from the parent trees, with an average dispersal distance of 124 m.
   While previous publications have focused on the scatter-hoarding
   behavior that gave rise to this expanding wild population, we report on
   possible factors affecting their spread, their fate, and prognosis for
   the future. Given the absence of other reproductive populations of
   American Chestnut in the immediate vicinity, our data provide rare
   insights into natural seed dispersal from a known point of origin while
   documenting the return of a functionally extinct species to a northern
   hardwood forest ecosystem.},

Title = {Midge Larvae Metriocnemus knabi Can Emigrate to New Pitchers Within

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many experimental aquatic ecologists are familiar with the commonly used
   model system Sarracenia purpurea (Purple Pitcher Plant), as this plant
   contains an entire aquatic ecosystem with obligate invertebrates in its
   pitcher-shaped leaves. An obligate herbivore of the Purple Pitcher
   Plant, Exyra fax (Pitcher Mining Moth), consumes plant tissue and chews
   a hole at the base of the pitcher, draining the pitcher of fluid and
   thereby creating unsuitable habitat for obligate aquatic invertebrates.
   Historically, it has been noted that the obligate aquatic invertebrate
   larvae within the Purple Pitcher Plant are incapable of leaving the
   pitcher they were initially deposited in as eggs. The objective of this
   experiment was to determine if larvae of the obligate invertebrate
   Metriocnemus knabi (Pitcher Plant Midge) is capable of emigrating to new
   pitchers when faced with pitcher drainage as a result of damage from the
   Pitcher Mining Moth. We placed midge larvae of varying abundances in
   experimental pitchers that were drained in a way similar to the work of
   Pitcher Mining Moth larvae. After drainage, larval midges were allowed 2
   weeks to emigrate. At the end of 2 weeks, as much as 38.2\% of the
   initial abundance of M. knabi larvae had emigrated out of drained
   pitchers to new, viable, fluid-filled pitchers and survived. We present
   here the first evidence that the obligate Pitcher Plant Midge larvae are
   capable of emigration when faced with unsuitable habitat.},

   treated) in 2009 and 2018. Percent dead hemlock increased 11\%,
   regardless of chemical treatment. Hemlock had higher vigor in treated
   sites, but a hemlock-decline index did not differ by treatment. None of
   6 indicator bird species showed a significant population response to
   chemical treatments. Setophaga virens (Black-throated Green Warbler)
   declined between years across treated and untreated sites, whereas
   Contopus virens (Eastern Wood-Pewee) increased between years. Treatments
   positively affected individual hemlocks, but this did not carry over to
   influence avian species. Hemlock health may need to decline below some
   threshold before avian species respond.},

Abstract = {Climate change in mountains can vary with elevation, but there is a

   temperatures, changing winters, and extended growing seasons.
   Differences occur with weaker winter warming on the summit, and
   snow-related indicators providing unclear results for wind-influenced
   upper elevations. Recommendations for distributed monitoring,
   particularly for snow metrics, are encouraged for an improved
   understanding of the complex climate-change response on the mountains in

Title = {A genome-wide phylogeny and the diversification of genus Liriomyza

Abstract = {The genus Liriomyza Mik (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a diverse and globally
   distributed group of acalyptrate flies. Phylogenetic relationships among
   Liriomyza species have remained incompletely investigated and have never
   been fully addressed using molecular data. Here, we reconstruct the
   phylogeny of the genus Liriomyza using various phylogenetic methods
   (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and gene tree coalescence) on
   target-capture-based phylogenomic datasets (nucleotides and amino acids)
   obtained from anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE). We have recovered tree
   topologies that are nearly congruent across all data types and methods,
   and individual clade support is strong across all phylogenetic analyses.
   Moreover, defined morphological species groups and clades are
   well-supported in our best estimates of the molecular phylogeny.
   Liriomyza violivora (Spencer) is a sister group to all remaining sampled
   Liriomyza species, and the well-known polyphagous vegetable pests {[}L.
   huidobrensis (Blanchard), L. langei Frick, L. bryoniae. (Kaltenbach), L.
   trifolii (Burgess), L. sativae Blanchard, and L. brassicae (Riley)].
   belong to multiple clades that are not particularly closely related on
   the trees. Often, closely related Liriomyza species feed on distantly
   related host plants. We reject the hypothesis that cophylogenetic
   processes between Liriomyza species and their host plants drive
   diversification in this genus. Instead, Liriomyza exhibits a widespread
   pattern of major host shifts across plant taxa. Our new phylogenetic
   estimate for Liriomyza species provides considerable new information on
   the evolution of host-use patterns in this genus. In addition, it
   provides a framework for further study of the morphology, ecology, and
   diversification of these important flies.},

Title = {Systematic revision, molecular phylogeny and biogeography of the antlion
   tribe Acanthoplectrini (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae: Dendroleontinae),

Abstract = {The tribe Acanthoplectrini (Myrmeleontidae: Dendroleontinae) includes a
   group of antlion genera widely distributed across the Australasian and
   Oriental regions. The intergeneric and interspecific relationships
   between or within the Australian and Oriental lineages of this tribe as
   well as their historical biogeography remain largely unexplored. Here,
   we present a molecular phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of
   Acanthoplectrini to infer the diversification history of this tribe,
   with emphasis on the Oriental lineage. Both the Oriental and Australian
   lineages are monophyletic and recovered as sister groups. Ancestral area
   reconstruction suggests that the ancestor of Acanthoplectrini might have
   been once widely distributed from Indochina to Australia and then split
   into the Oriental and Australian lineages during the early-Miocene. Our
   analyses recovered northeastern Indochina and south China as the
   ancestral range of the Oriental Acanthoplectrini. During the mid-Miocene
   to the mid-Pliocene, orographic events such as the rising of mountain
   ranges (including the Himalayas) and the formation of major islands in
   southeastern Asia triggered several dispersal and vicariance events in
   the Oriental Acanthoplectrini, driving their speciation. We revise the
   classification of the Oriental Acanthoplectrini, establishing the new
   genus Paralayahima gen. n., which is recovered sister to Layahima Navas.
   Moreover, we describe four new species of Layahima, Layahima aspoeckorum
   sp. n., Layahima monba sp. n., Layahima lhoba sp. n. and Layahima
   xinliae sp. n., and we reinstate two previously synonymized species,
   Layahima melanocoris (Yang) stat. rev. and comb. n. and Layahima
   nebulosa Navas stat. rev.},

Title = {Impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on plankton ciliates from a
   saline lowland river in South America},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {43-59},
Abstract = {We analyzed the structure and dynamics of plankton ciliates from the
   Salado River, Buenos Aires (Argentina), during El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation events, to evaluate their response to alterations of certain
   environmental variables during these climatic phenomena. The basin
   exhibits intense land use at the headwaters and fluctuating salinity
   along the main channel, canals and tributaries. During El Nino
   (1997-1998), heavy rainfall caused high discharge, and low mean
   conductivity values were recorded along with low mean abundances in the
   entire basin. During neutral (2004-2005) and La Nina (2007-2009) events,
   the discharge was reduced, and mean conductivity was double the values
   recorded during El Nino, with maxima of mean abundances and diversity at
   the headwaters and the lower basin. The most abundant ciliates were
   tintinnids, heterotrichs and peritrichs. Species replacement was
   detected along the river system, mainly during the neutral event. At the
   headwaters and canals, abundance peaks of certain species were
   attributed to the strong human impact (nutrients and sewage inputs) and
   increased salinity, allowing the establishment of euryhaline ciliates.
   In the middle basin, freshwater species predominated, although less
   abundantly due to higher water flow. The mouth sector showed abundance
   peaks of an estuarine tintinnid. Temperature, conductivity and suspended
   solids were the most important variables driving ciliate structure. High
   discharge as a result of heavy rainfall during El Nino negatively
   influenced ciliate assemblages. In contrast, low water conditions during
   the other events allowed the development of diverse assemblages,
   increasing species number and abundance of particular species.},

   control techniques for virotherapy. Both controllers are designed to
   bring global stability to the cancer system with the aid of a quadratic
   Lyapunov function. Furthermore, we use simulations to verify our
   controllers. Moreover, we show that our adaptive control technique gives

Abstract = {In this study we compare seven mathematical models of tumour growth
   using nonlinear mixed-effects which allows for a simultaneous fitting of
   multiple data and an estimation of both mean behaviour and variability.
   This is performed for two large datasets, a patient-derived xenograft
   (PDX) dataset consisting of 220 PDXs spanning six different tumour types
   and a cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) dataset consisting of 25 cell
   lines spanning eight tumour types. Comparison of the models is performed
   by means of visual predictive checks (VPCs) as well as the Akaike
   Information Criterion (AIC). Additionally, we fit the models to 500
   bootstrap samples drawn from the datasets to expand the comparison of
   the models under dataset perturbations and understand the growth
   kinetics that are best fitted by each model. Through qualitative and
   quantitative metrics the best models are identified the effectiveness
   and practicality of simpler models is highlighted},

Abstract = {A new genus of Neotropical Satyrinae butterflies, Viloriodes Pyrcz \&
   Espeland gen. n. is described in the Pedaliodes Butler complex
   comprising 11-13 genera and more than 400 species. Support for the new
   genus is provided by a phylogenetic analysis based on target enrichment
   (TE) data including 618 nuclear loci with a total of 248,940
   nucleotides, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
   (COI). Five species, whose DNA sequences were obtained by TE during this
   study, form a strongly supported clade sister to the large clade
   comprising Pedaliodes and four other genera. Complementary COI analysis
   confirms the monophyly of Viloriodes gen. n., with the above five plus
   eight other species clustering in highly supported clades in both
   Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses, and a TE + COI
   concatenated tree. Based on molecular and morphological data, 30 species
   are assigned to Viloriodes gen. n. The new genus can be recognized by a
   set of subtle morphological characteristics of colour patterns and male
   and female genitalia. An analysis of divergence times indicates that
   Viloriodes gen. n. and Steromapedaliodes Forster separated around 5.9
   Mya. Viloriodes gen. n. has a wider geographic distribution than any
   other genus of the Pedaliodes complex, being found from central Mexico
   to northern Argentina and to the Guyana Shield, typically occurring at
   lower elevations than Pedaliodes.},

Abstract = {The use of baited remote underwater video surveys (BRUVS) has become
   increasingly prevalent in temperate ecosystems in recent years as this
   technique provides data on ecosystem structure and species composition.
   To date, no BRUVS have been performed in the Saco Bay due to natural
   obstacles within the region. Our modified BRUVS resulted in 66 hours of
   video recorded over 2 sampling periods with 17 different species of
   various taxa observed. A total of 623 individuals was observed based on
   MaxN. These baited remote underwater video surveys successfully provided
   ecosystem data; therefore, we suggest that it would be an ideal
   complementary sampling method for this region.},

Abstract = {Nature- based tourism is an important economic industry for Maine, with
   winter tourism especially vulnerable to climate change. Perceptions of
   risk due to climate change can influence stakeholder decisions to
   respond (adapt or mitigate) to climate change. We used phenomenology to
   study how nature- based tourism stakeholders perceive their risk to
   climate change and how they are responding. We conducted 20
   semi-structured stakeholder interviews in Western Maine. We analyzed
   interviews using interpretive phenomenological analysis. A key theme was
   that of uncertainty of the causes of climate change, impacts to the
   region, and whether or not experienced environmental changes were
   related to climate change. Participants showed a need for information
   about climate change specific to the study region to facilitate the
   adoption of more strategies to bolster the adaptive capacity of the
   destination.},

Abstract = {In this paper we assess the effectiveness of different
   non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 utilizing a
   compartmental model. The local asymptotic stability of equilibria
   (disease-free and endemic) in terms of the basic reproduction number
   have been determined. We find that the system undergoes a backward
   bifurcation in the case of imperfect quarantine. The parameters of the
   model have been estimated from the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
   India. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number has been
   performed. The findings also suggest that effectiveness of face masks
   plays a significant role in reducing the COVID-19 prevalence in India.
   Optimal control problem with several control strategies has been
   investigated. We find that the intervention strategies including
   implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and awareness only, has
   the highest cost-effectiveness in controlling the infection. This
   combined strategy also has the least value of average cost-effectiveness
   ratio (ACER) and associated cost.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the actual background of the susceptible population being
   directly patients after inhaling a certain amount of PM2.5 is taken into
   account. The concentration response function of PM2.5 is introduced, and
   the SISP respiratory disease model is proposed. Qualitative theoretical
   analysis proves that the existence, local stability and global stability
   of the equilibria are all related to the daily emission P-0 of PM2.5 and
   PM2.5 pathogenic threshold K. Based on the sensitivity factor analysis
   and time-varying sensitivity analysis of parameters on the number of
   patients, it is found that the conversion rate beta and the inhalation
   rate eta has the largest positive correlation. The cure rate gamma of
   infected persons has the greatest negative correlation on the number of
   patients. The control strategy formulated by the analysis results of
   optimal control theory is as follows: The first step is to improve the
   clearance rate of PM2.5 by reducing the PM2.5 emissions and increasing
   the intensity of dust removal. Moreover, such removal work must be
   maintained for a long time. The second step is to improve the cure rate
   of patients by being treated in time. After that, people should be
   reminded to wear masks and go out less so as to reduce the conversion
   rate of susceptible people becoming patients.},

Title = {Dynamics of a multi-strain malaria model with diffusion in a periodic

Abstract = {This paper mainly explores the complex impacts of spatial heterogeneity,
   vector-bias effect, multiple strains, temperature-dependent extrinsic
   incubation period (EIP) and seasonality on malaria transmission. We
   propose a multi-strain malaria transmission model with diffusion and
   periodic delays and define the reproduction numbers R-i and (R) over cap
   (i = 1, 2). Quantitative analysis indicates that the disease-free
   omega-periodic solution is globally attractive when R (i) < 1 , while if
   R (i) > 1 > R j ( i not equal j , i , j = 1 , 2 ), then strain i
   persists and strain j dies out. More interestingly, when R-1 and R-2 are
   greater than 1, the competitive exclusion of the two strains also
   occurs. Additionally, in a heterogeneous environment, the coexistence
   conditions of the two strains are (R) over cap (1) > 1 and (R) over cap
   (2) > 1 . Numerical simulations verify the analytical results and reveal
   that ignoring vector-bias effect or seasonality when studying malaria
   transmission will underestimate the risk of disease transmission.},

Title = {Within-individual leaf allometry and the evolution of leaf morphology: A
   multilevel analysis of leaf allometry in temperate Viburnum (Adoxaceae)
   species},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {145-157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A critical issue in evolutionary biology is understanding the
   relationship between macroevolutionary patterns of diversity and the
   origin of variation at the organismal level. Among-individual allometry,
   the relationship between the size and shape of a structure among
   organisms at a fixed developmental stage, is often similar to
   evolutionary allometry, the relationship between the size and shape of a
   structure among populations or species, and the genetic and
   developmental process that underlie allometric relationships at both
   levels are thought to influence evolutionary diversification. Metameric
   organisms present an additional level of allometry: the relationship
   between the size and shape of structures within individuals. We propose
   that within-individual allometry is also related to evolutionary
   diversification among metameric organisms. We explore this idea in
   temperate deciduous Viburnum (Adoxaceae) species that bear two types of
   leaves, that is, preformed and neoformed leaves, with contrasting
   patterns of development. Examination of within-individual,
   among-individual, among-population, and among-species allometry of leaf
   shape in both leaf types showed that the slopes of all allometric
   relationships were significantly different from isometry, and their sign
   was consistent across allometric hierarchies. Although the allometric
   slope of preformed leaves was constant across allometry levels, the
   allometric slope of neoformed leaves became increasingly steeper. We
   suggest that allometric variation underlying evolutionary
   diversification in metameric organisms may manifest among individuals
   and also among their repeated structures. Moreover, structures with
   contrasting patterns of development within metameric organisms can
   experience different degrees of developmental constraint, and this can
   in turn affect morphological diversification.},

Title = {Fishes of Northern New York and the Adirondacks},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1-46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the fishes of northern New York can help with conservation
   planning and landscape interpretations. This report draws from fish
   surveys from the 1930s to 2018 to summarize and interpret the
   distribution of fishes in the region surrounding and including the
   Adirondacks. The study area, with its broad elevational gradient,
   includes lowland and upland ecoregions, for which we compare fish
   assemblages. Lowlands are the waters downstream of historic barriers to
   migration into the uplands (elevations of 62-215 m, depending on
   landscape slope). Uplands are the waters at higher elevations than the
   lowlands (above 168 m) that include the transitional and Adirondacks'
   elevations (above 305 m). In total, 114 fish species and 2 hybrids have
   been documented in northern New York; for the sake of convenience, the
   hybrids are tabulated as species here. Of the 116 taxa, 111 are in
   lowlands. Eighty percent are native to New York State, although patterns
   of nativity differ between the lowlands and the uplands. Specifically,
   natives make up 80\% of the lowland group and 51\% of upland group. Many
   of the species that are native to the lowlands do not occur naturally in
   the uplands, becoming widespread there only after transferal or
   stocking. The continued expansion of non-native species has caused
   changes in fish communities and losses of native species. In the
   uplands, 3 native species have been lost and 3 others dramatically
   reduced. In the lowlands, there has been relatively little change in
   species status over time. Brief annotations are provided for each of the
   116 taxa, including summaries of recent studies, changes in their status
   before and after December 1989, and proposed conservation
   classifications.},

Abstract = {Marine macroalgae are a polyphyletic group of photosynthetic eukaryotes
   and play critical roles in oxygen production, as primary producers, and
   in providing physical habitat structure. They harbor diverse microbial
   communities, including mutualistic, commensalistic, and parasitic fungi.
   These fungi may be obligately or facultatively marine and symbiotic. In
   this investigation, we isolated endophytic algicolous fungi from marine
   macroalgae collected from 5 intertidal sites in Nova Scotia. Fungi were
   cultured from surface-sterilized algal tissue and identified using ITS
   rDNA barcoding. From 21 marine macroalgal species collected, 11 algal
   species harbored endophytic fungi. We identified 23 endophytic
   algicolous fungi from the Bay of Fundy and Atlantic coasts of Nova
   Scotia. Marine endophytes are a promising new resource for bioactive
   compounds.},

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In North America, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) has
   experienced precipitous declines from white-nose syndrome. As these bats
   become rare and difficult to capture, additional day-roost assessments
   to inform management may fill gaps in our understanding, particularly in
   habitats and regions where such roosts have never been surveyed. Over 2
   summers, we radio-tracked 16 individuals from a maternity colony on Long
   Island, NY, in a small forested patch surrounded by development and
   ocean. These bats disproportionately selected small, suppressed Robinia
   pseudoacacia (Black Locust) trees or snags for roosting. Generally,
   roosts occurred within the interior or edges of this forest patch,
   rather than surrounding suburbia, reinforcing the hypothesis that
   Northern Long-eared Bats are forest adapted. Our study shows even small
   tracts of forest in coastal, urban areas may have conservation value in
   providing day-roost and foraging habitat.},

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},

Abstract = {Along the river-ocean transition, few freshwater species persist into

   During surveys of fish and crustaceans in Prince Edward Island (PEI), we
   noted 3 unexpected insect species from within subtidal-channels.
   Multiple instars of Coenagrionidae n. det. and Enallagma civile
   (Familiar Bluet) were collected around marine macroalgae at 5 localities
   with 6-26 PSU salinities and observed emerging atop macroalgae. Also,
   collections of the larvae of the caddisfly Limnephilus externus
   (Limniphilidae), and adult Haliplus cribrarius (IIaliplidae) beetles at
   sites with maxima of 23 and 20 PSU, respectively, suggest rare
   occurrences of these species within estuarine ecotones.},

   surveys detected 7 PIT-tagged individuals: 1 Lesser Siren moved 36.9 m
   over 8 months. Capture success increased with warmer minimum water
   temperature. Body size upon first capture was unrelated to the
   microenvironment of the trap location. We recommend monitoring programs

Abstract = {HIV is a virus that weakens a person's immune system. HIV has three
   stages, and AIDS is the most severe stage of HIV (Stage 3). People with
   HIV should take medicine (called ART) recommended by WHO as soon as
   possible to reduce the amount of virus in the body. In this paper, we
   formulate a mathematical model for HIV/AIDS with a new approach by
   focusing on two groups of infectious individuals, HIV and AIDS. We also
   introduce a controlled class (treated patients and being monitored), and
   people in this class can spread the disease. We further investigate the
   essential dynamics of the model through an equilibrium analysis. Optimal
   control theory is applied to explore effective treatment strategies by
   combining two control measures: standard antiretroviral therapy and AIDS
   treatments. Numerical simulation results show the effects of the two
   time-dependent controls, and they can be used as guidelines for public
   health interventions.},

Abstract = {Understanding the spread of pathogens through the environment is
   critical to a fuller comprehension of disease dynamics. However, many
   mathematical models of disease dynamics ignore spatial effects. We seek
   to expand knowledge around the interaction between the bare-nosed wombat
   (Vombatus ursinus) and sarcoptic mange (etiologic agent Sarcoptes
   scabiei), by extending an aspatial mathematical model to include spatial
   variation. S. scabiei was found to move through our modelled region as a
   spatio-temporal travelling wave, leaving behind pockets of localized
   host extinction, consistent with field observations. The speed of
   infection spread was also comparable with field research. Our model
   predicts that the inclusion of spatial dynamics leads to the survival
   and recovery of affected wombat populations when an aspatial model
   predicts extinction. Collectively, this research demonstrates how
   environmentally transmitted S. scabiei can result in travelling wave
   dynamics, and that inclusion of spatial variation reveals a more
   resilient host population than aspatial modelling approaches.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we derive a delayed epidemic model to describe the
   characterization of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune
   response against virus infection. The stability of equilibria and the
   existence of Hopf bifurcation are analysed. Theoretical results reveal
   that if the basic reproductive number is greater than 1, the positive
   equilibrium may lose its stability and the bifurcated periodic solution
   occurs when time delay is taken as the bifurcation parameter.
   Furthermore, we investigate an optimal control problem according to the
   delayed model based on the available therapy for hepatitis B infection.
   With the aim of minimizing the infected cells and viral load with
   consideration for the treatment costs, the optimal solution is discussed
   analytically. For the case when periodic solution occurs, numerical
   simulations are performed to suggest the optimal therapeutic strategy
   and compare the model-predicted consequences.},

Title = {Multigene phylogeny of blister beetles (Coleoptera, Meloidae) reveals

Abstract = {Meloidae is a beetle family with about 3000 species divided into three
   subfamilies and 16 tribes. Included is the tribe Lyttini containing 33
   genera and about 400 species. However, the boundaries of Lyttini have
   proved hard to define since the systematics of this tribe have
   repeatedly changed. In this study, we investigated the phylogeny of
   Lyttini and tested for its monophyly based on a comprehensive molecular
   dataset of mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (CAD and 28S) genes
   including 57 genera and 385 species representing most of the tribes of
   Meloidae. Further phylogenetic analyses were performed on a reduced
   taxon set (51 genera and 135 species covering 60\% of the generic
   diversity of Lyttini) in order to maximize the number of loci and
   minimize missing data. Phylogenetic results strongly supported the
   monophyly of most of the tribes of the subfamily Meloinae, apart from
   Lyttini, which is split into 11 phylogenetically distinct lineages
   scattered throughout the tree. Based on these results, we restrict the
   tribe Lyttini to the genera Alosimus Mulsant, Lydus Dejan, Lytta
   Fabricius, Muzimes Mulsant \& Rey and Oenas Latreille, all exclusive to
   the Holarctic region. The relationships among the remaining genera
   previously included in Lyttini and the other 10 lineages representing
   `non-Lyttini' tribes remain to be clarified. This study also provides a
   number of nomenclatural acts {[}including Pseudolytta n. stat.; Lytta
   (Taurilytta) n. subgen.; Lytta (Teratolytta) n.stat.; Mimovesperus

Abstract = {With extensive and ongoing human development in coastal areas, effective
   shoreline-protection strategies against erosion and rising sea level
   that also provide natural ecosystem services will become increasingly
   important. Constructed living shoreline marshes can serve as successful
   management solutions when implemented correctly, but studies comparing
   these created estuarine habitats to their natural marsh counterparts are
   needed to assess their ecological functionality. We compared adult
   Palaemonetes pugio (Daggerblade Grass Shrimp) population demographics
   and diets from 13 pairs of living shoreline and natural marsh sites in
   the southwestern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. No significant
   differences were observed in demographics including abundance, weight,
   length, number of gravid females, and egg abundance and quality.
   Gut-content analysis detected significantly more terrestrial debris in
   shrimp from living shorelines, but the omnivorous dietary needs appeared
   met in all marsh sites. Overall, shrimp populations differed more among
   site pairs from different shorescape settings than between created and
   natural marshes from the same settings, suggesting that living
   shorelines are approaching ecosystem functionality similar to natural
   marsh habitats. However, the observed negative effect of agricultural
   land use on shrimp abundance and the discovery of microplastics in gut
   contents from all sites sampled indicate the need for further
   consideration of human impacts in both constructed and natural coastal
   habitats.},

   Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an
   adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD,
   located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This
   finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal
   Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this
   species in the era of WNS.},

Abstract = {Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) (Brook Trout) abundance and
   distribution have declined in much of their native range in the eastern
   United States, with most intact habitats concentrated in the northern

   and the 2000s (2005 to 2016) to quantify changes in the abundance and
   distribution of Brook Trout in Vermont over the last half century. We
   also investigated whether Brook Trout's co-occurrence with Salmo trutta
   (Brown Trout) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout) in the 1950s
   influenced their abundance in the 2000s and, further, whether or not the
   distribution or abundance of non-native trout has changed appreciably
   since the 1950s. Overall, Brook Trout abundance was higher in the 2000s
   than in the 1950s. Increased abundance was driven by increases in young
   of year (YOY), which was not related to the occurrence of non-native
   trout. Although present at fewer sites in the 2000s, non-native trout
   densities remained unchanged. Brook Trout distribution at the HUC-12
   watershed scale was essentially identical during both time periods. This
   study confirms previous modeling efforts, which indicated that Brook
   Trout have a higher probability of persisting in higher latitude, higher
   elevation, and less-developed regions.},

Abstract = {The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has become a global public
   health issue, and it has been a cause for morbidity and mortality of
   more people throughout the world. In this paper, we investigated the
   impacts of vaccination, other protection measures, home quarantine with
   treatment, and hospital quarantine with treatment strategies
   simultaneously using a deterministic mathematical modelling approach. No
   one has considered these intervention strategies simultaneously in
   his/her modelling approach. We examined all the qualitative properties
   of the model such as the positivity and boundedness of the model
   solutions, the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, the
   effective reproduction number using next-generation matrix method, local
   stabilities of equilibrium points using the Routh-Hurwitz method. Using
   the Centre Manifold criteria, we have shown the existence of backward
   bifurcation whenever the COVID-19 effective reproduction number is less
   than unity. Moreover, we have analysed both sensitivity and numerical
   simulation using parameter values taken from published literature. The
   numerical results show that the transmission rate is the most sensitive
   parameter we have to control. Also vaccination, other protection
   measures, home quarantine with treatment, and hospital quarantine with
   treatment have great effects to minimize the COVID-19 transmission in
   the community.},

   employing time delay tau as the main critical value of the Hopf
   bifurcation, we investigate the direction of the Hopf bifurcation of

   results of the direction of the Hopf bifurcation in a random network
   model are rare, we thus try to use the method of multiple time scales
   (MTS) to derive amplitude equation and determine the direction of the
   Hopf bifurcation. It is showed that the delayed random network
   nutrient-microorganism model can exhibit a supercritical or subcritical
   Hopf bifurcation. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the

Abstract = {Sphaeriusidae (Coleoptera: Myxophaga) is a group of shiny, blackish and
   hemispherical riparian beetles, known for their miniaturized bodies.
   They are worldwide in distribution, but very limited information is
   available about taxonomic and morphological diversity, and natural and
   evolutionary history. The aim of this study is to help fill in these
   gaps. We examined the external morphology of modern representatives
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reconstructed the
   phylogeny of the family using five DNA markers (cytochrome oxidase I,
   18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, CAD and wingless). Our results suggest a larger
   morphological diversity than previously expected, corresponding to the
   deep genetic divergences of principal lineages. We also examined two
   inclusions in 99-million-year-old Burmese amber. The integration of all
   evidence allows us to recognize three genera: the extinct genus \&
   DAG;Burmasporum Kirejtshuk, the newly defined genus Bezesporum gen.nov.
   preserved in Burmese amber (B. burmiticum sp.nov.) and present in the
   modern fauna of Southeast Asia, and the genus Sphaerius Waltl with a
   world-wide distribution. Sphaerius species are morphologically highly
   uniform, with the exception of species from Australia and South Africa,
   which share some characteristics with Bezesporum gen.nov. despite being
   resolved as deeply nested lineages of Sphaerius by DNA data. The
   presence of Bezesporum gen.nov. in Burmese amber and in recent fauna
   indicates that Sphaeriusidae largely maintained their specific
   morphology and specialized riparian lifestyle for at least 100 million
   years. Therefore, they can be considered an exceptionally conserved
   group, with a minimum of evolutionary changes over a long period. Our
   study also demonstrates that the species numbers and fine-scale
   morphological diversity of Sphaeriusidae are larger than expected in
   both the past and present-day faunas. Both were apparently
   underestimated due to the minute body size and cryptic habits of these
   beetles.},

Abstract = {Moth lacewings (Ithonidae) are a rare group of Neuroptera with an
   unusual subterranean larval life-style. We examined external and
   internal head structures of an older-instar larva of Ithone Newman with
   a broad spectrum of techniques. Larval autapomorphies, likely correlated
   with the subterranean habits, are the compact and shovel-shaped head,
   unusually massive mandibular-maxillary stylets, and a C-shaped
   postcephalic body. Other cephalic autapomorphies are the massive
   X-shaped tentorium, incurved antennae, and a strongly developed M.
   verticopharyngalis. The visual organs are distinctly simplified but a
   single functional stemma on each side of head is retained despite of the
   subterranean habits. In contrast to previous studies, a well-developed
   gular sclerite is present in Ithonidae, possibly a secondary
   acquisition. A cephalic gland complex and poison channel are present,
   with an unexpected additional lateral accessory gland and an additional
   lateral channel. The poison glands and dual channels very clearly
   indicate that the larvae are predators, contradicting the phytophagous
   habits formerly postulated. Compared with soil-inhabiting scarabaeoid
   beetle larvae, striking differences of head structures are due to
   different feeding habits and phylogenetic constraints. Morphological
   similarities like a C-shaped postcephalic body and strongly developed
   legs suitable for burrowing in soil are evolutionary parallels
   associated with the subterranean life-style in the two non-related
   groups. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out with an updated
   morphological matrix. The results were compared with a phylogeny based
   on anchored hybrid enrichment data. The evolutionary transformations of
   selected characters were evaluated using phylogenies estimated from both
   datasets.},

Abstract = {A massive adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian archipelago has produced
   approximately one-quarter of the fly species in the family
   Drosophilidae. The Hawaiian Drosophila clade has long been recognized as
   a model system for the study of both the ecology of island endemics and
   the evolution of developmental mechanisms, but relatively few genomic
   and transcriptomic datasets are available for this group. We present
   here a differential expression analysis of the transcriptional profiles
   of two highly conserved embryonic stages in the Hawaiian picture-wing
   fly Drosophila grimshawi. When we compared our results to previously
   published datasets across the family Drosophilidae, we identified cases
   of both gains and losses of gene representation in D. grimshawi,
   including an apparent delay in Hox gene activation. We also found a high
   expression of unannotated genes. Most transcripts of unannotated genes
   with open reading frames do not have identified homologs in non-Hawaiian
   Drosophila species, although the vast majority have sequence matches in
   genomes of other Hawaiian picture-wing flies. Some of these unannotated
   genes may have arisen from noncoding sequence in the ancestor of
   Hawaiian flies or during the evolution of the clade. Our results suggest
   that both the modified use of ancestral genes and the evolution of new
   ones may occur in rapid radiations.},

Abstract = {Paleotropical clades with largely disjunct distributions are ideal
   models for biogeographic reconstructions. The dung beetle genera
   Grebennikovius Mlambo, Scholtz \& Deschodt, Epactoides Olsouffief and
   Ochicanthon Vaz-de-Mello are distributed in Tanzania, Madagascar and
   Reunion, and the Oriental region, respectively. We combine morphology
   and molecular dataset to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships
   between these taxa. Our analyses corroborate previous hypotheses of
   monophyly of the group, which is here described as new tribe Epactoidini
   trib. nov. Grebennikovius is recovered as sister to Epactoides, while
   Ochicanthon emerges as sister to them both. The disjunct distribution of
   our focal clade is unusual within the subfamily Scarabaeinae. Bayesian
   divergence time estimates and ancestral range reconstructions indicate
   an African origin of the crown group of the tribe Epactoidini trib. nov.
   in the early mid Eocene, ca. 46 Ma. The divergence between Epactoides
   and its sister is dated to 32.3 Ma, while the crown age for the genus
   Ochicanthon is dated to 27 Ma. We investigate the factors that may have
   shaped the current distribution of the tribe Epactoidini trib. nov. The
   formation of the Gomphotherium landbridge, along with favourable
   environmental conditions would have allowed dry-intolerant organisms,
   such as Ochicanthon, to disperse out of Africa. Remarkable climatic
   stability of the Eastern Arc Mountains was critical for the retention of
   the monotypic genus Grebennikovius. We suggest two subsequent overwater
   dispersal events: the migration of the most recent common ancestor
   (MRCA) of Epactoides from Africa to Madagascar (32.3-29.5 Ma); the
   lately dispersal of the MRCA of the today's extinct Epactoides giganteus
   Rossini, Vaz-de-Mello \& Montreuil to Reunion island from Madagascar
   (3.4 Ma). We suggest that the high potential of dispersal of Epactoidini
   trib. nov. dung beetles and the strict association to forest habitat
   might have triggered two major radiations, one in Madagascar and one in
   the Oriental Region.},

Abstract = {We propose a higher classification of the lycaenid hairstreak tribe
   Eumaeini - one of the youngest and most species-rich butterfly tribes -
   based on autosome, Lepidopteran Z sex chromosome and mitochondrial
   protein-coding genes. The subtribe Neolycaenina Korb is a synonym of
   Callophryidina Tutt and subtribe Tmolusina Balint is a synonym of
   Strephonotina K. Johnson, Austin, Le Crom, \& Salazar. Proposed names
   are Rhammina Prieto \& Busby, new subtribe; Timaetina Busby \& Prieto,
   new subtribe; Atlidina Martins \& Duarte, new subtribe; Evenina Faynel
   \& Grishin, new subtribe; Jantheclina Robbins \& Faynel, new subtribe;
   Paiwarriina Lamas \& Robbins, new subtribe; Cupatheclina Lamas \&
   Grishin, new subtribe; Parrhasiina Busby \& Robbins, new subtribe;
   Ipideclina Martins \& Grishin, new subtribe; and Trichonidina Duarte \&
   Faynel, new subtribe. Phylogenetic results from the autosome and Z sex
   chromosome analyses are similar. Future analyses of datasets with
   hundreds of terminal taxa may be more practical time-wise by focussing
   on the smaller number of sex chromosome sequences (2.6\% of nuclear
   protein-coding sequences). The phylogenetic classification and
   biological summaries for each subtribe suggest that a variety of factors
   affected Eumaeini diversification. About a dozen kinds of male secondary
   sexual organs with frequent evolutionary gains and losses occur in
   Atlidina, Evenina and Jantheclina (141 species combined). Females have
   been shown to use these organs to discriminate between conspecific and
   nonconspecific males, facilitating sympatry among close relatives.
   Eumaeina, Rhammina and Timaetina (140 species combined) are
   overwhelmingly montane with some evidence for a higher incidence of
   sympatric diversification. Seven Neotropical lineages in five subtribes
   invaded the temperate parts of the Nearctic Region with a
   diversification increase in the Callophryidina (262 species). North
   American Satyrium and Callophrys then invaded the Palearctic at least
   once each, with a major species-richness increase in Satyrium. The
   evolution of litter-feeding detritivores within Calycopidina (172
   species) resulted in an increase in diversification rate compared with
   its flower-feeding sister lineage. Atlidina, Strephonotina, Parrhasiina
   and Strymonina (562 species combined) each contain a mixture of genera
   that specialize on one or two caterpillar food plant families and genera
   that are polyphagous. These would be appropriate subtribes to assess how
   the breadth of caterpillar food plants and the frequency of host shifts
   affected diversification.},

   interference or group defense. For the model with mutual interference,
   we show the interior equilibrium is globally stable, and the mutual
   interference can stabilize the predator-prey system. For the model with
   group defense, we discuss the singular dynamics around the origin and
   the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation, and find that there is a separatrix
   curve near the origin such that the orbits above which tend to the
   origin and the orbits below which tend to limit cycle or the interior
   equilibrium.},

Abstract = {The development of dimorphic adult sexes is a critical process for most
   animals, one that is subject to intense selection. Work in vertebrate
   and insect model species has revealed that sex determination mechanisms
   vary widely among animal groups. However, this variation is not uniform,
   with a limited number of conserved factors. Therefore, sex determination
   offers an excellent context to consider themes and variations in gene
   network evolution. Here we review the literature describing sex
   determination in diverse insects. We have screened public genomic
   sequence databases for orthologs and duplicates of 25 genes involved in
   insect sex determination, identifying patterns of presence and absence.
   These genes and a 3.5 reference set of 43 others were used to infer
   phylogenies and compared to accepted organismal relationships to examine
   patterns of congruence and divergence. The function of candidate genes
   for roles in sex determination (virilizer, female-lethal-2-d,
   transformer-2) and sex chromosome dosage compensation (male specific
   lethal-1, msl-2, msl-3) were tested using RNA interference in the
   milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. None of these candidate genes
   exhibited conserved roles in these processes. Amidst this variation we
   wish to highlight the following themes for the evolution of sex
   determination: (1) Unique features within taxa influence network
   evolution. (2) Their position in the network influences a component's
   evolution. Our analyses also suggest an inverse association of protein
   sequence conservation with functional conservation.},

Abstract = {Scientists are increasingly encouraged to engage with the public about
   science. Key to normalizing and advancing ``public engagement with
   science{''} (PES) is the dissemination of such activities within the
   science literature. We developed a classification scheme to assess the
   extent and type of PES articles in ecology-themed scholarly journals.
   Our review indicated that although many ecologists interact with the
   public and intend to maintain this interaction, only a small minority
   publish about PES efforts, perspectives, strategies, successes, and
   challenges in ecology journals regularly read by their peers. We suggest
   that publication of PES in disciplinary journals offers a means of both
   providing professional credit and improving engagement practices. Thus,
   we encourage ecologists to write articles about their PES efforts, urge
   editors and reviewers to be responsive to such submissions, and
   recommend more consistent use of common PES keywords in science
   articles. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Title = {Permian parallelisms: Reanalysis of dagger Tshekardocoleidae sheds light

Abstract = {The Coleoptera provides an excellent example of the value of fossils for
   understanding the evolutionary patterns of recent lineages. We
   reevaluate the morphology of the Early Permian dagger Tshekardocoleidae
   to test alternative phylogenetic hypotheses relating to the Palaeozoic
   evolution of the order. We discuss prior interpretations and revise an
   earlier data matrix. Both Bayesian and parsimony analyses support the
   monophyly of Coleoptera excluding dagger Tshekardocoleidae (=
   Mesocoleoptera), and of Coleoptera excluding dagger Tshekardocoleidae
   and dagger Permocupedidae (= Metacoleoptera). Plesiomorphies preserved
   in dagger Tshekardocoleidae are elytra, which rest over the body in a
   loose tent-like manner, with flat lateral flanges, projecting beyond the
   abdominal apex, and abdomens that are flexible and nearly cylindrical.
   Apomorphies of Mesocoleoptera include shortening of the elytra and a
   closer fit with the flattened and probably more rigid abdomen. A crucial
   synapomorphy of Metacoleoptera is the tightly sealed subelytral space,
   which may have been advantageous during the Permian aridification. Taxon
   exclusion experiments show that dagger Tshekardocoleidae is crucial for
   understanding the early evolution of Coleoptera and that its omission
   strongly affects ancestral state polarities as well as topology,
   including crown-group taxa. By constraining the relationships of extant
   taxa to match those supported by phylogenomic analysis, we demonstrate
   that features shared by Archostemata with Permian stem groups are most
   reasonably supported as plesiomorphic and that the smooth and simplified
   body forms of Polyphaga, Adephaga, Myxophaga, and Micromalthidae were
   derived in parallel. Our study highlights the reciprocal illumination of
   molecular, morphological, and paleontological data, and paves the way
   for tip-dating analysis across the order.},

Abstract = {The genus Thalpomena Saussure comprises nine species and four subspecies
   and is largely endemic to the Atlas Mountains (North Africa). Here, we
   used an evolutionary taxonomic approach to differentiate the species of
   the genus Thalpomena and to reconstruct their biogeographic history.
   Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on five molecular markers
   revealed four distinct clades within the genus Thalpomena. These are not
   fully in line with the current taxonomy but rather seem to represent
   lineages defined by their distribution and hind wing banding patterns.
   All lineages are geographically separated and can be distinguished based
   on genetic, morphometric and ecological modelling data. Ancestral area
   reconstruction suggests an origin of the species in the southern regions
   of the Atlas Mountains (High Atlas to Aures Mountains). Molecular clock
   analysis promotes the glacial refugia theory, supporting the origin of
   Thalpomena in the Pliocene, followed by diversification events in the
   Pleistocene.},

Abstract = {Which reduced-mixing strategy maximizes economic output during a disease
   outbreak? To answer this question, we formulate an optimal-control
   problem that maximizes the difference between revenue, due to healthy
   individuals, and medical costs, associated with infective individuals,
   for SIS disease dynamics. The control variable is the level of mixing in
   the population, which influences both revenue and the spread of the
   disease. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we find a closed-form
   solution for our problem. We explore an example of our problem with
   parameters for the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus in dairy cows,
   and we perform sensitivity analyses to determine how model parameters
   affect optimal strategies. We find that less mixing is preferable when
   the transmission rate is high, the per-capita recovery rate is low, or
   when the revenue parameter is much smaller than the cost parameter.},

Title = {Systematics and evolution of predatory flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae)

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are one of the most species-rich
   dipteran families and provide important ecosystem services such as
   pollination, biological control of pests, recycling of organic matter
   and redistributions of essential nutrients. Flower fly adults generally
   feed on pollen and nectar, but their larval feeding habits are
   strikingly diverse. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was
   used to capture and enrich phylogenetically and evolutionary informative
   exonic regions. With the help of the baitfisher software, we developed a
   new bait kit (SYRPHIDAE1.0) to target 1945 CDS regions belonging to 1312
   orthologous genes. This new bait kit was successfully used to exon
   capture the targeted loci in 121 flower fly species across the different
   subfamilies of Syrphidae. We analysed different amino acid and
   nucleotide data sets (1302 loci and 154 loci) with maximum likelihood
   and multispecies coalescent models. Our analyses yielded highly
   supported similar topologies, although the degree of the SRH (global
   stationarity, reversibility and homogeneity) conditions varied greatly
   between amino acid and nucleotide data sets. The sisterhood of
   subfamilies Pipizinae and Syrphinae is supported in all our analyses,
   confirming a common origin of taxa feeding on soft-bodied arthropods.
   Based on our results, we define Syrphini stat.rev. to include the genera
   Toxomerus and Paragus. Our divergence estimate analyses with beast
   inferred the origin of the Syrphidae in the Lower Cretaceous (125.5-98.5
   Ma) and the diversification of predatory flower flies around the K-Pg
   boundary (70.61-54.4 Ma), coinciding with the rise and diversification
   of their prey.},

Title = {Why are there so many species of mining bees (Hymenoptera, Andrenidae)?
   The possible roles of phenology and Wolbachia incompatibility in
   maintaining species boundaries in the Andrena proxima-complex},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The factors leading to the extraordinary diversity of the bees of the
   genus Andrena Fabricius, the second most speciose genus among bees,
   remain largely unknown. To examine the pattern of diversification in
   this genus, we investigate species boundaries within the controversial
   Andrena proxima-complex using a dataset of ultra-conserved elements and
   various species delimitation analyses (admixture analyses, BPP, DAPC).
   Our results confirm the presence of three separate species in this
   species group (Andrena proxima (Kirby), A. ampla Warncke and A. alutacea
   Stockhert) and suggest very low levels of interspecific gene flow.
   Andrena proxima and A. alutacea are regularly found in sympatry,
   suggesting an advanced stage of speciation. By contrast, A. ampla shows
   a parapatric distribution with both other species. Andrena alutacea
   harbours a unique strain of Wolbachia Hertig, absent in the other two
   species, which are infected by the two same strains of Wolbachia. In
   addition, the three species have distinct phenologies, with A. proxima
   flying earlier in the season and A. alutacea significantly later; the
   phenology of A. ampla is intermediate. Our results suggest that
   Wolbachia-induced incompatibilities and phenological differences
   maintain species boundaries in this group. The most advanced stage of
   speciation is observed in the two species showing putatively
   incompatible strains of Wolbachia and strongly distinct phenologies, A.
   alutacea and A. proxima. We propose that the smaller differences in
   phenological differentiation between A. ampla and both other species may
   explain the observed pattern of parapatric distribution. We discuss how
   these factors may underlie the high diversification rate observed in
   other groups of Andrena, a genus characterized by particularly variable
   and short flying periods.},

Abstract = {Mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae, Rhizoecidae and Xenococcidae) are
   important organisms for understanding processes of evolution, especially
   microbial symbiotic systems and interactions with host plants. Molecular
   phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for 128 species of mealybug using
   DNA fragments of eight loci, namely a mitochondrial (COI), nuclear
   ribosomal RNA (18S and 28S D2 and D10) and nuclear protein-encoding
   genes (EF-1 alpha 5 ` and 3 `, Dynamin and wingless). In addition, data
   on the types of obligate endosymbionts were used to test the monophyly
   of major groups resulting from this molecular phylogeny. Based on the
   data from DNA sequences, morphology and obligate endosymbionts, we
   present a phylogeny supporting the families Rhizoecidae and Xenococcidae
   separate from Pseudococcidae, and the separation of Rastrococcus Ferris
   from Phenacoccinae and Pseudococcinae. Consequently, Rastrococcus is
   excluded from Phenacoccinae and elevated to subfamily Rastrococcinae
   subfam. nov. We also found support for Putoidae as a family distinct

Title = {Describing biodiversity in the genomics era: A new species of Nearctic

Abstract = {Gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) specializing on live oaks in the
   genus Quercus (subsection Virentes) are a relatively diverse and
   well-studied community with 14 species described to date, albeit with
   incomplete information on their biology, life history and genetic
   structure. Incorporating an integrative taxonomic approach, we combine
   morphology, phenology, behaviour, genetics and genomics to describe a
   new species, Neuroterus valhalla sp. nov. The alternating generations of
   this species induce galls on the catkins and stem nodes of Quercus
   virginiana and Quercus geminata in the southern United States. We
   describe both generations in the species' life cycle, and primarily use
   samples from a population in the centre of Houston, Texas, thus serving
   as an example of the undescribed biodiversity still present in
   well-travelled urban centres. In parallel, we present a draft assembly
   of the N. valhalla genome providing a direct link between the type
   specimen and reference genome. The genome of N. valhalla is the smallest
   reported to date within the tribe Cynipini, providing an important
   comparative contrast to the otherwise large genome size of cynipids.
   While relatively small, the genome was found to be composed of >64\%
   repetitive elements, including 43\% unclassified repeats and 11\%
   retrotransposons. A preliminary ab initio and homology-based annotation
   revealed 32,005 genes, and a subsequent orthogroup analysis grouped
   18,044 of these to 8186 orthogroups, with some evidence for high levels
   of gene duplications within Cynipidae. A mitochondrial barcode phylogeny
   linked each generation of the new species and a phylogenomic
   ultraconserved element (UCEs) phylogeny indicates that the new species
   groups with other Nearctic Neuroterus. However, both phylogenies present
   the genus Neuroterus in North America as polyphyletic.},

Abstract = {Leafmining insects have extraordinarily intimate relationships with
   their host plants and are therefore prime candidates for potential
   ecological speciation in sympatry, but how commonly this mode of
   speciation occurs in any group of life remains debated. Prior research
   on the pygmy moth (Nepticulidae) genus Ectoedemia using morphology, DNA
   barcoding, and multi-marker phylogenetic approaches left two unresolved
   species complexes, each with each four described species. In this study,
   we thoroughly sampled each complex across a range of host plants and
   localities across Europe. We used a double digest restriction-site
   associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach to clarify species
   boundaries. In the E. rubivora complex, ddRAD data resolved all four
   species, contrary to morphological and COI data, which supports a
   potential scenario of host plant-driven speciation where the host plant
   specialization provides an ecological barrier to hybridization. However,
   we found no indication of host race formation within the oligophagous E.
   atricollis (Stainton). In the E. subbimaculella complex, SNP data only
   partly distinguishes between the parapatric E. subbimaculella (Haworth)
   and E. heringi (Toll), but with some statistical overlap, suggesting
   incomplete lineage sorting which may represent early phases of
   host-based ecological speciation, or admixture following a period of
   isolation.},

Abstract = {Understanding phylogeography, demographic dynamics as well as
   evolutionary forces of agricultural pests can enhance our understanding
   of their distribution dynamics, which is critical for developing
   effective control strategies. The pink rice borer (PRB), Sesamia
   inferens (Walker), is a destructive pest of rice that is widely
   distributed in Asia; however, little is known regarding its
   phylogeography and evolutionary history. In this study, we investigated
   the genetic diversity, population genetic structure and demographic
   history of the PRB at the scale of its whole distribution in China. Both
   mitochondrial and microsatellite datasets indicated that PRB individuals
   exhibit high levels of genetic diversity. Two large phylogeographic
   clusters were identified, corresponding to Northern and Southern China
   regions, respectively. The glacial events during the penultimate glacial
   period likely led to the separation of these two clusters, and parts of
   Northern and Southern China areas acted as independent refugia for PRB
   during glacial period. Two microrefugia in the Sichuan Basin and
   Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau were also identified, and the PRB from Sichuan
   Basin could be one of the ancestral sources for PRB individuals from the
   Northern China lineage. Our study not only provides information that has
   implications for refugia identification, but also provides an example on
   how to reveal the phylogeography, demography history and evolutionary
   forces of an agriculture pest.},

Abstract = {Termites are social cockroaches distributed throughout warm temperate
   and tropical ecosystems. The ancestor of modern termites roamed the
   earth during the early Cretaceous, suggesting that both vicariance and
   overseas dispersal may have shaped the distribution of early diverging
   termites. We investigate the historical biogeography of three early
   diverging termite families -Stolotermitidae, Hodotermitidae and
   Archotermopsidae (clade Teletisoptera) - using the nuclear rRNA genes
   and mitochondrial genomes of 27 samples. Our analyses confirm the
   monophyly of Teletisoptera, with Stolotermitidae diverging from
   Hodotermitidae + Archotermopsidae approximately 100 Ma. Although
   Hodotermitidae are monophyletic, our results demonstrate the paraphyly
   of Archotermopsidae. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the timing of
   divergence among the main lineages of Hodotermitidae + Archotermopsidae
   are compatible with vicariance. In the Stolotermitidae, however, the
   common ancestors of modern Porotermes Hagen and Stolotermes Hagen are
   roughly as old as 20 and 35 Ma, respectively, indicating that the
   presence of these genera in South America, Africa and Australia involved
   over-water dispersals. Overall, our results suggest that early diverging
   termite lineages acquired their current distribution through a
   combination of over-water dispersals and dispersal via land bridges. We
   clarify the classification by resolving the paraphyly of
   Archotermopsidae, restricting the family to Archotermopsis Desneux and
   Zootermopsis Emerson and elevating Hodotermopsinae (Hodotermopsis
   Holmgren) as Hodotermopsidae (status novum).},

   Assessing the potential causes and consequences},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAR 19},
Abstract = {The field of molecular phylogenetics is being revolutionized with
   next-generation sequencing technologies making it possible to sequence
   large numbers of genomes for non-model organisms ushering us into the
   era of phylogenomics. The current challenge is no longer how to get
   enough data, but rather how to analyse the data and how to assess the
   support for the inferred phylogeny. Here, we focus on one of the largest
   animal groups on the planet - butterflies and moths (order Lepidoptera),
   whose phylogeny remains unresolved despite several recent phylogenomic
   studies. In this study, we assess the potential causes and consequences
   of the conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses. With a dataset consisting of
   331 protein-coding genes and the alignment length over 290,000 base
   pairs, including 200 taxa representing 83\% of lepidopteran
   superfamilies, we compare phylogenetic hypotheses inferred from amino
   acid and nucleotide alignments. The resulting two phylogenies are
   discordant, especially with respect to the placement of the superfamily
   Gelechioidea, which is likely due to compositional bias and possible
   other model violations. Furthermore, we employed a series of analyses to
   dissect our dataset and demonstrate that there is sufficient
   phylogenetic signal to resolve much - but not all - of the lepidopteran
   tree of life. The relationships among superfamilies within Ditrysia, the
   most species rich lepidopteran clade containing 98\% of the extant
   species, remain poorly resolved. We conclude that taxon sampling remains
   an issue even in phylogenomic analyses and recommend that poorly sampled
   highly diverse groups, such as Gelechioidea in Lepidoptera, should
   receive extra attention in the future.},

Title = {Hitchhiking into the future on a fly: Toward a better understanding of
   phoresy and avian louse evolution (Phthiraptera) by screening bird
   carcasses for phoretic lice on hippoboscid flies (Diptera)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Abstract = {Many phoretic relationships between arthropods are understudied because
   of taxonomic impediments. We here illustrate for avian lice riding on
   hippoboscid flies how new natural history data on phoretic relationships
   can be acquired quickly with modern and cost-effective barcoding
   techniques. Most avian lice are host-specific, but some can arrive on
   new hosts by hitchhiking on hippoboscid flies that feed on bird blood.
   Our summary of the literature yielded 254 published records which we
   here show to belong to two large and 13 small interaction networks for
   birds, flies, and lice. In order to generate new records, we developed a
   protocol based on screening bird carcasses sourced with the help of
   citizen scientists. The inspection of 131 carcasses from Singapore led
   to the first record of a Guimaraesiella Eichler (Ischnocera:
   Philopteridae) louse species riding on Ornithoica momiyamai Kishida
   flies collected from a pitta carcass. Phoresy may explain why this louse
   species is now known from three phylogenetically disparate hosts (Pitta
   moluccensis (Muller), Ficedula zanthopygia (Hay); Pardaliparus elegans
   Lesson). A second new case of phoresy enhanced a large interaction
   network dominated by Ornithophila metallica (Schiner), a cosmopolitan
   and polyphagous hippoboscid fly species. Overall, we argue that many
   two- and three-way phoretic relationships between arthropods (e.g.,
   mites, pseudoscorpions, beetles, flies) can be resolved with
   cost-effective large-scale NGS barcoding, which can be used to partially
   overcome taxonomic impediments by pre-sorting specimens for taxonomic
   revision.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have severely degraded the ecological integrity
   of global freshwater systems. Migratory freshwater fishes are especially
   threatened by the cumulative effects of multiple stressors and
   fragmentation, particularly those that impede access to critical
   habitats. To stimulate the conservation and protection of these species,
   we propose a ``Global Swimways{''} program to identify rivers that
   support the migration routes of biologically and/or socioeconomically
   important freshwater fishes. We test the utility of the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature Red List data to support the
   identification of Global Swimways and present case study regions
   containing rivers with either high species richness (west-central Africa
   and Southeast Asia), high numbers of threatened species (Eastern Europe
   and Central Asia), or multiple endemic species (the Rift Valley lakes in
   East Africa). We hope the Global Swimways program will provide metrics
   that can be used to identify rivers requiring increased protection or
   restoration, track trends, and stimulate the greater inclusion of
   migratory freshwater fishes in global policy mechanisms. Front Ecol

Abstract = {Recent catastrophic fires in Australia and North America have raised
   broad-scale questions about how the cessation of Indigenous burning
   practices has impacted fuel accumulation and structure. For sustainable
   coexistence with fire, a better understanding of the ancient nexus
   between humans and flammable landscapes is needed. We used novel
   palaeoecological modeling and charcoal compilations to reassess evidence
   for changes in land cover and tire activity, focusing on southeast
   Australia before and after British colonization. Here, we provide what
   we believe is the first quantitative evidence that the region's forests
   and woodlands contained fewer shrubs and more grass before colonization.
   Changes in vegetation, fuel structures, and connectivity followed
   different trajectories in different vegetation types. The pattern is
   best explained by the disruption of Indigenous vegetation management
   caused by European settlement. Combined with climate-change impacts on
   fire weather and drought, the widespread absence of Indigenous fire
   management practices likely preconditioned fire-prone regions for
   wildfires of unprecedented extent.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Site fidelity, or the behavior of returning to previously visited
   locations, has been observed across taxa and ecosystems. By developing
   familiarity with a particular location, site fidelity provides a range
   of benefits and is advantageous in stable or predictable environments.
   However, the Anthropocene is characterized by rates of environmental
   change that outpace the evolutionary history of extant taxa, which can
   result in site fidelity becoming maladaptive. Here we outline the
   theoretical underpinnings for maladaptive site fidelity and synthesize
   empirical research supporting its occurrence, and examine it in the
   context of a related concept, ecological traps, whereby organisms
   exhibit maladaptive behavior in habitat selection. We then discuss
   adaptive mechanisms that may enable species with site fidelity to
   continue to persist in the Anthropocene. With ongoing environmental
   change, researchers and practitioners should expect fidelity-induced
   ecological traps to become more common, and initiate projects to
   identify and understand their origins. Such knowledge will help conserve
   the widespread and ecologically important behavior of site fidelity.},

Abstract = {Headwater streams are critical for freshwater ecosystems. Global and
   continental studies consistently show major dams as dominant sources of
   hydrological stress threatening biodiversity in the world's major
   rivers, but cumulative impacts from small artificial impoundments (SAIs)
   concentrated in headwater streams have rarely been acknowledged. Using
   the Murray Darling River basin (Australia) and the Arkansas River basin
   (US) as case studies, we examined the hydrological impacts of SAIs. The
   extent of their influence is considerable, altering hydrology in
   280-380\% more waterways as compared to major dams. Hydrological impacts
   are concentrated in smaller streams (catchment area <100 km(2)), raising
   concerns that the often diverse and highly endemic biota found in these
   systems may be under threat. Adjusting existing biodiversity planning
   and management approaches to address the cumulative effects of many
   small and widely distributed artificial impoundments presents a rapidly
   emerging challenge for ecologically sustainable water management.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study a stage-structured wild and sterile mosquito
   interaction impulsive model. The aim is to study the feasibility of
   controlling the population of wild mosquitoes by releasing sterile
   mosquitoes periodically. The existence of trivial periodic solutions is
   obtained, and the corresponding local stability and global stability
   conditions are proved by Floquet theory and Lyapunov stability theorem,
   respectively. And we prove the existence conditions of non-trivial
   periodic solutions and their local stability. We can find that the
   system has the bistable phenomenon in which the trivial periodic
   solution and the non-trivial periodic solution can coexist under certain
   threshold conditions. All the results show that the appropriate release
   period and release amount of sterile mosquitoes can control the wild
   mosquito population within a certain range and even make them extinct.
   Finally, numerical simulation verifies our theoretical results.},

Abstract = {The expression of spidroins in the major ampullate, minor ampullate,
   flagelliform, and tubuliform silk glands of Trichonephila clavipes
   spiders was analyzed using proteomics analysis techniques. Spidroin
   peptides were identified and assigned to different gene products based
   on sequence concurrence when compared with the whole genome of the
   spider. It was found that only a relatively low proportion of the
   spidroin genes are expressed as proteins in any of the studied glands.
   In addition, the expression of spidroin genes in different glands
   presents a wide range of patterns, with some spidroins being found in a
   single gland exclusively, while others appear in the content of several
   glands. The combination of precise genomics, proteomics,
   microstructural, and mechanical data provides new insights both on the
   design principles of these materials and how these principles might be
   translated for the production of high-performance bioinspired artificial
   fibers.},

Abstract = {The species endangerment listing process is governed not solely by
   causal factors but also by human perception, particularly as it relates
   to observability. Because human perception is important in species
   detection, we hypothesized that ecological indicators associated with
   human perception would change noticeably over time. Testing our
   hypothesis on species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, we
   found that - in general and across (not within) different taxa - body
   mass and geographic range of listed species decreased over time and that
   animals that produced vocalizations and exhibited grouping behavior were
   listed earlier than silent and solitary animals. Specifically, since the
   year of their listing, the body mass of birds, mammals, and reptiles
   decreased, whereas the body mass of amphibians increased; likewise, the
   geographic range of insects, mammals, and plants contracted, whereas the
   geographic range of amphibians, bivalves, birds, and fish slightly
   expanded. Our results demonstrate a temporal shift in endangered species
   listings, suggesting that approaches to listing species may need to be
   reevaluated and methodologically revised.},

Title = {Riparian buffers can help mitigate biodiversity declines in oil palm
   agriculture},

Volume = {20},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agricultural expansion is a primary driver of biodiversity decline in
   forested regions of the tropics. Consequently, it is important to
   understand the conservation value of remnant forests in production
   landscapes. In a tropical landscape dominated by oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis), we characterized faunal communities across eight taxa
   occurring within riparian forest buffers, which are legally protected
   alongside rivers, and compared them to nearby recovering logged forest.
   Buffer width was the main predictor of species richness and abundance,
   with widths of 40-100 m on each side of the river supporting broadly
   equivalent levels of biodiversity as compared to logged forest. However,
   width responses varied markedly among taxa, and buffers often lacked
   forest-dependent species. Much wider buffers than are currently mandated
   are needed to safeguard most species. The largest biodiversity gains are
   achieved by increasing relatively narrow buffers. To provide optimal
   conservation outcomes in tropical production landscapes, we encourage
   policy makers to prescribe width requirements for key taxa and different
   landscape contexts.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {In response to interdependent challenges, city planners are increasingly
   adopting ``green infrastructure{''} (GI). Reviewing 122 plans from 20 US
   cities, we identify what types of city plans address and define GI,
   including the concepts associated with GI, as well as the types,
   functions, and benefits of GI. The most common plans that feature GI,
   some of which focus exclusively on GI, comply with US Clean Water Act
   regulations for stormwater and sewer systems. Municipalities also
   address GI through diverse planning processes, including the creation of
   comprehensive citywide plans. Many of these plans (similar to 40\%) do
   not explicitly define GI. When they do, stormwater concepts predominate,
   followed by landscape concepts, along with an emergent emphasis on
   integrating GI with other built infrastructure systems. Large
   differences in GI types, functions, and benefits across concepts, plan
   types, and cities indicate a need for synthesis of GI definitions. To
   facilitate this synthesis, we provide a database of GI definitions from
   plans used in our analysis. We conclude with a broad synthetic
   definition of GI to provide clarity and stimulate discussion in rapidly
   evolving planning, policy, and research arenas.},

Title = {A phylogenomic approach to species delimitation in the mango fruit fly

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Species that are dispersed across oceanic islands can have strong
   population structure due to genetic isolation, which makes it difficult
   to determine realistic and meaningful species boundaries. This becomes
   especially problematic when pest species are involved, and can result in
   undetected new invasions. The mango fruit fly, Bactrocera frauenfeldi
   (Schiner), is currently considered to be one of five morphologically
   similar members in a monophyletic species group distributed across
   Southeast Asia, Australasia, and Oceania, including three major pests.
   We used a phylogenomic approach with highly multiplexed amplicon
   sequencing to test species limits and evaluate the relationships among
   species in the B. frauenfeldi species complex and two closely related
   species. We obtained sequence data from 196 specimens for 395 nuclear
   DNA loci, totalling 102 kb, of which 2.2 kb were parsimony informative
   sites. Based on morphology, biogeography, and phylogenetic analyses, we
   conclude that there are five distinct species in the complex in our
   phylogeny. Our results show that the morphological differences between
   B. frauenfeldi and B. albistrigata (de Meijere) are part of a continuum
   that cannot be phylogenetically separated into monophyletic groups. We
   therefore synonymize the names of two major pests: B. albistrigata syn.
   rev. with B. frauenfeldi, making B. frauenfeldi now recognized as a
   widespread pest across Australasia and Southeast Asia. We evaluated the
   use of COI for pest recognition and conclude that it cannot reliably
   distinguish between six of the seven species we studied, thus new
   molecular approaches will be necessary for effective management and the
   prevention of incursions.},

Title = {Phylogeny, evolution, and classification of the ant genus Lasius, the

Abstract = {Within the Formicidae, the higher classification of nearly all
   subfamilies has been recently revised given the findings of molecular
   phylogenetics. Here, we integrate morphology and molecular data to
   holistically address the evolution, classification, and identification
   of the ant genus Lasius, its tribe Lasiini, and their subfamily
   Formicinae. We find that the crown Lasiini originated around the end of
   the Cretaceous on the Eurasian continent and is divisible into four
   morphologically distinct clades: Cladomyrma, the Lasius genus group, the
   Prenolepis genus group, and a previously undetected lineage we name
   Metalasius gen.nov., with one extant species M. myrmidon comb. nov. and
   one fossil species, dagger M. pumilus comb. nov. The crown of the Lasius
   genus group is considerably younger than that of the Prenolepis genus
   group, indicating that extinction has played a major role in the
   evolution of the former clade. Lasius itself is divided into two
   well-supported monophyletic groups, which are approximately equally
   speciose. We present evidence that temporary social parasitism and
   fungiculture arose twice independently in Lasius. In addition, we
   recover the paraphyly of three Lasius subgenera and propose replacing
   all subgenera with an informal species group classification: Lasius =
   Acanthomyops syn.rev., = Austrolasius syn.nov., = Cautolasius syn.nov.,
   = Chthonolasius syn.nov., = Dendrolasius syn.nov. Total-evidence
   analysis reveals that the Baltic-region amber fossil species dagger
   Lasius pumilus and dagger Pseudolasius boreus are misplaced to genus;
   we, therefore, create Sussuido gen. nov. to accomodate dagger S. boreus
   comb. nov. and transfer dagger L. pumilus to Metalasius. Further, we
   transfer dagger Sussudio and dagger Glaphyromyrmex out of the Lasiini,
   considering the former to be incertae sedis in the subfamily, and the
   latter a member of the Formicini (tribal transfer). Two final taxonomic
   actions are deemed necessary: synonymy of Lasius escamole with
   Liometopum apiculatum syn.nov.},

Abstract = {Hox genes encode transcription factors that specify the body segment
   identity during development, including crustaceans, such as amphipods
   and decapods, that possess a remarkable diversity of segments and
   specialized appendages. In amphipods, alterations of specialized
   appendages have been obtained using knockout experiment of Hox genes,
   which suggests that these genes are involved in the evolution of
   morphology within crustaceans. However, studies of Hox genes in
   crustaceans have been limited to a few species. Here, we identified the
   homeodomain of nine Hox genes: labial (lab), proboscipedia (pb),
   Deformed (Dfd), Sex combs reduced (Scr), fushi tarazu (ftz),
   Antennapedia (Antp), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), abdominal-A (abdA), and
   Abdominal-B (AbdB), and evaluated their expression by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR
   in the ovary, during embryonic development, and at the first larval
   stage (Zoea I) of the decapod Macrobrachium olfersii. The transcript
   levels of lab, Dfd, and ftz decreased and transcripts of pb, Scr, Antp,
   Ubx, abdA, and AbdB increased during embryonic development. Hox genes
   were expressed in mature ovaries and Zoea I larval stages, except Scr
   and ftz, respectively. In addition, isoforms of Dfd, Scr, Ubx, and abdA,
   which have been scarcely reported in crustaceans, were described. New
   partial sequences of 87 Hox genes from other crustaceans were identified
   from the GenBank database. Our results are interesting for future
   studies to determine the specific function of Hox genes and their
   isoforms in the freshwater prawn M. olfersii and to contribute to the
   understanding of the diversity and evolution of body plans and
   appendages in Crustaceans.},

Abstract = {The genitalia present some of the most rapidly evolving anatomical
   structures in the animal kingdom, possessing a variety of parts that can
   distinguish recently diverged species. In the Drosophila melanogaster
   group, the phallus is adorned with several processes, pointed
   outgrowths, that are similar in size and shape between species. However,
   the complex three-dimensional nature of the phallus can obscure the
   exact connection points of each process. Previous descriptions based
   upon adult morphology have primarily assigned phallic processes by their
   approximate positions in the phallus and have remained largely agnostic
   regarding their homology relationships. In the absence of clearly
   identified homology, it can be challenging to model when each structure
   first evolved. Here, we employ a comparative developmental analysis of
   these processes in eight members of the melanogaster species group to
   precisely identify the tissue from which each process forms. Our results
   indicate that adult phallic processes arise from three pupal primordia
   in all species. We found that in some cases the same primordia generate
   homologous structures whereas in other cases, different primordia
   produce phenotypically similar but remarkably non-homologous structures.
   This suggests that the same gene regulatory network may have been
   redeployed to different primordia to induce phenotypically similar
   traits. Our results highlight how traits diversify and can be
   redeployed, even at short evolutionary scales.},

Title = {Modularity in the trilobite head consistent with the hypothesized

Volume = {24},

Pages = {177-188},

Abstract = {The trilobite head served multiple functions and was composed of several
   fused segments. Yet, the underlying organization of the trilobite head,
   and whether patterns are conserved across trilobites, remains unclear.
   Modeling the head as being composed of modules, or subunits that vary
   and thus have the potential to evolve semi-independently can reveal
   underlying patterns of organization. Hypotheses of modular organization
   based on the comparative developmental biology of arthropods were
   evaluated using geometric morphometrics. Two-dimensional (semi)landmark
   datasets collected from the cranidia of two Ordovician trilobite
   species, Calyptaulax annulata (Phacopida) and Cloacaspis senilis
   (Olenida sensu Adrain, 2011) were analyzed. The degree and pattern of
   modularity were assessed using the covariance ratio (CR), which compares
   the covariation within putative modules to the covariation between them,
   and the fit of different models was compared using an effect size
   measure derived from the CR. When treating the eyes as a distinct
   module, the best modular hypothesis identified for C. annulata shows the
   eyes and anteriormost region of the head integrated as a single module.
   The best modular hypotheses for C. senilis are more complex but the eyes
   still covary mostly strongly with the anterior part of the head. The
   latter is also the case for all other well-supported models for both
   species. These results can be interpreted as a developmental signal
   corresponding to the anteriormost ocular segment of early arthropods
   that is retained throughout development, despite any likely selective
   pressures related to functional needs.},

Abstract = {Eusociality has been commonly observed in distinct animal lineages. The
   reproductive division of labor is a particular feature, achieved by the
   coordination between fertile and sterile castes within the same nest.
   The sociogenomic approach in social hymenopteran insects indicates that
   vitellogenin (Vg) has undergone neo-functionalization in sterile castes.
   Here, to know whether Vgs have distinct roles in nonreproductive castes
   in termites, we investigated the unique characteristics of Vgs in the
   rhinotermitid termite Reticulitermes speratus. The four Vgs were
   identified from R. speratus (RsVg1-4), and RsVg3 sequences were newly
   identified using the RACE method. Molecular phylogenetic analysis
   supported the monophyly of the four termite Vgs. Moreover, the termites
   Vg1-3 and Vg4 were positioned in two different clades. The dN/dS ratios
   indicated that the branch leading to the common ancestor of termite Vg4
   was under weak purifying selection. Expression analyses among castes
   (reproductives, workers, and soldiers) and females (nymphs, winged
   alates, and queens) showed that RsVg1-3 was highly expressed in fertile
   queens. In contrast, RsVg4 was highly expressed in workers and female
   nonreproductives (nymphs and winged adults). Localization of RsVg4
   messenger RNA was confirmed in the fat body of worker heads and
   abdomens. These results suggest that Vg genes are functionalized after
   gene duplication during termite eusocial transition and that Vg4 is
   involved in nonreproductive roles in termites.},

Abstract = {Activating transcription factor 5 (Atf5) is a member of the ATF/CREB
   family of transcription factors and involved in diverse cellular
   functions and diseases in mammals. However, the function of atf5 remains
   largely unknown in fish. Here, we report the expression pattern and
   function of duplicated atf5 genes in zebrafish. The results showed that
   the gene structures of zebrafish atf5a and atf5b were similar to their
   mammalian orthologs. Zebrafish Atf5a and Atf5b shared an amino acid
   sequence identity of 40.7\%. Zebrafish atf5a and atf5b had maternal
   origin with dynamic expression during embryonic development. Zebrafish
   atf5a mRNA is mainly enriched in olfactory epithelium, midbrain, and
   hindbrain, while zebrafish atf5b mRNA is mainly detected in midbrain,
   hindbrain, and liver during embryogenesis. The results of acute hypoxia
   experiment showed that atf5a mRNA was significantly upregulated in the
   brain, liver, and muscle, while atf5b mRNA was just increased
   significantly in the brain. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of
   atf5a affects the development of the ciliated neurons in zebrafish
   embryos. The effect was enhanced when atf5a MO was co-injected with
   atf5b MO. The development of ciliated neurons in zebrafish embryos was
   not affected by injection of atf5b MO alone. atf5a knockdown also
   affects the development of early-born olfactory neurons. The effects
   caused by atf5a knockdown could be rescued by atf5b mRNA. These results
   suggest that the duplicated atf5 genes may have evolved divergently and
   play redundant biological roles in the development of olfactory sensory
   neurons in zebrafish.},

Abstract = {The zona pellucida (ZP) protein constitutes the egg envelope, which
   surrounds the vertebrate embryo. We performed a comprehensive study on
   the molecular evolution of ZP genes in Teleostei by cloning and
   analyzing the expression of ZP genes in fish of Anguilliformes in
   Elopomorpha, Osteoglossiformes in Osteoglossomorpha, and Clupeiformes in
   Otocephala to cover unsurveyed fish groups in Teleostei. The present
   results confirmed findings from our previous reports that the principal
   organ of ZP gene expression changed from ovary to liver in the common
   ancestors of Clupeocephala. Even fish species that synthesize egg
   envelopes in the liver carry the ovary-expressed ZP proteins as minor
   egg envelope components that were produced by gene duplication during
   the early stage of Teleostei evolution. The amino acid repeat sequences
   located at the N-terminal region of ZP proteins are known to be the
   substrates of transglutaminase responsible for egg envelope hardening
   and hatching. A repeat sequence was found in zona pellucida Cs of
   phylogenetically early diverged fish. After changing the synthesis
   organ, its role is inherited by the N-terminal Pro-Gln-Xaa repeat
   sequence in liver-expressed zona pellucida B genes of Clupeocephala.
   These results suggest that teleost ZP genes have independently evolved
   to maintain fish-specific functions, such as egg envelope hardening and
   egg envelope digestion, at hatching.},

Abstract = {Spiders constitute more than 49,000 described species distributed all
   over the world, and all ecological environments. Their order, Araneae,
   is defined by a set of characteristics with no parallel among their
   arachnid counterparts (e.g., spinnerets, silk glands, chelicerae that
   inoculate venom, among others). Changes in developmental pathways often
   underlie the evolution of morphological synapomorphies, and as such
   spiders are a promising model to study the role of developmental genes
   in the origin of evolutionary novelties. With that in mind, we
   investigated changes in the evolutionary regime of a set of six
   developmental genes, using spiders as our model. The genes were mainly
   chosen for their roles in spinneret ontogeny, yet they are pleiotropic,
   and it is likely that the origins of other unique morphological
   phenotypes are also linked to changes in their sequences. Our results
   indicate no great differences in the selective pressures on those genes
   when comparing spiders to other arachnids, but a few site-specific
   positive selection evidence were found in the Araneae lineage. These
   findings lead us to new insights on spider evolution that are to be
   further tested.},

Abstract = {The US federal government has implemented a variety of policies and
   subsidies that help coastal development remain viable, including
   investments in risk reduction measures, subsidized flood insurance, and
   post-disaster assistance. In this study, we explored how the removal of
   federal subsidies impacts coastal development patterns by measuring the
   causal effect of the US Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) on building
   activity. Implemented in 1982, CBRA withdrew eligibility for federal
   funding for infrastructure, post-disaster assistance, and subsidized
   flood insurance along designated sections of coastal barriers ({''}CBRA
   units{''}). Using a novel built-structures dataset, we employed a
   spatial regression discontinuity design to compare development rates
   within and outside of CBRA units in 1980 and 2016. We found that
   enactment of the CBRA has resulted in significant reductions in
   development activity: indeed, development rates were reduced by more
   than 75\% in CBRA areas as compared to non-CBRA areas. Our findings
   suggest that policies like CBRA can be effective at slowing development
   in other sensitive or hazardous areas, and could help to preserve
   natural environments for habitat conservation and climate adaptation
   purposes.},

Abstract = {Finding food is a key motivator of animal behavior and underpins an
   increasing number of conservation and wildlife management challenges.
   Introduced predators threaten many vulnerable native species, and some
   native predators are problematic for declining prey species. Likewise,
   browsing by native and introduced herbivores threatens endangered plant
   species, undermines habitat restoration efforts, and alters plant
   communities. Mammalian predators and herbivores use olfactory
   information to forage efficiently, pursuing cues that are useful and
   ignoring those that are not. Here, we present the theoretical basis for
   why olfactory misinformation should alter foraging decisions and provide
   compelling evidence that supports the theory. Drawing on this theory and
   evidence of the success of olfactory misinformation where it has been
   applied to date, we propose that there is enormous scope for its
   application more broadly in conservation and wildlife management. Such
   an approach offers a robust behavioral alternative for protecting valued
   plants and prey species that are otherwise vulnerable to foraging
   mammals.},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of high-severity wildfire in forests in the US
   state of California is connected to past forest management, but
   uncertainty remains regarding the differential effects of land ownership
   on these trends. To determine whether differing forest management
   regimes, inferred from land ownership, influence high-severity fire
   incidence, we assembled and analyzed a large dataset of 154 wildfires
   that burned a combined area of more than 971,000 ha in California. We
   found that where fires occurred, the odds of high-severity fire on
   ``private industrial{''} lands were 1.8 times greater than on
   ``public{''} lands and 1.9 times greater than on ``other{''} lands (that
   is, remaining lands classified as neither private industrial nor
   public). Moreover, high-severity fire incidence was greater in areas
   adjacent to private industrial land, indicating this trend extends
   across ownership boundaries. Overall, these results indicate that
   prevailing forest management practices on private industrial timberland
   may increase high-severity fire occurrence, underscoring the need for
   cross-boundary cooperation to protect ecological and social systems.},

Abstract = {Cholera is an acute enteric infectious disease caused by the
   Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Despite a huge body of
   research, the precise nature of its transmission dynamics has yet to be
   fully elucidated. Mathematical models can be useful to better understand
   how an infectious agent can spread and be properly controlled. We
   develop a compartmental model describing a human population, a bacterial
   population as well as a phage population. We show that there might be
   eight equilibrium points, one of which is a disease free equilibrium
   point. We carry out numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses and
   we show that the presence of phage can reduce the number of infectious
   individuals. Moreover, we discuss the main implications in terms of
   public health management and control strategies.},

Abstract = {A mathematical model with the intraguild predation structure is proposed
   to describe the interactions of autotrophs and mixotrophs containing
   light and nutrients in a well-mixed aquatic ecosystem. The dissipation,
   existence and stability of equilibria of the model are proved, and the
   ecological reproductive indexes for the extinction, survival and
   coexistence of autotrophs and mixotrophs are established. We also
   consider the influence of Holling type functional responses and abiotic
   factors on the coexistence and biomass of autotrophs and mixotrophs. It
   is shown that the intraguild predation structure is beneficial to
   phytoplankton biodiversity and provides an explanation for the
   phytoplankton paradox.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate the influence of the waning
   immunity on the dynamics of Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) transmission in
   wild and farmed tilapia within freshwater. We formulate a model for
   which susceptible individuals can contract the disease in two ways: (i)
   direct mode caused by contact with infected individuals; (ii) indirect
   mode due to the presence of pathogenic agents in the water. We obtain an
   age-structured model which combines both age since infection and age
   since recovery. We derive an explicit formula for the reproductive
   number R-0 and show that the disease-free equilibrium is locally
   asymptotically stable when, R-0 < 1. We discuss on the form of the
   waning immunity parameter and show numerically that a Hopf bifurcation
   may occur for suitable immunity parameter values, which means that there
   is a periodic solution around the endemic equilibrium when, R-0 > 1.},

Abstract = {After few days from tail amputation in lizards the stump is covered with
   mesenchymal cells accumulated underneath a wound epidermis and forms a
   regenerative blastema. During migration, some keratinocytes transit from
   a compact epidermis into relatively free keratinocytes in a process of
   ``epithelial to mesenchymal transition{''} (EMT). EMT is also induced
   after damaging the regenerating epidermis by cauterization, whereas
   keratinocytes detach and migrate as mesenchymal-like cells among the
   superficial blastema cells and reconstruct a wound epidermis after about
   a week from the damage. In normal amputation or after cauterization, no
   malignant transformation is observed during the transition and migration
   of keratinocytes. Immunolabeling for markers of EMT confirms the
   histological description and shows a unique pattern of expression for
   l-CAM (E-cadherin), N-CAM, and SNAIL-1 and -2 (SLUG). These proteins are
   present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of migrating keratinocytes. It is
   hypothesized that the nuclear labeling for E-cadherin coupled to
   cytoplasmic SNAIL-labeling is somehow related to an initially regulated
   EMT. After the migrating keratinocytes have reached confluence over the
   stump, they reverse into a ``mesenchymal to epithelial transition{''}
   (MET) forming the wound epidermis. The basal layers of the apical wound
   epidermis of the blastema show some nuclear E-cadherin labeling, while
   the tail regenerates. It is hypothesized that, together with other tumor
   suppressors proteins, the apical epidermis and mesenchyme are kept under
   a tight proliferative control, while in proximal regions the prevalent
   effect of tumor suppressors determine the differentiation of the new
   tail tissues.},

Abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), or enhancers, are segments of noncoding
   DNA that regulate the spatial and temporal expression of nearby genes.
   Sometimes, genes are expressed in more than one tissue, and this can be
   driven by two main types of CREs: tissue-specific ``modular{''} CREs,
   where different CREs drive expression of the gene in the different
   tissues, or by ``pleiotropic{''} CREs, where the same CRE drives
   expression in the different tissues. In this perspective, we will
   discuss some of the ways (i) modular and pleiotropic CREs might
   originate; (ii) propose that modular CREs might derive from pleiotropic
   CREs via a process of duplication, degeneration, and complementation
   (the CRE-DDC model); and (iii) propose that hotspot loci of evolution
   are associated with the origin of modular CREs belonging to any gene in
   a regulatory network.},

Abstract = {Deciphering the plastic (i.e., nonheritable) changes induced by human
   control over wild animals in the archeological record is challenging.
   Previous studies detected morphological markers associated with
   captivity in the cranium, mandible, and calcaneus of adult wild boar
   (Sus scrofa) but the developmental trajectories leading up to these
   changes during ontogeny remain unknown. To assess the impact of growth
   in a captive environment on morphological structures during postnatal
   ontogeny, we used an experimental approach focusing on the same three
   structures and taxon. We investigated the form and size differences of
   captive-reared and wild-caught wild boar during growth using
   three-dimensional landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Our results
   provide evidence of an influence of captivity on the morphology of
   craniomandibular structures, as wild specimens are smaller than captive
   individuals at similar ages. The food resources inherent to
   anthropogenic environments may explain some of the observed differences
   between captive-reared and wild specimens. The calcaneus presents a
   different contrasted pattern of plasticity as captive and wild
   individuals differ in terms of form but not in terms of size. The
   physically more constrained nature of the calcaneus and the direct
   influence of mobility reduction on this bone may explain these
   discrepancies. These results provide new methodological perspectives for
   bioarchaeological approaches as they imply that the plastic mark of
   captivity can be observed in juvenile specimens in the same way it has
   been previously described in adults.},

Abstract = {Division of the dentition into morphologically distinct classes of teeth
   (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) and the acquisition of
   tribosphenic molars facilitated precise occlusion between the teeth
   early in mammal evolution. Despite the evolutionary and ecological
   importance of distinct classes of teeth with unique cusp, crest, and
   basin morphologies, relatively little is known about the genetic basis
   for the development of different tooth classes within the embryo. Here
   we investigated genetic differences between developing deciduous
   incisor, canine, and premolar teeth in the domestic cat (Felis catus),
   which we propose to be a new model for tooth development. We examined
   differences in both developmental timing and crown morphology between
   the three tooth classes. Using RNA sequencing of early bell stage tooth
   germs, we showed that each of the three deciduous tooth classes possess
   a unique transcriptional profile. Three notable groups of genes emerged
   from our differential expression analysis; genes involved in the
   extracellular matrix (ECM), Wnt pathway signaling, and members of
   multiple homeobox gene families (Lhx, Dlx, Alx, and Nkx). Our results
   suggest that ECM genes may play a previously under-appreciated role in
   shaping the surface of the tooth crown during development. Differential
   regulation of these genes likely underlies differences in tooth crown
   shape and size, although subtle temporal differences in development
   between the tooth germs could also be responsible. This study provides
   foundational data for future experiments to examine the function of
   these candidate genes in tooth development to directly test their
   potential effects on crown morphology.},

Title = {Teeth out of proportion: Smaller horse and cattle breeds have

Abstract = {There are different descriptions of allometric relationships between
   important components of the mammalian skull. Craniofacial evolutionary
   allometry describes a pattern of increasing facial cranium in larger
   skulls. Another body of literature describes disproportionately larger
   teeth in smaller species or specimens, matching anecdotal observations
   with dental problems in dwarf breeds whose teeth appear ``too large for
   their skulls.{''} We test the scaling of tooth row length with body size
   and skull length in a data set comprising 114 domestic horses
   (representing 40 breeds) and in another data set of 316 domestic cattle
   (of >60 breeds). We demonstrate that smaller skulls have a relatively
   longer tooth row in both horses and cattle; larger specimens have
   relatively shorter tooth rows. Whereas in horses, larger skulls have a
   relatively longer diastema, the distance of the mesial maxillary
   premolar to the premaxilla was proportional to cranium length in cattle.
   While the reasons for these patterns remain to be detected, they support
   the hypothesis that tooth size might be less ``evolvable,{''} in terms
   of time required for changes, than body size. The pattern may affect (i)
   the selective breeding for dwarf breeds by setting minimum constraints
   for skull size, as described previously for domestic horses with the
   same data set; (ii) the susceptibility of small breeds for dental
   problems; and (iii) differences in chewing efficiency between breeds of
   different sizes. The findings support the existing concept that scaling
   of tooth to body size across taxa becomes more isometric the longer
   these taxa are separated in evolutionary time.},

Title = {Integration of mitogenomic and morphological data disentangles the

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Abstract = {The Polleniidae (Diptera) are a family of flies best known for species
   of the genus Pollenia, which overwinter inside human dwellings.
   Previously divided across the Calliphoridae, Tachinidae and
   Rhinophoridae, the polleniid genera have only recently been united.
   Several studies have utilized molecular data to analyse polleniid
   phylogenetic relationships, although all have suffered from low taxon
   sampling or insufficient phylogenetic signal in molecular markers. To
   alleviate these problems, we utilized two automated organellar genome
   extraction software, GetOrganelle and MitoFinder, to assemble
   mitogenomes from genome skimming data from 22 representatives of the
   polleniid genera: Dexopollenia, Melanodexia, Morinia, Pollenia and
   Xanthotryxus. From these analyses, we provide 14 new mitogenomes for the
   Polleniidae and perform phylogenetic analyses of 13 protein-coding
   mitochondrial genes using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference. Subfamilial phylogenetic relationships within the Polleniidae
   are interrogated and Pollenia is found to form a monophyletic clade
   sister to Melanodexia, Morinia and Dexopollenia, providing no evidence
   for the synonymisation of any of these genera. Our topology conflicts
   with previous morphology-based cladistic interpretations, with the
   amentaria, griseotomentosa, semicinerea and viatica species-groups
   resolving as non-monophyletic. We provide support for our topology
   through analysis of adult morphology and male and female terminalia,
   while identifying new diagnostic characters for some of the clades of
   the Pollenia. To test the validity of the current diagnostic morphology
   in the Polleniidae, newly assembled cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
   data are combined with a polleniid COI barcode reference library and
   analysed using the species delimitation software ASAP. COI barcodes
   support the current morphologically defined species within the Pollenia.},

Title = {Massive gene rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes and implications

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-295},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used for phylogenetic
   reconstruction and evolutionary analysis in various groups of Insecta.
   Gene rearrangements in the mitogenome can be informative characters for
   phylogenetic reconstruction and adaptive evolution. Trichoptera is one
   of the most important groups of aquatic insects. Prior to this study,
   complete mitogenomes from Trichoptera were restricted to eight families,
   resulting in a biased view of their mitogenome structure and evolution.
   Here, we assemble new mitogenomes for 66 species by high-throughput
   sequencing. The mitogenomes of 19 families and 47 genera are documented
   for the first time. Combined with 16 previously published mitogenomes of
   Trichoptera, we find 14 kinds of gene rearrangement patterns novel for
   Trichoptera, including rearrangement of protein-coding genes, tRNAs and
   control regions. Simultaneously, we provide evidence for the occurrence
   of tandem duplication and non-random loss events in the mitogenomes of
   three families. Phylogenetic analyses show that Hydroptilidae was
   recovered as a sister group to Annulipalpia. The increased nucleotide
   substitution rate and adaptive evolution may have affected the
   mitochondrial gene rearrangements in Trichoptera. Our study offers new
   insights into the mechanisms and patterns of mitogenome rearrangements
   in Insecta at large and into the usefulness of mitogenomic gene order as
   a phylogenetic marker within Trichoptera.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maritime chironomid midges (Diptera) are diverse, yet these `pearls of
   the ocean' are little known. Emphasizing Pacific Ocean taxa, we used six
   genetic markers (18S, 28S, CAD1, CAD4, FolCOI and COI) and fossil
   calibrations to produce Bayesian time-calibrated phylogenies to date
   eight independent marine transitions in three subfamilies. Deep nodes
   involve subfamily Telmatogetoninae (originating mid-Cretaceous, 101-128,
   114 Ma), with sister genera Telmatogeton Schiner and Thalassomya Schiner
   splitting later in the Cretaceous (56-82, 69 Ma). Two transitions in
   Orthocladiinae involve Clunio Haliday and Pseudosmittia Edwards, dating
   from the upper Cretaceous, both with Eocene crown groups. In subfamily
   Chironominae, transitions to marine occur in two tribes. Four
   transitions occur within the otherwise nonmarine crown groups
   Kiefferulus Goetghebuer, Dicrotendipes Kieffer, Polypedilum Kieffer and
   Ainuyusurika Sasa \& Shirasaka. Two separate robust clades in tribe
   Tanytarsini involve: (1) a minor radiation within Paratanytarsus dated
   to the mid-Eocene around 43 Ma; and (2) an unexpected but fully
   supported diversification in Pontomyia Edwards plus Yaetanytarsus Sasa
   dated to around 47 Ma, with separation of Pontomyia from Yaetanytarsus
   around 40 Ma. Crown Pontomyia, represented by three species, was
   estimated to have diverged around 19 Ma, whereas the crown radiation of
   Yaetanytarsus, with 12 sampled species, dates to the mid-Eocene. In a
   comprehensive global review we concisely document new synonymies and new
   combinations revealed by the study. The evolutionary timing estimate
   provides insights into the frequency of marine transitions and
   diversifications in the Chironomidae in association with dynamic oceanic
   changes during the Oligocene and Miocene.},

Abstract = {Organization and functioning of immune system remain unevenly studied in
   different taxa of lophotrochozoan animals. We analyzed transcriptomic
   data on coelomocytes of the lugworm Arenicola marina (Linnaeus, 1758;
   Annelida, Polychaeta) to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms
   involved in polychaete immunity. Coelomocytes are specialized motile
   cells populating coelomic fluid of annelids, responsible for cellular
   defense reactions and providing humoral immune factors. The
   transcriptome was enriched with immune-related transcripts by
   challenging the cells in vitro with lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia
   coli and Zymosan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis revealed a
   multifaceted and complex internal defense system of the lugworm. A.
   marina possesses orthologs of proto-complement-like factors: six
   thioester-containing proteins, a complement-like receptor, and a
   MASP-related serine protease (MReM2). A. marina coelomocytes employ
   pattern-recognition receptors to detect pathogens and regulate immune
   responses. Among them, there are 18 Toll-like receptors and various
   putative lectin-like proteins with evolutionary conserved and
   taxa-specific domains. C-type lectins and a novel family of Gal-binding
   and CUB domains containing receptors were the most abundant in the
   transcriptome. The array of pore-forming proteins in the coelomocytes
   was surprisingly reduced compared to that of other invertebrate species.
   We characterized a set of conserved proteins metabolizing reactive
   oxygen species and nitric oxide and expanded the arsenal of potential
   antimicrobial peptides. Phenoloxidase activity in immune cells of
   lugworm is mediated only by laccase enzyme. The described repertoire of
   immune-associated molecules provides valuable candidates for further
   functional and comparative research on the immunity of annelids.},

Title = {On the hormonal control of posterior regeneration in the annelid

Abstract = {Regeneration is the process by which many animals are able to restore
   lost or injured body parts. After amputation of the posterior part of
   its body, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is able to regenerate the
   pygidium, the posteriormost part of its body that bears the anus, and a
   subterminal growth zone containing stem cells that allows the subsequent
   addition of new segments. The ability to regenerate their posterior part
   (posterior regeneration) is promoted, in juvenile worms, by a hormone
   produced by the brain and is lost when this hormonal activity becomes
   low at the time the worms undergo their sexual maturation. By
   characterizing posterior regeneration at the morphological and molecular
   levels in worms that have been decapitated, we show that the presence of
   the head is essential for multiple aspects of posterior regeneration, as
   well as for the subsequent production of new segments. We also show that
   methylfarnesoate, the molecule proposed to be the brain hormone, can
   partially rescue the posterior regeneration defects observed in
   decapitated worms. Our results are therefore consistent with a key role
   of brain hormonal activity in the control of regeneration and growth in
   P. dumerilii, and support the hypothesis of the involvement of
   methylfarnesoate in this control.},

Abstract = {Domestication has led to many changes in domestic animal biology,
   including their anatomy. The shape of the inner ear, part of the
   mammalian ear, has been found particularly relevant for discriminating
   domesticated species, their hybrids or differentiating the wild and
   domestic populations of a single species. Here we assessed the use of
   the size and shape of the semicircular canals (SCC) of the inner ear as
   a marker of pig domestication. We studied a total of 63 petrosal bones
   belonging to wild boar (Sus scrofa, two populations) and domestic pigs
   (extensively and intensively reared specimens) that were mu CT-scanned
   and from which the size and the shape of the inner ear were quantified
   through geometric morphometrics, analyzing the 3D coordinates of 6
   landmarks and 60 sliding semilandmarks localized on the SCC and the
   common crus. The domestic pigs have larger SCC than the wild boar from
   which they also strongly differ in shape (correct cross validation of
   95.5\%, confidence interval: 92.3\%-98.1\%). Strong shape differences
   were detected between the two populations of wild boar, as well as a
   sexual size dimorphism. All together the results highlight the taxonomic
   discriminant power of the SCC of the inner ear shape, and its relevance
   for domestication studies.},

Abstract = {Insects are the dominant group of animals on Earth. Despite this
   abundance, most of our knowledge about many aspects of their biology and
   development come from a unique model, the vinegar fly, Drosophila
   melanogaster. Nevertheless, in the last years, the advances in molecular
   tools and imaging techniques have allowed the emergence of new insect
   models, adding valuable information to decipher the morphogenetic bases
   behind the formation and evolution of the vast diversity of shapes,
   sizes, and patterns that characterize them. Earwigs belong to Dermaptera
   which is a small order clustered in the Polyneopteran group. They are
   hemimetabolous insects with a flattened body, characteristic abdominal
   pincers, and maternal care behavior. This last feature and their role in
   agroecosystems have been studied in cosmopolitan species such as
   Forficula auricularia and Euborellia annulipes; however, their
   reproduction and embryonic development have been poorly addressed in
   laboratory conditions. In response, here we describe the ring-legged
   earwig Euborellia annulipes embryogenesis and life cycle from nymphal to
   adult stages, its reproduction, and essential morphological and
   behavioral characters. Additionally, using confocal and transmission
   electron microscopy we analyzed in detail the morphogenesis of its
   peculiar meroistic polytrophic ovary. Our aim is to provide an emerging
   model system to perform comparative studies on insect oogenesis,
   development, and morphological evolution.},

Title = {Is there a loophole in Dollo's law? A DevoEvo perspective on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL
   EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 29},
Abstract = {There is a longstanding interest in whether the loss of complex
   characters is reversible (so-called ``Dollo's law{''}). Reevolution has
   been suggested for numerous traits but among the first was Kurten, who
   proposed that the presence of the second lower molar (M-2) of the
   Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) was a violation of Dollo's law because all
   other Felids lack M-2. While an early and often cited example for the
   reevolution of a complex trait, Kurten and Werdelin used an ad hoc
   parsimony argument to support their. Here I revisit the evidence that
   M-2 reevolved lynx using explicit parsimony and maximum likelihood
   models of character evolution and find strong evidence that Kurten and
   Werdelin were correct-M-2 reevolved in E. lynx. Next, I explore the
   developmental mechanisms which may explain this violation of Dollo's law
   and suggest that the reevolution of lost complex traits may arise from
   the reevolution of cis-regulatory elements and protein-protein
   interactions, which have a longer half-life after silencing that protein
   coding genes. Finally, I present a developmental model to explain the
   reevolution M-2 in E. lynx, which suggest that the developmental
   programs required for the establishment of serially homologous
   characters may never really be lost so long as a single instance of the
   character remains-thus the gain and loss and regain of serially
   homologous characters, such mammalian molars, may be developmentally and
   evolutionarily ``simple.{''}},

Abstract = {Sperm chemotaxis, in which sperms are attracted to conspecific eggs via
   species-specific attractants, plays an important role in fertilization.
   This phenomenon has been observed in various animals and
   species-specific sperm attractants have been reported in some species.
   However, the mechanisms involved in the reception and recognition of the
   species-specific attractant by the sperms is poorly studied. Previously,
   we found that the plasma membrane-type Ca2+/ATPase (PMCA) is the
   receptor for the sperm-activating and -attracting factor (SAAF) in the
   ascidian Ciona intestinalis. To determine the role of PMCA in
   species-specific sperm chemotaxis, we identified the amino acid
   sequences of PMCAs derived from six Phlebobranchia species. The
   testis-specific splice variant of PMCA was found to be present in all
   the species investigated and the ascidian-specific sequence was detected
   near the 3 `-terminus. Moreover, dN/dS analysis revealed that the
   extracellular loops 1, 2, and 4 in ascidian PMCA underwent a positive
   selection. These findings suggest that PMCA recognizes the
   species-specific structure of SAAF at the extracellular loops 1, 2, and
   4, and its testis-specific C-terminal region is involved in the
   activation and chemotaxis of ascidian sperms.},

Abstract = {Organismal phenotypes result largely from inherited developmental
   programs, usually executed during embryonic and juvenile life stages.
   These programs are not blank slates onto which natural selection can
   draw arbitrary forms. Rather, the mechanisms of development play an
   integral role in shaping phenotypic diversity and help determine the
   evolutionary trajectories of species. Modern evolutionary biology must,
   therefore, account for these mechanisms in both theory and in practice.
   The gene regulatory network (GRN) concept represents a potent tool for
   achieving this goal whose utility has grown in tandem with advances in
   ``omic{''} technologies and experimental techniques. However, while the
   GRN concept is widely utilized, it is often less clear what practical
   implications it has for conducting research in evolutionary
   developmental biology. In this Perspective, we attempt to provide
   clarity by discussing how experiments and projects can be designed in
   light of the GRN concept. We first map familiar biological notions onto
   the more abstract components of GRN models. We then review how diverse
   functional genomic approaches can be directed toward the goal of
   constructing such models and discuss current methods for functionally
   testing evolutionary hypotheses that arise from them. Finally, we show
   how the major steps of GRN model construction and experimental
   validation suggest generalizable workflows that can serve as a scaffold
   for project design. Taken together, the practical implications that we
   draw from the GRN concept provide a set of guideposts for studies aiming
   at unraveling the molecular basis of phenotypic diversity.},

Abstract = {Linoleic acid is the material for biosynthesis of sex attracting and
   blocking (postmating) pheromones in Nasonia vitripennis, it is
   synthesized from oleic acid by a male-biased fatty acid desaturase
   (SCD5a). In this study, we developed a specific antibody and further
   characterized the expression patterns of SCD5a in males at different
   mating stages by western blot. SCD5a was mainly expressed in male heads
   rather than in abdomens. Along with the aging process (from Day 1 to Day
   3), SCD5a increased significantly. Compared with virgin males, mated
   males showed higher levels of SCD5a. Likewise, abdomen dipping
   frequency, during which males release attracting pheromone, increased
   with age and mating. Moreover, real-time quantitative PCR revealed that
   genes responsible for the first three steps of attracting pheromone
   biosynthesis were more highly expressed in head than in abdomen, but the
   final gene for transformation of attracting pheromone was more highly
   expressed in abdomen than in head. These results suggest that linoleic
   acid for biosynthesis of attracting pheromones may also originate from
   the head rather than only synthesized at the rectal vesicles.},

Abstract = {Yak has evolved specific adaptative mechanisms to high-altitude
   environment. Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation
   in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and
   transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle
   tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan
   cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs
   potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis.
   Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly
   involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood
   pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA
   repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes
   associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle,
   suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes. Overall, the
   present study contributes basic data at the DNA methylation level to
   further understand the physiological metabolism in yak.},

Abstract = {Studies of domesticated animals have greatly contributed to our
   understanding of avian embryology. Foundational questions in
   developmental biology were motivated by Aristotle's observations of
   chicken embryos. By the 19th century, the chicken embryo was at the
   center stage of developmental biology, but how closely does this model
   species mirror the ample taxonomic diversity that characterizes the
   avian tree of life? Here, we provide a brief overview of the taxonomic
   breadth of comparative embryological studies in birds. We particularly
   focused on staging tables and papers that attempted to document the
   timing of developmental transformations. We show that most of the
   current knowledge of avian embryology is based on Galliformes (chicken
   and quail) and Anseriformes (duck and goose). Nonetheless, data are
   available for some ecologically diverse avian subclades, including
   Struthioniformes (e.g., ostrich, emu) and Sphenisciformes (penguins).
   Thus far, there has only been a handful of descriptive embryological
   studies in the most speciose subclade of Aves, that is, the songbirds
   (Passeriniformes). Furthermore, we found that temporal variances for
   developmental events are generally uniform across a consensus
   chronological sequence for birds. Based on the available data,
   developmental trajectories for chicken and other model species appear to
   be highly similar. We discuss future avenues of research in comparative
   avian embryology in light of the currently available wealth of data on
   domesticated species and beyond.},

Abstract = {Larvae of temnopleurid sea urchins form a cell mass (CM) instead of an
   amniotic cavity on the left side at the early developmental stage for
   formation of the adult rudiment. However, the cell lineage and the
   mechanisms that form the CM are still unknown. We analyzed the potential
   to form a CM in partial embryos resulting from microsurgeries, using two
   temnopleurid species, Mespilia globulus (L.) and Temnopleurus
   toreumaticus (Leske). CM formation was completed 28-34 h after
   fertilization at 24 degrees C, corresponding to the period from the late
   prism to the two-armed pluteus larval stages in both species. In the
   case of specimens dissected horizontally during the mesenchyme blastula
   to prism stages, the CM was formed in partial embryos containing enough
   of the an2 region, a part of the precursor cells that differentiate the
   ectoderm. The proportion of specimens with a CM was higher in T.
   toreumaticus than in M. globulus. Additionally, all larvae derived from
   half embryos obtained from dissection along the animal-vegetal axis at
   the mesenchyme blastula stage formed the CM. Transplantation of a
   stained animal or vegetal hemisphere at the 16-cell stage into a
   nonstained vegetal or animal embryo indicated that the CM derives from
   the animal half. Exogastrulae vegetalized by lithium chloride treatment
   did not form the CM. These results indicate that the CM formation is
   dependent not only on the an2 region but also on signals from the
   vegetal region after the mesenchyme blastula stage.},

Abstract = {Averting human-induced extinctions will require strong policy
   commitments that comprehensively address threats to species. A new
   Global Biodiversity Framework is currently being negotiated by the
   world's governments through the Convention on Biological Diversity. Here
   we explored how the suggested targets in this framework could contribute
   to reducing threats to threatened vertebrates, invertebrates, and
   plants, and assessed the importance of a proposed target to implement
   recovery actions for threatened species. Although many of the targets
   benefit species, we found that extinction risk for over half (57\%) of
   threatened species would not be reduced sufficiently without a target
   promoting recovery actions, including ex situ conservation,
   reintroductions, and other species-specific interventions. A median of
   54 threatened species per country require such actions, and most
   countries of the world hold such species. Preventing future
   human-induced extinctions requires policy commitments to implement
   targeted recovery actions for threatened species in addition to broader
   efforts to mitigate threats, underpinned by transformative change.},

Abstract = {Extreme climatic events (ECEs) are increasing in frequency and magnitude
   as part of global climate change, with severe consequences for both
   nature and human societies. While many restoration projects account for
   gradual climate change, ECEs are rarely considered. Through a literature
   search and the use of expert opinion, we reviewed the impacts of ECEs on
   habitat restoration projects, and the degree to which they were
   resilient. ECEs had overwhelmingly negative impacts on habitat
   restoration, although some projects also reported positive outcomes. The
   severity of impact varied among and within projects. Nearly all projects
   that included more than one focal species, life stage or genotype,
   restoration method, site, habitat type, or microhabitat reported better
   outcomes for at least one of these project aspects. We suggest that
   practitioners may be able to reduce risk from future ECEs through a
   portfolio approach, incorporating heterogeneity into project design,
   including in site selection and propagule choices.},

Abstract = {Regeneration, the ability to replace lost body parts, is a widespread
   phenomenon in the animal kingdom often connected to asexual reproduction
   or fission, since the only difference between the two appears to be the
   stimulus that triggers them. Both developmental processes have largely
   been characterized; however, the molecular toolkit and genetic
   mechanisms underlying these events remain poorly unexplored. Annelids,
   in particular the oligochaete Pristina leidyi, provide a good model
   system to investigate these processes as they show diverse ways to
   regenerate, and can reproduce asexually through fission under laboratory
   conditions. Here, we used a comparative transcriptomics approach based
   on RNA-sequencing and differential gene expression analyses to
   understand the molecular mechanisms involved in anterior regeneration
   and asexual reproduction. We found 291 genes upregulated during anterior
   regeneration, including several regeneration-related genes previously
   reported in other annelids such as frizzled, paics, and vdra. On the
   other hand, during asexual reproduction, 130 genes were found
   upregulated, and unexpectedly, many of them were related to germline
   development during sexual reproduction. We also found important
   differences between anterior regeneration and asexual reproduction, with
   the latter showing a gene expression profile more similar to that of
   control individuals. Nevertheless, we identified 35 genes that were
   upregulated in both conditions, many of them related to cell
   pluripotency, stem cells, and cell proliferation. Overall, our results
   shed light on the molecular mechanisms that control anterior
   regeneration and asexual reproduction in annelids and reveal
   similarities with other animals, suggesting that the genetic machinery
   controlling these processes is conserved across metazoans.},

Abstract = {The Issidae are highly diverse in terms of morphology and species
   richness. Despite recent efforts, the internal phylogeny and
   classification of this planthopper family remain controversial. Here, we
   present a phylogeny of the family inferred with Bayesian and Maximum
   Likelihood analyses of a nine-gene molecular dataset (4702 bp) and
   morphological data (35 characters) across a broad sample of taxa (99
   terminals). Based on these results, we verify the taxonomic status of
   the issid subfamilies, tribes and generic complexes. Results revealed a
   well-supported basal dichotomy of the family into two clades,
   corresponding to the subfamilies Issinae and Hysteropterinae. Within
   Issinae, the tribes Issini, Thioniini, Sarimini, Hemisphaeriini,
   Parahiraciini and Kodaianellini were recovered with high support. Four
   strongly statistically supported clades were revealed within the
   subfamily Hysteropterinae, but we refrain from taxonomic decisions in
   the absence of morphological characters to diagnose the clades A-C.
   Interestingly, the obtained results are in good agreement with L.
   Melichar's view on Issidae classification suggested more than a century
   ago. Our results challenge an early Cretaceous origin of the Issidae and
   the basal split of the family between Neotropical taxa (Thioniini) and
   the remaining issids.},

Title = {Defensive spines are associated with large geographic range but not
   diversification in spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Several prominent evolutionary theories propose mechanisms whereby the
   evolution of a defensive trait or suite of traits causes significant
   shifts in species diversification rate and niche evolution. We
   investigate the role of cuticular spines, a highly variable
   morphological defensive trait in the hyperdiverse ant genus Polyrhachis,
   on species diversification and geographic range size. Informed by key
   innovation theory and the escape-and-radiate hypothesis, we predicted
   that clades with longer spines would exhibit elevated rates of
   diversification and larger range sizes compared to clades with shorter
   spines. To address these predictions, we estimated phylogenetic
   relationships with a phylogenomic approach utilizing ultraconserved
   elements and compiled morphological and biogeographic trait databases.
   In contrast to the first prediction, we found no association between
   diversification rate and any trait (spine length, body size and range
   size), with the sole exception of a positive association between range
   size and diversification in one of three trait-based diversification
   analyses. However, we recovered a positive phylogenetic correlation
   between spine length and geographic range size, suggesting that spines
   promote expanded geographic range. Notably, these results were
   consistent across analyses using different phylogenetic inference
   approaches and spine trait measurement schemes. This study provides a
   rare investigation of the role of a defensive trait on geographic range
   size, and ultimately supports the hypothesis that defensive spines are a
   factor in increased range size in Polyrhachis ants. Furthermore, the
   lack of support for an association between spines and diversification,

Title = {Phylogenetics and host-specificity of the mega-diverse louse genus
   Myrsidea (Amblycera: Menoponidae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Myrsidea Waterston is the most diverse genus of chewing lice, primarily
   parasitizing perching birds (Passeriformes), which is the most speciose
   avian order. Myrsidea also parasitize several hosts from non-passerine
   groups, including toucans, barbets, woodpeckers (Piciformes) and
   hummingbirds (Apodiformes). To examine host specificity, host switching
   and generic limits, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the avian feather
   louse genus Myrsidea using DNA sequence data from two fragments of the
   mitochondrial COI gene and a fragment of the nuclear EF-1 alpha gene for
   152 Myrsidea specimens collected from 23 avian host families. Unlike
   other highly diverse louse genera, only a small proportion of Myrsidea
   species parasitize more than one host species. We found that host family
   has significant phylogenetic signal on the Myrsidea phylogeny. These
   results suggest that Myrsidea is generally highly host-specific, with
   some exceptions where host switching is important. We found that there
   are two separate groups of Myrsidea that parasitize toucans, and that
   both are nested within Myrsidea found on perching birds, suggesting that
   these toucan ectoparasites may have arisen from two independent host
   switching events. Lastly, representatives of the genus Ramphasticola
   Carriker, which was originally described as a distinct genus due to a
   suite of morphologically unique characters, falls in with a strongly
   supported clade of Myrsidea parasitizing Ramphastos toucans, and
   therefore we definitively place Ramphasticola as a synonym of Myrsidea.},

Abstract = {For over 150 years, Indo-Pacific species have been colonizing the
   Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal, with increasing ecological and
   socioeconomic impacts. Using an ensemble of species distribution models
   and ten invasive fish species as a case study, we demonstrate that
   warming conditions are now weakening the climatic barriers that
   historically prevented these species from expanding further and moving
   into the Atlantic Ocean. On the basis of our analysis, we discuss the
   prospect for studying an underappreciated large-scale process: namely,
   the evolution of a novel unidirectional faunal interchange between two
   distant oceans.},

Abstract = {Every year, field excursions engage students of ecology in experiential
   learning that results in wide-ranging and well-documented pedagogical
   benefits. Much less appreciated, however, is the potential for these
   excursions to contribute long-term data that advance scientific
   knowledge and natural resource management. Here we explore this
   potential by providing a global synthesis of field data collection,
   mapping the geography, temporal extent, and type of data collected by
   students worldwide, and calling attention to the associated benefits and
   challenges for course instructors. We then offer perspectives on how
   undergraduate courses in ecology can more broadly contribute to science,
   management, and policy. Finally, we highlight how several aspects -
   namely, existing frameworks, resources, and networks; enhanced
   institutional support; and synergies with the broader science community
   - can help undergraduate ecology courses achieve their full potential
   for contributing to both education and science for society.},

Abstract = {For successful conservation of biodiversity, it is vital to know whether
   protected areas in increasingly fragmented landscapes effectively
   safeguard species. However, how large habitat fragments must be, and
   what level of protection is required to sustain species, remains poorly
   known. We compiled a global dataset on almost 2000 bird species in 741
   forest fragments varying in size and protection status, and show that
   protection is associated with higher bird occurrence, especially for
   threatened species. Protection becomes increasingly effective with
   increasing size of forest fragments. For forest fragments >50 ha our
   results show that strict protection (International Union for
   Conservation of Nature {[}IUCN] categories I-IV) is strongly associated
   with higher bird occurrence, whereas fragments had to be at least 175 ha
   for moderate protection (IUCN categories V and VI) to have a positive
   effect. This meta-analysis quantifies the importance of fragment size,
   protection status, and their interaction for the conservation of bird
   species communities, and stresses that protection should not be limited
   to large pristine areas.},

Abstract = {Egg size is a fast-evolving trait among Drosophilids expected to change
   the spatial distribution of morphogens that pattern the embryonic axes.
   Here we asked whether the patterning of the dorsal region of the embryo
   by the Decapentaplegic/Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (DPP/BMP-4) gradient
   is scaled among Drosophila species with different egg sizes. This region
   specifies the extra-embryonic tissue amnioserosa and the ectoderm. We
   find that the entire dorsal region scales with embryo size, but the gene
   expression patterns regulated by DPP are not proportional, suggesting
   that the DPP gradient is differentially scaled during evolution. To
   further test whether the DPP gradient can scale or not in Drosophila
   melanogaster, we created embryos with expanded dorsal regions that mimic
   changes in scale seen in other species and measured the resulting
   domains of DPP-target genes. We find that the proportions of these
   domains are not maintained, suggesting that the DPP gradient is unable
   to scale in the embryo. These and previous findings suggest that the
   embryonic dorso-ventral patterning lack scaling in the ventral and
   dorsal sides but is robust in the lateral region where the neuroectoderm
   is specified and two opposing gradients, Dorsal/NFkappa-B and DPP,
   intersect. We propose that the lack of scaling of the DPP gradient may
   contribute to changes in the size of the amnioserosa and the numbers of
   ectodermal cells with specific cortical tensions, which are expected to
   generate distinct mechanical forces for gastrulating embryos of
   different sizes.},

Abstract = {The introduction of nonindigenous species (NIS) threatens global
   ecosystems and results primarily from human transportation and trade
   activities. Although some NIS can disperse immediately upon arrival (for
   example, mobile species), actual inoculation for other (sessile) species
   can require a reproductive event to produce propagules that disperse and
   establish. NIS reproductive potential, however, can vary with
   environmental conditions experienced during transit and upon arrival
   that differ substantially by route. We propose that variation in
   reproductive responses, both across species and transit routes, is a
   critical but overlooked driver of species invasions. We illustrate these
   concepts using vessel biofouling organisms, which are exposed to vastly
   different conditions during transport across the world's oceans. Current
   knowledge gaps prevent precise predictions of the potential for species
   to be introduced via reproduction. Integrating reproductive potential
   into management strategies is key to limiting NIS spread, particularly
   as climate change and novel events continue to alter global
   transportation networks. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Effective digital environmental communication is integral to galvanizing
   public support for conservation in the age of social media.
   Environmental advocates require messaging strategies suited to social
   media platforms, including ways to identify, target, and mobilize
   distinct audiences. Here, we provide - to the best of our knowledge -
   the first systematic characterization of environmental personas on
   social media. Beginning with 1 million environmental nongovernmental
   organization (NGO) followers on Twitter, of which 500,000 users met data
   quality criteria, we identified six personas that differ in their
   expression of 21 environmental issues. General consistency in the
   proportional composition of personas was detected across 14 countries
   with sufficiently large samples. Within the US, although the six
   personas varied in their mean political ideology, we did not observe
   that the personas split along political party lines. Our results pave
   the way for environmental advocates - including NGOs, public agencies,
   and researchers - to use audience segmentation methods like the methods
   discussed here to target and tailor messages to distinct constituencies
   at high speed and at large scale.},

Abstract = {The environment plays an important role in an individual's development
   during early life, however, parents may also influence offspring
   development through so called ``parental effects.{''} We examined the
   effects of environmental enrichment in zebrafish (Danio rerio) across
   two generations through the paternal lineage. Fathers and grandfathers
   were exposed to either standard or high levels of housing enrichment for
   4-weeks during adulthood. First-generation (F1) and second-generation
   (F2) offspring were obtained from controlled breeding and tested as
   larvae for changes in morphology at hatching stage (72hpf), and in
   locomotor activity at larval stage (120hpf) in both generations. We
   found paternal experience of enrichment resulted in changes in trunk
   length of F1 offspring and changes in spine curvature and dorsal length
   of F2 offspring, while changes in snout morphology of F2 offspring
   seemed to be driven by whether grandpaternal and paternal experience of
   the environment was matched or not. We found that while paternal
   enrichment increased the frequency of spontaneous movement in F1 and F2
   offspring, interacting effects of paternal and grandpaternal enrichment
   on movement distance were seen in F2 offspring, and that spontaneous
   movement and the distance that larvae swam are thus distinct phenotypes
   that were differentially affected by the experiences of previous
   paternal generations. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
   parental and grandparental environment influence zebrafish behavior and
   morphology. The nature of these effects and the design of this study
   mean that these phenotypes were likely the result of nongenetic
   transmission through the paternal germline.},

Abstract = {Classical Drosophila eye color mutations have unearthed a toolkit of
   genes that have permitted candidate gene studies of the outstanding
   diversity of coloration patterns in other insects. The gene underlying
   the eye color phenotypes of the red Malphigian tubules (red) fly mutant
   was mapped to a LysM domain gene of unknown molecular function. Here, we
   used RNAi to test the role of a red ortholog in the pigmentation of the
   milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, and contrast its effect with the
   ommochrome biosynthetic pathway gene vermilion (ver). Pigmentation was
   reduced in the cuticle of embryonic legs and first instar abdomens
   following parental RNAi against red, but not against ver, likely
   reflecting an effect on pterin biogenesis. Nymphal RNAi of red and ver
   both resulted in adult eye depigmentation, consistent with an effect on
   ommochrome content. These results suggest red loss-of-function impacts
   biochemically distinct types of pigments, and we discuss its putative
   role in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as
   ommochromasomes and pterinosomes.},

Abstract = {The chondrocranium is a key structure of the skull, but our knowledge of
   its embryonic development is based mostly on investigations of few
   stages across taxa. Variation of chondrocranial features is known across
   species, but little is known about intraspecific variation, or its
   evolution in the context of domestication. Here, we investigated two
   specific structures of the chondrocranium in three windows of embryonic
   development. The anatomy of one of these structures was also compared
   among adult skulls of chickens and their wild ancestor (red junglefowl
   {[}RJF]). The proccesus tectalis and the prenasal process, along with
   the surrounding area of the orbitonasal foramina, presented variation
   throughout the ontogeny and in the adults. The processus tectalis showed
   distinct variation from the earliest stage studied to the adult. The
   numbers of orbitonasal foramina were also found to be variable in the
   ancestor and breeds studied. Furthermore, during early embryonic
   development, the prenasal process is similar across breeds and RJF, but
   later in embryonic development this structure presents variable states.
   The embryonic and adult variation found herein could be an example of
   intraspecific variation under domestication, resulting from different
   types of tissue interrelationship during development.},

Title = {An evaluation of the effect of hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment on
   keratins},

   EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {340},

Abstract = {Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is commonly used in geological and
   paleontological research to extract organic fossils for morphological
   and chemical studies. However, during HF treatment, organic matter can
   also be altered, which raises concerns that HF-treated organic matter
   may not be representative of the original organic matter. To provide
   reference data for protein studies on fossils, herein, we use Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the effect of HF
   (21.3 M) treatment on keratins, with treatment durations ranging from 2
   to 48 h. Results show that the FTIR spectra of HF-treated samples are
   overall similar to that of the untreated sample, while curve fitting
   shows that HF treatment has led to alteration of the secondary structure
   in all the HF-treated samples and the effect is time-dependent. The 2-
   and 4-h treatment mainly reduced the content of the random coils,
   alpha-helix, and intermolecular beta-sheet. From 8h onwards, the content
   of random coils greatly increased at the expense of other structures.
   Our results imply that for protein detection in fossils using FTIR
   spectroscopy, the negative effect of HF treatment is not substantial, as
   the bands characteristic of proteins, that is, amide A, amide B, amide
   I, amide II, and amide III, are still present after the 48-h treatment.
   If the target is a secondary structure, the effect of HF treatment
   should be considered. When HF treatment is necessary, limiting the
   treatment duration to less than 4h may be a choice.},

Title = {How body patterning might have worked in the evolution of arthropods-A

Abstract = {Body organization within arthropods is enormously diverse, but a fusion
   of segments into ``functional groups{''} (tagmatization) is found in all
   species. Within Tetraconata/Pancrustacea, an anterior head, a locomotory
   thorax region, and a posterior, mostly limbless tagma known as the
   abdomen is present. The posterior-most tagma in crustaceans is
   frequently confused with the malacostracan, for example, decapod pleon
   often misleadingly termed abdomen, however, its evolutionary and
   developmental origin continues to pose a riddle, especially the
   completely limbless abdomen of the ``entomostracan morphotype{''} (e.g.,
   fairy shrimps). Since the discovery of Hox genes and their involvement
   in specifying the morphology or identity of segments, tagmata, or
   regions along the anteroposterior axis of an organism, only a few
   studies have focused on model organisms representing the ``entomostracan
   morphotype{''} and used a variety of dedicated Hox genes and their
   transcription products to shine light on abdomen formation. The homeotic
   genes or the molecular processes that determine the identity of the
   entomostracan abdomen remain unknown to date. This study focuses on the
   ``entomostracan morphotype{''} representative Derocheilocaris remanei
   (Mystacocarida). We present a complete overview of development
   throughout larval stages and investigate homeotic gene expression data
   using the antibody FP6.87 that binds specifically to epitopes of
   Ultrabithorax/Abdominal-A proteins. Our results suggest that the abdomen
   in Mystacocarida is bipartite (abdomen I + abdomen II). We suggest that
   the limbless abdomen is an evolutionary novelty that evolved several
   times independently within crustaceans and which might be the result of
   a progressive reduction of former thoracic segments into abdominal
   segments.},

Abstract = {Captive-breeding programs are actively engaged in conservation and
   resource enhancement for a variety of species around the world, yet
   captive-bred individuals often experience reduced fitness in the wild
   due to inbreeding and adaptation to captivity. Increasing wild-type
   genetic contributions has been proposed as one solution to this problem,
   but the demographic impacts of these contributions remain unclear. Using
   data from long-term mass-marking programs conducted by national
   hatcheries in Japan, we evaluated the effects of wild genes in the
   parental generation on the survival of captive-bred populations. Our
   results indicated that increasing the percentage of wild genes improves
   survival of captive-bred offspring in the wild in two salmonid species.
   These findings offer insights for future bioresource management efforts
   that use both wild and captive-bred individuals.},

Abstract = {Wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs), the juxtaposition of highly and
   minimally developed lands, are an increasingly prominent feature on
   Earth. WUIs are hotspots of environmental and ecological change that are
   often priority areas for planning and management. A better understanding
   of WUI dynamics and their role in the coupling between cities and
   surrounding wildlands is needed to reduce the risk of environmental
   hazards, ensure the continued provisioning of ecosystem services, and
   conserve threatened biodiversity. To fill this need, we propose an
   expanded framework for WUIs that not only conceptualizes these
   interfaces as emergent and functional components of socioecological
   processes but also extends them vertically from the bedrock to the top
   of the vegetation and horizontally across heterogeneous landscapes. This
   framework encourages management that reconciles pervasive trade-offs
   between development and resulting multiple environmental impacts.
   Focusing on southern California as a case study, we use the framework to
   facilitate integration across disciplines and between scientists and
   managers.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and degradation, and their interaction with other threats,
   are driving declines in animal populations worldwide. One potential
   approach for mitigating these threats is to create artificial habitat
   structures as substitutes for lost or degraded natural structures. Here,
   we provide - to the best of our knowledge - the first general definition
   of artificial habitat structures and synthesize important considerations
   for their effective use. We show that such structures represent a
   versatile conservation tool that has been trialed in a variety of
   contexts globally, albeit with varying degrees of success. The design of
   these structures must be well informed by the drivers of natural habitat
   selection, and their use should be part of an experimental framework to
   enable evaluation and refinement. We highlight possible ecological risks
   associated with the use of artificial habitat structures and urge that
   they not be exploited as inappropriate biodiversity offsets or for
   greenwashing. Looking forward, cross-disciplinary collaborations will
   facilitate the development of sophisticated and effective structures to
   assist animal conservation in this era of rapid global change.},

Abstract = {Conversion of tropical peat swamp forests to meet the demand for
   industrial plantations and agricultural production systems has triggered
   rapid and substantial carbon loss in the Asia-Pacific region. Various
   management practices have been designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2),
   methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from tropical peat
   soils after changes in land use. We conducted a meta-analysis using 506
   paired observations on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from peat soils
   under different land uses and the effects of management practices on
   emissions. As compared to peat swamp forest, other land uses had higher
   emissions of CO2 (heterotrophic respiration) and N2O from soils, whereas
   soil-based CH4 emissions were also increased but not significantly so.
   Raising the water table decreased CO2 emissions but increased N2O
   emissions; reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs led to decreased CO2 and
   N2O emissions in oil-palm (Elaeis spp) plantations and cropping systems;
   and shading and growing cover crops decreased CO2 emissions. Practices
   such as these are needed for careful management of tropical peatlands,
   and additional measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales
   are required to guide future GHG mitigation strategies in tropical
   peatlands.},

Abstract = {Latently infected CD4+ T cells represent one of the major obstacles to
   HIV eradication even after receiving prolonged highly active
   anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term use of HAART causes the
   emergence of drug-resistant virus which is then involved in HIV
   transmission. In this paper, we develop mathematical HIV models with
   staged disease progression by incorporating entry inhibitor and latently
   infected cells. We find that entry inhibitor has the same effect as
   protease inhibitor on the model dynamics and therefore would benefit HIV
   patients who developed resistance to many of current anti-HIV
   medications. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results
   and show that the virus and latently infected cells reach an infected
   steady state in the absence of treatment and are eliminated under
   treatment whereas the model including homeostatic proliferation of
   latently infected cells maintains the virus at low level during
   suppressive treatment. Therefore, complete cure of HIV needs complete
   eradication of latent reservoirs.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs)
   significantly affect the population dynamics. In this paper, we propose
   a general mathematical modelling approach incorporating the impact of
   habitat size reduction and non-lethal harvesting of NTFP on population
   dynamics. The model framework integrates experimental data of Pentadesma
   butyracea in Benin. This framework allows us to determine the rational
   non-lethal harvesting level and habitat size to ensure the stability of
   the plant ecosystem, and to study the impacts of distinct levels of
   humidity. We suggest non-lethal harvesting policies that maximize the
   economic benefit for local populations.},

Abstract = {Domestication leads to phenotypic characteristics that have been
   described to be similar across species. However, this ``domestication
   syndrome{''} has been subject to debate, related to a lack of evidence
   for certain characteristics in many species. Here we review diverse
   literature and provide new data on cranial shape changes due to
   domestication in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a
   preliminary case study, thus contributing novel evidence to the debate.
   We quantified cranial shape of 30 wild and domestic rabbits using
   micro-computed tomography scans and three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics. The goal was to test (1) if the domesticates exhibit
   shorter and broader snouts, smaller teeth, and smaller braincases than
   their wild counterparts; (2) to what extent allometric scaling is
   responsible for cranial shape variation; (3) if there is evidence for
   more variation in the neural crest-derived parts of the cranium compared
   with those derived of the mesoderm, in accordance with the ``neural
   crest hypothesis.{''} Our own data are consistent with older literature
   records, suggesting that although there is evidence for some cranial
   characteristics of the ``domestication syndrome{''} in rabbits, facial
   length is not reduced. In accordance with the ``neural crest
   hypothesis,{''} we found more shape variation in neural crest versus
   mesoderm-derived parts of the cranium. Within the domestic group,
   allometric scaling relationships of the snout, the braincase, and the
   teeth shed new light on ubiquitous patterns among related taxa. This
   study-albeit preliminary due to the limited sample size-adds to the
   growing evidence concerning nonuniform patterns associated with
   domestication.},

Abstract = {Despite substantial progress in understanding global biodiversity loss,
   major taxonomic and geographic knowledge gaps remain. Decision makers
   often rely on expert judgement to fill knowledge gaps, but are rarely
   able to engage with sufficiently large and diverse groups of
   specialists. To improve understanding of the perspectives of thousands
   of biodiversity experts worldwide, we conducted a survey and asked
   experts to focus on the taxa and freshwater, terrestrial, or marine
   ecosystem with which they are most familiar. We found several points of
   overwhelming consensus (for instance, multiple drivers of biodiversity
   loss interact synergistically) and important demographic and geographic
   differences in specialists' perspectives and estimates. Experts from
   groups that are underrepresented in biodiversity science, including
   women and those from the Global South, recommended different priorities
   for conservation solutions, with less emphasis on acquiring new
   protected areas, and provided higher estimates of biodiversity loss and
   its impacts. This may in part be because they disproportionately study
   the most highly threatened taxa and habitats. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Title = {The significance of phosphorus in algae growth and the subsequent

Abstract = {Human activities have substantially disrupted phosphorus (P) cycles in
   the ecosystem, affecting producers and consumers along the food chain.
   To assess the ecological effects of imbalanced P on producers as well as
   consumer reactions to changes in food quality, the effects of P
   concentrations (HP, MP, LP) on Scenedesmus obliquus, were investigated.
   To investigate the indirect effects of P levels on consumer feeding
   behavior and life history strategies, the algae were fed to Rotaria
   rotatoria. The results showed that P concentrations increased population
   density, environment capacity, cell size, specific growth rate,
   chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b substantially. As a result of the P
   intracellular concentration of algae produced in HP and MP media, the
   algae were classified as two categories of food quality (P-rich,
   P-poor). Rotifers' grazing and filtration rates were significantly
   increased when they were fed P-poor algae. In reaction to a lack of P in
   their diet, rotifers extended their juvenile and reproductive periods,
   resulting in a longer life span, generation time, and life expectancy at
   rotifer hatching. Despite living longer than P-rich groups, rotifers fed
   P-poor algae produced much fewer offspring and had a significantly lower
   net reproductive rate, which was linked to the rotifers' longer
   generation period. According to the findings, phosphorus has a major
   impact on algal food quality, and herbivorous consumers are subjected to
   significant food quality variation of algae, which they respond to by
   modifying their life history strategies and feeding behavior.},

Title = {Zooplankton community and its environmental driving factors in Ulungur
   Lake, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {387-403},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {This study investigated the zooplankton community structure in Ulungur
   Lake, located in the arid region of Northwest China, which has been
   slightly polluted by exogeneous sources. A total of 44 zooplankton
   species were identified in Ulungur Lake, which were sorted into seven
   functional groups: protozoan filter feeders (PF), rotifer filter feeders
   (RF), rotifer carnivores (RC), small copepod and cladoceran filter
   feeders (SCF), mid-sized copepod and cladoceran filter feeders (MCF),
   mid-sized copepod and cladoceran carnivores (MCC), and large copepod and
   cladoceran filter feeders (LCF). The dominant zooplankton functional
   group varied according to seasonal change. The RF group was dominant in
   the spring, comprising 87.77\% of the total biomass. In the summer, the
   dominant group was SCF, comprising 90.72\% of the total biomass, while
   the RF group accounted for only 7.24\%. In the autumn, the biomass was
   mainly distributed between the RC (36.38\%), SCF (30.62\%), and RF
   (30.06\%) groups. This seasonal difference in zooplankton community
   structure is related to fish production in Ulungur Lake, as well as to
   the competition and predation relationship among zooplankton species.
   This study showed a significant positive correlation between the PF and
   LCF groups, and between the RC, MCC, and MCF groups. This positive
   correlation was found to be related to the competition and predatory
   relationships between these functional groups. The predation pressure
   within the zooplankton functional groups in Ulungur Lake was not as
   significant as the pressure of food competition. The zooplankton biomass
   showed no significant difference between spring (0.0615 mg/L) and summer
   (0.0621 mg/L), but the biomass in autumn (0.3051 mg/L) was significantly
   increased. Nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) and Secchi Depth (SD) had
   significant correlations between species and functional groups, and were
   the major driving factors affecting the community structure of Ulungur
   Lake. In this study, the seasonal variations in the biomass of
   zooplankton were strongly influenced by environmental factors, which
   played an important driving role in structuring the ecological
   communities of zooplankton.},

   the population dynamics of rotifers. In the present study, the effects
   of temperature and food concentration on the developmental durations,

   Keratella valga were studied at four temperatures (15 degrees C, 20
   degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and four food levels (0.5 x
   10(6), 1.0 x 10(6), 2.0 x 10(6) and 3.0 x 10(6) cells/mL Scenedesmus
   obliquus). The results showed significant effects of both temperature
   and food concentration, independently and interactively on the embryonic
   development (ED), juvenile period (JP), average lifespan (LS),
   generation time (T) and intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) in
   B. angularis, while the ED, life expectancy at hatching (e(0)), LS, T
   and r(m) in K. valga. In all conditions, the number of eggs per female
   and r(m) in B. angularis were higher than those in K. valga. These
   results suggested that B. angularis might be more suitable to mass
   culture in aquaculture than K. valga, and a potential prey for fish
   larvae in freshwater aquaculture.},

Title = {The impact of excessive protein consumption on human wastewater nitrogen

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {452-458},

Abstract = {Total and per capita protein consumption rates in US diets, whether from
   plant or animal sources, rank among the highest in the world. When
   protein consumption outpaces physiologic protein demands, excess amino
   acids are degraded in the human body and nitrogen (N) is excreted and
   released to the environment, mainly in the form of urea. Such excess
   reactive N can enter downstream environments, thereby impairing human
   and ecosystem health as well as contributing to economic losses. We show
   that matching protein consumption with physiologic requirements would
   reduce US hydrologic N losses to aquatic ecosystems by 12\% and overall
   (atmospheric and hydrologic) N losses to ecosystems by 4\%. Were US
   citizens to consume protein at recommended rates, projected N excretion
   rates in 2055 would be 27\% less than they are today, despite population
   growth. Optimizing US protein consumption to levels that meet human
   health standards has environmental benefits on par with improving
   wastewater treatment using existing technology, while also generating
   impactful economic benefits.},

   computational tomography, and structured light scanning along with
   three-dimensional (3D) printing to study and exhibit the remains of a
   7.9-m transient male killer whale (Orcinus orca) and a 22.4-m female
   blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). In collaboration with larger
   institutions, we applied these technologies to bone replication,
   skeletal articulation, soft-tissue anatomical studies, and digital
   modeling to create high-quality specimen replicas. These techniques
   surpass traditional modeling and restoration methods, and advance
   specimen-associated research and documentation. In addition, 3D
   technology supports education and public awareness through in-person and
   online exhibits and demonstrations. The decreasing cost and increasing
   appeal of advanced imaging can be used to enhance community engagement
   and the accessibility of science.},

Abstract = {Tissues of multicellular animals are maintained due to a tight balance
   between cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Sponges are early
   branching metazoans essential to understanding the key mechanisms of
   tissue homeostasis. This article is dedicated to the comparative
   analysis of proliferation and apoptosis in intact tissues of two
   sponges, Halisarca dujardinii (class Demospongiae) and Leucosolenia
   variabilis (class Calcarea). Labeled nucleotides EdU and
   anti-phosphorylated histone 3 antibodies reveal a considerable number of
   cycling cells in intact tissues of both species. Quantitative DNA
   staining reveals the classic cell cycle distribution curve. The main
   type of cycling cells are choanocytes - flagellated cells of the
   aquiferous system. The rate of proliferation remains constant throughout
   various areas of sponge bodies that contain choanocytes. The EdU
   tracking experiments conducted in H. dujardinii indicate that
   choanocytes may give rise to mesohyl cells through migration. The number
   of apoptotic cells in tissues of both species is insignificant, although
   being comparable to the renewing tissues of other animals. In vivo
   studies with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester and CellEvent Caspase-3/7
   indicate that apoptosis might be independent of mitochondrial outer
   membrane permeabilization. Altogether, a combination of confocal laser
   scanning microscopy and flow cytometry provides a quantitative
   description of cell proliferation and apoptosis in sponges displaying
   either rapid growth or cell turnover.},

Abstract = {Adaptive approaches are needed to effectively manage dynamic marine
   systems, and ecological forecasts can help managers anticipate when and
   where conservation issues are likely to arise in the future. The recent
   development of subseasonal global environmental forecasts provides an
   opportunity to inform management by forecasting species distributions in
   advance over operational timeframes. We demonstrate the utility of
   environmental forecasts for managing marine mammals by integrating
   species distribution models with subseasonal forecasts to predict the
   arrival of migratory humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at
   foraging grounds in the Northeast US. Environmental forecasts showed
   high model skill at lead times of up to 2 weeks and resulting humpback
   whale models performed well in predicting humpback arrival. Forecasts of
   whale distribution can shape management efforts to minimize both impacts
   on whales and economic costs. Applying subseasonal forecasts to
   anticipate future risk presents a powerful tool for the dynamic
   management of marine mammals. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

   indicators of seafloor biodiversity, anthropogenic stress, and
   ecological sustainability emphasize the need to shift habitat management

   disturbance-recovery dynamics in devising and prioritizing effective
   management interventions. Understanding disturbance-recovery dynamics
   enables assessment of possible recovery outcomes and where these may be
   achieved. Ecosystem networks, biodiversity landscapes, species-specific
   biological traits, and location-specific contexts provide managers with
   information from which likely temporal and spatial scales of recovery
   can be determined. On the basis of ecological theory and empirical
   evidence, we emphasize the potential for key species to drive the
   recovery or maintenance of biodiversity in marine soft-sediment

Abstract = {Range maps are critical for understanding and conserving biodiversity,
   but current range maps often omit important context, negating the
   dynamism and variation of populations, environmental conditions, and
   ecological attributes to functionally oversimplify biogeography theory.
   Moreover, the gross underrepresentation of spatial heterogeneity
   throughout a species distribution limits the utility of range maps in
   decision making and for community engagement, weakening applications to
   disciplines outside the natural sciences. As climate change and other
   anthropogenic factors outpace our understanding of their impacts, robust
   and informative range maps for species will be critical in anticipating
   how environmental changes affect coupled ecological, evolutionary, and
   social processes. Here, we highlight the expansion of ``flat{''} range
   maps by adding ``texture{''}, which can represent a myriad of conditions
   that are spatially explicit across a species range. Using examples of
   variations (in human pressures, presence of competitor species, and
   extent of Indigenous lands) as texture, we demonstrate how range maps
   can address broader questions and promote enhanced capacity for
   interdisciplinary research.},

Abstract = {In species with seasonal breeding, male specimens undergo substantial
   testicular regression during the nonbreeding period of the year.
   However, the molecular mechanisms that control this biological process
   are largely unknown. Here, we report a transcriptomic analysis on the
   Iberian mole, Talpa occidentalis, in which the desquamation of live,
   nonapoptotic germ cells is the major cellular event responsible for
   testis regression. By comparing testes at different reproductive states
   (active, regressing, and inactive), we demonstrate that the molecular
   pathways controlling the cell adhesion function in the seminiferous
   epithelium, such as the MAPK, ERK, and TGF-beta signaling, are altered
   during the regression process. In addition, inactive testes display a
   global upregulation of genes associated with immune response, indicating
   a selective loss of the ``immune privilege{''} that normally operates in
   sexually active testes. Interspecies comparative analyses using
   analogous data from the Mediterranean pine vole, a rodent species where
   testis regression is controlled by halting meiosis entry, revealed a
   common gene expression signature in the regressed testes of these two
   evolutionary distant species. Our study advances in the knowledge of the
   molecular mechanisms associated to gonadal seasonal breeding,
   highlighting the existence of a conserved transcriptional program of
   testis involution across mammalian clades.},

Abstract = {From 2018 to 2019, a survey of a typical lakes system in the Taihu Lake
   basin, China, was carried out. To provide reference values for the
   restoration and management of submerged vegetation in the lakes, the
   optical attenuation coefficient (K-d) and euphotic depth (Z(eu)) of the
   water body were calculated, and the distribution characteristics and
   factors that influenced the underwater optical field lands with
   different nutrition levels in the basin were analyzed. The main factor
   affecting the distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   in lakes in the Taihu Lake basin is suspended solids (SS), dominated by
   inorganic suspended matter (ISS). Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   all affect, although weakly, the optical characteristics of lake
   wetlands. In CDOM, humic-like components have a more significant impact
   on K-d. The K-d of lakes in the Taihu Lake basin is closely related to
   permanganate index (CODMn) and especially total phosphorus (TP); The
   growth of aquatic vegetation is increased in Shanghu, Dianshan-Yuandang,
   Yangcheng, and Wuli Lakes that have higher Z(eu) and Z(eu)/Depth values.},

Abstract = {Extinction-risk assessments play a major role in prioritizing
   conservation action at national and international levels. However,
   quantifying extinction risk is challenging, especially when including
   the full suite of adaptive responses to environmental change. In
   particular, evolutionary potential (EP) - the capacity to evolve
   genetically based changes that increase fitness under changing
   conditions - has proven difficult to evaluate, limiting its inclusion in
   risk assessments. Theory, experiments, simulations, and field studies
   all highlight the importance of EP in characterizing and mitigating
   extinction risk. Disregarding EP can therefore result in ineffective
   allocation of resources and inadequate recovery planning. Fortunately,
   proxies for EP can be estimated from environmental, phenotypic, and
   genetic data. Some proxies can be incorporated into quantitative
   extinction-risk assessments, whereas others better inform basic
   conservation actions that maximize resilience to future change.
   Integration of EP into conservation decision making is challenging but
   essential and remains an important issue for innovation in applied
   conservation science. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Achieving global sustainability objectives such as the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals or Aichi Targets, including remaining within planetary
   boundaries, necessitates proactively avoiding a proportion of the
   environmental impacts otherwise expected to result from economic
   development. Quantifying these ``avoided{''} impacts is important for
   monitoring progress toward meeting sustainability objectives, but doing
   so in a consistent way is fraught with difficulty. Using the mitigation
   of biodiversity impacts by development projects as an example, we
   explored the challenges of defining and measuring impact avoidance.
   Avoidance can be defined as either action-based or outcome-based, and
   classified by whether it is achieved through project cancellation,
   spatial avoidance, design-based avoidance, or temporal avoidance. We
   also examined what drives different types of project proponents to
   implement avoidance measures. To support empirical quantification of the
   contribution that avoidance makes toward conservation goals, we present
   a framework for structuring assessments of biodiversity impact
   avoidance. Our framework has widespread applicability in conservation
   science, policy, and practice, as well as relevance for broader policies
   that seek to avoid environmental and social impacts.},

Abstract = {Gentrification operates as a social driver of health that can increase
   tick-borne disease (TBD) risk for communities of color through either
   population displacement or land-use change. Research on the emergence of
   TBDs in urban environments has primarily focused on the ecological
   processes of urban landscapes that facilitate favorable habitats for
   host reservoirs and tick vectors. However, neglecting to view infectious
   disease risk from a socioecological framework will continue to result in
   policies and planning that disadvantage communities of color. Using Lyme
   disease as a case study, we integrated elements of environmental
   epidemiology, ecology, public health, and urban planning to propose
   pathways of gentrification as a socioecological process with public
   health implications. By drawing connections between urban ecology, urban
   planning, and environmental racism, we seek to bring awareness to
   disease ecologists, policy makers, and public health managers on the
   potential role of gentrification as a driver of tick-borne pathogen
   exposure. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Title = {Precise knowledge of commodity trade is needed to understand invasion

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {467-473},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Globalization has led to the unintentional movement of thousands of
   species around the world, necessitating a better understanding of how
   species are spread by international trade to prevent new invasions.
   However, to date, the evidence implicating global trade in
   intercontinental species flows has been mixed. Here, we show that
   commonly used proxies of global trade, such as general and agricultural
   imports, fail to explain the invasion flows of alien ants from donor
   regions to the continental US. Analysis of 97 individual commodity flows
   revealed instead that plant and fruit imports - a small subset of all
   agricultural commodities - were primarily associated with invasion flows
   of ants. The transport patterns of all 95 other commodities, including
   most ``agricultural{''} commodities, differed from those of alien ants.
   Our findings highlight the need to determine precisely which commodities
   serve as introduction pathways for a particular taxon in order to
   account for invasion flows and identify likely source regions of future
   invasions in a world of evolving trade relationships.},

Abstract = {The global decline of coral reefs urgently requires scalable
   colony-level data about phenotypic variation to improve coral
   conservation and management. To address this, we leveraged historical
   bleaching phenotypes, airborne imaging spectroscopy, and recurrent
   temperature stress to map coral species composition and thermal
   tolerance across four focal reefs with a cumulative area of -15 ha.
   Spectral data accurately distinguished benthic composition and coral
   species, and showed substantial capacity for mapping thermal tolerance
   in two species of healthy coral. We used thermal stress from a 2019
   marine heatwave to demonstrate high prediction accuracy during a natural
   bleaching event, and to strengthen the links between predictions,
   conserved tolerance phenotypes, and spectral signatures. Large
   differences in the proportion of tolerant corals at individual reefs
   suggest that ecosystem-scale ``winners{''} and ``losers{''} in future
   bleaching can be predicted, which may greatly increase the efficacy of
   management. This framework provides foundational evidence for the
   applicability of organismic-scale remote sensing to coral conservation.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity in urban environments continues to decline, alongside
   diminution of human connections with nature and community. An integrated
   ethic and practice of caring for one's human and ecological community
   could help address these issues. Here, we describe how wildlife
   gardening can be such a pathway. We provide an overview of related
   social dynamics and benefits to human well-being, highlighting a case
   study that reveals an array of connections and well-being aspects
   derived from wildlife gardening, and their relationship with several
   activities, including time spent in the garden. We outline how positive
   biodiversity outcomes can be attained through habitat improvement in
   gardens, and describe how integration of nature and human community
   stewardship can function across physical and political boundaries when
   municipal governments and local communities work collaboratively. We
   contend that wildlife gardening conducted in this manner can involve
   urban residents in crafting and enacting an intertwined ethic and
   practice of caring for nature and humanity.},

Abstract = {Invasive species are a primary threat to biodiversity and are
   challenging to manage once populations become established in previously
   unoccupied areas. But removing them is further complicated when
   invasions occur in continental, mixed-ownership systems. We demonstrate
   a rare conservation success: the regional-scale removal of an invasive
   predator - the barred owl (Strix varia) - to benefit the spotted owl
   (Strix occidentalis) in California. Barred owl site occupancy declined
   sixfold, from 0.19 to 0.03, following 1 year of removals, and site
   extinction (0.92) far exceeded colonization (0.02). Spotted owls
   recolonized 56\% of formerly occupied territories within 1 year,
   contrasting starkly with removals conducted after barred owls achieved
   high densities in the Pacific Northwest. Our study therefore averted the
   otherwise likely extirpation of California spotted owls (Strix
   occidentalis occidentalis) by barred owl competition. Collectively,
   leveraging technological advances in population monitoring, early
   intervention, targeting defensible biogeographic areas, and fostering
   public-private partnerships will reduce invasive species-driven
   extinction of native fauna in continental systems.},

Abstract = {Fencing is a globally ubiquitous yet largely underestimated human
   infrastructure. To date, most fencing-related research and management
   has focused on its biophysical outcomes. However, fencing is often part
   of coupled human and natural systems, and inevitably affects social and
   ecological dynamics and the links between them. Drawing from three key
   case studies in the US, China, and South Africa, we delineate five
   social pathways through which fencing shapes social-ecological dynamics
   in a landscape. We show that the social functions and physical
   appearance of fencing conjointly form a positive feedback loop that
   stimulates the proliferation of fences across entire landscapes,
   rendering fencing a more impactful feature than expected from its
   ecological impacts alone. The emerging field of fence ecology and
   management must embrace the social-ecological complexities of fenced
   landscapes to minimize unanticipated social consequences.},

Abstract = {Allelopathic plants release secondary compounds into the soil that then
   suppress the growth of nearby plants. Allelopathy has been shown for the
   invasive Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and Bohemian knotweed (F.
   x bohemica). The aggressive and dominant invaders represent a serious
   threat to the local plant communities outside their native range. Here,
   we analysed the phenols in the knotweed rhizomes using nuclear magnetic
   resonance. We also evaluated the allelopathic potential of methanol
   extracts of F. japonica and F. x bohemica rhizomes and compared these
   with the effects of the individual knotweed phenols resveratrol,
   epicatechin and emodin, and their mixture. Rhizomes of both knotweeds
   contained similar amounts of epicatechin and emodin, with 24\% higher
   resveratrol in F. x bohemica. Only the F. x bohemica methanol extract
   inhibited radish (Raphanus sativus) seed germination. After 3 days of
   treatments with 10\% (w/v) extracts of both knotweeds, radish seedlings
   showed up to 70\% shorter roots. In contrast, root growth of seedlings
   treated with the individual phenols resveratrol, epicatechin and emodin,
   and their mixture, was inhibited by up to 30\%, similar to the 1\%
   knotweed extracts. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress also
   increased in the roots of treated seedlings, with high levels of
   malondialdehyde in particular indicating lipid peroxidation. Total
   antioxidative capacity was also increased in seedlings exposed to 0.6
   mg/mL resveratrol and emodin. This study shows higher allelopathic
   potential of the knotweed methanol extracts compared to the individual
   phenols and their mixture.},

   have traditionally been considered to be products of de novo synthesis,
   we here provide evidence for the unusual case of sequestration-derived
   scent gland constituents: at least myrmicacin appears to be sequestered
   from leaf-cutter ants that constitute a part of the prey of the
   Prionostemma-species herein investigated. This is the first report on
   the scent gland chemistry of the sclerosomatid subfamily Gagrellinae as
   well as on a possible sequestration mechanism in harvestmen.},

Abstract = {Antarctic conservation science is crucial for enhancing Antarctic policy
   and understanding alterations to terrestrial Antarctic biodiversity.
   Antarctic conservation will have limited long-term impacts in the
   absence of large-scale biodiversity data, but if such data were
   available, it is likely to improve environmental protection regimes. To
   enable the prediction of Antarctic biodiversity across continental
   spatial scales through proxy variables, in the absence of baseline
   surveys, we linked Antarctic substrate-derived environmental DNA (eDNA)
   sequence data from the remote Antarctic Prince Charles Mountains to a
   selected range of concomitantly collected measurements of substrate
   properties. We achieved this through application of a statistical method
   commonly used in machine learning. Our analysis indicated that neutral
   substrate pH, low conductivity, and certain substrate minerals are
   important predictors of the presence of basidiomycetes, chlorophytes,
   ciliophorans, nematodes, and tardigrades. A bootstrapped regression
   revealed how variations in the identified substrate parameters influence
   probabilities of detecting eukaryote phyla across vast and remote areas
   of Antarctica. We believe that our work will improve future taxon
   distribution modeling and aid in developing more targeted surveys of
   biodiversity conducted under logistically challenging conditions.},

Abstract = {Marine biological communities are dynamic across many scales in both
   space and time. Such multi-scale complexity complicates efforts to fully
   characterize these communities. Critical processes unfold on the order
   of 0.1-10 kilometers and 0.1-10 days, but conventional oceanographic
   techniques generally do not observe or model at this scale. Small aerial
   drones conveniently achieve scales of observation between satellite
   resolutions and in-situ sampling, and effectively diminish the ``blind
   spot{''} between these established measurement techniques. Despite this
   promise, drone-based techniques face challenges inherent to optical
   oceanography, as well as logistical and regulatory barriers relating to
   both aerial and marine operations. Such obstacles have slowed adoption
   of drones for marine biological study, but best practices are emerging
   alongside new techniques that facilitate robust study designs and
   rigorous data collection. With such advancements, drones promise to
   complement conventional approaches in biological oceanography to more
   fully capture the spatiotemporal complexity of the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Sharing ecological research with stakeholders has broader impacts for
   conservation and sustainability outcomes. However, ecologists face major
   challenges to effective communication with stakeholders, including lack
   of reciprocal trust, unacknowledged incentives, differing goals, and
   scientific inaccessibility. These obstacles largely stem from
   professional training in ecology prioritizing effective communication
   among peers over the public. Here, we argue that coding skills honed for
   peer communication can be leveraged to overcome these challenges within
   a ``coding for broader impact{''} framework that provides tasks to
   promote effective communication and culminates in individualized
   stakeholder reports. The reports explicitly incorporate stakeholder
   knowledge and are coded in conjunction with tasks for peer
   communication. We illustrate the framework through three case studies in
   which we shared data and information about backyard biodiversity,
   agricultural impacts, and tick-borne disease with homeowners, farmers,
   and land managers. A coding for broader impact framework allows a common
   analytical tool to become a public communication skill valuable to
   diverse stakeholder audiences.},

Abstract = {Society increasingly demands accurate predictions of complex ecosystem
   processes under novel conditions to address environmental challenges.
   However, obtaining the process-level knowledge required to do so does
   not necessarily align with the burgeoning use in ecology of correlative
   model selection criteria, such as Akaike information criterion. These
   criteria select models based on their ability to reproduce outcomes, not
   on their ability to accurately represent causal effects. Causal
   understanding does not require matching outcomes, but rather involves
   identifying model forms and parameter values that accurately describe
   processes. We contend that researchers can arrive at incorrect
   conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships by relying on
   information criteria. We illustrate via a specific example that
   inference extending beyond prediction into causality can be seriously
   misled by information-theoretic evidence. Finally, we identify a
   solution space to bridge the gap between the correlative inference
   provided by model selection criteria and a process-based understanding
   of ecological systems.},

Title = {Host-plant volatiles enhance the attraction of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},

Volume = {32},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a notorious
   pest of rice, Oryza sativa L. (Poaceae). Sex pheromones and host-plant
   volatiles can trap C. medinalis separately. To improve the trap
   efficiency of synthetic sex pheromone blend, we first tested the
   synergistic effect of 8 host-plant volatiles, including 2-phenylethanol,
   1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, octanal,
   valeraldehyde, and methyl salicylate, on the attraction of C. medinalis
   to the female-produced sex pheromones in electroantennography. The
   addition of (E)-2-hexenal, methyl salicylate, valeraldehyde, and
   (Z)-3-hexenal increased electroantennogram response of C. medinalis to
   sex pheromones. Further behavioral testing in wind tunnel experiments
   indicated that additive (E)-2-hexenal or methyl salicylate stimulated
   the landing behaviors of both male and female C. medinalis compared with
   sex pheromones alone. Field evaluations showed that mixtures of sex
   pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal /methyl salicylate resulted in
   significantly higher catches to male moths than sex pheromones alone.
   Using 1:1 and 1:10 combinations of the sex pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal,
   the attraction of C. medinalis to mixtures showed a synergistic effect
   of 95\% and 110\%, respectively. Furthermore, 1:1 and 1:10 mixtures of
   the sex pheromones and methyl salicylate exhibited a synergistic effect
   of 69\% and 146\%, respectively. These results may provide the basis for
   developing efficient pest management strategies against C. medinalis
   using host-plant volatiles and insect sex pheromones.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {One of the most difficult aspects of studying intact amphibian
   communities is that they tend to occupy isolated areas within
   inaccessible terrain-factors that both protect watersheds from
   development and disturbance while also making them difficult to study.
   We conducted an extensive survey of the freshwater herpetofauna of the
   remote King Range National Conservation Area in Northern California
   using a combination of visual encounter surveys and environmental DNA
   (eDNA) sampling. We found twelve species of native aquatic amphibians
   and the western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), and no introduced
   amphibians. Detection probabilities for the four most commonly
   encountered species, giant salamanders (Dicamptodon sp), foothill
   yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), and
   black salamanders (Aneides flavipunctatus), were affected by substrate
   and canopy cover, but the effects of these habitat characteristics on
   detection probability were species specific. Neither survey method,
   visual encounter surveys nor eDNA sampling, was more effective than the
   other, and our study suggests that the use of visual encounter surveys
   in conjunction with eDNA sampling may counteract the shortcomings of
   either when done individually. Five species were found using both
   methods, seven were only encountered during visual encounter surveys,
   and one recorded only from eDNA sampling. DNA samples from two taxa,
   toads and giant salamanders, could not be resolved to species. Toad
   species identity was assigned to the only member of the candidate
   species with a species range known to overlap the study area; the other
   three candidate species occupy restricted ranges far from the study
   area. Neither of the two giant salamander candidate species have known
   species ranges overlapping the study area. One, the California giant
   salamander (D. ensata), is known to occur within 100 km. However, there
   is a paucity of genetic material in GenBank DNA library for both the
   California giant salamander and the coastal giant salamander (D.
   tenebrosus), a widely distributed species with a range overlapping the
   study area, which could lead to inaccurate assignment of eDNA fragments.},

Title = {Comparison of three functional classification approaches to characterize
   phytoplankton response to environmental heterogeneity: a case study in
   NE China wetlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-116},
Abstract = {Functional classification is widely recognized as an important approach
   for characterizing phytoplankton community response to environmental
   change in freshwater ecosystems. However, there are few studies of that
   type examining the northeast (NE) China wetlands. The study aimed to
   evaluate the capacities of phytoplankton functional groups (FGs),
   morpho-functional groups (MFGs), and morphology-based functional groups
   (MBFGs), to characterize phytoplankton response to environmental
   heterogeneity in two wetlands with different nutrient levels. Water
   quality variables and phytoplankton were examined in the Longfeng and
   Hulanhe wetlands located on the Songnen Plain, NE China, in 2013.
   Multivariate analyses (RDA) were performed to compare three functional
   classification approaches to environmental heterogeneity. Our results
   revealed that all three functional classification approaches (FGs, MFGs,
   and MBFG) could characterize the phytoplankton community response to
   environmental heterogeneity. MBFG had the highest cumulative percentage
   variance of species composition. We suggest using MBFG as a routine tool
   to characterize environmental heterogeneity in wetlands NE China.
   Furthermore, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), electrical
   conductivity (EC), and pH were key predictors for regulating the
   ecological distribution of the phytoplankton community pattern in the
   study area. This study further highlights that MBFG is a relevant tool
   in assessing ecological health in wetland ecosystems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Pages = {189-202},

Abstract = {To address the issues of submerged vegetation restoration in the
   deep-water area of Baiyangdian Lake, a type of suspended ecological bed
   was developed, which was constructed with aquatic plants, ropes and
   supporting poles. The depth of a suspended ecological bed could be
   adjusted based on the water level. From July to November 2019, the
   phytoplankton community structure in the water around the suspended beds
   was continually monitored, and the effects of the submerged plants
   present in the suspended beds on the phytoplankton community structure
   in the deep-water area of the lake were studied. The results showed that
   Myriophyllum spicatum L. grew well in the suspended beds, with 95\%
   survival after 60 d. The maximum biomass was reached in 55 d, and the
   water surface coverage reached 23\%. There were 71 species of
   phytoplankton belonging to seven phyla in the water surrounding the
   suspended ecological beds. Over half (36 species) were members of
   Prochlorophyta, and the average density and biomass of phytoplankton
   gradually decreased month by month. The proportion of cyanobacteria in
   the community showed a downwards trend, while the proportions of other
   phytoplankton phyla showed upwards trends. The annual average
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index was 0.88, the annual average Pielou
   evenness index was 0.32, and the annual average Margalef richness index
   was 1.21. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index
   both showed increasing trends. This comprehensive analysis shows that
   planting submerged plants in suspended beds can improve the
   phytoplankton community structure of the surrounding water and increase
   the biodiversity of phytoplankton, making this an effective measure for
   restoring submerged vegetation in algae-dominated northern lakes.},

Abstract = {Spring floods trigger spawning in many native fishes of the desert
   Southwest (USA), but less is known about fish community response when
   native fishes are rare. Here, we document change to native and nonnative
   fish captures and instream habitat features following a decade-high
   flooding event (2019) in the Verde River (AZ) where native fish captures
   were rare in the years pre-flood. Using prepositioned areal
   electrofishing devices (PAEDs), we sampled the fish community at 90
   sampling units pre-flood (2017) and resampled those same units
   post-flood (2019) to compare and identify changes to catch and habitat
   features. Relative abundance of native fishes increased from 0.6\%
   pre-flood (0.01 fish/PAED) to 53.0\% post-flood (1.66 fish/PAED) and was
   largely attributable to the presence of juvenile Roundtail Chub Gila
   robusta (<= 70 mm total length (TL)) and juvenile Sonora Sucker
   Catostomus insignis (<= 100 mm TL). Juvenile Desert Sucker Catostomus
   clarkii experienced a lesser increase. One adult native fish was
   captured in 2017 and adult native fishes were absent from 2019 sampling.
   The catch of adult/subadult Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (> 100 mm TL)
   declined; however, this could be related to reservoir management and not
   the flood. The abundance of all size-classes of Black Bass Micropterus
   spp., Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis and other nonnative fishes did not
   change. The majority (97\%) of juvenile native fishes were captured at
   the uppermost sampling reach. A 54\% reduction to canopy cover across
   all sampling reaches and an increase of fine sediments at the most
   downstream reach demonstrates how floods can restructure the river
   environment. This case-study adds evidence that protection of spring
   floods is vital to the persistence and recolonization of fishes native
   to the desert Southwest, especially where they are rare. The continued
   presence of nonnative species may preclude juvenile native fishes from
   recruiting to adults.},

Title = {Assessment of organic substrates as sites for zebra mussel (Dreissena

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {71-83},
Abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species
   generalist with known ecological and economic impacts due to their
   settlement and attachment characteristics as well as their filtration
   abilities. Although zebra mussel attachment to abiotic substrates has
   been extensively studied, the importance of organic substrates for
   established zebra mussel populations in North American waters has not
   been evaluated. We assessed organic substrates in four west-central
   Minnesota lakes. Using qualitative analysis, we found most substrates
   were used proportionally to their availability. A quantitative
   assessment revealed significantly more zebra mussels attached to
   detritus than pondweeds (P < 0.05). Algae (filamentous and Chara spp.)
   were a significant suitable substrate for zebra mussel attachment (P <
   0.05). Furthermore, more juvenile zebra mussels were found on organic
   substrates than were adults (P < 0.001). Although not always a
   consistent substrate, biological material as a vector for zebra mussel
   spread and settlement should be considered in further research to
   mitigate subsequent invasions and manage already naturalized
   populations.},

Abstract = {While there is substantial support for the river continuum concept (RCC)
   using aquatic macroinvertebrates, nearly all of this support has come
   from studies using benthic specimen counts or relative biomass as the
   basis for comparing sites. We instead assessed the RCC using the
   ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of winged adult Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and
   Trichoptera (EPT) specimens. Insects were sampled at 13 sites along a
   100 km 2nd-4th order reach of the Pine River in northern Lower Michigan
   using ultraviolet lights. Specimens were identified to the genus level
   and the AFDM of each functional feeding group (FFG) was calculated.
   Forty-two environmental and river morphological variables were tested
   for their ability to predict differences in EPT FFG biomass. A
   determined environmental gradient relating to increasing river size
   predicted over 80\% of FFG biomass differences. Biomass of each
   individual FFG increased along the determined gradient, except for
   scrapers which decreased at the most downstream sites. The number of EPT
   genera also increased along the gradient. Our results were similar to
   those of previous studies, except that shredders nearly doubled in
   importance compared to RCC predictions, suggesting a greater ecological
   impact of shredders on forested streams than is typically reported.},

Title = {Testing the effect of the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum

Abstract = {To investigate the effect of submerged macrophytes on heterotrophic
   bacterioplankton communities in response to nutrient enrichment, we
   simulated mesocosms to test two factors, namely, the presence of
   Ceratophyllum demersum (L.) and the level of nutrients (slight and
   medium nutrient enrichment) under four possible system combinations for
   a duration of more than 3 months. The results show that C. demersum can
   affect the temporal dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton density
   (HBD) and cause it to decrease. However, the effect of C. demersum on
   HBD was more pronounced under medium nutrient enrichment. The mean
   values of HBD in the treatment and control systems under slight nutrient
   enrichment were 1.30 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) and 1.34 x 10(5) cells mL(-1),
   respectively; whereas for medium nutrient enrichment, they were 1.78 x
   10(5) cells mL(-1) and 2.65 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), respectively. The
   total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were
   maintained throughout the experiment, and no significant differences
   were observed in the pH value, chlorophyll a (Chl. a) concentrations or
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels between the systems with and
   without macrophytes, regardless of the nutrient level. Furthermore,
   linear mixed models revealed that environmental variables had a limited
   impact on HBD and that C. demersum had no significant direct effect on
   the environmental variables in the systems. A likely explanation is
   higher predation on bacterioplankton in the mesocosms, although
   allelopathic effects exerted by C. demersum cannot be excluded.},

Abstract = {Microplastics are contaminants of emerging concern. In particular,
   research on the ecological effects of microplastics on microorganisms
   has attracted widespread attention. In this study, the role of
   characteristics of microplastics and environmental factors on

   investigated. Microscopic identification of microplastics revealed that
   the most common characteristics of microplastics were fiber, black color
   and particle size <0.5 mm. The results of Pearson correlation analysis
   verified that the characteristics of microplastics with particle size
   <0.5 mm and the main physicochemical characteristics of the sediments
   (pH, salinity) were positively correlated with the abundance of dominant
   microorganisms (P < 0.05). In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes (KEGG) functional pathway analysis that the proportion of
   functional metabolic pathways related to DNA replication, recombination
   and reparation was higher in the sampling sites with higher
   microplastics abundance. This study will provide valuable information

Abstract = {Wildfires in 2019-2020 broke global records for extent and severity,
   affirming the arrival of the megafire era. Frequent megafires reflect
   changes to fire regimes that can negatively impact species and
   ecosystems. Here, we offer what we believe to be the first comprehensive
   analysis of megafire impacts on southeastern Australian vegetation
   communities, combining remote-sensing data, fire-history records, and
   plant trait-derived fire interval thresholds. In our study area, fires
   burned over 5.5 million ha. We found that one-third of all native
   vegetation in this region has burned too frequently following the
   megafires, particularly impacting fire-sensitive vegetation (for
   example, rainforests). This represents a single-year increase of 36\% in
   the vegetation at risk of interval squeeze (vegetation transitions
   driven by altered fire regimes) compared to the previous 59 years
   combined. We demonstrate that megafires can overrun recently burned
   vegetation and infiltrate refugia, reducing fire intervals beyond the
   persistence thresholds of plant species and increasing the risk of
   ecosystem collapse. Averting this will require innovative approaches to
   fire management. However, if climate change is not addressed, ecosystem
   collapse may be unavoidable especially for ecosystems adapted to
   infrequent, high-severity fire.},

Abstract = {Available space and other resources associated with urban greening
   initiatives are limited, yet demand for urban cooling to mitigate high
   urban temperatures is growing. Consequently, identifying the best
   locations for urban greening to maximize the cooling effects of the
   urban tree canopy (UTC) is taking on new urgency. We present a
   cross-city comparison and show how cooling efficiency (CE) varies
   spatially within a city. CE tends to be higher in locations with less
   UTC due in part to evapotranspiration from non-uniformly distributed
   trees, but results from a subtropical city included within our
   comparison underscore the strong effect of a city's background climate
   on CE. Mapping the spatial variation of CE can guide tree planting to
   enhance the cooling effects of UTC, expand the role trees play in urban
   adaptation to local warming, and help achieve urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {Water regime plays a determinant role in plant community development and
   patterns of plant zonation in wetlands. The waters located in the middle
   reach of the Yangtze River (China) have experienced a large decrease in
   wetland area from human activities for a long time, especially after the
   hydrological drought events in recent years. This outdoor study was
   conducted to clarify the morphological responses and reproductive
   strategy of Vallisneria spinulosa to water depth gradients (0.6 m, 1.0
   m, 1.5 m) and to drawdown (down to 0.3 m). In static water, water depth
   of 1.0 m was the best condition for V. spinulosa to grow, manifested as
   high biomass of vegetative parts, tubers and sexual structures. However,
   V. spinulosa growing in water depth of 1.5 m was able to adapt to the
   decline in water depth in autumn, expressed as increased ramet number,
   stolon weight and belowground biomass. The low water depth of 0.6 m
   produced small plants with slight vegetative biomass and drawdown
   produced more tuber biomass. The drawdown caused a decline in vegetative
   ratio of V. spinulosa. Moreover, it caused an increase in clonal ratio
   at water levels of 1.5 m and 0.6 m, and a decline in sexual ratio at
   water levels of 1.5 m and 1.0 m. The results show that under the
   condition of relatively large fluctuations in water level, V. spinulosa
   will reduce the allocation of sexual biomass and increase the allocation
   of clonal biomass in order to cope with environmental changes so that it
   can proliferate better. Thus, water level changes have a great influence
   on the growth and reproduction of V. spinulosa.},

Title = {Development of a benthic macroinvertebrate predictive model based on the

Abstract = {Predictive models for the benthic macroinvertebrate community based on
   environmental variables facilitate the identification of the organisms
   expected to inhabit an area according to the target environmental
   conditions when restoring rivers. In this investigation, a biotic
   community predictive model was developed using benthic macroinvertebrate
   and environmental variable data collected from 1,210 sites in the
   Republic of Korea from 2010 to 2020. The sites were classified into six
   groups according to Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and
   based on their individual abundance/m(2) of benthic macroinvertebrates.
   The TWINSPAN groups were related to 14 variables by stepwise
   multi-discriminant analysis. The relative importance of the
   environmental variables that classified each TWINSPAN group was in the
   order of mean diameter of particle size, catchment area, altitude,
   velocity, total phosphorus, latitude, pH, longitude, conductivity, water
   depth, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, stream order, and
   total nitrogen. Discriminant functions 1-4 showed statistically
   significant and a predictive model was developed using functions 1 and 2
   based on Wilks' lambda values. The fit of the derived model was
   confirmed using Sorensen similarity (number of taxa) and Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity (individual abundance/m(2)) analyses between the predicted
   organisms and those observed at the sites. The distributions of
   similarity and dissimilarity that were confirmed by stream type ranged
   from 0.60 to 0.72 and 0.46-0.56, respectively, based on the mean. Based
   on the predicted and observed values, the ratio of shredders and
   scrapers to collectors showed similar results overall for each stream
   type. The predictive model derived using nationally managed available
   data is expected to be applicable to stream and river restorations in
   the future, as it provides a statistical assessment of the biotic
   communities that are expected to inhabit a given environment.},

Abstract = {The problem of seasonal drought has intensified in recent years.
   Unfortunately, dry seasons can lead to poor water quality due to
   nitrogen (N) accumulation, which, in turn, may result in the gradual
   decline or even disappearance of submerged plants. This outdoor study
   was conducted to determine the morphological, biomass responses and C/N
   metabolism of Vallisneria spinulosa to the high N content and low water
   level. We used two N contents (i.e., low and high) and three simulated
   water levels (i.e., gradual water level increase from 60 cm to 150 cm
   over four periods (C), low water level of 60 cm maintained for three
   periods followed by an abrupt increase to 150 cm in the fourth period
   (CE) and low water levels of 60 +/- 30 cm maintained for three periods
   followed by an abrupt increase to 150 cm in the fourth period (E)). For
   the low N content, low water levels for CE and E treatments caused
   increased ramet number and biomass of V. spinulosa. However, for the
   high N content, the low water levels did not cause such big changes in
   V. spinulosa. High N contents demonstrated a remarkably negative
   influence on the biomass of each organ (included leaf, stolon, root and
   tuber) of V. spinulosa and flowering ramet number. For C water level,
   the high N content caused an increase in free-amino acid (FAA) content
   in stolons and leaves, and no difference in soluble carbohydrate (SC)
   content. For E water level, there was no significant increase in FAA
   content of V. spinulosa under high N treatment; furthermore, there was
   no significant change in SC content under high N treatment except for
   leaves. In conclusion, low water levels exacerbated the damage to V.
   spinulosa caused by high nitrogen level.},

Abstract = {Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) has become an efficient and
   cost-effective form of renewable energy, with an expanding footprint
   into rangelands that provide important habitat for many wild ungulate
   populations. Using global positioning system data collected before and
   after construction, we documented the potential impacts of USSE on
   pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), including direct habitat loss,
   indirect habitat loss, and barrier effects to both resident and
   migratory population segments. Our case study highlights the challenges
   that USSE poses to ungulate conservation, including (1) impermeable
   security fencing that blocks access to and reduces connectivity between
   formerly available habitats, and (2) the lack of guidelines for
   minimizing USSE impacts on ungulates. Improved siting and
   ungulate-specific best management practices would help to minimize
   habitat loss and retain landscape connectivity. Ungulate biodiversity
   and ecosystem services (for example, services provided by long-distance
   migratory species) in arid rangelands are important considerations when
   balancing the global benefits of renewable energy with local wildlife
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic
   continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be
   associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of
   some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed)
   footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most
   paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some
   workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph
   ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is
   usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead
   attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a
   pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of
   the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal
   dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously
   available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those
   of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges
   from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of
   both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of
   prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal
   sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these
   features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit
   I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some
   pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all)
   morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been
   made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to
   determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.},

Abstract = {Understanding habitat use and nursery areas of larval fish is a key
   component to managing and conserving riverine fishes. Yet, freshwater
   researchers often focus only on adult fishes, resulting in a limited
   understanding of the habitat requirements for the early life stages of
   freshwater fishes. The goal of this study was to quantify the larval
   fish microhabitat use of three fish families in Twelvemile Creek, a
   fifth-order tributary of Lake Hartwell (Savannah River basin) in the
   Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. We used handheld dipnets to
   sample larval fishes along 20 equidistant transects spaced 10 m apart
   weekly from May to July 2021 along a 200 m stream reach. We also
   collected microhabitat data at each larval fish capture location. Most
   captured individuals were in the metalarval stage and were identified to
   the family level. A partial distance-based redundancy analysis indicated
   that water velocity contributed to changes in larval fish assemblage
   structure. Larval fishes occupied a subset of the available habitat that
   was characterized by low water velocity, non-Podostemum substrate, and
   shallow habitats close to the shore or bed rock structure. We also
   detected temporal patterns in larval fish counts, with peak Percidae and
   Leuciscidae counts in late July and the highest Catostomidae counts in
   late May-early June. Our results suggest that larval fishes select
   habitats with low water velocity and shallow habitats close to shore
   microhabitat characteristics, and that riffle-pool sequences may serve
   as a nursery habitat for Percidae, Catostomidae and Leuciscidae
   metalarvae.},

Abstract = {Although the outcome of parasitic infections can be explained by a
   combination of environmental and host/parasite genetic factors, these
   factors are often confounded by geography. Thus, linking temperature, a
   locally variable environmental factor, with host and parasite genetics
   can reveal complex spatial host-parasite interactions. We used Daphnia
   magna genotypes from Central Europe, where the Hamiltosporidium
   tvaerminnensis parasite has not yet been reported, and from two regions
   where it is frequently found, Northern Europe and Mediterranean basin.
   In Central Europe habitats are usually permanent and hosts are typically
   in their planktonic phase during summer - the hottest time of the year.
   In Northern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, on the other hand, hosts
   inhabit ponds that frequently dry-up in summer. We predicted that high
   temperatures during host and parasite active phases would prevent
   long-term parasite persistence. By exposing all hosts to two parasite
   isolates at ambient and stressfully high temperatures we tested this
   prediction. At ambient temperatures, we confirmed that long-term
   parasite persistence is only possible in Northern and Mediterranean host
   genotypes, while we observed reduced persistence at high temperature,
   but only for the Mediterranean hosts. Virulence was higher in Northern
   host genotypes only at ambient temperature. These results were
   consistent among the two parasites isolates. Our findings, thus, do not
   corroborate our hypotheses and suggest that predictions about responses
   to future climate change are highly complex in this host-parasite
   system.},

Abstract = {The chorioallantoic membrane of oviparous reptiles forms a vascular
   interface with the eggshell. The eggshell contains calcium, primarily as
   calcium carbonate. Extraction and mobilization of this calcium by the
   chorioallantoic membrane contributes importantly to embryonic nutrition.
   Development of the chorioallantoic membrane is primarily known from
   studies of squamates and birds. Although there are pronounced
   differences in eggshell structure, squamate and bird embryos each
   mobilize calcium from eggshells. Specialized cells in the chicken
   chorionic epithelium transport calcium from the eggshell aided by a
   second population of cells that secrete protons generated by the enzyme
   carbonic anhydrase. Calcium transporting cells also are present in the
   chorioallantoic membrane of corn snakes, although these cells function
   differently than those of chickens. We used histology and
   immunohistology to characterize the morphology and functional attributes
   of the chorioallantoic membrane of corn snakes. We identified two
   populations of cells in the outer layer of the chorionic epithelium.
   Calbindin-D-28K, a cellular marker for calcium transport expressed in
   squamate chorioallantoic membranes, is localized in large, flattened
   cells that predominate in the chorionic epithelium. Smaller cells,
   interspersed among the large cells, express carbonic anhydrase 2, an
   enzyme not previously localized in the chorionic epithelium of an
   oviparous squamate. These findings indicate that differentiation of
   chorionic epithelial cells contributes to extraction and transport of
   calcium from the eggshell. The presence of specializations of
   chorioallantoic membranes for calcium uptake from eggshells in chickens
   and corn snakes suggests that eggshell calcium was a source of embryonic
   nutrition early in the evolution of Sauropsida.},

Abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of adaptations in coevolving species
   requires identifying the genes that underlie reciprocally selected
   phenotypes, such as those involved in venom in snakes and resistance to
   the venom in their prey. In this regard, California ground squirrels
   (CGS; Otospermophilus beecheyi) are eaten by northern Pacific
   rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus oreganus), but individual squirrels may
   still show substantial resistance to venom and survive bites. A recent
   study using proteomics identified venom interactive proteins (VIPs) in
   the blood serum of CGS. These VIPs represent possible resistance
   proteins, but the sequences of genes encoding them are unknown despite
   the value of such data to molecular studies of coevolution. To address
   this issue, we analyzed a de novo assembled transcriptome from CGS liver
   tissue-where many plasma proteins are synthesized-and other tissues from
   this species. We then examined VIP sequences in terms of three
   characteristics that identify them as possible resistance proteins:
   evidence for positive selection, high liver expression, and
   nonsynonymous variation across CGS populations. Based on these
   characteristics, we identified five VIPs (i.e., alpha-2-macroglobulin,
   alpha-1-antitrypsin-like protein GS55-LT, apolipoprotein A-II,
   hibernation-associated plasma protein HP-20, and hibernation-associated
   plasma protein HP-27) as the most likely candidates for resistance
   proteins among VIPs identified to date. Four of these proteins have been
   previously implicated in conferring resistance to the venom in mammals,
   validating our approach. When combined with the detailed information
   available for rattlesnake venom proteins, these results set the stage
   for future work focused on understanding coevolutionary interactions at
   the molecular level between these species.},

Title = {Crinoid anthraquinones as kairomones allowing host selection for the
   symbiotic snapping shrimp Synalpheus stimpsonii},
Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {95-104},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Quinones are one of the major pigment groups that provide such bright
   colors to feather stars (Echinodermata, Crinoidea). These secondary
   metabolites also act as defensive molecules rendering crinoids
   unpalatable and repellent to other organisms. However, feather stars are
   usually associated with numerous symbiotic organisms, amongst which the
   ectocommensal snapping shrimp Synalpheus stimpsonii. We investigated the
   chemical stimulus allowing host selection in S. stimpsonii through the
   combination of behavioral tests, chemical extractions, and mass
   spectrometry analyses. The individuals of S. stimpsonii used in the
   experiments were sampled around the Great Reef of Toliara (Madagascar)
   where they are found in association with two crinoid species: Comanthus
   wahlbergii and Phanogenia distincta. The chemical attractiveness of the
   two crinoid hosts and a non-host species, Cenometra bella, was tested in
   an olfactometer. The three crinoids produced attractive kairomones
   allowing the snapping shrimp to recognize them. Mass spectrometry
   analyses on purified extracts of P. distincta revealed the presence of
   three different anthraquinones (rhodoptilometrin, comantherin, and a new
   crinoid anthraquinone). Compared to the existing literature, this
   anthraquinonic cocktail is specific to P. distincta. When these extracts
   were injected in the olfactometer, they triggered similar attracting
   behavior suggesting that crinoid anthraquinones are kairomones allowing
   host selection for S. stimpsonii. This hypothesis is also supported by
   the fact that shrimps were chemically attracted by pure commercial
   anthraquinones. In addition to their traditional defensive role
   (allomones), anthraquinones would, therefore, also function as
   kairomones, maintaining the symbiosis between S. stimpsonii and its
   crinoid hosts.},

Abstract = {Systematic bias is one of the major phylogenetic issues arising over the
   last two decades. Using methods designed to reduce compositional and
   rate heterogeneity, hence systematic bias, Cai and co-workers (2022) (=
   CEA22) reanalyzed the DNA sequence dataset for Coleoptera of Zhang et
   al. (2018) (= ZEA). CEA22 suggest that their phylogenetic results and
   major evolutionary hypotheses about the Coleoptera should be favoured
   over other recently published studies. Here, we discuss the methodology
   of CEA22 with particular attention to how their perfunctory reanalysis
   of ZEA obfuscates rather than illuminates beetle phylogeny. Similar to
   published rebuttals of an earlier study of theirs, we specifically find
   that many of their claims are misleading, unsupported, or false.
   Critically, CEA22 fail to establish the stated premise for their
   reanalysis. They fail to demonstrate how composition or rate
   heterogeneity supposedly impacted the phylogeny estimate of ZEA, let
   alone the results of other recent studies. Moreover, despite their claim
   of comprehensive sampling of Coleoptera, their dataset is neither the
   most diverse with respect to species and higher taxa included, nor
   anywhere near the largest in terms of sequence data and sampled loci.
   Although CEA22 does contribute additional fossils for calibration, those
   seeking the best available estimate for Coleoptera phylogeny and
   evolution based on molecular data are advised to look elsewhere.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Patterns in morphological variation are a central theme of evolution.
   Uncovering links between morphological character evolution and natural
   history, specifically feeding behaviour, is important to understanding
   biological diversity. Species within the sap beetles (Nitidulidae)
   exhibit a tremendous diversity of feeding behaviours. This immense
   diversity of feeding can be seen both between major lineages and very
   closely related taxa. Feeding behaviour diversity may drive
   morphological variation in several character systems (e.g., eyes). For
   example, in a shift from feeding on rotting fruit to flower-visiting
   (anthophily), selective pressures on the visual system may vary and
   ultimately lead to differences in eye morphology. We tested for
   potential morphological shifts in relative eye size among adult beetles.
   We specifically tested for significant relationships between relative
   eye size and the following factors flower-visiting and sex. We also
   tested for the influence of phylogeny on the evolution of relative eye
   size, implementing tests of trait correlation across a topology. We
   found greater relative eye size in taxa exhibiting anthophilous
   behaviour, regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or feeding behaviour
   of sister taxa. We were unable to recover a relationship between
   relative eye size and sex. Thus, feeding behaviour is currently the
   strongest predictor of eye size in sap beetles.},

Title = {Delimiting continuity: Comparison of target enrichment and double digest

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Parapatrically distributed taxa pose a challenge for species
   delimitation due to the presence of gene flow and inherent arbitrariness
   of exactly defining the species boundaries in such systems. We tackled
   the problem of species delimitation in a parapatric species pair of
   Melitaea butterflies using two popular genomic methods-double digest
   restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) and target
   enrichment. We compared newly generated target enrichment dataset with
   1733 loci to the already available ddRAD data from a previous study on
   the same set of specimens using a suite of phylogenetic, population
   genetic, and species delimitation methods. We recovered consistent
   phylogenetic relationships across the datasets, both demonstrating the
   presence of a genetically distinct Balkan lineage and paraphyly of
   Melitaea athalia with respect to Melitaea celadussa. Population genetic
   STRUCTURE analyses supported the presence of two species when using
   ddRAD data, but three species when using target enrichment, while a
   Bayes factor delimitation analysis found both two and three species
   scenarios equally decisive in both datasets. As the results obtained
   from both methods were largely congruent, we discuss some practical
   considerations and benefits of target enrichment over RAD sequencing. We
   conclude that the choice of method of genomic data collection does not
   influence the results of phylogenetic analyses at alpha taxonomic level,
   given a sufficient number of loci. Finally, we recommend a solution for
   delineating species in parapatric scenarios by proposing that parapatric
   taxa be consistently classified as subspecies or complete species, but
   not both, to promote taxonomic stability.},

Title = {Phylogenomics of the Aphididae: Deep relationships between subfamilies

Abstract = {Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are a lineage of similar to 5200
   plant-feeding insects most abundant in temperate regions. The
   diversification of aphids is thought to be a rapid radiation, whereas
   abiotic and biotic factors heavily influence the morphologies. These
   factors have clouded the taxonomy at all taxonomic ranks, and the effect
   can be viewed in many incongruent molecular and morphological
   phylogenies. In this study, we address this problem using both genome
   and transcriptome data to estimate the phylogenomic relationships
   between 12 subfamilies with 48 ingroup taxa. We predicted a novel
   well-curated dataset of phylogenetically consistent orthologues that
   included 3162 genes to estimate a concatenated maximum likelihood and
   multi-species coalescent species trees. Our results suggest that there
   are three main clades of Aphididae subfamilies, which are congruent with
   a previous Sanger sequencing-based phylogenetic study. However, the
   relationship between the three clades of subfamilies is clouded by gene
   tree discordance, introgression and parent-child branches along the
   backbone that fall within the gene tree anomaly zone. In addition, our
   results suggest an introgression event between two agriculturally
   important species of aphids within the subfamily Aphidinae. Our research
   provides the first phylogenomic study of the Aphididae subfamilies and a
   foundation for future molecular and morphological studies into this
   adaptive radiation of insects.},

Abstract = {The Bigeye Chub (Hybopsis amblops) once inhabited streams and rivers in
   eastern and southeastern Illinois and was thought to be extirpated in
   the state by the 1970s. However, it was rediscovered in the 1990s from
   the Little Vermilion River. Today, H. amblops has become widespread and
   locally abundant in streams of the Wabash River drainage. Currently,
   little is known about the spawning and reproductive ecology of H.
   amblops. We conducted a study in the Salt Fork Vermilion River to
   determine the spawning schedule and microhabitats of H. amblops. Based
   upon near-weekly samples in May and June in 2019 and 2021, we determined
   H. amblops spawns in moderate water velocity over sandy gravel
   substrates when water temperatures are between 18-22 degrees C.
   Understanding such ecological traits is necessary for the continued
   success of H. amblops throughout its range.},

Title = {Hyporheic exchange due to in-stream geomorphic structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {221-241},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {In-stream structures, such as channel spanning logs and weirs, can
   enhance hyporheic exchange in streams. Hyporheic exchange is important
   for stream ecosystem function, and restoring this function is a goal of
   many stream restoration projects. However, studies on the connection
   between in-stream structure size, hydrogeologic setting, and hyporheic
   exchange remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we combined
   flume experiments and numerical simulations to systematically evaluate
   how in-stream structure and its hydrogeologic setting impacted the
   hyporheic vertical exchange flux, Q, the solute penetration depth, D-p,
   and the solute flux, QS, in the hyporheic zone. The results showed that
   stream water downwells into the riverbed upstream of the weir and
   upwells downstream. Exchange rates were greatest near the weir and decay
   with distance upstream and downstream. Model results indicated Q, D-p
   and QS had a positive exponential relationship with the weir height, h,
   the flow velocity, u, and the sediment intrinsic permeability, k. While
   model results indicated that u was the most important factor determining
   Q, D-p and QS, followed by h, while only h reached a certain value, the
   hyporheic exchange would increase with the height and vice versa.
   Hyporheic exchange generally was sensitive to changes in k, only the
   magnitude of k varied from 10(-8)-10(-10)m(2). This finding suggests
   that a rethinking of the currently applied restoration techniques is
   required to better consider in-stream structure size, hydrological
   conditions and natural substratum dynamics in river restoration.},

Title = {Transcriptome response of cold-pretreated Pantoea agglomerans KSC03 to

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are initially formed in the form of
   aldehydes, and then converted to alcohol and ester forms by the enzymes
   from plants. However, it remains unclear whether and how plant microbes
   work with aldehyde GLVs, especially under stressed conditions. Here,
   transcriptional response of cold-pretreated Pantoea agglomerans KSC03,
   an endophyte from Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus roots to
   E-2-hexenal was investigated and verified by real-time PCR and GC-MS
   after the time length of cold pretreatment was optimized. The results
   revealed that a 12-h cold stress was the most effective for KSC03 to
   trigger positive response to E-2-hexenal as far as the cell density was
   concerned. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed
   genes induced by E-2-hexenal were enriched in the following pathways:
   ABC transporter, phosphotransferase system, nitrotoluene degradation,
   and metabolisms of hexose and butanoate. Amongst, the upregulated
   transcription of gene3176 and gene4782 encoding N-ethylmaleimide
   reductase and diacetyl reductase in E-2-hexenal treatment was confirmed
   by real-time PCR. So did the enhanced production of 2,3-butanediol
   triggered by E-2-hexenal. Additionally, the transcription of gene3176
   and gene4782 and the production of 2,3-butanediol chronologically
   reached their peaks in the E-2-hexenal-treated cells at the stationary
   phase. The results also indicated that exogenous E-2-hexanal passed
   through the cell membrane at the lag/early logarithmic phase and could
   not be utilized directly. In summary, E-2-hexenal triggers the positive
   cell response of cold-pretreated KSC03 at the transcriptional and
   metabolic levels in a time-length dependent manner.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are facing degradation from human activities in
   the form of alterations of flow regimes, changes in land-use, and
   intensive water abstraction, in turn generating adverse effects on
   biodiversity and ecological functionality. Efficient assessment of
   river/stream ecosystem response to such anthropogenic changes is
   urgently needed. Many human activities that have an effect on water
   quality and river health are increasing along the Mohlapitsi River,
   which used to be one of the rivers with good water quality in South
   Africa. The aim of the study was to assess spatial variation in
   macroinvertebrate assemblages in relation to water quality of the
   Mohlapitsi River. A combination of canonical correspondence analysis and
   univariate analyses were used to examine the macroinvertebrate
   assemblages at six different sites of the Mohlapitsi River. The spatial
   difference in macroinvertebrate abundance was mostly related to changes
   in water quality. The number of taxa and the diversity of
   macroinvertebrates remained relatively high across the river as compared
   to other rivers in the Olifants River System. The midstream and
   downstream sites were mostly dominated by macroinvertebrates tolerant to
   disturbance/pollution. The most abundant family was the Thiaridae (about
   60\%) and mainly occurred in the midstream and downstream sites of the
   river (more disturbed sites). The study showed a higher evenness index
   in the upstream than the midstream and downstream sites which is an
   indication of good water quality at the upstream sites of the river. The
   results suggest that the river is being subjected to a moderate
   environmental pollution, which requires continuous assessment and
   monitoring to determine causes and initiate remedial measures.},

Abstract = {To study the response of the Vallisneria natans morphological and
   physiology to water level change, seedlings were placed in a submerged
   condition at depths ranging from 50 cm to 135 cm and set the rising and
   declining water levels respectively (0.2 cm/d, 0.5 cm/d, 0.8 cm/d, 1.1
   cm/d, 1.4 cm/d, 1.7 cm/d). After 50 days of simulation experiment, we
   observed the effects on plant height, the number of blades, root
   activity, biomass, chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b),
   chlorophyll (a + b) (Chl a + b), carotenoid (Car), soluble protein (SP)
   and soluble sugar (SS) of V. natans under different water level change
   rates. The results showed that (1) plant height and the number of blades
   showed an overall upward trend under the condition of high-rate water
   level change, while the low-rate change of water level showed a trend of
   first rising and then decreasing. (2) the root activity of 0.5-1.7 cm/d
   groups increased with the test time at rising water level, and the
   declining water level showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing.
   The total biomass showed an upward trend with the extension of the test
   time. (3) Chl a, Chl b, Chl (a + b), and Car showed a multi-peak
   downward trend with the extension of the test time. (4) the response of
   SP and SS to the test time showed a trend of first increase and then
   decrease with water level changes. In conclusion, our study demonstrates
   that the morphological and physiology of V. natans could adapt to water
   level changes, but it could be stressed if the water level exceeded the
   suitable range.},

Title = {Potential vulnerability of black bullheads to multiple predators in
   small impoundments: implications for biological control},

Abstract = {Overabundant species can alter a fish community and negatively influence
   recreationally important species. Introducing new or more predators into
   a system to control such nuisance fish has been met with limited success
   and may involve some risk. Understanding to what degree consumption of
   nuisance species occurs by existing predators and whether an existing
   predator community is physically capable of consuming the nuisance
   species can help to determine whether biological control may be possible
   without new introductions of predators. The objectives of this study
   were to: (1) document consumption of black bullheads Ameiurus melas by
   three predators; and (2) determine the relative vulnerability and
   potential ingestion of bullheads by these predators. We used gastric
   lavage monthly from May through September to collect stomach contents of
   channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, largemouth bass Micropterus
   salmoides, and walleye Sander vitreus in four reservoirs to calculate
   the percent occurrence of black bullheads in predator stomachs. We also
   collected various sizes of juvenile black bullheads to measure body
   width and depth, with and without the pectoral and dorsal spines
   extended, respectively. This information was coupled with measured gape
   widths from the predators to calculate relative vulnerability curves and
   probabilities of ingestion based on predator size. Black bullheads were
   rarely consumed by the three predators, and stomach contents generally
   contained a single black bullhead when consumption did occur. Relative
   vulnerability based on body depth was similar for all three predators.
   Potential ingestion was similar among all three predators but was higher
   for channel catfish compared to the other two predators when black
   bullhead depths were measured with the dorsal spines extended. This
   study provides new information about the potential for biological
   control of black bullheads by an existing predator community.},

Abstract = {16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the changes in the
   microbial community structure of Macrobrachium rosenbergii (M.
   rosenbergii) larvae and environmental water at different stages (0, 7,
   14 and 21 days). The PICRUSt was used to precalculated the predicted
   genes and their functions. The Alpha and Beta diversity analysis showed
   that the abundance and uniformity of the flora of larvae and water
   samples were significantly different at four stages. At the phylum
   level, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were
   the dominant flora of larvae, while Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and
   Actinobacteria were the dominant flora of environmental water. But at
   the genus level, Raoultella and Blastopirellula were the main changes in
   larvae, and Dyadobacter, Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas were the main
   changes in environmental water. The gene function prediction analysis
   indicated that the amino acid metabolism, immune system, immune system
   disease, nervous system, sensory system and other pathways enriched in
   the different stages of larvae and environmental water were closely
   related to the breeding of M. rosenbergii. This research might provide
   theoretical basis and guidance for the high-quality breeding of M.

Title = {Bosmina fatalis adapting to ammonia through oxidative stress and

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Ammonia is generated in large quantities during organic degradation,
   concluding that of cyanobacteria, which is toxic to aquatic animals. B.
   fatalis is a widespread cladoceran species found in freshwater. The
   present study aimed to explore the toxic responses of B. fatalis to
   ammonia. Our experiments showed that the 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC50 values
   of NH3 on B. fatalis were 20.59, 13.06, 5.77 and 3.36 mg center dot L-1,
   respectively. A 14-days NH3 exposure study at 0, 0.22, 0.57 and 1.4 mg
   center dot L-1 were carried out. NH3 at low and medium doses (0.22 and
   0.57 mg center dot L-1) displayed stimulative effects on the B. fatalis
   population and the body length of the newborns, while NH3 at high dose
   (1.4 mg center dot L-1) did not exhibit significant effect on the B.
   fatalis population and size. Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
   revealed significant increase in number of ribosomes at low doses, while
   the interior structure showed no marked change at high dose. The levels
   of indicators related to oxidative stress (ACP, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and
   MDA) caused by NH3 first increasedand, then decreased with time in all
   the NH3-exposure groups. The mRNA expression of genes related to
   ribosomal structure (RPL12, RPL10, RPL10A, RPL27A and RPL19) and
   antioxidant stress (CAT, SOD and GSH-Px) was rapidly downregulated after
   NH3 exposure. Collectively, it is inferred that ammonia at a certain
   dose (<= 0.57 mg center dot L-1) stimulates the growth and reproduction
   of B. fatalis, which may be its defensive reaction to ammonia.},

Title = {A comparison of fish communities between coves of varying connection to
   Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {543-554},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Sediment berms of various heights have developed in the mouths of
   several coves within Harlan County Reservoir due to a combination of
   sediment deposition and lateral drift of eroded sediments. These berms
   can isolate coves from the main reservoir if the berm height is greater
   than the water elevation of the reservoir. Previous research in other
   reservoirs has shown that fish communities may differ in coves based on
   their connection histories. This study examines similarities and
   differences in fish assemblages between several disconnected coves and
   connected coves in Harlan County Reservoir. Connected coves had greater
   species richness and diversity compared to disconnected coves. Fish
   communities between cove types were relatively similar based on
   presence-absence data but notably different based on species abundance.
   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed that fish
   communities were distinct between cove types. Eleven fish species were
   indicators of connected coves, and two species were indicators of
   disconnected coves. Disconnected coves had higher abundances of
   understudied native species rarely found in the main reservoir, such as
   Orangespotted Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead. Further
   research evaluating the influence of water quality, food availability,
   and duration of isolation is needed to understand the effect of cove
   disconnection on fish communities. Managers can use this information
   when planning cove renovations by weighing the costs and benefits of
   either maintaining ecologically distinct coves versus connecting coves
   and improving habitat accessibility for reservoir fishes.},

Title = {The effect of physicochemical parameters on the abundance of zooplankton
   of River Adada, Enugu, Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-56},
Abstract = {Because of the pivotal role of zooplankton in most aquatic ecosystems;
   there is constant need to explore the effect of stressors (such as
   physicochemical properties of freshwater) on their abundance. We
   documented the effect of temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen
   (DO), nitrate (NO3-), and phosphate (PO43-) on the abundance of
   zooplankton of the River Adada, Nigeria. Using a manual pump,
   zooplankton were collected from three strategic stations from January to
   April (dry season) and June to September (rainy season). A total of
   2,219 (dry = 945; rainy = 1,274) zooplankton occurred in the following
   descending order of abundance: copepods < rotifers < cladocerans <
   ostracods < insect larva. Whereas based on species number, cladocerans
   (n = 10) < copepods (n = 8) < rotifers (n = 7) < insect larva (n = 4) <
   ostracods (n = 2) occurred in this descending order. The downstream
   (station C) had more zooplankton (dry = 427; rainy = 391), followed by
   the mid-stream (station B; dry = 216; rainy = 591) and upstream (station
   A; dry = 302; rainy = 292). There was also a significant (P < 0.05)
   joint interactive effect of thermal condition on turbidity, pH, DO,
   PO43- and NO3- to influence zooplankton abundance. Indicating that
   temperature is an important factor determining the assemblage of
   zooplankton in freshwater. Nevertheless, to assure an accurate
   evaluation of the effect of physicochemical parameters on zooplankton
   abundance in freshwater, future studies should include extended study
   periods and make use of more sophisticated trapping technique that would
   ensure the collection of a larger sample size with more species of
   zooplankton.},

Title = {Environmental DNA metabarcoding of fish communities in a small

Abstract = {Environmental DNA methods have emerged as a promising tool in fish
   diversity studies and fishery management in various aquatic ecosystems.
   However, eDNA metabarcoding of fish communities in small hydropower dam
   reservoirs has received limited attention. In this study, we tested
   whether eDNA metabarcoding was an appropriate approach for the
   characterization of fish communities and fishery stock assessment by
   comparing its results with combined capture-based fishing methods and
   hydroacoustic surveys, which involved species detection and
   abundance/biomass evaluation. Our results indicated that the species
   detection performance of eDNA metabarcoding was basically similar to
   that of traditional capture-based fishing gear. However, it was also
   noteworthy that the eDNA method failed to cover all species detected by
   capture-based method, although some additional species were found.
   Besides, although we observed a significant correlation between site
   occurrence and sequence abundance for fishes, an effort to
   quantitatively establish a correlation between eDNA sequence counts and
   fish abundance/biomass was unsuccessful. Therefore, our study suggested
   that eDNA metabarcoding was an important supplementary tool to
   traditional capture-based fishing methods for the investigation and
   biomonitoring of fish diversity in small hydropower dam reservoirs.
   Further studies on the mechanisms of eDNA production, persistence,
   transportation and degradation in reservoirs might facilitate the
   interpretation of fish abundance and biomass from eDNA data.},

Abstract = {Polygraphus proximus, a four-eyed fir bark beetle, is an invasive bark
   beetle species which has caused extensive damage to forests of Abies
   sibirica in southern and western Siberia and to Abies species in the
   European part of Russia. There is a high risk that the pest insect will
   spread to areas where it is currently not considered present, such as
   the European Union. In these areas, it threatens to attack conifer
   forests of various species which may result in major environmental and
   economic impact. The aim of this study was to identify pheromone
   components of P. proximus that can be used as pheromone baits. Males and
   females of P. proximus were allowed to bore into the bark of stem
   sections of Abies sibirica at the laboratory, and volatiles were
   collected with solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Analyses of these
   extracts with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed
   several sex-specific compounds. In total, twelve male-specific compounds
   and one female-specific compound were identified. The major
   male-specific compound determined by GC peak area was
   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol {[}(Z)-DMCHE] and the minor
   male-specific compounds were 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol,
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-2-butenal, benzyl alcohol, fragranol,
   7-methyl-3-methylene-6-octen-1-ol, (Z)- and
   (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde, geraniol, geranial and
   papayanol. The only female-specific compound was identified as
   1-hexanol. Two of the male-specific compounds, (Z)-DMCHE and
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol were shown to attract males and females of P.
   proximus in field studies. Thus, we now for the first time can present
   the structures of two male-specific components that are biologically
   active parts of P. proximus aggregation pheromone. However, some
   chemical communication overlap between P. proximus and P. subopacus
   needs to be further investigated as (Z)-DMCHE also attracted males and
   females of P. subopacus.},

Abstract = {A vast diversity of parasites associates with ants. Living in and around
   ant nests of these organisms must overcome ant colony defenses. As ant
   defensive behavior is mainly mediated by species-specific cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) or alarm pheromones, and ant-associated parasites
   can either crack their hosts' chemical communication code by modifying
   their own CHC profiles or use pro-active strategies like chemical
   weaponry for distraction and repellency. While the chemical nature of
   ant-parasite interactions has been intensively studied for highly
   host-specific parasites, the chemical-deceptive strategies of the rather
   rare ant-resembling heteropterans are unknown. To gain insight into this
   system, I studied the bug Scolopostethus pacificus (Barber 1918) which
   can be found near the nests of the ecologically dominant and aggressive
   velvety tree ant (Liometopum occidentale, Emery 1895). Using behavioral,
   chemical, and molecular approaches, I disentangled the relationship of
   S. pacificus and its host ant. Chemical profiling of the bug and the ant
   revealed that the bug does not make use of CHC insignificance or
   mimicry, but instead uses a cocktail of volatile compounds released from
   its metathoracic glands that likely moderates encounters with its
   aggressive host. Feeding trials with armed and artificially disarmed
   bugs revealed a defensive function of the gland exudates. Targeted
   molecular gut barcoding showed that S. pacificus does not feed on L.
   occidentale. These results suggest that chemical weaponry, rather than a
   chemical code-cracking CHC matching or chemical insignificance, enables
   S. pacificus to get along with and live in close proximity to its host
   ant.},

Title = {Benzoxazinoids in roots and shoots of cereal rye (Secale cereale) and

Volume = {32},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cover crops provide many agroecosystem services, including weed
   suppression, which is partially exerted through release of allelopathic
   benzoxazinoid (BX) compounds. This research (1) characterizes changes in
   concentrations of BX compounds in shoots, roots, and soil at three
   growth stages (GS) of cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), and (2) their
   degradation in soil over time following termination. Concentrations of
   shoot dominant BX compounds, DIBOA-glc and DIBOA were lowest at GS 83
   (boot). The root dominant BX compound, HMBOA-glc, concentration was
   least at GS 54 (elongation). Rhizosphere soil BX concentrations were
   1000 times smaller than in root tissues. Dominant compounds in soil were
   HMBOA-glc and HMBOA. Soil BX compound concentrations were similar near
   root crowns and between-rows. Soil BX concentrations following cereal
   rye termination declined exponentially over time in three of four
   treatments: incorporated shoots (S) and roots (R), no-till S + R (cereal
   rye rolled flat), and no-till R (shoots removed); no-till S had
   consistently low concentrations. In treatments showing changes, soil
   concentrations of HMBOA-glc and HMBOA increased above initial
   concentrations on the day following cereal rye termination.
   Concentrations of these two compounds decreased more rapidly than the
   other compounds. Placement of shoots on the surface of an area where
   cereal rye had not grown (no-till S) did not increase soil
   concentrations of BX compounds. The short duration and complex dynamics
   of BX compounds in soil prior to and following termination illustrate
   the limited window for enhancing weed suppression directly by cereal rye
   allelochemicals; valuable information for programs breeding for enhanced
   weed suppression.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the physicochemical characteristics regulating
   the distribution and abundance of M. marcella larvae in six wetlands in
   the northern Colombia. Standardized techniques for collecting
   invertebrate and physicochemical data were used in 29 sampling points in
   an intraannual period. Mean pH and temperature oscillated in narrow
   ranges within wetlands (7.7 +/- 0.09-8.6 +/- 0.07; 28.1 +/- 0.29-32.8
   +/- 0.17 degrees C, respectively), whereas ammonium concentrations and
   conductivity exhibited a wide variation (0.2 +/- 0.03-2.8 +/- 0.54 mg
   NH4 L-1; 861 +/- 30.7-19254 +/- 1706 mu S cm(-1), respectively). A total
   of 2586 individual M. marcella larvae were collected. Abundance was
   greater in wetlands influenced by the Magdalena River, with 19.4 +/- 1.7
   and 9.3 +/- 1.4 individuals; followed by wetlands hydrologically
   influenced by seasonal runoff, with 8.1 +/- 0.4 and 6.4 +/- 0.4
   individuals; and lowest in wetlands with influence of the Caribbean Sea,
   with 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 individuals. Abundances of M. marcella
   larvae exhibited similar variations at different months during the
   sampling period. Abundance and distribution of M. marcella larvae in
   wetlands of northern Colombia is strongly dependent on water
   conductivity, transparency and alkalinity. This study evidence that
   Odonata larvae are a valuable tool as bioindicators for wetland
   assessment and monitoring.},

Abstract = {The endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is an
   endangered species among the conserved Chinese amphibians.
   Tourism-related pressures have increased for this species recently. The
   effect of tourism on the hatching rate of the target species was
   determined by experimentally observing the influences of different
   intensities of tourism disturbance on salamander in the Zhangjiajie
   Chinese Giant Salamander National Nature Reserve. Water quality factors
   (e.g. total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and Escherichia
   coli abundance) were analysed, and hatching rate was estimated. Results
   showed that high levels of tourism disturbance (500,000-1,200,000
   visitors per year) had active effects on the hatching time and negative
   effects on the hatching rate. The prediction performance of artificial
   neural network models was validated by the low root mean square error
   values of 2.2539 and 3.2612 for the training and testing data and high
   determination coefficient values of 0.9732 and 0.9508 for the training
   and testing data, respectively. The potential for positive or negative
   feedback mechanisms in such relationships between tourists and wildlife
   highlights the importance of considering both sides of the complex
   interaction to find a balance between the development of tourism and
   wild animal protection.},

Abstract = {We used isotopic and genomic data to explore the ecological and social

   crocodiles in ancient Egypt. Ancient DNA was recovered from four
   mummified crocodile hatchlings held in the collections of the Peabody

   crocodile mummies have indicated that most mummies represent the newly
   resurrected taxon, Crocodylus suchus Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1807.
   However, mitogenomic data for the Yale Peabody Museum mummies indicates
   that these specimens represent the first genomically authenticated
   representatives of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti,
   1768) in museum collections. We explore these findings within the
   broader context of modern and historical distributions of both crocodile
   species and the potential implications for our understanding of funerary

   tested at the concentration that inhibits 50\% of L. perenne root growth
   (IC50). Mixtures were prepared at the total concentration determined to
   inhibit 50\% of weed root growth based upon the IC50 value for each

   mixtures, followed by binary ones, and single compounds showed the
   lowest phytotoxicity. Moreover, spray treatment was more effective at
   inhibiting growth of L. perenne, compared with irrigation. For sprayed
   binary mixtures, the 2 and 3 mixture showed the best inhibitions in
   shoot (75.79\%) and root (91.02\%) growth, and fresh weight (89.28\%).

   compound, 1 (48.01\%, 58.62\% and 57.14\%, respectively, following
   spray). On the other hand, compound 3, whose structure is related to
   guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones, was a common constituent of the most
   active mixtures, suggesting that it plays a more relevant role in the
   improvement of the phytotoxicity of mixtures. Results obtained for the
   spray treatment of the tertiary mixture of 1 (333.33 mu M), 2 (51.33 mu
   M) and 3 (100 mu M) were even more prominent, since weed growth was
   completely inhibited. After irrigation with a tertiary mixture, the
   greatest inhibitions in shoot and root growth and fresh weight did not
   exceed 88.16\%, 94\% and 90.47\%, respectively. The results reported
   highlight a synergistic behavior of the test allelochemicals which could
   be applied in the development of bio-herbicides.},

Abstract = {We describe tooth implantation, replacement, and attachment in a
   specimen of the procolophonid Scoloparia glyphanodon. Though an earlier
   description of the specimen made mention of the dentary, splcnial, and
   coronoid, we identify a small sliver of the angular that is also
   present. We observe two modes of tooth implantation (protothecodonty and
   acrodonty) and no tooth replacement, though it is likely teeth were
   added posteriorly over time. Previous interpretations of tooth
   implantation in procolophonids were conflated with replacement patterns
   and mode of implantation. Additionally, the combination of dental
   characters of the specimen suggests Scoloparia glyphanodon had an
   herbivorous diet.},

Abstract = {The concept of phytoplankton functional groups was used to assess
   phytoplankton community structure in an attempt to better understand
   their spatial and seasonal variation in Lake Okeechobee, USA. Samples
   were collected for analyses during summer and winter. 23 phytoplankton
   functional groups were identified among 102 species, of which 9 groups
   (H1, M, C, MP, Y, S1, J, X1 and X2) were categorized as dominant. Y
   represented by Cryptomonas ovate and H1, represented by Anabaena
   circinalis and Anabaena variabilis, were dominant in some sites in
   summer corresponding to higher temperatures. In winter, the biomass of
   the functional groups was dominated by chlorophyta group X2
   corresponding to lower temperatures, and relatively high nutrients.
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) with Monte Carlo test revealed that water
   temperature (WT), TP, and TN were the most dominant environmental
   variables which influenced phytoplankton functional group distribution
   in Lake Okeechobee. Functional group H1 was associated with TN, pH, TP
   and WT. Similarly, functional group Y was significantly positively
   correlated with TN, TP and WT but negatively correlated with TN/TP
   ratios. This study reveals the importance of physical-chemical variables
   across a spatial and seasonal gradient, in structuring phytoplankton
   functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of environmental
   status of the lake.},

Abstract = {River water degradation arising from wastewater effluents is a major
   factor contributing to the deterioration of river ecosystems; yet direct
   evidence of the beneficial influence of long-term sewerage development
   on such ecosystems is scarce at a basin scale. The present study, over
   12 years, examined changes in sewerage connection rate, water quality,
   and invertebrate assemblages at 10 study sites in the Shigenobu River,
   southwestern Japan, and investigated the relationships between them.
   Sewerage connection rates increased in the three main municipalities in
   the basin during the study period (range: 8.6\%-31.4\%). At the lowland
   sites, the concentration of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) decreased by
   38.9\% on average and the richness metrics of invertebrate assemblages
   significantly increased at several sites. Furthermore, the richness
   metrics negatively related with TIN concentration, implying that
   invertebrate diversity recovery was the result of water quality
   improvement. Our findings strongly suggest that sewerage system
   improvement is an effective measure for restoring river ecosystems.},

Title = {The response of benthic diatom community to anthropogenic eutrophication
   of a river basin under agricultural influence in NE China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication has universally threatened river ecological
   health and has been a key issue in river conservation. Agricultural
   sewage, which leads to increased nutrient levels and results in the loss
   of ecological function and biodiversity, results from the growth of
   agricultural activity and human populations. Consequently, attention has
   increasingly been focused on developing a relevant tool to describe the
   relationship between the biotic communities and anthropogenic
   eutrophication. The benthic diatom community has been widely used as an
   effective tool for indicating the ecological status of river systems
   especially in the context of recent international Water Framework
   Directive policies (WFD). In this study, a statistical method consisting
   of trophic status index (TSI), Specific Polluosensitivity Index (IPS),
   Descy Index (DES), redundancy analysis (RDA), and the geographic
   information system (GIS) technique was conducted to explore the response
   of benthic diatom community to anthropogenic eutrophication. Initially,
   the TSI, IPS and DES were determined to differentiate the trophic
   gradient along a gradient in agricultural intensity. Subsequently, RDA
   was used to identify spatial distribution patterns of environmental
   parameters and benthic diatom communities. Finally, the RDA scores as
   calculated and spatially interpolated were applied to GIS technology to
   reveal the response of benthic diatom communities to anthropogenic
   impacts along the trophic gradient. Our results revealed that the
   studied basin mostly exceeded the eutrophic level. Two different
   patterns of diatom communities response to ecological gradient were
   identified based on RDA, one representing the agriculture eutrophication
   discharges in electrical conductivity (EC) and the other representing
   organic pollution as chemical oxygen demand (COD). The developed method
   in this study highlight that the EC was more effective than the nutrient
   indices in determining diatom distribution in a eutrophic
   agriculturally-influenced river system.},

Abstract = {River ecosystems receive a large amount of organic matter, which will
   increase the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon
   dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Despite extensive
   research on the distribution of greenhouse gases and dissolved organic
   matter (DOM), little is known about the associations between greenhouse
   gases and DOM compositions. In this study, the distributions of GHGs
   (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and DOM in the overlying water of the main rivers
   around Taihu Lake were investigated. The results showed that the
   concentration of GHGs was positively correlated with dissolved organic
   carbon concentrations. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix
   fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were employed to identify the
   source of the DOM, which was related to protein-like and humic-like
   components. The DOM was a combination of terrigenous and endogenous
   origins. The GHGs (except CO2) were significantly associated with DOM
   composition. These results emphasize the importance of the relationship
   between GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and DOM compositions in river

Title = {Extremely high abundances of Prasiola crispa-associated micrometazoans
   in East Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {To elucidate poorly known aspects of the microscopic metazoan
   distribution in ice-free parts of the Antarctic, we examined samples of
   the multicellular terres-trial alga Prasiola crispa, collected over the
   last decade in different parts of con-tinental East Antarctica and
   Haswell Island. We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae
   consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea),
   followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer
   assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species).
   Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities
   ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight
   and the maximum value num-bered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry
   sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with
   mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in
   the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of cor-relations
   between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and
   Na). Our findings are consistent with the patchy distribution of
   terrestrial micrometazoans in the Antarctic that has previously been
   found.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key insect hormone involved in the regulation
   of physiological, developmental and behavioural processes. In social
   insects, it has been shown that JH can play a key role in modulating
   reproductive division of labour, age-related division of labour and
   chemical signalling, and can display marked changes in function of the
   degree of sociality. Here, we checked the effects of JH on reproduction
   in single foundresses of two neotropical primitively eusocial wasp
   species, Mischocyttarus cerberus and Mischocyttarus cassununga, by
   examining how treatments with the JH-analogue methoprene and the anti-JH
   precocene affect egg-laying, ovarian activation and chemical profiles.
   Our hypothesis was that reproduction and the production of particular
   fertility-linked cuticular hydrocarbon cues might be under shared JH
   control already in primitively eusocial wasp species, and this could
   have been a key enabler to allow such cues to later evolve into
   full-fledged queen pheromone signals in advanced eusocial species. In
   line with this hypothesis, we show that our hormone treatments
   significantly affected both egg laying and the production of particular
   hydrocarbons present on the egg surface. We discuss the relevance of
   these findings in the context of the evolution of social insect queen
   pheromones in advanced eusocial species with a morphologically
   differentiated queen-worker caste.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},

Volume = {40},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Heterotrophic flagellates are essential components of the marine
   microbial food web. However, how the changes in flagellate populations
   reflect envi-ronmental changes in marine ecosystems is still unclear,
   especially in polar regions. In this study, we used pyrosequencing to
   examine the community structure of heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) in
   the Powell Basin's surface waters of the northern Antarctic Peninsula.
   OTUs (operational taxonomic units) of different taxa and the
   correlations between community structure and environmental factors were
   analysed. Eight taxa of HFs were selected for the principal analysis:
   Telonemia, Picozoa, Rhizaria, Amoebozoa, Apusomonas, Centrohelida,
   Choanomonada and marine stramenopiles (MASTs). The HFs were defined as
   heterotrophic picoflagellates (HPFs; 3 mu m) and heterotro-phic
   nanoflagellates (HNFs; 3 mu m, <20 mu m), which had similar dominant
   phyla (MASTs and Telonemia). However, their taxonomic composition
   dif-fered. Environmental factors exerted similar effects on the
   community struc-ture of both HPFs and HNPs. Compared with the
   correlation between HPF and environmental factors, the correlation
   between HNF and environmental fac-tors was stronger. Salinity, bacterial
   biomass and the biological interactions amongst dominant taxa were the
   main variables to influence the diversity and community structure of
   HFs.},

Title = {Why are Svalbard Arctic foxes Brucella spp. seronegative?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are susceptible to smooth Brucella
   (s-Brucella) infection and may be exposed to such bacteria through the
   consumption of infected marine mammals, as implied by the finding of
   s-Brucella antibodies in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard have not previously been investigated for s-Brucella
   antibodies, but such antibodies have been detected in Arctic foxes in
   Iceland, Alaska (USA) and Russia. We investigated blood from Svalbard
   Arctic foxes for s-Brucella antibodies using an indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (iELISA). The animals (0???13 years old) were either
   caught by fur trappers (1995???2003, n = 403) or found dead (1995 and
   2003, n = 3). No seropositive animals were detected. Morbidity and
   mortality due to the infection cannot be ruled out. However, no known,
   large disease outbreaks of unknown aetiology have been reported.
   Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Svalbard Arctic fox is resistant to
   infection as Arctic foxes from other populations are susceptible, and
   there is circumpolar connectivity between populations. The discrepancy
   between the findings in Iceland and Svalbard is surprising as both
   populations are on islands with no known local sources of exposure to
   s-Brucella other than marine mammals. However, our negative findings
   suggest that marine mammals may not be a major source of infection for
   this species. Comparative investigations are needed in order to draw
   conclusions regarding the epizootiology of s-Brucella in Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard and Iceland.},

Abstract = {With China becoming more active in Greenland, worries abound that China
   might have hidden intentions. Despite that, the Greenlandic government
   is showing an increasing interest in deepening its cooperation with
   China. This article explores Greenland's motivation behind its positive
   attitude towards China and examines whether China will be a threat to
   Greenland's independence. For Greenland, China is both a deep-pocketed
   investor and a huge consumer market, especially in the mining, fishing
   and tourism industries. Greenland, therefore, views China as an
   important partner in its economic development, which is necessary for
   its independence from Denmark. Considering China's relationship with
   Denmark, its foreign policy and its affairs vis-a-vis Tibet, Xinjiang
   and Taiwan, it is not in China's interest to interfere with any affairs
   related to Greenland's independence.},

Abstract = {Plasticity of spine morphology is a universal phenomenon in rotifers.
   Some Brachionus calyciflorus clones consistently develop two
   posterolateral spines (PS) with similar length (Type A), but others
   (Type B) not. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present
   study, the resting eggs were collected from the same B. calyciflorus
   strain, their hatchlings (stem rotifers) were categorized into types A
   and B, and then, clonally cultured for eight generations at different
   algal densities or temperatures. The results showed that the PS varied
   in length among different temperatures and food levels, but inherent
   differences between types A and B were always observed, indicating that
   differentiation between types A and B might not associate with
   temperature or food availability. Next, we compared the population
   growth and PS length between types A and B at the general condition
   (control), in responses to Asplanchna kairomone, Keratella tropica and
   Moina macrocopa. The results showed that type B had higher population
   growth rate than type A, suggesting the higher adaptability of type B in
   the general condition. In response to Asplanchna kairomone, the PS
   length of both types A and B was significantly induced, and their PS
   length was similar, but type B showed higher population growth rate than
   type A. Coculture with M. macrocopa significantly lengthened the PS of
   type B but not type A, and types A and B showed similar population
   growth curves. Coculture with K. tropica did not affect significantly
   the PS length of types A and B. However, type A showed significantly and
   greatly higher population density and population growth rate than type
   B, indicating a much stronger competition ability of type A than type B
   against K. tropica. Overall, these results indicated that consistent
   development of PS might facilitate B. calyciflorus to defend against
   small competitors.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) has important functions that regulate insect life.
   In adult individuals, it induces gonadotropic and behavioral changes.
   Manipulating JH levels helps to understand how it influences insect
   physiology. The effects of JH on Epiponini swarm-founding wasps have
   shown contrasting results, affecting reproduction, chemical compound
   expression, behavior, and age polyethism. In this study, we investigated
   whether JH affects reproductive physiology and production of fertility
   cues in a swarm-founding wasp species Polybia occidentalis in an
   age-controlled experimental setup. We treated newly emerged females with
   methoprene (JH analogue) and precocene-I (JH inhibitor) to determine
   their effects on ovary activation and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC)
   expression. Furthermore, we compared the chemical profiles of treated
   workers with those of queens. Our results show that methoprene and
   precocene-I affected the CHC production in P. occidentalis.
   Additionally, females treated with methoprene were chemically more
   similar to queens than precocene- and acetone-treated females.
   Methoprene affected ovarian status (increasing ovary activation). These
   results suggest that different levels of JH reflect changes in chemical
   and reproductive traits in P. occidentalis females. Furthermore, we
   point out the existence of fertility cues in this Epiponini wasp.},

Abstract = {Investigating the response of alien invasive plants to water level
   gradient in wetlands is important for developing strategies to prevent
   invasions by alien plants in these ecosystems. Controlled experiments
   were conducted to investigate the response of root morphology in the
   alien invasive plant Amaranthus retroflexus to water level gradient. The
   plants were planted in three water levels from low to high that resulted
   in drought, wet and flooded conditions. The results showed that biomass
   and allocation of A. retroflexus under flooded conditions were
   significantly lower than the other two treatments (p < .05). Root
   morphological parameters (root mean diameter, root length, root surface
   area and root volume) were maximum under wet condition, followed by dry
   and flooded conditions, and the differences were significant among the
   treatments (p < .05). Special root length and special root surface area
   were also significantly greater under wet condition than under dry
   condition (p < .05). The results indicate that water level gradient in
   wetlands affects root biomass and morphology of A. retroflexus, which
   has the highest growth potential under wet condition. The roots of the
   plant also exhibited plasticity to water level gradient. Therefore,
   maintaining a high water level in wetlands could restrict the growth of
   A. retroflexus and prevent its successful invasion. Moreover, a high
   water level is beneficial to the growth of wetland plants and further
   decreases the invasibility of wetland ecosystems.},

Abstract = {With the aim of exploring the features of the phytoplankton community
   and eutrophication status in the lower reaches of the Haihe River Basin
   near Tianjin, sampling surveys were carried out in May, July and
   September of 2021. The results showed 53 dominant phytoplankton species
   in the survey area, of which 36 species were found in May, while 28 were
   found both in July and September. Ten dominant species were highlighted
   in the surveys, mainly belonging to Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta,
   Bacillariophyta, and Cryptophyta. The regions with relatively higher
   levels of phytoplankton biomass and abundance were Duliujian River,
   Qilihai Wetland and New Chaobai River, while the highest species
   richness and biodiversity occurred in Yuqiao Reservoir, Duliujian River,
   New Chaobai River and Ji Canal. The highest TN content was observed in
   Duliujian River, and the highest TP, chl-a, CODMn and EI were recorded
   in New Chaobai River. In contrast, the region with the lowest level of
   eutrophication was Yuqiao Reservoir. Correlation analysis and RDA
   analysis showed that the eutrophication assessment indices affecting the
   phytoplankton community and distribution of dominant species were mainly
   TN, chl-a and CODMn in May and July, while TN, TP, chl-a, CODMn and EI
   were the most influential in September.},

Abstract = {The diet of five freshwater fish species of Lake Trichonis, the largest
   natural lake of Greece, was studied. Specifically, the studied species
   were Atherina boyeri, Luciobarbus albanicus, Leucos panosi, Scardinius
   acarnanicus and Tropidophoxinellus hellenicus. The diet analysis was
   based on stomach content analysis of seasonal samples collected during
   2019 by experimental Nordic multimesh gillnets. Additionally, trophic
   indices were estimated (Shannon-Wiener, Levins', Schoener, Trophic
   level) so as to investigate each species' feeding diversity, trophic
   niche breadth, trophic level as well as their trophic competition and
   overlap. Moreover, the annual and the seasonal relative condition factor
   was estimated. The diet analysis indicated a tendency of the studied
   species to omnivorous feeding strategy and a seasonal fluctuation in
   their diet composition. In addition, the estimated trophic indices
   revealed similar feeding behavior and significant diet overlap between
   species, suggesting narrow partitioning of the food resources. However,
   the relative condition factor ranged between 0.973 and 1.041, indicating
   a state of wellbeing for the fish species and possibly sufficient food
   availability.},

Title = {Effects of extreme water levels on nutrient dynamics in a large shallow

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Changhu Lake, a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in central China,
   experienced an extremely low water level event from November 2015 to
   January 2016 followed by an extremely high water level event in July
   2016. In this study, we examined the effects of two extreme water levels
   on the nutrient dynamics of Changhu Lake over five years. The nutrient
   parameters in Changhu Lake showed significant interannual variations,
   and the nutrient concentrations at the sites in the western part of
   Changhu Lake were 2-41\% higher than those at the outlet of the lake. In
   late 2015, the effects of low water levels led to a 17-74\% increase in
   nutrient concentrations. After July 2016, however, a high water level
   event occurred, leading to a 34-48\% decrease in nutrient
   concentrations. These changes in nutrient parameters were strongly
   related to water level fluctuations (p < 0.05). As extreme water levels
   are likely to become more frequent during the twenty-first century, this
   work may provide some insights into the conservation and management of
   lake ecosystems in the face of climate change and human activity.},

Abstract = {Channel catfish (Ictalurus puncatus) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus
   grunniens) are two commercially and recreationally important species in
   large rivers of the Midwestern United States. Understanding their
   population demographics is essential to managing sustainable
   populations. In this study, we determined and compared the size
   structure, individual growth, and mortality estimates of channel catfish
   and freshwater drum among the Illinois River and sections of the
   Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash rivers to provide a current baseline for
   managing these populations. Results suggest that both fishes differed in
   size structure among rivers. Compared to all other rivers, the
   Mississippi River freshwater drum growth rate was the highest and the
   theoretical maximum length was the lowest, and the Ohio River annual
   mortality was lowest. Channel catfish growth did not differ among
   rivers, but annual mortality was significantly higher in the Mississippi
   River compared to the Wabash River. Given the importance of these two
   fishes, better understanding of their population demographics in these
   systems is essential to improving current and future fisheries
   management programs.},

Title = {The Eurypterid Endostoma and Its Homology with Other Chelicerate

Abstract = {The endostoma of eurypterids is a small ventral structure previously
   known from only 11 specimens and in detail from only a single species,
   Eurypterus tetraganophthalmus. Four previously undescribed eurypterid
   specimens from the Samuel J. Ciurca Jr. Collection, Yale Peabody Museum
   of Natural History, likely belonging to Eurypterus, and a previously
   documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New
   York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and
   homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a
   bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly
   facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are
   noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates
   with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous
   interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh
   body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria.
   This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the
   metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.},

Title = {Value of the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) in
   representing near-surface temperature and wind speed in the north-east

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The representation of 2-m air temperature and 10-m wind speed in the
   high-resolution (with a 2.5-km grid spacing) Copernicus Arctic Regional
   Reanalysis (CARRA) and the coarser resolution (ca. 31-km grid spacing)
   global European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
   fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) for Svalbard, northern Norway, Sweden
   and Finland is evaluated against observations. The largest differences
   between the two reanalyses are found in regions with complex terrain and
   coastlines, and over the sea ice for temperature in winter. In most
   aspects, CARRA outperforms ERA5 in its agreement with the observations,
   but the value added by CARRA varies with region and season. Furthermore,
   the added value by CARRA is seen for both parameters but is more
   pronounced for temperature than wind speed. CARRA is in better agreement
   with observations in terms of general evaluation metrics like bias and
   standard deviation of the errors, is more similar to the observed
   spatial and temporal variability and better captures local extremes. A
   better representation of high-impact weather like polar lows, vessel
   icing and warm spells during winter is also demonstrated. Finally, it is
   shown that a substantial part of the difference between reanalyses and
   observations is due to representativeness issues, that is, sub-grid
   variability, which cannot be represented in gridded data. This
   representativeness error is larger in ERA5 than in CARRA, but the
   fraction of the total error is estimated to be similar in the two
   analyses for temperature but larger in ERA5 for wind speed.},

Title = {Five decades of terrestrial and freshwater research at Ny-?lesund,
   Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {For more than five decades, research has been conducted at Ny-Alesund,
   in Svalbard, Norway, to understand the structure and functioning of High
   Arctic ecosystems and the profound impacts on them of environmental
   change. Terrestrial, freshwater, glacial and marine ecosystems are
   accessible year-round from Ny-Alesund, providing unique opportunities
   for interdisciplinary observational and experimental studies along
   physical, chemical, hydrological and climatic gradients. Here, we
   synthesize terrestrial and freshwater research at Ny-Alesund and review
   current knowledge of biodiversity patterns, species population dynamics
   and interactions, ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and
   anthropogenic impacts. There is now strong evidence of past and ongoing
   biotic changes caused by climate change, including negative effects on
   populations of many taxa and impacts of rain-on-snow events across
   multiple trophic levels. While species-level characteristics and
   responses are well understood for macro-organisms, major knowledge gaps
   exist for microbes, invertebrates and ecosystem-level processes. In
   order to fill current knowledge gaps, we recommend (1) maintaining
   monitoring efforts, while establishing a longterm ecosystem-based
   monitoring programme; (2) gaining a mechanistic understanding of
   environmental change impacts on processes and linkages in food webs; (3)
   identifying trophic interactions and cascades across ecosystems; and (4)
   integrating long-term data on microbial, invertebrate and freshwater
   communities, along with measurements of carbon and nutrient fluxes among
   soils, atmosphere, freshwaters and the marine environment. The synthesis
   here shows that the Ny-Alesund study system has the characteristics
   needed to fill these gaps in knowledge, thereby enhancing our
   understanding of High-Arctic ecosystems and their responses to
   environmental variability and change.},

Title = {Foraging behaviour of sympatrically breeding macaroni (Eudyptes
   chrysolophus) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) penguins at
   Bouvetoya, Southern Ocean},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Species with similar ecological requirements that overlap in range tend
   to segregate their niches to minimize competition for resources.
   However, the niche segregation possibilities for centrally foraging
   predators that breed on isolated Subantarctic islands may be reduced by
   spatial constraints and limitations in the availability of alternative
   prey. In this study we examined spatial and trophic aspects of the
   foraging niches of two sympatrically breeding penguin species, macaroni
   (Eudyptes chrysolophus; MAC) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus;
   CHIN) penguins, at Bouvetoya over two breeding seasons. To measure
   at-sea movements and diving behaviour, 90 MACs and 49 CHINs were
   equipped with GPS loggers and dive recorders during two austral summer
   breeding seasons (2014/15 and 2017/18). In addition, blood samples from
   tracked birds were analysed for stable isotopes to obtain dietary
   information. CHINs displayed marked interannual variation in foraging
   behaviour, diving deeper, utilizing a larger foraging area and
   displaying enriched values of 815N in 2014/15 compared to the 2017/18
   breeding season. In contrast, MACs dove to similar depths and showed
   similar 815N values, while consistently utilizing larger foraging areas
   compared to CHINs. We suggest that low krill abundances in the waters
   around Bouvetoya during the 2014/15 season resulted in CHINs shifting
   toward a diet that increased their niche overlap with MACs. Our findings
   may partly explain the decreasing number of breeding CHINs at the
   world's most remote island, Bouvetoya, while also highlighting the
   importance of characterizing niche overlap of species using multi-season
   data sets.},

Title = {Remote sensing, snow modelling, survey data and Indigenous Knowledge

Abstract = {Accelerated warming of the Arctic has reduced sea ice and has increased
   the occurrence of winter extreme events like rain-on-snow and storms
   that impact sonal movements and grazing conditions. We used caribou
   movements between Banks, Melville and Victoria islands and mainland
   Canada, documented from Indigenous Knowledge, to assess whether
   spatiotemporal trends in sea-ice anomalies (1983-2019) can be used as an
   indicator of caribou movement. We used the SNOWPACK model to evaluate
   how foraging conditions (as indexed by simulated snow properties)
   contribute to the prediction of caribou presence. Our results suggest
   that changes in sea-ice anomalies over time have impacted caribou
   crossings between islands: caribou no longer use areas with less sea ice
   whilst they continue to use areas with more sea ice. Our model
   evaluation shows that, when the simulated snow conditions are paired
   with other environmental variables, the ability of models to predict
   Peary caribou occurrence on land was enhanced across Banks and Melville
   islands. Overall, the land models suggest that caribou are more likely
   to occupy areas with lower density of snow accumulation and a majority
   of forb tundra with dwarf shrubs for Banks Island and cryptogam tundra,
   rush and grass for the Melville Island Complex. Our results suggest that
   future work monitoring changes in sea-ice and snow conditions will be
   important for understanding the impact of climate change on the
   distribution of Peary caribou in the western Arctic.},

Title = {Applying landscape fragmentation analysis to icescape environments:
   potential impacts for the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens)},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Sea-ice cover across the Arctic has declined rapidly over the past
   several decades owing to amplified climate warming. The Pacific walrus
   (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) relies on sea-ice floes in the St.
   Lawrence Island (SLI) and Wainwright regions of the Bering and Chukchi
   seas surrounding Alaska as a platform for rest, feeding and
   reproduction. Lower concentrations of thick ice floes are gen-erally
   associated with earlier seasonal fragmentation and shorter annual
   per-sistence of sea-ice cover, potentially affecting the life history of
   the Pacific walrus. In this study, 24 Landsat satellite images were
   classified into thick ice, thin ice or open water to assess sea-ice
   fragmentation over the spring-summer breakup period. Geospatial
   fragmentation analyses traditionally used in terres-trial landscapes
   were newly implemented in this study to characterize the ices -cape
   environment. Fragmentation of sea ice was assessed based on the Percent
   of Landscape, Number of Patches, Mean Area, Shape Index, Euclidean
   Nearest Neighbor and Edge Density. Results show that lower sea-ice
   concentrations in both the SLI and Wainwright regions were associated
   with smaller sea-ice floes. In the Bering Sea, lower sea-ice
   concentrations were also associated with increases in the number of ice
   floes, floe isolation and edge density. By contrast, lower sea-ice
   concentrations in the Chukchi Sea were associated with ice floes that
   were more circular in shape. The continuation of sea-ice decline with
   shift-ing icescape characteristics may result in walruses having to swim
   longer dis-tances in the northern Bering Sea and adapt to use
   less-preferred, rounder ice floes in the Chukchi Sea.},

Title = {Hormone profiles from Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and aquarium beluga whales},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from Cook Inlet (CI), Alaska, are
   listed as ???endangered??? because of dramatic declines in abundance,
   with no indications of population recovery. Serum samples from this
   population are exceedingly rare. Longitudinal samples from aquarium (AQ)
   belugas can potentially provide health assessment reference ranges for
   free-ranging beluga, including reproduc-tive and metabolic hormones. We
   analysed serum hormone concentrations from CI (n = 6, three females and
   three males) and Bristol Bay (Alaska; BB; n = 5, four males and one
   female), alongside AQ (n = 3, two females and one male) belugas, to
   conduct physiological comparisons of reproductive hormones
   (progesterone, testosterone and total oestrogens) and metabolic hormones
   (total thyroxine, triiodothyronine and cortisol) in beluga serum.
   Oestrogen and progesterone profiles from January through May from two AQ
   female beluga were typical of non-pregnant, cycling females. CI and BB
   sex steroid concentrations were within AQ hormone ranges, with the
   exception of elevated progesterone concentrations in four potentially
   pregnant females. Both CI and BB belugas had elevated meta-bolic
   hormones, which may indicate greater metabolic effort required in the
   wild environment or capture response. Because sample collection from CI
   belugas is rare, analysis of even the few samples that we analysed may
   contribute to the conservation of the small and declining population of
   genetically distinct CI beluga whales. It is important that each sample
   collected from free-range CI belu-gas provides the maximum biological
   information possible. Continued compari-son of hormones in AQ and
   free-ranging beluga will enhance the interpretation of health data in
   both groups.},

Title = {Cetacean spatial trends from 2005 to 2019 in Svalbard, Norway},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {This study uses cetacean sighting data, acquired via a citizen science
   pro-gramme, to update distributions and spatial trends of whales and
   dolphins in waters around the Svalbard Archipelago during the period
   2005-2019. Distri-butions, based on kernel density estimates, from an
   early period (2005-2019) and a recent period (2015-19) were compared to
   identify potential shifts in distribution in this area, which is
   experiencing rapid warming and concomi-tant sea-ice losses. Among the
   three Arctic endemic cetaceans, white whales (Delphinapterus leucas,
   also known as beluga) had a stable, coastal distribution throughout the
   study, whereas narwhals (Monodon monoceros) and bowhead whales (Balaena
   mysticetus) were observed only north of the archipelago, but with
   increasing frequency during the recent period. White-beaked dolphins
   (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) had a stable distribution along the
   continental shelf break, west and south of Svalbard. Sperm whale
   observations shifted from west of Bjornoya during the early period to
   being concentrated around the north end of Prins Karls Forland, west of
   Spitsbergen during the recent period. The four summer-resident baleen
   whales-blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera
   physalus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and minke whales
   (Balaenoptera acutorostrata)-have shifted their distributions from the
   continental shelf break west of Spitsbergen during the early period into
   fjords and coastal areas during the recent period. These changes
   coincide with increased inflows of Atlantic Water into the fjords along
   the west coast of Spits-bergen and across the north of the archipelago.},

Abstract = {Many areas in the Arctic are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change. We observe large-scale effects on physical, biological, economic
   and social parameters, including ice cover, species distributions,
   economic activity and regional gover-nance frameworks. Arctic living
   marine resources are affected in various ways. A holistic understanding
   of these effects requires a multidisciplinary enterprise. We synthesize
   relevant research, from oceanography and ecology, via economics, to
   political science and international law. We find that multidisciplinary
   research can enhance our understanding and promote new questions and
   issues relating to impacts and outcomes of climate change in the Arctic.
   Such issues include recent insights on changing spawning migrations of
   the North-east Arctic cod stock that necessitates revisions of
   socioeconomic estimates of ecosystem wealth in the Barents Sea, better
   integrated prediction systems that require increased coopera-tion
   between experts on climate prediction and ecosystem modelling, and
   institu-tional complexities of Arctic governance that require enhanced

Title = {The Chelicerae of Slimonia (Eurypterida; Pterygotoidea)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pterygotid eurypterids are the most speciose eurypterid Glade,
   accounting for almost a fifth of the approximately 250 known species,
   although it is unclear whether this increase in diversity is due to
   their increased dispersal ability, shift in predation style to
   cheliceral-driven prey capture, or some other factor. Determining if the
   development of their characteristic large chelicerae represents a key
   trait facilitating increased diversification is hindered by uncertainty
   regarding the form of the chelicerae in Slimonia, the sister taxon to
   Pterygotidae. Here I report the discovery of a specimen of Slimonia
   acuminata preserving the chelicerae in detail and corroborate reports
   from the 1800s suggesting that the chelicerae of Slimonia were short and
   robust. The evidence from the new specimen, taken in concert with the
   morphology of the rest of the animal, indicates that Slimonia was an
   active predator that captured prey with its robust prosomal appendages.
   The apparent increase in pterygotid species diversity therefore does
   indeed seem to be associated with the development of the large
   chelicerae; however, further work is needed to determine whether
   taphonomic biases in preservation due to increased sclerotization of the
   chelicerae or taxonomic oversplitting due to minor changes in denticle
   morphology are driving this phenomenon.},

Title = {Managing cumulative impacts and protected areas in Antarctica: what can
   we learn from the rest of the world?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {For more than 20 years Antarctic Treaty Parties have been discussing how
   to appropriately manage cumulative impacts in the continent. Preventing
   cumu-lative impacts requires the fluent exchange of information to
   enable proper and timely assessment of, and response to, the impacts
   that result from multiple activities, undertaken by multiple
   stakeholders and supervised by different Parties. This is a particular
   challenge for the effective management of Antarctic Specially Protected
   Areas (ASPAs), as a lack of coordination may potentially put at risk the
   fulfillment of their conservation objectives. Here we suggest that
   incorporating lessons learnt from protected areas management elsewhere
   might improve the effectiveness of ASPAs and provide valuable
   experiences and insights on how to better manage cumulative impacts in
   the rest of the continent. Key concepts to incorporate in Antarctica???s
   environmental manage-ment toolbox include (1) the notion of adaptive
   management, which is a cor-nerstone of protected areas management
   effectiveness elsewhere, and (2) the need of empowering protected area
   managers, which are a key (but often miss-ing) element to ensure local
   compliance with management plans, co-ordinate on site activities,
   facilitate exchange of information, promote cooperation and manage
   conflicts.},

Title = {Stranded beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) calf response and care: reports
   of two cases with different outcomes},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Given the remote, rugged areas belugas typically inhabit and the low
   rehabilitation success rate with any cetacean, it is rare to have the
   opportunity to rescue a live-stranded beluga. The Alaska SeaLife Center
   cared for two stranded beluga calves with two different outcomes. In
   2012, a neonatal male beluga calf (DL1202) stranded following intense
   storms in Bristol Bay. In 2017, a helicopter pilot discovered a stranded
   male beluga calf (DL1705) during a flight over Cook Inlet. The Alaska
   SeaLife Center transported both calves for rehabilitation and utilized
   supportive care plans based on those for other species of stranded
   cetaceans and care of neonatal belugas at zoological facilities.
   Diagnostics included complete blood counts, serum chemistries, microbial
   cultures, hearing tests, imaging and morphometric measurements to
   monitor systemic health. Treatments included in-pool flotation support;
   antimicrobials; gastrointestinal support; and close monitoring of
   respirations, urination, defecation and behaviour. After three weeks of
   supportive care, the Bristol Bay calf (DL1202) succumbed to sepsis
   secondary to a possible prematurity-related lack of passive transfer of
   antibodies. After seven weeks, the Cook Inlet calf (DL1705) recovered
   and all medications were discontinued. Unable to survive on his own, he
   was declared non-releasable and placed in long-term care at a zoological
   facility, to live with other belugas. Aspects and details from
   successful cases of cetacean critical care become important references
   especially vital for the survival of essential animals in small,
   endangered populations.},

Title = {Patterns of interdisciplinary collaboration resemble biogeochemical
   relationships in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: a historical
   social network analysis of science, 1907-2016},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Co-authorship networks can provide key insights into the production of
   scientific knowledge. This is particularly interesting in Antarctica,
   where most human activity relates to scientific research. Bibliometric
   studies of Antarctic science have provided a useful understanding of
   international and interdisciplinary collaboration, yet most research has
   focused on broad-scale analyses over recent time periods. Here, we take
   advantage of a `Goldilocks' opportunity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, an
   internationally important region of Antarctica and the largest ice-free
   region on the continent. The McMurdo Dry Valleys have attracted
   continuous and diverse scientific activity since 1958. It is a
   geographically confined region with limited access, making it possible
   to evaluate the influence of specific events and individuals. We trace
   the history of environmental science in this region using bibliometrics
   and social network analysis. Our results show a marked shift in focus
   from the geosciences to the biosciences, which mirrors wider trends in
   the history of science. Collaboration among individuals and academic
   disciplines increased through time, and the most productive scientists
   in the network are also the most interdisciplinary. Patterns of
   collaboration among disciplines resemble the biogeochemical
   relationships among respective landscape features, raising interesting
   questions about the role of the material environment in the development
   of scientific networks in the region, and the dynamic interaction with
   socio-cultural and political factors. Our focused, historical approach
   adds nuance to broad-scale bibliometric studies and could be applied to
   understanding the dynamics of scientific research in other regions of
   Antarctica and elsewhere.},

Title = {Integrative biodiversity inventories: characterizing lichen-forming
   fungal diversity in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area using DNA
   barcoding and vouchered specimens},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},

Pages = {213-233},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Colorado River and its tributaries on the Colorado Plateau are home
   to unique desert river ecosystems and changing environmental conditions.
   Within this region, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA) is
   composed of rugged, high desert terrain and is managed by the United
   States National Park Service as both a recreational and conservation
   area. Despite the ecological and economic importance of GCNRA,
   significant components of the ecological communities therein remain
   poorly characterized, including lichens. Accurately characterizing
   lichen-forming fungal diversity is challenging due to poorly known
   taxonomic groups, underexplored regions/habitats, and varying
   interpretations of morphological differences, including the recognition
   of environmentally modified forms. To better understand lichen diversity
   in GCNRA, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, incorporating both
   traditional morphology-based identification and information from the
   standard fungal DNA barcoding marker, the ITS, to compile a thorough
   inventory of lichen-forming fungi in Fifty-Mile Canyon. Vouchered lichen
   specimens were collected in 2019, and from these the ITS marker was
   sequenced. Candidate species-level lineages were delimited from
   family-level multiple sequence alignments using the Assemble Species by
   Automatic Partitioning web server. Specimens comprising DNA-based
   candidate species were then evaluated using traditional taxonomically
   diagnostic characters to link these, where possible, to currently
   described species. For Fifty-Mile Canyon, we document 100 putative
   species in 15 families, each represented by vouchered specimens, ITS
   sequence data, and photographic documentation. For comparison, a survey
   of historic records from GCNRA revealed a total of 124 documented
   lichen-forming fungal species throughout the NRA and adjacent land.
   Approximately 50\% of the species documented in Fifty-Mile Canyon had
   not previously been found in GCNRA, and similar proportions of species
   diversity have been documented in GCNRA but not observed in our survey.
   We report 3 species new to North America-Calogaya ferrugineoides (H.
   Magn.) Arup, Froden \& Sochting, Endocarpon deserticola T. Zhang, X.L.
   Wei \& J.C. Wei, and Xanthocarpia ferrarii (Bagl.) Froden, Arup \&
   Sochting-verified using ITS sequencing data. In addition, Circinaria
   squamulosa sp. nov. is formally described here, currently known only
   from sandstone slabs in Fifty-Mile Canyon. However, the taxonomic
   identity of many of the candidate species from Fifty-Mile Canyon
   remained ambiguous at the species level, and some collections likely
   represent undescribed species-level lineages. Our results revealed
   unexpected, high species-level diversity of lichen-forming fungi at
   local scales and that overall lichen diversity across the entire GCNRA
   is likely vastly undercounted. These data-including DNA barcodes for the
   vast majority of lichen-forming fungi occurring in this canyon-provide
   an important resource that can be integrated into subsequent lichen
   biodiversity research in the southwestern United States and other
   semiarid climates.},

Title = {Mechanisms of action and biocontrol potential of Trichoderma against
   fungal plant diseases - A review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Plant diseases are among the major causes of the low productivity of
   crops, causing yield losses of up to 30\%, heralding an enormous threat
   to global food security. Indiscriminate use of chemical-based fungicides
   for controlling fungal diseases has raised severe concerns about
   ecosystem health. Moreover, pathogens have become insensitive against
   these chemicals necessitating excessive use of chemicals for adequate
   control. The resulting accumulation of these chemicals in the food chain
   has provoked numerous health complications. For combating the
   adversaries of chemical-based fungicides, biological control of fungal
   pathogens is proposed as an eco-friendly alternative. Among various
   biological controls, Trichoderma-based biological control agents (BCAs)
   are widely used in agriculture for controlling soil-borne pathogens.
   These BCAs are commercialized and known as; stimulators of resistance in
   plants, growth enhancers, bio-fertilizers, and bio-pesticides.
   Biological management of plant pathogens has yielded valuable results in
   the sustainability of ecosystems and compelling improvements in the
   quality and quantity of agricultural produce. These BCAs exhibit
   potential against pathogens, remarkably improve photosynthesis, plant
   growth, and nutrient use efficiency for impressive crop yields. Despite
   these peculiarities, Trichoderma's mechanisms against pathogens and
   their growth promotional effects are not thoroughly investigated, hence
   formulating the prime objective of the current review. Along with these,

Title = {Modelling Holling type II functional response in deterministic and
   stochastic food chain models with mass conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model is the building block in
   modeling food chain, food webs and ecosystems. There are a number of
   hidden assumptions involved in the derivation. For instance the prey
   population growth is logistic without predation but also with predation.
   In order to reveal these we will start with modelling a
   resource-predator-prey system in a closed spatially homogeneous
   environment. This allows us to keep track of the nutrient flow. With an
   instantaneous remineralisation of the products excreted in the
   environment by the populations and dead body mass there is conservation
   of mass. This allows for a model dimension reduction and yields the mass
   balance predator-prey model. When furthermore the searching and handling
   processes are much faster that the population changing rates, the
   trophic interaction is described by a Holling type II functional
   response, also assumed in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. The derivation
   uses an extended deterministic model with number of searching and
   handling predators as model variables where the ratio of the
   predator/prey body masses is used as a mechanistic time-scale parameter.
   This extended model is also used as a starting point for the derivation
   of a stochastic model. We will investigate the stochastic effects of
   random switching between searching and handling of the predators and
   predator dying. Prey growth by consumption of ambient resources is still
   deterministic and therefore the stochastic model is hybrid. The
   transient dynamics is studied by numerical Monte Carlo simulations and
   also the quasi-equilibrium distribution for the population quantities is
   calculated. The body mass of the prey individual is the scaling
   parameter in the stochastic model formulation. This allows for a
   quantification of the mean-field approximation criterion for the
   justification of replacement of the stochastic by a deterministic model.},

Title = {Landscape pattern changes across alpine shrub meadows gradient in
   warm-season pastures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Grassland degradation has been one of the major ecological concerns on
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in recent years, but the degradation of
   alpine shrub meadows, and in particular the changes in its surface
   landscape pattern, has been less well assessed. This study selected a
   warm-season pasture on the QTP as a study area, and used an unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect aerial photographs along the degradation
   gradient from late June to early July 2018. We then classified the
   surface landscape as alpine shrub, alpine meadow, bare soil and plateau
   pika hole and analyzed the landscape pattern changes at different
   degradation levels. The results showed that the alpine shrub and alpine
   meadow dominated landscape degraded to a pattern of alpine meadow and
   bare soil dominance and pika hole pervasiveness, during which vegetation
   cover declined and the overall landscape pattern tended to fragment.
   Landscape pattern characteristics related to the area, density,
   connectivity and boundaries respond more clearly to the shrub
   degradation, with moderate degradation being the key stage at which the
   surface landscape pattern changes dramatically. Our study demonstrates a
   potential application of UAV technology in the study of grassland
   degradation. Future research should focus on the status, mechanisms and
   ecological effects of alpine shrub meadows degradation and the
   quantitative relationships between surface landscape patterns and
   ecological functions.},

Abstract = {Long-term vegetation monitoring is essential to understanding plant
   responses to both climate and grazing. The objective of this study was
   to monitor the long-term effects of precipitation on vegetation changes
   within a salt desert shrub plant community and determine whether grazing
   by livestock altered the vegetation during this time. The study was
   located within the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah. Two sites were
   selected. One exclosure was constructed at each site, and foliar cover
   was measured inside and outside the exclosure to separate the effect of
   grazing from precipitation on vegetation change over a 30-year period.
   Shrubs were the dominant vegetative cover at the start of the study,
   with the invasive shrub Gutierrezia sarothrae being the dominant shrub
   accounting for 53\% of total plant cover. As the invasive shrub died out
   due to drought, native shrub cover as well as C-4 grass cover increased.
   Native shrub cover displayed positive correlations with current winter
   and cool-season precipitation. C-4 grass cover displayed positive
   correlation with cool-season precipitation. Winter and spring grazing at
   moderate stocking rates were not detrimental to these desert plant
   communities. Climatic conditions were the dominant influence on
   vegetation.},

Title = {Unipartite and bipartite mycorrhizal networks of Abies religiosa
   forests: Incorporating network theory into applied ecology of conifer
   species and forest},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Abies religiosa's forests are severely endangered as a result of climate
   change; to save this species and its biological interactions, population
   assisted migration is discussed in forest management, but not in the
   microbial ecology field. Our objectives were to analyze its mycorrhizal
   networks; and, with this data, to identify potential facilitator plants
   and it's most important mycorrhizal fungal links. This information could
   be used together in assisted migration programs to connect Abies
   religiosa saplings to their mycorrhizal network and improve their field
   establishment. We collected 47 rhizosphere samples from 19 plant species
   and sequenced their fungal ITS2 region by Illumina. In the whole fungal
   community, 464 species were mycorrhizal fungi with assigned guild
   (32\%). In this subset, 85 fungi are arbuscular, 365 ectomycorrhizal and
   14 from orchid-mycorriza. The Abies religiosa bipartite network is low
   nested and highly modular, and has a scale-free architecture. Besides
   Abies religiosa, the plants with the largest degree and the lowest
   average shortest path were Salix paradoxa, Muhlenbergia spp., and
   Baccharis conferta. The most important fungal nodes are species of
   Cortinarius, Genea, Rhodoscypha, Russula, and Tomentella. We suggest to
   evaluate the Abies' future establishment in the following scheme: in the
   first year reintroduce Muhlenbergia spp., and Baccharis conferta, in the
   second year Salix paradoxa, and in the third year-once the mycorrhizal
   network is reestablished- Abies religiosa' saplings in close proximity
   of these plants. This scheme is proposed using the data and network
   analyses of the present study.},

Title = {Multi-Dimensional assessment of beach systems on the Catalan coast from
   a pragmatic and epistemological perspective},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent decades, much of the progress observed in the study of beaches
   to aid policy has focused on producing sound substantive and/or
   contextual knowledge. However, attention has not usually been paid to
   the procedural manner in which it has been produced. Guided by an open
   learning process, this study aims to develop and present an expanded
   reviewed assessment of the Catalan coast operationalized by means of the
   Double-Looped Beach Quality Index (DL-BQI). Such openness helps us to
   understand which narratives of beach management in Catalonia are
   operating (and which are excluded), the extent to which they are
   unfolding, and the capacity of the DL-BQI to provide information for
   policymaking. Data collection enabled assessment of 96 representative
   beaches on the Catalan coast, that may find correspondence with other
   geographic locations. Both the instrument used for the assessment - the
   DL-BQI - and its results were co-evaluated at a multi-stakeholder
   meeting. In general, beaches have mainly been conditioned to supply
   elements for tourism and leisure. Different pressures have arisen from
   the orientation towards such activities, usually according to beach
   type, most of them negatively impacting the ecological assets and
   natural heritage of beaches. The economic growth narrative, albeit
   predominant, was shown to be deficient for tackling complex coastal
   problems, i.e. intensifying ecological deterioration. Alternatively, the
   study shows the importance for regional coastal policy of considering
   the value of beaches as natural systems, as advocated, to a greater or
   lesser extent, by the narratives of sustainability, environmental
   protection and integrated coastal zone management. This research
   innovates on considering substantive, contextual and procedural
   dimensions of knowledge quality for the governance of beach systems, by
   relating dimensions, narratives and outcomes.},

Title = {Assessing the climate change effects on the distribution pattern of the
   Azerbaijan Mountain Newt (Neurergus crocatus)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is a grave danger for humans and a looming threat to
   Earth's biodiversity in the twenty-first century. Assessing the
   vulnerability of species to climate change is critical for practical
   conservation efforts. Due to their limited dispersal ability, amphibians
   are one of the most vulnerable groups of vertebrates to climate change.
   Among them, the species that inhabit mountains suffer a tremendous
   amount of climate change-induced pressures. We, therefore, adopted the
   Azerbaijan Mountain Newt (Neurergus crocatus), which currently inhabits
   Northwest Iran, North Iraq, and Southeast Turkey, as a case study for
   assessing the effects of climate change on the distribution patterns of
   mountain amphibians. By applying the species distribution models (SDMs)
   in this study, we tried to hindcast the species distribution area in the
   past and illustrate the impacts of climate change on its distribution in
   the present and future (the 2050s and 2070s) climate conditions. Also,
   the patch metrics have been deployed for identifying habitat
   fragmentation. Our results indicate a more than 50\% rise in the
   species' current suitable habitats compared to its glacial refugia. The
   suitable habitat is expected to gradually decrease in RCP 2.6 and RCP
   8.5. Among the three countries in which the species occurs, its
   distribution overlaps with protected areas only in Iraq. The number of
   habitat patches will grow and reach approximately 20 to 60 patches by
   2070 and the average area of the patches will decrease throughout this
   time. Aside from the numerous threats that endanger the species, climate
   change puts the long-term existence of Azerbaijan Newt in jeopardy. The
   results of this study stress the urgent need for taking extreme measures
   on the species management and conserving its remnant habitat patches.},

Abstract = {Record of coprophagic behavior in vultures from both the Old and the New
   World are rare. We know of only a handful of reports for Turkey Vultures
   (Cathartes aura). Herein we report a specific event of
   heterocoprophagia: the consumption of 1-day-old puma (Puma concolor)
   feces by C. aura in the Manantlan Biosphere Reserve (Jalisco, Mexico).
   Feces of P. concolor play a role in chemical communication by male
   pumas, who generally do not cover their feces. Females and juveniles
   attempt to cover theirs. It is not known whether puma scats provide any
   nutrients to vultures. A bromatological analysis should be performed to
   determine whether the fecal matter contains nutrients that could be
   assimilated by vultures. As far as we know, this is the first
   observation of coprophagic behavior by C. aura on puma feces.},

Title = {Personality-dependent responses of elk to predatory pursuits},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {276-286},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Personality in wildlife has been linked to several ecological processes
   including mortality risk, facultative migration, and behavioral
   plasticity. In this paper I examined the relationship between
   personality and antipredator tactics exhibited by 20 wild female elk
   (Cervus canadensis) in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Two observers
   conducted 106 separate chases designed explicitly to resemble predator
   pursuits by wolves, the main predator of elk. We quantified and
   classified elk tactical responses during each chase. Elk with ``shy{''}
   type personalities responded to 84\% of predator-resembling pursuits by
   employing speed-based tactics to outrun pursuers or rejoin conspecifics.
   Elk with ``bold{''} type personalities adopted this tactic just 11\% of
   the time, and instead employed tactics where they stopped and evaluated
   pursuers in 45\% of chases, attempted to hide from pursuers in 19\% of
   chases, and turned aggressively toward pursuers in 17\% of chases. Bold
   animals employed a greater variety of tactics overall and were more
   likely to try multiple tactics within the same 10-min chase. Shyness was
   also positively correlated with flight initiation distance at the start
   of chases. These results are important for wildlife managers who may be
   artificially and unwittingly selecting against certain personalities and
   thereby influencing management and conservation outcomes.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of sculpins (Cottus, Cottidae) remains one of the last
   major unresolved puzzles in the systematics of North American freshwater
   fishes. We used molecular approaches to identify candidate taxa and
   their distribution across western North America. We crowd-sourced the
   collection of specimens (n = 8272) via outreach to biologists in the
   western United States and Canada. From that collection, we sequenced-at
   up to 2 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear genes-a subset (n = 4009) of
   specimens from most basins in the western United States, added sequences
   from public sequence databases, and applied an array of species
   delimitation and specimen identification methods to assess phylogenetic
   and spatial patterns of diversity. Species delimitation methods,
   primarily relying on a conservative interpretation of the phylogenetic
   species concept, were broadly concordant and indicated that 43 candidate
   species were present. Some named taxa were unsupported, whereas others,
   if recognized, would violate the phylogenetic species concept. Specimen
   assignment was largely unambiguous and geographic distributions were
   consistent with phylo-geographic patterns in other taxa. Our work
   establishes a benchmark for understanding the diversity of sculpin in
   western North America and suggests new species hypotheses both there and
   in eastern North America.},

Title = {New distributional data for the northern forestfly, Lednia borealis

Abstract = {The northern forestfly, Lednia borealis Baumann and Kondratieff, 2010
   (Plecoptera: Nemouridae), is a rare montane stonefly that until recently
   was thought to be endemic to Washington State. It is one of 4 described
   Lednia species in the western United States and Canada and the only
   member of its genus known to occur in Washington. All 4 Lednia species
   are associated with cold-water habitat in alpine and subalpine habitats;
   because of this, they may be especially vulnerable to threats associated
   with climate change. However, L. borealis is rarely targeted in species
   inventories or survey efforts, and more information is needed about its
   distribution and habitat associations in order to assess its
   conservation status. To address these data gaps, we conducted targeted
   surveys at 94 sites in montane areas of Washington State from 2015 to
   2019. We collected L. borealis at only 8 of these (8.5\%), bringing the
   total number of known sites to 19. In this paper, we update the known
   distribution for the species, report recent COI barcoding results,
   highlight a confirmed habitat association with glacial edge meltwater,
   and provide recommendations for future surveys.},

Volume = {82},

Abstract = {Many North American populations of lekking grouse have declined across
   their ranges, and understanding and evaluating population trajectories
   can assist in better managing these iconic species. Columbian
   Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) is a
   subspecies of Sharp-tailed Grouse that has declined across its range in
   the Intermountain West over the past century. Management of this species
   primarily focuses on habitat around leks; therefore, knowing where
   Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse leks occur is key to their conservation.
   We used a resource selection framework to predict lek occurrence in an
   area with multiple known leks in Carbon County, Wyoming. We used this
   model to predict lek occurrence in an area with only one known lek in
   Grand Teton National Park. Our model predicting lek locations in Carbon
   County was a strong predictor of lek occurrence in that area (r(s) =
   0.97), and when this model was projected onto Grand Teton National Park,
   the one known lek in the park was located in an area of very high
   probability for lek occurrence (>90\% probability of lek occurrence). We
   also used this predictive surface to locate 1 unknown lek and 7 other
   locations in Grand Teton National Park used by Columbian Sharp-tailed
   Grouse as detected by fecal droppings, feathers, or birds flushed. Our
   methods demonstrated that a resource selection framework from one area
   can be used to predict lek and other occurrences in another area when
   these areas have similar vegetation compositions.},

Title = {Structural sensitivity in the functional responses of predator-prey
   models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In mathematical modelling, several different functional forms can often
   be used to fit a data set equally well, especially if the data is
   sparse. In such cases, these mathematically different but similar
   looking functional forms are typically considered interchangeable.
   Recent work, however, shows that similar functional responses may
   nonetheless result in significantly different bifurcation points for the
   Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the bifurcation
   behaviours include destabilizing oscillations, predicting the occurrence
   of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different
   bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained
   from the models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to
   the extinction of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions
   is also clearly important for conservationists. Mathematically, this
   difference in bifurcation structure given similar functional responses
   is called structural sensitivity. We extend the existing work to find
   that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey system is also structurally
   sensitive to the functional response. Using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur and
   Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if there is some way
   to obtain a functional description of data so that different functional
   responses yield the same bifurcation structure, i.e., we aim to describe
   data such that our model is not structurally sensitive. We first add
   stochasticity to the functional responses and find that better
   similarity of the resulting bifurcation structures is achieved. Then, we
   analyse the functional responses using two different methods to
   determine which part of each function contributes most to the observed
   bifurcation behaviour. We find that prey densities around the
   coexistence steady state are most important in defining the functional
   response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for ecologists and mathematical
   modellers to increase the accuracy of model predictions in predator-prey
   systems.},

Title = {Baseline biodiversity assessment of South Texas small mammals and

Abstract = {Baseline biodiversity surveys are necessary to assess organismal
   diversity across spatial and temporal scales. These surveys can be
   particularly useful for monitoring changes in organismal diversity and
   pathogen spread in response to climate change. Arthropod vectors such as
   ticks are susceptible to geographic range shifts with a warming climate,
   potentially resulting in the expansion of risk areas for vector-borne
   disease. Biodiversity data are deficient from South Texas, which is
   particularly concerning given the abundance of wildlife and livestock
   that may be important in perpetuating tick and pathogen populations. We
   performed a baseline biodiversity assessment of small mammals, ticks,
   and tick-borne pathogens in South Texas using a combination of
   fieldwork, collections-based research, and molecular approaches. We
   recorded 19 species of small mammals and 3 species of ticks, and we
   detected no tick-borne pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia or
   Rickettsia in the ticks or mammals. Given the continued emergence of
   tick-borne disease, we recommend collaborations with natural history
   collections and private landowners interested in land stewardship so
   researchers can develop a better understanding of changing small mammal,
   tick, and pathogen diversity with implications for human and veterinary
   health in this region of Texas.},

Title = {Trace elements in walleye tissues and dietary components from an

Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},

Abstract = {There is a paucity of studies focusing on how total mercury (THg) and
   total selenium (TSe) concentrations vary in walleye tissues and prey
   organisms from a reservoir that is downstream from a major mining
   district and whose basin consists of Cretaceous sedimentary Se-bearing
   outcroppings. Pueblo Reservoir in Colorado is fed by water from the
   upper Arkansas River, which has been polluted by trace metals and
   metalloids since mining began in 1859. Pueblo Reservoir is the only
   mainstem impoundment on the Upper Arkansas River and is located about
   251 km downstream from the historic Leadville Mining District. Nearly
   all the contaminated colloids and sediment eventually reach Pueblo
   Reservoir and its walleye fishery. We compared THg and TSe
   concentrations among 15 walleye tissues clustered within ``functional
   tissue groups,{''} and with walleye stomach contents and the walleye's
   primary forage fish (gizzard shad). We found that THg concentration in
   epaxial muscle and cardiac muscle ranked first and second, respectively,
   and results indicated a significant difference in THg between the 2
   muscle types. Unlike THg, TSe levels were highest for liver, spleen,
   kidney, ovary/egg, and gill tissues, and TSe levels in all but 2 tissue
   pairings were significantly different. Significant differences occurred
   when THg and TSe in gizzard shad and stomach contents were compared to
   levels in each tissue. Our THg concentrations at the Pueblo Reservoir
   were generally lower than at other sites in western North America;
   however, TSe concentrations were higher and markedly different. The data
   indicate that THg tissue levels appear to be lower than established fish
   health benchmarks, yet many TSe tissue concentrations were above
   critical thresholds.},

Title = {Field-based selenium partitioning coefficients and trophic transfer
   factors for cutthroat trout fisheries from four montane lakes, Colorado,

Abstract = {Most studies of selenium (Se) bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in
   freshwater habitats have focused primarily on lotic and lentic sites in
   regions of elevated selenium. In contrast to previous reports, we
   proposed investigating Se partitioning from water to subsequent trophic
   levels in oligotrophic montane lakes using concentrations in water,
   sediment, periphyton, and filamentous algae, and also in the stomach
   contents and tissues of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) analyzed
   by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The indicator
   values for the level-one (water to particulate) partitioning
   coefficients (K-d values) or enrichment factors (EFs) were as high as
   1,641,000 L/kg dry weight and as low as 14,843. Values of Upper Sand
   Creek Lake partitioning coefficients in Great Sand Dunes National Park
   and Preserve were 36,529 using sediment, 28,000 using filamentous algae,
   and 1,641,000 using periphyton. For Lower Sand Creek Lake the
   partitioning coefficients were 14,843 for sediment, 17,250 for
   filamentous algae, and 32,415 for periphyton. The level-two metric
   (particulates to invertebrate trout stomach contents) was 1.18 for the
   mean trophic transfer factor for invertebrates of Upper Sand Creek Lake,
   1.31 for Lower Sand Creek Lake, and 1.77 for Lake Louise. The
   level-three indicator (invertebrates to trout tissues) values for Lake
   Louise, Lower and Upper Sand Creek Lakes, and Trappers Lake varied by
   tissue type. For the 4 Colorado sites, the range of trophic transfer
   factors was 2.31-5.25 for trout liver, 1.30-2.64 for ovary/egg, and
   0.28-1.08 for epaxial muscle. We proposed nonlinear food web exposure
   scenarios for 3 subalpine lakes. We compared Colorado trophic transfer
   factors for trout to those for cutthroat trout from Se-richer lentic
   sites in British Columbia, Canada. We concluded that historical (50
   years or less) surficial sediment concentrations could be used to
   generate appropriate partitioning coefficients in oligotrophic montane
   lakes. Selenium concentrations in stomach contents appeared
   representative of a range of trout dietborne invertebrates.},

Abstract = {Pacific salmon are ecologically, economically, and culturally important
   species indigenous to British Columbia, Canada. Unfortunately, some
   populations of Pacific salmon have been declining due to climate change,
   habitat loss, overfishing, and anthropogenic development. As such,
   considerable resources have been invested to study, restore, protect,
   and monitor Pacific salmon and their habitat. Since 2004, Lyall Creek, a
   salmon-bearing stream in the Salish Sea in British Columbia, Canada, has
   been monitored. Using 2-pass electrofishing, we investigated changes in
   observed densities over 15 years (2004-2019) for juvenile coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and juvenile coastal cutthroat trout
   (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) that inhabit Lyall Creek. A statistically
   insignificant but general decreasing trend was observed for juvenile
   coho salmon densities over 15 years in Lyall Creek. Juvenile coastal
   cutthroat trout densities in Lyall Creek exhibited a statistically
   significant decline. More research is required to understand what
   anthropogenic and environmental factors are negatively influencing
   Pacific salmon densities in Lyall Creek. Specifically, water
   availability may be an important stressor affecting these salmon
   populations.},

Title = {Nesting biology and offspring development of the cavity-nesting solitary

Abstract = {We studied the nesting biology and developmental schedules of the
   cavity-nesting solitary wasp Isodontia elegans in Oregon, USA.
   Trap-nests contained 1-15 brood cells each, separated by partitions,
   which adult females made with grass fragments. Before leaving nests to
   hunt, females made loose, temporary closures of longer fragments of
   dried grass and, upon returning, briefly deposited prey just inside the
   nest entrance before transferring them to a cell. Cells were provisioned
   with katydids (Meconema thalassinum, an invasive species in North
   America) and tree crickets (Oecanthus fultoni), the latter predominating
   as summers progressed. The inner cells of nests, where most daughters
   developed, were longer and separated from adjacent cells by partitions
   thicker than those in outer cells, where most sons developed. These
   observations, along with the fact that daughters are larger than sons
   (likely because they receive a greater provision mass from mothers),
   indicate that investment in daughters is considerably greater than that
   in sons, by multiple measures. Sexual size dimorphism was evident in
   both cocoon mass (prepupae + cocoon case) and adult mass. From 2013 to
   2019, nesting began earlier in the summer when mean maximum daily
   temperatures in June were higher and when the number of days in June
   with maximum temperatures <25 degrees C were fewer. Once nesting began,
   females typically completed 1 cell per day, the egg being laid on one of
   the first 3 prey placed in the cell. In the field, eggs hatched in 2-6
   d, and larvae completed feeding and began cocoon spinning 5-11 d later.
   After removal from winter storage, offspring completing development at
   29 degrees C emerged as adults in 22-40 d, with males emerging about 2 d
   earlier on average. The duration of the postdiapause period leading to
   adult emergence, however, was not correlated with eventual adult mass in
   either sex. We discuss interpopulation differences in prey species and
   nest materials used by I. elegans.},

Title = {Seasonal fish communities in three Northern California estuaries},

Abstract = {The majority of Northern California estuaries are small, flooded river
   valleys that are largely unstudied due to their small sizes. Yet these
   estuaries serve as important nursery areas for many marine fish species,
   including rock-fish, flatfish, smelt, and herring. In addition, they are
   vital to anadromous species such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss). Some of these small estuaries
   gained protection with the completion of Califor-nia's Marine Protected
   Area (MPA) network in 2012. From June 2014 to June 2016, we sampled the
   summer and winter fish communities in 3 estuaries: the Big River
   estuarine MPA, the Ten Mile River estuarine MPA, and the Mad River
   Estuary, which served as a non-MPA reference site. Fish were sampled via
   beach seine or fyke net at 2 stations within each estuary biannually, in
   summer and winter. Additional sampling was conducted in the Mad River
   Estuary to examine the transition from summer to winter fish
   communities. The fish communities in all 3 estuaries were strongly
   seasonal. The summer community was abundant and diverse, while winter
   catches were low and dominated by sculpin. Additional sampling in the
   Mad River Estuary showed that fish communities were diverse from spring
   through fall, but that catch in spring and fall was highly variable.
   After accounting for season, variability in the estuarine fish
   communities was best explained by location. The Big River Estuary had
   the strongest ocean connection and the most diverse marine fish
   community. The Ten Mile River Estuary had the weakest ocean connectivity
   and lowest species diversity. The Mad River Estuary fish community
   shared more similarities with both MPAs than they did with each other.
   All estuaries had a more diverse marine fish community downstream than
   upstream. The establishment of designated estuarine MPAs and the
   research presented here are important first steps to increased
   protection, understanding, and appreciation of the small California
   estuaries that cumulatively provide habitat critical to the life cycles
   of anadromous and marine species.},

Abstract = {Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi) and Paiute
   cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii seleniris) are rare taxa of
   conservation concern. Their generally low population densities and
   remote distribution make traditional sampling difficult, but they
   primarily exist in small streams, a habitat type where environmental DNA
   (eDNA) sampling has proven extremely effective. We developed a single
   eDNA assay that allows sensitive detection of both taxa, which occur
   separate from each other in different regions of the Lahontan Basin.
   Performance of the assay was evaluated using most lineages of Lahontan
   cutthroat trout and Paiute cutthroat trout as well as tissues of other
   cutthroat trout and rainbow trout that have been introduced within the
   Lahontan Basin. The assay amplified DNA only from the target taxa, and
   only from eDNA samples collected where those taxa were known to be
   present. This assay should enhance the ability of managers to more
   precisely and efficiently describe the distribution of these taxa.},

Title = {Trace elements in walleye tissues and dietary components from an

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Trace elements in 15 walleye (Sander vitreus) tissues taken from the
   Pueblo Reservoir in Colorado corresponded to many metals of worldwide
   concern and were the same as those released into the Arkansas River from
   decades of mining at Leadville, Colorado. Therefore, analyses of walleye
   stomach contents, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum; a dietary prey item
   for walleye), and tissues of walleye were compared for an increase in,
   or a deficiency of, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb. Tissues were compared as
   couplets but also evaluated with tissues clustered into 6 functional
   groups. The trace elements were found to be tissue distinctive and
   functional-group specific. An interesting finding was that muscle,
   liver, gill, or whole bodies of fish-often indicators of trace
   elements-may not be as illustrative as adipose, skin, heart, bone, or
   stomach contents of the walleye. Results showed no significant
   differences in amounts of Pb among tissues within any of the 6
   functional groups. We suggest that only 6 of 15 tissues might be
   necessary to indicate the uptake or lack of elements: heart, adipose,
   skin, bone, liver, and muscle, the latter of value for human
   consumption. Elements in gizzard shad, walleye stomach contents, livers,
   and muscle reflected historical element-rich colloidal sediments in the
   Arkansas River above the Pueblo Reservoir inlet. Despite the presence of
   trace elements in walleye tissues, this study suggests that a robust
   fishery of walleye in the Pueblo Reservoir exists and is likely to
   increase in the future.},

Title = {Optimal control of hybrid variable-order fractional coronavirus
   (2019-nCov) mathematical model; numerical treatments},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A novel coronavirus is a serious global issue and has a negative impact
   on the economy of Egypt. According to the publicly reported data, the
   first case of the novel corona virus in Egypt was reported on 14
   February 2020. Total of 96753 cases were recorded in Egypt from the
   beginning of the pandemic until the eighteenth of August, where 96, 581
   individuals were Egyptians and 172 were foreigners. Recently, many
   mathematical models have been considered to better understand
   coronavirus infection. Most of these models are based on classical
   integer-order derivatives which can not capture the fading memory and
   crossover behavior found in many biological phenomena. Therefore, we
   study the coronavirus disease in this paper by exploring the dynamics of
   COVID-19 infection using new variable-order fractional derivatives. This
   paper presents an optimal control problem of the hybrid variable-order
   fractional model of Coronavirus. The variable-order fractional operator
   is modified by an auxiliary parameter in order to satisfy the
   dimensional matching between the both sides of the resultant
   variable-order fractional equations. Existence, uniqueness, boundedness,
   positivity, local and global stability of the solutions are proved. Two
   control variables are considered to reduce the transmission of infection
   into healthy people. To approximate the new hybrid variable-order
   operator, Grunwald-Letnikov approximation is used. Finite difference
   method with a hybrid variable-order operator and generalized fourth
   order Runge-Kutta method are used to solve the optimality system.
   Numerical examples and comparative studies for testing the applicability
   of the utilized methods and to show the simplicity of these
   approximation approaches are presented. Moreover, by using the proposed
   methods we can concluded that, the model given in this paper describes
   well the confirmed real data given by WHO about Egypt.},

Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Volume = {82},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Vegetation in salt playas-iconic landforms in the Great Basin of the
   western United States-exhibits a striking topographical zonation that
   has remained unexplained. In particular, a distinctive pattern is
   exhibited by salt-succulent species in the Amaranthaceae wherein
   Allenrolfea occidentalis occurs in monospecific stands at the highest
   topographic position in the playa, Sarcocornia utahensis occurs in
   monospecific stands in the middle position, and Salicornia rubra occurs
   in monospecific stands at the lowest topographic position. Because salt
   playas feature a shallow, temporary winter lake that recedes as it
   evaporates throughout the summer and because vegetation zones closely
   follow the contours of the temporary lake, we hypothesized that factors
   relating to the hydrology of the system could be used to predict
   vegetation zonation. Indeed, we found multiple environmental gradients
   associated with hydrology that could contribute to the topographical
   zonation of the 3 plant species, including gradients in soil salinity,
   pH, redox potential, and water content, but not soil texture. A
   multinomial logistic regression model incorporating soil pH, redox
   potential, and water content was able to predict the correct vegetation
   zone with 100\% accuracy. Surprisingly, the gradient in soil NaCl
   concentration did not contribute significantly to the regression model.
   These results suggest that soil pH, redox potential, and water content
   are factors that could be further explored as niche axes that
   distinguish members of salt playa vegetation.},

Title = {Prevalence and intensity of infection of the parasitic copepod

Abstract = {Salmincola californiensis is a parasitic copepod that infects salmonid
   fishes in the genus Oncorhynchus. Our objective was to determine the
   level of infection of S. californiensis in Rainbow Trout in Birch Creek,
   Idaho. We sampled Rainbow Trout at 5 sites on Birch Creek during October
   2015 and May 2016. Mean intensity of infection was greater in May 2016
   ((x) over bar = 1.7) than it was in October 2015 ((x) over bar = 2.9;
   F-1,F-69 = 5.535, P = 0.021). Intensity of infection ranged from 1 to 10
   copepods in October 2015 and 1 to 12 copepods in May 2016. Intensity of
   infection did not differ among sites (F-4,F-69 = 0.141, P = 0.966) or by
   total length of the fish (F-1,F-69 = 3.036, P = 0.086). We found that
   the odds of infection of Rainbow Trout increased by 3\% (95\% CI, 2.1\%
   to 3.9\%) for every 1 mm increase in total length (chi(2)(0.05,321) =
   59.469, P < 0.001). Site 5 had the highest odds of infection
   (chi(2)(0.05, 317) = 11.656, P = 0.020). In addition, Rainbow Trout were
   2.3 times (95\% CI, 1.28 to 4.33) more likely to be infected in May 2016
   than they were in October 2015 (chi(2)(0.05, 316) = 7.769, P = 0.005).

Title = {Record of nesting and fledgling depredation on Crested Caracara

Abstract = {Urban settings represent a challenge to most bird species, although some
   raptors seem to adjust to new urban environments. The Crested Caracara
   (Caracas-a cheriway) is known as an urban-tolerant species. Though
   caracaras are resident in west-central Mexico, there is no information
   about the species' distribution, reproduction, and nesting within a
   metropolis such as Guadalajara. This species was using the peri-urban
   setting of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (GMA) to hunt, breed,
   construct its nests, and care for juveniles. To our knowledge, this is
   the first reported record of it breeding in a peri-urban setting in
   Mexico. On 15 February 2019, we found the remains of a caracara
   fledgling in a private vacant lot north of the GMA. The body had
   injuries on its back between the wings and no remaining muscle, which
   could be attributed to predation by another raptor. We later located a
   caracara nest in a eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in the
   same private vacant lot, within 30 m of where the carcass was found. The
   nest was a platform made of sticks, resting on the bifurcation between
   the tree trunk and one of its branches, 23.8 m high. The eucalyptus tree
   measured 37.4 m in height and 50 cm in diameter, with a 10.7-m(2) canopy
   cover. Twenty-four days later, we saw another juvenile perched near the
   parents. That was the last time we saw it. The following year, on 15
   March 2020, we saw 2 adult caracaras using the same nest and feeding a
   juvenile.},

Title = {Drivers of plant individual-based pollinator visitation network topology
   in an arid ecosystem},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Interactions with pollinators underlie the structure and function of
   plant communities. Network analysis is a valuable tool for studying
   plant-pollinator interactions, but these networks are most frequently
   built by aggregating interactions at the species level. Interactions are
   between individuals and an advantage of individual based networks is the
   ability to integrate inter-individual variation in traits and
   environmental context within complex ecological networks. We studied the
   influence of inter-individual variation on pollinator sharing among
   foundation shrubs and cactus in a desert ecosystem using plant
   individual-based pollinator visitation networks. We hypothesized that
   the traits that alter attractiveness of plants to pollinators will also
   influence an individual plant's role within the visitation network.
   Foundation plants growing with higher densities of nearby blooming
   shrubs had higher pollinator visitation rates and had greater access to
   the conspecific mating pool, suggesting widespread and diffuse
   pollination facilitation within this community. Further, shrub density
   influenced the role of betweenness centrality and the effective number
   of partners (eH). Floral display size also influenced the effective
   number of interaction partners but did not directly influence the
   centrality measures for individual plants or other measures of network
   structure despite increasing visitation rates. The individual-based
   visitation networks were significantly modular and module membership was
   predicted by species identity and pollinator visitation rates.
   Ecological and individual context mediate the outcome of
   pollinator-mediated interactions and are fundamental drivers of whole
   community structure. This study shows that the density of immediate
   neighbours can influence the overall structure of plant-pollinator
   interaction networks. Exploring the contribution of intraspecific
   variation to community interaction networks will improve our
   understanding of drivers of community-level ecological dynamics.},

Title = {Alterations in phytotoxicity and allelochemistry in response to
   intraspecific variation in Parthenium hysterophorus},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Allelopathy plays a crucial role in providing competitive advantage to
   several alien invasive species, and assists in their establishment
   beyond native boundaries. Role of allelopathy in the invasion success of
   the alien weed, Parthenium hysterophorus is well established; however,
   the ecological and evolutionary factors that could affect its
   allelopathic interactions are relatively unexplored. In our earlier
   findings, we suggested the presence of two morphotypes (P-A and P-B) in
   the population of P. hysterophorus, with variable morphology,
   physiology, and level of ecological impacts. Here, we hypothesize that
   phenotypically distinct morphotypes of P. hysterophorus may vary in
   their phytotoxicity and allelochemistry, thereby producing differential
   ecological impact. To test this hypothesis, effects of rhizospheric soil
   (RS) and plant amended soils (PAS) of the two morphotypes of P.
   hysterophorus (P-A and P-B) were studied on selected dicot (Bidens
   pilosa and Senna occidentalis) and monocot species (Phalaris minor and
   Avena fatua). Also, the composition of allelochemicals in P-A and P-B
   was assessed using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).
   The study revealed that the phytotoxic effect of P-B was greater than
   P-A in all the parameters measured for dicot species and in most of the
   parameters studied in monocot species. A generalized dose-dependent
   response was observed in the test species (PAS0 < PAS10 < PAS20 < PAS40)
   and the effect of RS was comparable to PAS20 and PAS40. A greater number
   of allelochemicals were reported from P-B, which is in accordance with
   the growth studies. The study concludes that intraspecific variations
   account for differential phytotoxicity and allelochemistry in P.
   hysterophorus.},

Title = {A predator-parasitoid mathematical model to describe the biological
   control of the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae), or tomato
   leafminer, is one of the most devastating pests of tomato crops in South
   America. The use of parasitoids and predators as biocontrol agents of
   this pest is an alternative to chemical insecticides and an
   environmentally safe strategy. However, an outcome of a three-way
   interspecific interaction (pest-parasitoid-predator) may bring
   surprises. The question is thus how a combination of enemies can
   contribute most effectively to reduction of the pest density. We examine
   this using an ordinary differential equations model. The formal and
   numerical analyses show that the joint use of both biological controls
   is the best option to decrease the tomato leafminer population, in
   contrast to the use of each biological control agent separately.
   Specifically, the numerical results show that in a scenario where the
   only biological control is given by the parasitoid, the introduction of
   the predator decreases the adult Tuta population by 28\%, reducing even
   more the damage caused in tomato crops compared to the use of parasitoid
   alone.},

   newly discovered peripheral populations are reported, and their habitats
   are characterized in detail. One of the new occurrences was monitored
   over a multiyear period, and changes in population and vegetation cover
   are described. Possible threats to the newest occurrences are
   identified. These results constitute the first reference on the status
   of B. campestre in Saskatchewan, which is important for the management
   and conservation of this rare plant species. Recommendations to protect

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate information on species identities and distributions is critical
   for informing state land use and conservation policies. However, it can
   often be difficult to determine species identity using morphological
   data alone. Using phylogenetic methods, we determined the identity of
   Sceloporus lizards occupying the Laramie Mountains of Wyoming, between
   known ranges for Sceloporus tristichus and Sceloporus consobrinus. The
   ND1 mitochondrial gene was sequenced for 10 individuals from the Laramie
   Mountains and analyzed using maximum likelihood with 23 other samples of
   S. tristichus and S. consobrinus from throughout their ranges. The mtDNA
   gene tree places the Laramie Mountains populations within a clade of
   Sceloporus consobrinus that includes the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.
   Given the prevalence of mtDNA introgression in Sceloporus, we also
   conducted phylogenetic analyses using 4 nuclear loci (RAG-1, R35, BDNF,
   and PNN) for a subset of samples. Species tree analysis of the nuclear
   data further verified that the Laramie Mountains population belongs to
   S. consobrinus. Given the very limited data available on the range,
   prevalence, and ecology of S. consobrinus in Wyoming, as well its
   designation as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Wyoming, more
   research must be done to ensure protection of this population.},

Title = {Socio-ecological contagion in Veganville},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement for 1.5 C global warming, per
   capita emissions need to come down to 2.9 tonnes by 2030. Food systems
   are known to be a significant source of an individual's carbon footprint
   and demand attention in sustainability management. The objective of this
   research is to conceptualise and define an intersection between
   contagion theory and socio-ecological systems models. This is achieved
   using a population dynamics model between two groups characterised by a
   distinct food regime: omnivores and vegans. The greenhouse gas emissions
   of each food regime is used to estimate the city's changing carbon
   foodprint as the food regimes shift by social contagion. Social
   contagion is identified as a catalyst for social tipping points, and
   emission pathways are explored with a variety of different contagion
   variables to test sensitivity towards a tipping point. The main finding
   is that the urban carbon foodprint can be reduced significantly with
   widespread adoption of veganism, but that the foodprint reaches a
   minimum at 1.97 tonnes CO2-equivalent per capita. This demonstrates the
   need to embed food demand in urban climate governance such as nudging
   towards plant-based food alternatives. Nudging is discussed as a lever
   of ecological importance to social contagion. Lastly, socio-ecological
   contagion is defined as the interactions between social contagion and
   damage done to ecological systems to measure peer-to-peer spread of
   environmental stewardship agendas, such as the journey to Veganville.},

Title = {Modelling Cultural Hereditary Transmission: Insight Through Optimal
   Control},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cultural hereditary transmission is indeed very important for the
   recognition of human personalities and countries are seeking to
   integrate them into their school curriculum. A deterministic
   mathematical model for human behavior transmission is extracted and
   built into the present study. The fundamental characteristics of the
   model are well established and the reproduction number is evaluated. The
   stability analysis indicates that the model is undergoing a backward
   bifurcation phenomenon. Time dependent control is also introduced into
   the model and Pontryagin's Maximum is employed to characterise the best
   strategy to spread cultural heredity. The numerical simulation findings
   are also provided and indicate that the best approach for improving
   cultural heritage in a society is to explore all three control methods
   at the same time.},

Title = {Whooping Crane (Grus americana) family consumes a diversity of aquatic
   vertebrates during fall migration stopover at the Platte River, Nebraska},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aransas-Wood Buffalo population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana)
   migrates approximately 4000 km through the central Great Plains
   biannually, between their breeding and wintering grounds. Whooping
   Cranes depend on stopover sites to provide secure resting locations and
   the caloric resources necessary to complete their migration, such as the
   USFWS-designated critical habitat area in the Central Platte River
   Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska. This area includes braided river habitat
   characterized by low-elevation and submerged sandbars, which provide
   impor-tant roosting and foraging opportunities for migrating Whooping
   Cranes. We used long-range photography, videography, and behavioral scan
   sampling to document forage items consumed by Whooping Cranes during an
   11-day stopover in this area during the fall of 2019. We identified 3
   adult-plumage Whooping Cranes and 1 colt consuming 16 individual
   vertebrates of at least 6 different species during the stopover. In
   total, we documented Whooping Cranes consuming 7 Channel Catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus), 5 ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), 1 sunfish
   (Centrarchidae), 1 carp/minnow rela-tive (Cypriniformes), 1 perch
   relative (Percidae), and 1 Leopard Frog relative (Lithobates sp.). We
   estimated prey item lengths using the average exposed culmen
   measurements for adult Whooping Cranes and approximated their
   nutritional value using log-transformed length-weight regression
   equations with taxon-specific intercepts and slopes from sec-ondary data
   sources. We estimated that aquatic vertebrate forage made up a
   significant portion of Whooping Crane daily energy requirements and
   provided substantial amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and protein not
   present at high levels in waste grains also consumed during migration.
   Additionally, we documented territorial behavior by adult Whooping
   Cranes during migration and evidence of adults teaching their colt to
   forage. Our study demonstrates the utility of photography and
   videography to natural history research and indicates that aquatic
   vertebrates may be a relatively regular part of Whooping Crane diet in
   the CPRV.},

Title = {Interactions between changes in land cover and potential of ecosystem
   services in Lithuania at temporal and spatial scale},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The growing interest in ecosystem services is mainly related to land use
   changes. The aim of the study is to analyse spatial-temporal changes in
   the capacity to supply of ES in Lithuania based on land use changes in
   1990-2018. The results show some balance between loss and gains of
   ecosystem services capacity due to land use changes. Decrease in
   heterogenous agricultural areas had negative impact on provision of
   ecosystem integrity and services. Considerable increase in scrubland and
   herbaceous vegetation areas significantly increased the ecosystem
   service potential. The conversion of former agricultural land to less
   intensively managed ecosystems enhance the potential of valuable
   habitats for biodiversity and ecosystem services associated with natural
   grasslands, moors and heathland, transitional woodland shrubs. The
   urbanization process along with increase in urban fabric areas had
   little effect on ESs potential since artificial vegetated areas had
   compensated the loss of ESs due to increased areas of urbanized
   ecosystems. Despite the area of open spaces slightly increased, this led
   to decrease of provision of ESs. Temporal changes in overall ESs
   capacity indicated an increase in Lithuania over the last two decades.
   Given the observed dynamic context of land cover, the structure of
   ecosystem services may face potential threats from land use change due
   to urban development and agricultural activities.},

Title = {Fish genomes and their evolution under the influence of ecology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Environmental interactions and the effects of such interactions on the
   evolution of genome attributes is an intriguing area of ongoing
   research. Several earlier studies have delved into how the genome size
   (GS) and the guanine-cytosine content (GC) of genomes are shaped by
   species' ecology while largely disregarding other genome attributes,
   such as number of chromosomes (CR), number of genes (GE), and protein
   count (PC) from such comparisons. The present study was designed at
   understanding the influence of ecology-climate, habitat, and depth-on
   genome attributes by using the most current data on 579 whole fish
   genomes available at NCBI. Given the diverse and intricate roles of GS
   and GC in species adaptations to temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic
   pressure, the focus was on finding if and how the genomes responded to
   these stressors and if any common patterns existed in the genome-level
   responses. Our analyses exhibited some significant and intriguing trends
   for fishes as a whole while indicating strong effects of ecology on GS,
   GC, CR, and PC. Also, some very unique trends were observed on
   regressing GS and GC values across temperature, salinity, and depth
   clines. Accordingly, a very strong decline in the GS and a concomitant
   increase in GC were observed in species through the tropics/sub tropics
   to the temperate/poles, from freshwater to the marine habitats, and from
   the pelagic to bathydemersal depths. Observed patterns strongly support
   the notion that smaller GS and larger GC are associated with species
   inhabiting more stable environments and vice versa. The results also
   signify the effect of these patterns on protein flexibility and its role
   in tolerating stressful conditions. Observed patterns are discussed in
   the light of latitudinal biodiversity gradient, habitat complexity, and
   energy and metabolic expenditure hypothesis.},

Title = {Susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model with virus mutation in a
   variable population size},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The complex dynamics of a contagious disease in which populations
   experience horizontal and vertical transmissions, size variation, and
   virus mutations are of considerable practical and theoretical interest.
   We model such a system by dividing a population into three distinct
   groups: susceptibles (S), C-infected (C) and F-infected (F), based on
   the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model. Once the individuals
   in the C-infected group recover from the disease, they gain no permanent
   immunity. The virus can mutate in the group C. When it does, the
   individuals become members of the F-infected group. The mutated virus
   causes a lethal and incurable disease with a high mortality rate. We
   discuss the model for two cases. For the first case, all the newborns
   from infected mothers develop the disease shortly after their birth. For
   the second case, there exist equal transmission rates and the C-infected
   population is lifelong infectious. Our analysis shows that both systems
   have positive solutions, and the first model possesses four equilibrium
   points, the trivial one (extinction of the species), C-free equilibrium
   (extinction of the ancestor virus) and two endemic equilibria of
   different properties. We identify the net population growth rates of the
   susceptible and C-infected groups for the existence of the equilibria of
   the first model. We define the conditions of parameters for which
   species extinction and endemic equilibria are locally asymptotically
   stable. We observe that bifurcation occurs at the C-free equilibrium.
   For the second model, we find that there is only one endemic equilibrium
   and it is always locally asymptotically stable. We also determine the
   region for the net population growth rates of the susceptible and
   F-infected groups for the existence of the endemic equilibrium.},

Title = {Is landscape fragmentation always detrimental for species conservation?
   The case of the Iberian lynx in central Spain},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The patch-corridor-matrix is the most commonly used model when dealing
   with landscape characterization studies, but it shows relevant
   limitations to detect landscape heterogeneity. Other authors have used a
   functional approach, since it is well known that nutrient, mineral and
   energy flows exist among ecosystems. These flows can be perceived in
   boundaries between different landcovers, making possible the
   identification of spatial units sharing a common pattern of ecological
   interactions known as mosaics. While the influence of each mosaic over a
   certain species has been previously addressed, no attention has been
   given to the intra-mosaic variation. The aim of this research is to
   assess the influence of functional diversity and connectivity, on the
   habitat suitability of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). For this, we
   built two GLMs to test if these features show a differential effect on
   lynxes' habitat suitability depending on the mosaic. Both GLMs built
   show that the influence of these landscape features on lynxes' habitat
   suitability depends on the landscape spatial organization and landcover
   composition, suggesting that there is no unique response of a species to
   changes in landscape diversity and/or connectivity. Thus, we conclude
   that considering both landscape and species features would allow to a
   better integration of land management strategies and conservation
   actions, which could favor species adaptation to highly human-modified
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Understanding how the preservation process affects fish morphology is
   important for studies that use museum collections as voucher specimens.
   Sixty-nine Rio Grande silvery minnows (standard length {[}SL]
   32.14-81.65 mm) were observed over 545 days during a
   formalin-to-water-to-ethanol preservation procedure. Median standard
   length decreased by the end of each preservation step; specimens shrank
   1.06 mm in formalin solution, 1.97 mm in 35\% ethanol, 2.17 mm in 50\%
   ethanol, and 2.48 mm in 70\% ethanol. Peak shrinkage occurred at 365 d,
   with a median decrease of 3.86 mm (SL 29.57-75.98 mm). After 545 days,
   Rio Grande silvery minnows began to increase in length, exhibiting a
   median shrinkage of 2.04 mm from live length. Research on museum
   specimens that includes morphological measurements should consider that
   changes in length or body shape may influence or hinder the ability to
   detect changes in morphology over time.},

Title = {Good predictors for the fixation probability on complex networks of
   multi-player games using territorial interactions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In 2012 Broom and Rychtar developed a new framework to consider the
   evolution of a population over a non-homogeneous underlying structure,
   where fitness depends upon multiplayer interactions amongst the
   individuals within the population played in groups of various sizes
   (including one). This included the independent model, and as a special
   case the territorial raider model, which has been considered in a series
   of subsequent papers. Here individuals are based upon the vertex of a
   graph but move to interact with their neighbours, sometimes meeting in
   large groups. The most important single property of such populations is
   the fixation probability, the probability of a single mutant completely
   replacing the existing population. In a recent paper we considered the
   fixation probability for the Birth Death Birth (BDB) dynamics for three
   games, a Public Goods game, the Hawk-Dove game and for fixed fitnesses
   for a large number of randomly generated graphs, in particular seeing if
   important underlying graph properties could be used as predictors. We
   found two good predictors, temperature and mean group size, but some
   interesting and unusual features for one type of graph, Barabasi-Albert
   graphs. In this paper we use a regression analysis to investigate (the
   usual) three alternative evolutionary dynamics (BDD, DBB, DBD) in
   addition to the original BDB. In particular, we find that the dynamics
   split into two pairs, BDB/DBD and BDD/DBB, each of which give
   essentially the same results and found a good fit to the data using a
   quadratic regression involving the above two variables. Further we find
   that temperature is the most important predictor for the Hawk-Dove game,
   whilst for the Public Goods game the group size also plays a key role,
   and is more important than the temperature for the BDD/DBB dynamics.},

Title = {Role of hydrological parameters in the uncertainty in modeled soil
   organic carbon using a coupled water-carbon cycle model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil organic carbon is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial
   biosphere. Large uncertainties exist in the numerical simulations of
   soil organic carbon due to inaccuracies in their mathematical
   descriptions of hydrological processes. In this study, the upper limit
   of uncertainty in modeled soil organic carbon that is induced by
   hydrological parameter errors, which may stem from measurement or
   experiential errors, is estimated in China under four different arid and
   humid conditions. The study was conducted using a conditional nonlinear
   optimal perturbation related to parameters (CNOP-P) approach and a model
   of the coupled water-carbon cycle (the Lund Potsdam-Jena Wetland
   Hydrology and Methane Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJ-WHyMe).
   Uncertainties in hydrological processes resulted in the largest error
   (2.73 kg C m(-2) yr(-1), 20.2\%) in the modeled soil organic carbon in
   the arid and semiarid regions of northern China, with errors of 1.20 kg
   C m(-2) yr(-1) (6.1\%) in northeastern China, 0.45 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)
   (3.3\%) in southern China, and -1.71 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) (13.7\%) in the
   semihumid region of northern China. By analyzing the three components of
   soil organic carbon, the fast soil carbon pool was found to be the main
   cause of the uncertainties in modeled soil organic carbon in the four
   regions of China. Moreover, belowground litter was another cause of the
   uncertainties in the modeled soil organic carbon in northeastern China
   and in the semihumid region of northern China. Additional results
   indicated that the simulation and prediction abilities of soil organic
   carbon could be improved by reducing parameter errors in hydrological
   processes through observations or targeted observations. The parameter
   sensitivity test showed that the benefits to modeling soil organic
   carbon were similar when reducing the errors in the sensitive
   hydrological parameter subset, compared to the benefits of reducing the
   errors in all the hydrological parameters.},

Abstract = {We present the Late Pleistocene extinct shrub-ox, Euceratherium collinum
   (Bovidae), dung pellets recovered from Pontatoc Ridge Shelter, a dry
   alcove in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona. The shelter
   is at the current upper edge of the ArizonaUpland subdivision (the
   highest and coldest part) of the Sonoran Desert. Packrat (Neotoma)
   middens with macrobotanical fossils and a floor deposit consisting of
   midden debris and dung pellets were sampled and are described here. Six
   packrat middens radiocarbon date to 15,690-22,874 cal yr B.P.
   (calibrated years before present); dung pellets from the floor deposit
   date to 14,990 cal yr B.P. Macrobotanical fossils primarily from the
   middens but also from the floor deposit indicate that a woodland
   composed of Arizona cypress (Hesperocyparis {[}Cupressus] arizonica),
   Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a
   hybrid singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla var. fallax), border
   pinyon (Pinus discolor), juniper (Juniperus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos
   pungens), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) grew outside the
   shelter. Dung pellets were measured, compared with other extant and
   extinct species, and sampled for phytoliths and pollen. Based on size,
   morphology, DNA, and physiographic setting (cliff face), our assumption
   is that only a single taxon of slickrockclimbing ruminant used the
   small, extremely inaccessible Pontatoc Ridge Shelter and that all large
   pellets belong to the extinct shrub-ox. The distribution of Late
   Pleistocene shrub-ox is reviewed; the stocky, rather short ruminant is
   recovered mainly in mountainous and canyon-county terrains of western
   United States and northern Mexico.},

Title = {Net ecosystem exchange comparative analysis of the relative influence of
   recorded variables in well monitored ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Weekly averaged datasets from fourteen AmeriFlux ecosystem monitoring
   sites spread across the Americas, processed to the FLUXNET2015 standard,
   are statistically evaluated to characterize their seasonal net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) trends. The sites cover wetland, cropland, woodland,
   grassland and tundra ecosystems. Up to twenty measured variables from
   the sites are variously correlated with NEE. A comparison of Pearson and
   Spearman correlation coefficients reveals that the variables are
   behaving parametrically with respect to NEE for the wetland, woodland
   (two out of three sites) and tundra locations, but non-parametrically
   for cropland and grassland sites. Multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis
   also distinguishes those ecosystems. MLR predicted versus calculated NEE
   follow Y asymptotic to X relationships for the wetland and tundra sites,
   whereas for the other ecosystems the MLR results follow Y
   \&NOTEQUexpressionL; X trends. Moreover, the coefficient values of the
   MLR optimum solutions for each ecosystem reveal quite distinct relative
   influences of the measured variables on the NEE predicted values. These
   results imply that NEE at wetland and tundra sites can be relatively
   easily predicted from the FLUXNET2015 set of recorded variables. On the
   other hand, the other three types of ecosystem sites cannot be easily
   predicted from those variables, implying that other factors
   substantially influence NEE at those sites.},

Abstract = {Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) plays a vital role in colonizing newly
   disturbed areas, providing shade for other tree species to germinate,
   and supplying food for a variety of birds and mammals, such as Clark's
   Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos
   horribilis). Decline of whitebark pine populations has been attributed
   to several factors, including white pine blister rust (Cronartium
   ribicola), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, and
   fire exclusion. In 2009, the U.S. Forest Service began to install
   permanent plots in whitebark pine stands in Washington and Oregon as
   part of a Pacific Northwest restoration strategy to track blister rust
   and mountain pine beetle mortality. Forest Service crews conducted
   surveys on these plots that included standard tree inventory
   measurements and assessments of blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and
   fire activity. During summer 2020/2021, we remeasured 12 of these plots
   located in 3 areas of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (Mission
   Ridge, Clover Springs, and Lake Ann) and 1 area within the Ahtanum State
   Forest (Darland Mountain). On average, 15\% of trees were newly infected
   by blister rust, 5\% of trees died from blister rust, and 12.6\% died
   from all causes combined in the 11-12 years between surveys. Despite
   this, the density of live whitebark pine trees experienced a
   nonsignificant increase due to regeneration, while the density of
   whitebark pine snags increased significantly and the density of
   whitebark pine seedlings decreased significantly. The percentages of
   trees with blister rust infection, seedlings with blister rust
   infection, and live trees with mountain pine beetle damage were
   heterogeneous over space and time. Our results help quantify parameters
   that are central to understanding the population dynamics of whitebark
   pine in the Pacific Northwest and informing management decisions, but
   the findings should be interpreted in light of the limited sample size
   and spatial extent of our data. Regular monitoring of a wider array of
   permanent whitebark pine plots will be critical to management of this
   tree species.},

Title = {VARIATION IN THE DIET OF GREATER ROADRUNNERS (GEOCOCCYX CALIFORNIANUS)
   IN A MESQUITE-THORNSCRUB ECOSYSTEM},

Abstract = {Greater roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) are conspicuous and
   well-recognized members of the southwestern fauna. Conventional wisdom
   suggests that roadrunners prey heavily upon vertebrates, particularly
   lizards and snakes, but detailed studies are lacking. We investigated
   roadrunner diet at a site in southern Texas inhabited by four
   state-threatened reptiles to better characterize seasonal variation in
   diet and speculate on the relative impact of these predators on
   state-threatened species. We examined gizzards from 144 greater
   roadrunners collected across four seasons (Summer 1997, Spring 1998,
   Summer 1998, Winter 2002) and enumerated the number of food items for
   each taxa identified. We compared dietary richness, diversity, evenness,
   number of food items, and similarity among the four seasons. We also
   evaluated the relationship between roadrunner body size and diet, and we
   estimated annual consumption rates for each taxa found in the diet.
   Roadrunner diet was rich and highly variable, but 95.9\% of 6,834
   identifiable food items were invertebrates. Overall, grasshoppers and
   beetles dominated all samples. Total number of food items consumed,
   particularly weevils, birds, and fruit, increased during the winter
   sampling period. There was a significant, but weakly predictive, inverse
   relationship between wing chord length and dietary richness. Our
   calculations suggested the average roadrunner would minimally consume
   34,639 prey items per year on this site. Snake consumption was less
   common than the popular perception of greater roadrunners would suggest.
   The consumption of vertebrates seemed to coincide with general abundance
   or when weather patterns decreased abundance of invertebrates.
   Consumption of two state-threatened species (Texas horned lizard
   {[}Phrynosoma cornutum] and Texas indigo snake {[}Drymarchon melanurus])
   occurred, but not at a level to suggest that greater roadrunners
   negatively impacted populations of these species. Thus, the diet of this
   species appears to be driven by availability, and greater roadrunners
   act as exceptional generalist omnivores.},

Title = {``Perchance to dream?{''}: Assessing the effects of dispersal strategies
   on the fitness of expanding populations},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Unraveling the patterns of animals' movements is crucial to
   understanding the basics of biogeography, tracking range shifts
   resulting from climate change, and predicting and preventing biological
   invasions. Many researchers have modeled animals' dispersal under the
   assumptions of various movement strategies, either predetermined or
   directed by external factors, but none have compared the effects of
   different movement strategies on population survival and fitness. In
   this paper, using an agent-based model with a landscape divided into
   cells of varying quality, we compare the ecological success of three
   movement and habitat selection strategies (MHSSs): (i) Smart, in which
   animals choose the locally optimal cell; (ii) Random, in which animals
   move randomly between cells without taking into account their quality;
   (iii) Dreamer, in which animals attempt to find a habitat of dream whose
   quality is much higher than that of the habitat available on the map. We
   compare the short-term success of these MHSSs in good, medium and bad
   environments. We also assess the effect of temporal variation of habitat
   quality (specifically, winter harshness) on the success of each MHSS.
   Success is measured in terms of survival rate, dispersal distance,
   accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most general
   conclusion is that while survival rate, accumulated energy and quality
   of settled habitat are affected primarily by overall habitat composition
   (proportions of different habitat types in the landscape), dispersal
   distance depends mainly on the MHSS. In medium and good environments,
   the Dreamer strategy is highly successful: it simultaneously outperforms
   the Smart strategy in dispersal distance and the Random strategy in
   terms of the other metrics.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Submerged aquatic macrophytes (SAMs) have been studied extensively in
   lotic ecosystems at low elevations, but few studies have been conducted
   in high-elevation systems, and factors controlling SAM distribution at
   high elevation are not well understood. After anecdotal and published
   documentation of abundant SAMs in high-elevation streams in the Jemez
   Mountains, northern New Mexico, USA, we wanted to determine what
   combination of physical factors are controlling the presence or absence
   of SAMs in the Jemez River watershed. We surveyed several sites on the
   three major river systems in the watershed along a gradient of elevation
   for physical factors, presence-absence, and percent cover of each taxa.
   Our results showed that SAMs were observed in 60\% of surveyed sites
   that were associated with deeper, narrower, lower-velocity streams with
   low gradients. This evidence suggests that SAMs at high elevations are
   subject to similar abiotic controls found for SAM presence at lower
   elevations.},

Abstract = {Numerous species of long-distance, Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds
   use Venezuela as a nonbreeding or migratory stopover site. We examined
   band recovery data (recaptures or dead-recoveries) in Venezuela from
   1926 to 2017. The band recovery data included 1,891 individual birds,
   representing 42 species from 17 families. Banding countries or islands
   of origin included Argentina, French Guiana, Aruba, Barbuda, the United
   States (U.S.) Virgin Islands, Trinidad, the continental United States,
   and Canada. Blue-winged teal (Spatula discors; 1,432 of 1,891 total
   recoveries, 75.7\%), royal tern (Thalasseus maximus; 117/1,891, 6.2\%),
   osprey (Pandion haliaetus; 93/1,891, 4.9\%), common tern (Sterna
   hirundo; 88/1,891, 4.7\%), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus;
   27/1,891, 1.4\%) were the most common banded birds in our assessment.
   Despite ongoing banding efforts, other bird species banded in Venezuela
   have not been recovered or recaptured in the Western Hemisphere. Despite
   significant social and political challenges that impede scientific
   research in Venezuela, the bird-banding community in Venezuela is
   growing, and this growth will likely facilitate our understanding of the
   annual cycle of numerous avifauna.},

Title = {A suite of ecological indicators for evaluating the integrity of
   structural eco-complexity in Mexican forests},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing forest
   complexity as the combination of the variety of species and key
   structures that are associated with the composition, structure, and
   function of forest stands. Several spatial indicators have been
   developed to characterize the biodiversity, the structural complexity,
   and anthropogenic effects that can be observed in Mexican forests. By
   integrating several stand complexity attributes, the forest condition
   can be characterized as a function of species composition, stand
   structural attributes, and forest development. In addition, indicators
   of anthropogenic effects were also analyzed to identify their influence
   on forest eco-complexity, and therefore, on the current condition of
   forests. The results of applying this con-ceptual framework showed that
   Mexican forest are ecologically complex, with varying levels of
   anthropogenic impacts that modify the structural forest characteristics,
   particularly in tropical forests. The main factor explaining the current
   eco-complexity condition in tropical forests was associated with early
   stages of forest development, due to ecological degradation, and showed
   a generalized loss of attributes, particularly for stand complexity and
   stand development. In contrast, temperate forests exhibited better
   eco-complexity conditions, especially for those attributes that define
   forest stand occupancy and development. Mining activities, forest
   extraction as selective harvesting, forest fires, land use change, and
   road openings are critical human activities that directly affect forest
   structure and, ultimately, modify forest eco-complexity and integrity.
   This eco-complexity index derived for Mexican forests can be used to
   integrate measures of forest structure and func-tioning, and thereby
   better inform decision making and policy development.},

Abstract = {In ecological systems, multiple interactions connect various kinds of
   components. Strong and weak as well as positive and negative effects
   cause complex dynamics and often quite unpredictable processes. Human
   impact is added to this complexity, with all of its diverse effects. In
   this paper, we present a case study on the Kelian river ecosystem
   (Borneo), connecting pristine habitats upstream, a gold mine close to
   the middle section and human settlements downstream. For six locations,
   separate food web models had been developed earlier. Here we first
   analyze the ecological system by loop analysis and compare its outcome
   for different sites. Second, we identify the most crucial human impacts
   and implement these in modified loop analysis models. We determine the
   sign of various effects and study the consistency of human impact on
   different sites and various organisms. Adding human impact to the models
   (1) increased the ratio of clear predictions, (2) caused the appearance
   of ``zero `` predictions in three sites and (3) reduced the variability
   of predictability along the river.},

   from the western United States, naturally display eccentric stem growth.
   The purpose of this study was to quantitatively document stem
   eccentricity for these 2 species. Stem segments were obtained from 3
   different plants of each species at locations in central Utah. Each stem
   was sawed into 8-mm sections and photographed for analysis. Every stem
   section was then marked at a 36 degrees interval to produce 10
   wedge-shaped sectors. The areas of each sector were determined and
   analyzed. Stem segment areas were about 40, 60, and 100 mm(2) for stem
   diameters of 6, 8, and 11 mm, respectively, for both species.
   Consecutive 8-mm segments were compared at 6 and 11 mm for both species.
   Absolute differences between paired segments ranged between 0.0 and
   12.0. On average, 43\% of all pairs had absolute differences above 0.40.
   These results suggest marked differences between consecutive segments.
   The eccentric growth percentages were also the same for both species.
   Mean eccentric percentages for 6-mm-diameter segments were 43.4\% and
   49.6\% for the 2 species. Moreover, 11-mm-diameter segments of P.
   tridentata and P. stansburyana had mean eccentric percentages of 36.4\%
   and 34.0\%, respectively. Overall, 81\% of all stem segments showed
   eccentricity. Many long-lived desert shrubs of the western United States
   exhibit a wide range of wood anomalies. These wood anomalies may be
   endemic in these species.},

Abstract = {The biology of Alniphagus aspericollis (LeConte) was studied in thinleaf
   alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) in northern Idaho. Infested alders were
   mature and dying from infection by a white rot fungus, Phellinus
   igniarius (L.) Quel. The beetle is monogamous and has one generation per
   year, with broods overlapping in developmental stages throughout summer.
   Alniphagus aspercollis individuals passed winter as larvae and sexually
   immature brood adults, some of which overwintered in short hibernation
   galleries. Beetles emerged in May to create a new generation. Egg
   galleries were short, with closely spaced, elongate larval mines. Larvae
   passed through 4 instars before pupating. New records of insect
   predators and commensals associated with A. aspericollis are presented.
   Features of the smaller Alniphagus hirsutus Schedl in Alnus sinuata
   (Regel) Rydb. from earlier Idaho collections are compared to A.
   aspericollis, and the published listing of A. tenuifolia as a host of A.
   hirsutus is questioned.},

Abstract = {The Chihuahuan Desert swamps are a hotspot for imperiled organisms
   including freshwater springsnails and bacteria. Many of these taxa are
   endemic to the desert and to the individual waterbodies where they
   occur. Efforts to conserve diversity in these threatened areas must
   account for the life history of the organisms, but also interactions
   between organisms including microbes. We documented the microbial
   assemblage associated with Tryonia metcalfi, a critically imperiled
   freshwater snail endemic to a cienega system in western Texas. We
   identified 14 bacterial families in our snail samples and determined a
   core assemblage of 19 bacterial taxa (4 of which represented novel
   lineages) that are likely dependent on the snail. Future conservation
   efforts involving T. metcalfi and its environment should therefore
   consider the microbial diversity associated with both the snail and the
   cienegas.},

Abstract = {Andromonoecy, a sexual system in which individuals have both bisexual
   and male flowers, is rare in angiosperms as a whole, but fairly common
   in Cleomaceae. We conducted greenhouse experiments on how fruit
   maturation and self- vs. cross-fertilization affect male flower
   production in Polanisia dodecandra (L.) DC. subsp. riograndensis. When
   we prevented fruit maturation, plants produced only bisexual flowers,
   but when we allowed fruit maturation, plants produced alternating zones
   of bisexual and male flowers. This is the first documentation of
   andromonoecy in P. dodecandra subsp. riograndensis. Our results support
   the resource limitation hypothesis for the origin and maintenance of
   andromonoecy, but not the alternative dichogamy and architectural
   effects hypotheses. Polanisia dodecandra subsp. riograndensis has a
   mixed mating system. Selfpollination did not result in slower
   transitions from bisexual to male flowers, but for the initial zone of
   bisexual flowers, selfed fruits weighed less than crossed fruits.
   Andromonoecy is likely widespread in North American cleomids, and we
   urge field botanists to be mindful of floral sex when observing and
   collecting.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of climatic habitat suitable for biomes of
   the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, under the contemporary climate
   (1961-1990) and projected to the decade centered on the year 2030. This
   was achieved through previous modeling of the climatic habitat using
   random forest of the program R and six different climatic model
   scenarios. By the year 2030, there will be a reduction in the area
   occupied by a climatic habitat suitable for temperate biomes: conifer
   forests (-100\% change relative to the area currently occupied), San
   Lucas pine-oak woodland (-100\%), and Madrean-Transvolcanic pine-oak
   woodland (-34\%). In contrast, climatic habitats suitable for dry biomes
   will expand and some will appear that do not currently exist in
   Tamaulipas, such as the Sinaloa-Guerrero thornscrub (+38\% of the state
   area occupied). In the area occupied by the Biosphere Reserve ``El
   Cielo,'' suitable climatic habitat will diminish for the Gulf Coast
   thornscrub (-100\%), tropical semievergreen forest (-100\%), and cloud
   forest (-99\%); however, suitable climatic habitat will increase inside
   that Reserve for the biomes chaparral (+1,703\%) and
   MadreanTransvolcanic pine-oak woodland (+33\%). In addition, habitat
   suitable for the dry deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (+22\% of
   the area of the Reserve, previously nonexistent). For the Biosphere
   Reserve ``Sierra de Tamaulipas,'' suitable climatic habitat will be lost
   mainly for the biomes chaparral (-92\%) and MadreanTransvolcanic
   pine-oak woodland (-89\%). However, habitat suitable to the dry
   deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (66\% of the area of the
   Reserve, which does not currently exist). Modification of the climatic
   habitat could imply serious challenges for the conservation and
   management of contemporary vegetation and may provide evidence that the
   in situ measures of conservation in place for these biome types in the
   state are insufficient, even within the Biosphere Reserves.},

Abstract = {An accumulation of Pleistocene owl pellets (strigilites) containing 30
   arvicoline rodent teeth was found at the Little Dell Dam fossil site
   outside of Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah, in 1992. The
   accumulation was recovered in a single block of matrix with partially
   exposed teeth. We used high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) to
   segment, digitally prepare, and describe teeth belonging to Allophaiomys
   pliocaenicus, Mictomys kansasensis, or Mictomys meltoni, and a
   previously recognized but unnamed morphotype of Phenacomys. Digital
   preparation revealed 10 associated upper or lower dentitions of those
   taxa. A reinterpretation of the age of the site (similar to 150 thousand
   years ago) using arvicoline rodent biochronology was made based on
   recent research at Cathedral Cave, Nevada. The new estimate is a much
   younger age for the Little Dell Dam fauna from Locality 2 than was
   previously reported.},

   ability between subadults and adults. Differences by month probably
   reflect differences in availability of food items. Differences by year
   may be related to differences in annual precipitation, although no such
   relationship was observed in this study. Crop contents also differed
   significantly by time of day collected, but this likely reflects

Title = {EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE HISTORY ON CURRENT GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF FOUR
   SPECIES OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS IN KANSAS},
Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-165},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Distributions of species are frequently treated as responding to current
   environmental conditions across areas that have been accessible to them.
   Although that paradigm has been quite successful in describing
   distributional areas, the effects of land use history have been
   neglected in most studies to date. In this study, we analyzed effects of
   historical land use (i.e., 1850s to present) on distributions of four
   reptile and amphibian species in eastern Kansas. We fit typical species
   distribution models using a broad diversity of descriptors of landscape
   and environmental conditions, and detailed model selection exercises in
   all cases identified a combination of current land use and topographic
   features as the best defining dimensions for species' distributions.
   However, within the areas identified as suitable in these modeling
   exercises, known occurrences of each species were concentrated in areas
   that had been forested in the 1850s, and that remain forested. That is,
   although current land use was crucial, land use history was an important
   modifier, such that distributional ecology must look to more than just
   current environmental conditions in efforts to characterize species'
   geographic distributions comprehensively.},

Abstract = {Extensive efforts to reduce the population of invasive channel catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus) in the San Juan River, USA, have increased the
   relative abundance of juveniles, with little understanding about
   potential trophic interactions between these juveniles and native
   fishes. Gut contents of juvenile (<250 mm total length) and adult (>=
   300 mm) channel catfish in the San Juan River were collected in the
   summer and fall of 2018 and 2019 to quantify ontogenetic change in diet.
   Juveniles primarily consumed aquatic insects and terrestrial plants,
   whereas adults primarily consumed fewer aquatic insects and
   significantly more plants and fish. Logistic regression confirmed these
   diet shifts as a function of total length and suggest the nature of
   interactions between channel catfish and native fishes can change with
   life stage: from potential competitor for aquatic invertebrates, to
   competitor and predator.},

Abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are aesthetically and
   economically important to landowners in Texas. Winter diets are heavily
   dependent upon browse species because of a decrease in herbaceous
   production during periodic winter droughts. Our objective was to
   determine the influence of winter progression on nitrogen and fiber
   concentration as well as in vitro organic matter disappearance (using
   white-tailed deer rumen inoculum) of six browse species of moderate to
   high dietary importance to whitetailed deer in north-central Texas. We
   also measured protein-precipitable phenolic concentrations because of
   their potential influence on digestion kinetics. We collected leaf and
   stem tips during prefrost, midwinter, and late-winter periods from four
   properties in the Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas over 2 years.
   Browse nutritive value differed between years and there was an
   interaction between species and period for all nutritive values.
   Nitrogen and in vitro true digestibility decreased with winter
   progression, as browse nutritional value decreased rapidly after the
   first freeze when most species shed leaves. Protein-precipitable
   phenolics demonstrated species-by-year and species-by-period
   interactions. The decrease in nitrogen and increase of fibrous
   constituents, in combination with the presence of biologically active
   tannins, considerably reduced digestibility during late winter. These
   results indicate a need for vegetational species diversity to meet
   whitetailed deer nutritional requirements during the fall and winter.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to preliminarily examine the breadth of
   microbial diversity on the pill bug (Armadillidium vulgare) exoskeleton.
   To address this question, we collected pill bugs at four time points
   (approximately 3 months apart) and analyzed their external microbiotas.
   Preliminary results suggest that each time point contained a unique
   microbiome, suggesting a rapid turnover of the exoskeletal microbiota.
   In total, we recovered 15 unique isolates, which we resolved into three
   phyla and nine families. There were only three instances in which we
   recovered a single isolate from multiple time points, and we recovered
   only a single isolate from all four time points. Among the phyla
   identified, sequence divergence ranged from a minimum of 6.2\% (among
   isolates recognized within the Actinobacteria) to a maximum of similar
   to 34\% (between isolates recognized within the Actinobacteria vs.
   b-proteobacteria). Overall, the results of this study suggest that in
   order to gain a complete understanding of the exoskeletal microbiota of
   pill bugs, and perhaps other arthropods, researchers must examine a
   temporal scale.},

Title = {BREEDING ECOLOGY OF A COLUMBID COMMUNITY OCCURRING IN SOUTH TEXAS WITH
   FOCUS ON EURASIAN COLLARED-DOVES (STREPTOPELIA DECAOCTO)},
Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},

Abstract = {The Eurasian collared-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) has expanded its
   range into South Texas, bringing it into contact with native columbid
   species. We studied urban columbid breeding ecology at three study
   sites, representing five South Texas towns, in 2006 and 2007. Columbids
   began nesting in April and peaked in late spring, followed by a
   secondary nesting peak. A positive relationship occurred between nesting
   vegetation type and mean nest density of each columbid species but was
   inconsistent within and among study sites. Eurasian collared-doves also
   utilized human-constructed structures for nesting sites. Columbids were
   nonselective in choosing nest placement within trees except for Eurasian
   collared-doves nesting in Rio Grande ash (Fraxinus berlanderiana).
   White-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) and Eurasian collared-doves tended
   to nest higher in trees than mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) or Inca
   doves (Columbina inca) where all four species co-occurred. Eurasian
   collared-dove, Inca dove, mourning dove, and white-winged dove
   productivity was 1.3 6 0.1 (SE) fledged young/nest, 1.3 6 0.2, 0.9 6
   0.1, and 1.1 6 <0.1, respectively. Overall, urban nesting columbids used
   a generalist habitat and nest site association strategy, which negated
   interspecific competition for available nest sites. We provide some of
   the first information on nesting ecology and productivity of the
   Eurasian collared-dove associated with native columbid species within
   North America.},

Abstract = {Buffelgrass ( Cenchrus ciliaris, syn. Pennisetum ciliare) is exotic to
   the Sonoran Desert and has caused drastic changes in this ecosystem.
   Yet, little research has documented the impact of buffelgrass on
   wildlife in the region, including small mammals. The objective of this
   study was to estimate abundance of native nocturnal rodents and
   characterize habitat structure in an area with native vegetation and
   buffelgrass prairies to assess the effect of this exotic grass on the
   diversity and population density of this community in the Sonoran
   Desert, located in the municipality of La Colorada, in central Sonora,
   Mexico. We trapped nocturnal rodents in a buffelgrass prairie site and
   in a site with native vegetation (with two trapping plots at each site),
   before and during the summer rainy season, and observed the differences
   in species composition between sites. We used capture-mark-recapture and
   distance sampling models to estimate population density of the two most
   common species, Dipodomys merriami and Chaetodipus penicillatus. Despite
   differences in habitat structural diversity between buffelgrass prairies
   and native vegetation, our results suggest that buffelgrass does not
   seem to affect dominance or population density of these two heteromyids,
   whereas evenness and species richness showed some differences between
   buffelgrass prairies and native vegetation sites.},

Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurological disease impacting
   cervids. The disease can move swiftly through populations, making CWD
   management a priority for wildlife agencies across the United States.
   Stakeholder perceptions of CWD may shape behaviors that can negatively
   impact wildlife agencies. Thus, agencies need comprehensive assessments
   of stakeholder risk perceptions and enhanced understandings of how
   perceptions are formed to improve communications. Using a mail- and
   online-based questionnaire to collect data from September 2020 through
   January 2021, we surveyed 503 hunters throughout the state of Texas,
   USA, and 481 Texas landowners who owned property in CWD-affected
   counties to better understand risk perceptions, knowledge of CWD, and
   relationships between both elements. Furthermore, we compared risk
   perceptions across multiple host types and wildlife-related diseases. We
   documented frequent ``don't know{''} responses across perceptions and
   found a negative or no relationship between factual knowledge and risk
   perceptions, context dependent. As such, results suggest wildlife
   agencies should consider communications that emphasize actionable
   knowledge to better encourage preventive action.},

Title = {Bat mortality at Ontario wind farms quantified and compared using four
   candidate estimator equations},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Wind farm development is expanding globally. While wind energy is a
   low-cost option for new electricity supply, the impacts to wildlife
   populations, including bats (Chiroptera), are of ecological concern. To
   quantify these impacts, scientists have developed estimator equations to
   estimate bat mortality, which vary in assumptions related to correction
   factors. We compared the results of 4 estimators applied to
   post-construction monitoring data from Ontario, Canada, wind farms to
   evaluate the effects of field methods and correction factors on
   estimator consistency. To conduct our study, we obtained data from 21
   wind farms between 2011 and 2017 for a total of 26 wind farm survey
   years, because some wind farms supplied fatality monitoring data in >1
   year, to estimate mortality. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
   and Forestry estimator (OMNRF) tended to be highest, while the Huso,
   Schoenfeld-Erickson, and GenEst estimators produced similar results.
   Huso and Schoenfeld-Erickson estimates tended to fall within 95\%
   confidence intervals for GenEst, while OMNRF estimates tended to be
   higher than the upper confidence interval for GenEst. The results from
   the OMNRF estimator were consistent with the other candidates when
   carcass persistence times were >6.5 days but inconsistent when carcass
   persistence times were shorter. Our results demonstrated the degree to
   which mortality estimates can vary among estimators and highlight the
   need for a consistent estimator in comparative studies. We recommend
   GenEst for such studies, as this estimator can incorporate more inputs
   with flexibility to reflect site-specific field conditions and produces
   highly consistent results. Conversely, the OMNRF estimator produced
   consistently higher estimates than the other candidate estimators, and
   assumptions related to carcass persistence were regularly violated. We
   recommend that these limitations be acknowledged when interpreting
   results from this estimator and that its use be reconsidered when
   assumptions related to carcass persistence are not met.},

Abstract = {Ecological light pollution is now recognized as a significant source of
   ecosystem alteration. We documented that holiday lights are a seasonal
   source of light pollution that constitute an ecological trap for eastern
   fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). Texas A\&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK)
   wildlife students surveyed a 2-km walking transect 5 times per month
   each month for the relative abundance and diel behavior of eastern fox
   squirrels and feral cats (Felis catus) on the TAMUK campus during
   2018-2019. Eastern fox squirrels exhibited diurnal behaviors throughout
   the year but extended their foraging behavior nearly 4 hours after
   sunset with the addition of holiday lights. Feral cats and owls
   (Strigiformes) exhibited diurnal and nocturnal behaviors but conducted
   the majority of their hunting during crepuscular hours. We documented
   that monthly squirrel mortality increased 7-fold with the addition of
   holiday lights, possibly due to the extension of foraging time by
   squirrels. Although seasonal lighting is intended to be festive for
   humans, it can have negative consequences for eastern fox squirrels.
   Educating the public concerning the issue of light pollution on wildlife
   species is needed because the majority of the public appears unaware
   that bright lights can negatively alter wildlife behaviors. Reducing
   light intensity by either using less outdoor lights or perhaps using
   colored lights rather than clear white bulbs may lessen the negative
   effect on foraging behavior of squirrels.},

Title = {Human-carnivore conflicts in a recently established Pakistani national
   park},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-157},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Human-carnivore conflicts (HCCs) are increasing globally. These
   conflicts may encompass competition for food resources, crop and
   livestock depredations, and attacks on humans. Concerns over conflicts
   may result in retaliatory killings of carnivores and negative views of
   wildlife or landscape conservation. Yet, despite the economic and
   conservation implications of HCCs, data regarding the magnitude and
   severity of the conflicts may be lacking because many incidents are
   unreported. To better inform this issue, we compared HCC data for 2016
   to 2018 obtained from official records of the Punjab Wildlife and Parks
   Department for a newly established national park in the Punjab Region of
   Pakistan to data we obtained regarding HCCs based on a survey of 200
   households from 25 villages abutting the park. The households surveyed
   reported 250 incidents of livestock lost to leopards (Panthera pardus),
   jackals (Canis aureus), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) during the study
   period. Most of the losses (83\%) were attributed to leopards. In
   contrast, official data reported 42 animals lost for the villages
   studied, with most losses attributed to leopards. Thus, official agency
   records underreported depredation losses by >80\%. Because of HCC, 19\%
   of households supported eliminating leopards from the park, and 25\% of
   households supported fencing the park to prevent leopards from entering
   human settlements. However, 47\% of the households also supported
   increasing programs focused on improving herding practices and enhanced
   livestock infrastructure that might prevent attacks. Our results
   suggested new opportunities for wildlife officials to help residents
   mitigate HCCs while enhancing local support of carnivore conservation.},

Title = {European starling use of nest boxes relative to human disturbance},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {84-96},

Abstract = {European starling (Sturnus vulgaris; starling) nesting poses debris
   hazards within airport hangars and to engine and flight surfaces of
   moored aircraft. We questioned whether consistent removal of nest
   material would negatively affect use of a nest site, measured by a
   reduction in material accumulation. We conducted our study on a 2,200-ha
   site in Erie County, Ohio, USA (41 degrees 22 ` N, 82 degrees 41 ` W),
   from April 15 through June 2, 2020. We used 120 wooden nest boxes on
   utility poles, protected by an aluminum predator guard below the box.
   Our treatments included (1) twice weekly, repeated nest material removal
   (RMR; n = 40 nest boxes); (2) complete nest removal, but only after nest
   construction and >= 1 starling egg was laid (CNR; n = 40 nest boxes);
   and (3) a control; n = 40 nest boxes; N = 120 nest boxes). Starlings
   deposited approximately 50\% greater mass of nest material and eggs at
   RMR than CNR nest boxes, indicating that consistent disturbance failed
   to dissuade use. Predator guard protection of nest boxes at our site
   reduced nest predation of starlings; the current starling population is
   likely adapted to selecting these sites. Similar selection toward low
   nest-predation risk associated with anthropogenic structures and moored
   aircraft is also possible. Aside from covering moored aircraft and
   closing hangar doors, actions not necessarily feasible, removal of
   starling nesting material more than twice weekly would be necessary to
   maintain minimum control over material deposition that could affect
   aircraft function and safety.},

Title = {Nighttime traffic volume predicts risk of deer-vehicle collisions},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Annually, in the United States, >1 million deer (Odocoileus
   spp.)-vehicle collisions are reported, resulting in losses of \$4.6
   billion in vehicle damage and medical expenses. Wildlife and
   transportation managers require better information about traffic volumes
   relative to seasonal and diurnal deer movement patterns to appropriately
   evaluate the risks associated with deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We
   incorporated traffic volume data with DVC data and the movement rates
   and incidences of road crossings by white-tailed deer (O. virginianus)
   to evaluate if traffic volume or deer behaviors mediate the incidence of
   DVCs along a high-volume interstate highway in Morgan County in central
   Georgia, USA. From May 2012 to July 2014, we monitored the movements and
   survival of 25 deer (13 males, 12 females) instrumented with global
   positioning system (GPS) collars in an area 1.6 km north and south of a
   7.7-km section of Interstate 20 in our study area. We used a linear
   mixed model to quantify the effects of mean traffic volume and total
   road crossings on DVCs for each hour of the day. Deer movements and DVCs
   were primarily crepuscular. Approximately 60\% of GPS-collared deer
   crossed roads; 7 deer accounted for >90\% of all road crossings.
   Approximately 73\% of daily traffic occurred between 0700 and 1859
   hours. Nearly twice the number of daily DVCs occurred during the fall
   (9.8 DVCs/day) than during the next highest season (winter; 4.9
   DVCs/day). Although DVCs occurred at greater frequencies during
   crepuscular periods, results of our linear mixed model suggested only
   nighttime traffic volume predicted DVCs. The relationship between
   nighttime DVCs and traffic volume is likely due to the inability of
   drivers to perceive deer in a roadway during this time. We recommend
   mitigation efforts focus on increasing driver vigilance and reducing
   vehicle speed during nighttime periods, especially during the fall
   season.},

Title = {No difference in corticosterone concentrations between Missouri
   three-toed box turtles living in an urban and a rural site},

Abstract = {Baseline health data for species of conservation concern are important
   for understanding threats to the long-term viability of populations. One
   indication of health is physiological stress among individuals.
   Corticosterone (CORT) is frequently used to quantify stress in
   free-living reptile populations, as high values may be associated with
   reduced fitness. Herein, we describe and validate methods for
   quantifying blood CORT levels in three-toed box turtles (Terrapene
   mexicana triunguis). We subsequently use this information to evaluate
   stress levels in 2 populations of free-living three-toed box turtles in
   Missouri, USA. To our knowledge, this is the first quantification of
   CORT levels in the three-toed box turtle. In 2012 we collected blood
   samples from 11 three-toed box turtles in human care at the Saint Louis
   Zoological Park (zoo), St. Louis, Missouri for assay validation, and
   from 2012 to 2016 we collected 220 samples from 144 free-living
   three-toed box turtles at 2 sites, 1 urban and 1 rural. In the zoo
   turtles, mean CORT concentration was 0.71 +/- 0.10 ng/mL. Following a
   handling experiment, CORT concentration increased to 3.14 +/- 0.72 ng/mL
   (P = 0.011). Mean CORT levels between free-living turtles at the urban
   and rural sites did not differ (urban = 0.54 +/- 0.08 ng/mL, rural =
   0.37 +/- 0.02 ng/mL, F pr = 0.12). Sex did not influence CORT levels (F
   pr = 0.29). These results suggest that the turtles living in the urban
   environment did not experience chronic elevated glucocorticoid
   production and supports urban parks as potential habitat for box
   turtles.},

Title = {What happens after a shark incident? Behavioral changes among Australian
   beachgoers},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-83},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Sharks (Selachimorpha) have an important ecological function and are
   both valued and feared by people around the world. Shark bite incidents
   present a high consequence risk in terms of human health and safety. In
   Australia, shark interactions with humans are most frequently recorded
   for the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), bull shark (Carcharhinus
   leucas), and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Human anxiety of
   encountering sharks may be elevated relative to the actual level of risk
   due to intensive media coverage, which typically emphasizes a narrative
   of highly abundant animals actively targeting human water users. This
   narrative is not supported by scientific evidence. Public perceptions of
   shark incidents can strongly influence shark management efforts. To help
   management, we set out to understand how people change their behavior in
   response to shark incidents and why some behaviors do or do not change.
   In October 2019, we used 4 participatory workshops, attended by 60
   people, and a visual communication approach to study the socioecological
   context of beachgoer behavior to sharks in a high shark incident region
   around Ballina and Byron Bay in New South Wales, Australia. Of all
   recorded comments captured at the workshops (174), 91\% mentioned
   changes in behavior following the reported incidents, and 9\% indicated
   no behavior change. The behavior changes generally did not result in
   less beach use but in different types of use. When beachgoers visited
   the beach and used the ocean, they implicitly asked themselves the
   following questions in selecting activities and behaviors: (1) how much
   risk do I think is present, (2) how much risk am I willing to accept,
   and (3) how much do I trust the information and advice available to me
   to mitigate these risks? We found that families, teenagers, and
   experienced beachgoers (such as surfers) used different socioecological
   information on which to base their risk assessments and that these
   groups had different risk profiles. Despite these variations, a common
   finding across beachgoers was a strong desire to improve the quality of
   publicly available and locally relevant information on risk factors.
   Using the graphic visualization of our findings for communication
   purposes can help beachgoers contextualize their own risk perception and
   learn from how others have changed their reported behavior. Sharing of
   behavior change information and risk reduction strategies can help
   target public investment in mitigation measures and may encourage
   further risk reduction strategies and policies to be implemented.},

Title = {Fertility control options for management of free-roaming horse
   populations},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-38},
Abstract = {The management of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus) and burros (E.
   asinus) in the United States has been referred to as a ``wicked problem
   `` because, although there are population control options, societal
   values will ultimately determine what is acceptable and what is not. In
   the United States, free-roaming equids are managed by different types of
   organizations and agencies, and the landscapes that these animals
   inhabit vary widely in terms of access, size, topography, climate,
   natural resources, flora, and fauna. This landscape diversity, coupled
   with contemporary socioeconomic and political environments, means that
   adaptive management practices are needed to regulate these free-roaming
   populations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently manages
   free-roaming equids on 177 herd management areas in the United States by
   applying fertility control measures in situ and/or removing horses,
   which are either adopted by private individuals or sent to long-term
   holding facilities. The BLM off-range population currently includes >
   50,000 animals and costs approximately \$50 million USD per year to
   maintain; on-range equid numbers were estimated in March 2022 to be
   approximately 82,384. On-range populations can grow at 15-20\% annually,
   and current estimates far exceed the designated appropriate management
   level of 26,715. To reduce population recruitment, managers need better
   information about effective, long-lasting or permanent fertility control
   measures. Because mares breed only once a year, fertility control
   studies take years to complete. Some contraceptive approaches have been
   studied for decades, and results from various trials can collectively
   inform future research directions and actions. Employing 1 or more
   fertility control tools in concert with removals offers the best
   potential for success. Active, iterative, cooperative, and thoughtful
   management practices can protect free-roaming horses while
   simultaneously protecting the habitat. Herein, we review contraceptive
   vaccines, intrauterine devices, and surgical sterilization options for
   controlling fertility of free-roaming horses. This review provides
   managers with a ``fertility control toolbox `` and guides future
   research.},

Volume = {16},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {While management measures cannot eliminate human-wildlife conflicts,
   they have the potential to minimize the damage done to both parties,
   especially if areas where the nature of the potential interaction can be
   predicted before an encounter occurs. The timber rattlesnake (Crotalus
   horridus) represents a wildlife species associated with public
   misconceptions that may foster unwarranted fears and retribution. This
   species is native to the eastern and southern regions of the United
   States, including a small population remnant in the southeastern region
   of Minnesota. To gain a better understanding of the environmental
   predictors relevant to human-snake encounters in Minnesota (that require
   action such as relocation), we studied point locations of human-snake
   interactions requiring human intervention in Winona County in
   southeastern Minnesota over a 13-year period between 2006 and 2019. We
   used the points to create a model to predict areas of increased
   potential for human-snake interactions. Our analysis identified areas
   with high potential for such contact between humans and rattlesnakes.
   This research highlighted environmental factors favorable to timber
   rattlesnake encounters with humans and may serve as a guide for
   management efforts to mitigate human-snake conflicts.},

Title = {Evaluation of the effect of culling on browse damage by the Japanese
   serow in Gifu Prefecture, Japan},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-43},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus; serow) is a protected
   territorial ungulate native to Japan. However, locally overabundant
   serow populations can damage forest plantations and agriculture through
   browsing. Despite government permitted annual culling of serows on
   forest lands of Gifu Prefecture, Japan, browse damage continues to be
   reported in hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa; cypress) plantations.
   Sika deer (Cervus nippon; deer), which are co-located with serows can
   also browse cypress, but their impacts have never been evaluated. The
   objective of our research was to evaluate the involvement of each
   species in browse damage and to establish the damage-causing mechanisms
   after serow culling at selected study sites (T1 {[}0.3 ha], T2 {[}0.2
   ha], and T3 {[}1.1 ha]) in 3 cypress plantations in Takayama City, Gifu
   Prefecture, where serow culling was conducted. In 2019 and 2020, 2 and 2
   serows were culled in T1, 3 and 0 in T2, and 1 and 1 in T3,
   respectively. Forestry workers also applied a chemical repellent
   (ziram-based fungicide) to some stands in T3 in October 2019 and May
   2020. Between December 2018 and September 2020, we used camera traps to
   monitor activity patterns of serows and deer and the replacement of
   territorial serows before and after culling. We also investigated
   seasonal browsing impacts between August 2019 and June 2020 by
   thoroughly checking for browsing marks on the terminal shoot. Serows and
   deer accounted for 79\% and 21\% of camera-trap videos, respectively.
   Despite annual culling, serows were recorded at all browsed sites before
   the next growing season. Browse damage was higher in autumn and winter,
   but in T3 it was reduced when the repellent was applied. Management of
   ungulate browse damage to cypress will require accurate identification
   of species causing the damage, monitoring serow activity before and
   after culling, and a using repellent immediately before browsing
   seasons.},

Title = {Quantifying wildlife use of escape ramps along a fenced highway},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-143},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Wildlife exclusion fencing can significantly reduce wildlife-vehicle
   collisions. However, some animals breach the fence and become trapped in
   the highway corridor, thereby increasing risk of a wildlife-vehicle
   collision. An emerging solution to this problem is the installation of
   earthen escape ramps (i.e., jumpouts), which allow trapped animals to
   escape the highway corridor. Few studies have quantified wildlife use of
   jumpouts, and none have investigated intraspecific differences in use.
   We used camera traps to document wildlife use of 4 2m-high jumpouts
   associated with wildlife exclusion fencing along Highway 101 near San
   Luis Obispo, California, USA, from 2012 to 2017. We surveyed for 7,361
   nights across all 4 jumpouts, yielding 1,015 visitation events by 10
   different species of large- and medium-ized mammals. Mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) accounted for 895 (88\%) detections; they jumped
   out 20\% of the time when detected at the top of the ramp and were never
   detected using the jumpout to enter the highway corridor. We
   differentiated male and female deer using the presence of antlers and
   found that they jumped out at similar rates, but females were detected 6
   times more often and were more likely to return to the same jumpout. Two
   groups of 2-3 deer accounted for similar to 41\% of deer detections,
   which allowed us to investigate their behavior over time. These results
   indicate that individual variation could influence jumpout use, which
   should be considered when quantifying their use. To increase the overall
   jumpout rate, we recommend a jumpout height between 1.75 and 2 m.},

Title = {Trico: a novel repellent for preventing deer damage to ornamental shrubs},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-28},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Homeowners whose landscape plants are repeatedly browsed by white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) desire repellent products that are
   effective and long-lasting. We conducted a 12-week trial from January 6
   through April 5, 2021 to test the duration and efficacy of a novel deer
   repellent (Trico((R))) relative to Plantskydd((R)), a commonly used deer
   repellent, and untreated plants. We placed treated and control Japanese
   yew shrubs (Taxus media `Hicksii') at 4 homeowner sites (Birch Hills
   Drive, Fairview Crescent, Pinegrove Ave., and St. Paul Blvd.) near
   Rochester, New York, USA, where we detected deer presence. Yews are
   frequently eaten by deer during winter and provide a good bioassay for
   testing repellents. To gauge the efficacy of the repellents, we
   photographed the yews and scored the level of deer browsing. We used
   ordinal logistic regression to determine the change in efficacy over
   time. Trico deer repellent reduced deer damage to yews (chi-square =
   97.273, P < 0.0001). Damage to yews treated with Plantskydd did not
   differ from control plants (chi-square = 0.24, P = 0.621) after 12
   weeks. The performance of deer repellents varied considerably among
   sites (chi-square = 109.460, P < 0.0001). Where there was intense deer
   browsing pressure (Pinegrove Ave. site), both repellents failed to
   protect the yews. However, at 3 of 4 sites, the Trico repellent
   effectively protected yews from deer browsing during winter through
   spring green-up in April. We found Trico to be an effective,
   long-lasting repellent for protecting ornamental shrubs from deer
   browsing during winter.},

Title = {Is mitigation translocation an effective strategy for conserving common
   chuckwallas?},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {117-132},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Mitigation translocation remains a popular conservation tool despite
   ongoing debate regarding its utility for population conservation. To add
   to the understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation translocation,
   in 2017 and 2018 we monitored a population of protected common
   chuckwallas (Sauromalus ater) following translocation away from the area
   of construction of a new highway near the South Mountains, Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA. We removed chuckwallas from the construction right-of-way,
   paint-marked and pit-tagged them, and then released them in a nearby
   municipal preserve. We deployed very high frequency radio-telemetry
   transmitters on a sub-sample of 15 translocated adult chuckwallas. We
   monitored the radio-marked chuckwallas once a day at 1- to 3-day
   intervals for up to 46 days to document survival, body mass, and
   post-release movements. The average distance moved following
   translocation was 359 +/- 53 m. Using minimum convex polygons, the
   average home range size of translocated lizards was 0.9 +/- 0.3 ha,
   which was 18-45 times larger than expected for the species. Following
   translocations, we surveyed the translocation sites 1 month later and
   again 1 year later to determine the presence of translocated
   chuckwallas. Translocated individuals were rarely observed a second
   time: in 2017, only 11 of 160 translocated chuckwallas were seen again,
   and in 2018, only 11 of 192 translocated chuckwallas were detected. In
   the light of low recapture rate, consistent loss of body mass, and large
   movements of marked lizards, we conclude that survival of translocated
   chuckwallas was low over a single year. In the future, efficacy of
   mitigation translocation could be better evaluated by assessing the
   spatial ecology of both resident and translocated individuals
   simultaneously using radio-telemetry.},

Abstract = {For the two-patch logistic model, we study the effect of dispersal
   intensity and dispersal asymmetry on the total population abundance and
   its distribution. Two complete classifications of the model parameter
   space are given: one concerning when dispersal causes smaller or larger
   total biomass than no dispersal, and the other addressing how the total
   biomass changes with dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry. The
   dependencies of the population abundance of each individual patch on
   dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry are also fully
   characterized. In addition, the maximal and minimal total population
   sizes induced by dispersal are determined for the logistic model with an
   arbitrary number of patches, and a weak order-preserving result
   correlated the local population abundances with and without dispersal is
   established. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Application of a Markovian ancestral model to the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of cultural evolution on a population network},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {14-29},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cultural macroevolution concerns a long-term evolutionary process
   involving transmission of nongenetic or cultural traits between
   populations as well as birth and death of populations. To understand the
   spatial dynamics of cultural macroevolution, we present a one-locus
   model of cultural diffusion in which a cultural trait is transmitted on
   a network of populations. Borrowing the method of ancestral backward
   process from population genetics, our model explores the lineage of a
   trait variant sampled in the present generation to quantify when and
   where the variant was invented. Mathematical analysis of the model
   enables us to predict the distribution of cultural age in each
   population of the network, estimate the frequencies of trait variants
   originating from given populations, and discuss the time it takes for a
   trait variant to diffuse between a given pair of populations. We also
   perform numerical analysis on random scale-free network of populations
   to investigate the effect of network topology and innovation rate on the
   age and origin of variants in each population. The result suggests that
   trait variants are more likely to derive from a population with higher
   innovation rate. Our numerical analysis also shows that trait variants
   invented in populations with higher network-centrality values are likely
   to be maintained at a higher frequency and transmitted to other
   populations in a shorter time period. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Male mating choices: The drive behind menopause?},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {126-135},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When we examine the life history of humans against our closest primate
   relatives, the other great apes, there is notably a greater longevity in
   humans which includes a distinctive postmenopausal life stage, leading
   to the question, ``How did human females evolve to have old-age
   infertility?{''}In their paper ``Mate choice and the origin of
   menopause{''}(Morton et al., 2013), Morton et al. developed an
   agentbased model (ABM) to investigate the novel hypothesis that
   ancestral male mating choices, particularly forgoing mating with older
   females, were the driving force behind the evolution of menopause. From
   their model, they concluded that indeed male preference for young female
   mates could have driven females to lose fertility at older ages through
   deleterious mutations, leading to menopause. In this work, we revisit
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis by formulating an analogous
   mathematical model using a system of ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs). We first show that our ODE model recreates the qualitative
   behaviour and hence conclusions of key scenarios in Morton et al.
   (2013). However, since our ODE system is less computationally demanding
   than their ABM, we also conduct a broader sensitivity analysis over a
   range of parameters and differing initial conditions to analyse the
   dependence on their conclusions to underlying assumptions. Our results
   challenge those of Morton et al. as we find that even the slightest
   deviation from an exclusive mating preference for younger females would
   counteract the evolution of menopause. Consequently, we propose that
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis is incomplete and needs further
   explanation of how a male strategy to exclusively mate with young
   females could have arisen in our common ancestors and remained
   evolutionarily stable for long enough to drive the evolution of old-age
   female infertility. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Immunoecology of Species with Alternative Reproductive Tactics and
   Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to
   polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual
   two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that
   have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition.
   Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental,
   behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the
   balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being
   immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic
   of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative
   morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex per se from other
   factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first
   summarize the evolution, development, and maintenance of ARTS. We then
   review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS,
   dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological
   hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in
   detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS.
   Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of
   studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working
   with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless
   forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the
   hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has
   generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest
   level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general
   guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated
   predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but
   perhaps they should take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as
   ``immunocompetence{''} and ``androgens{''} might be useful to develop a
   rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated.
   Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving
   deeper into physiology, sometimes at the cost of ignoring their
   organisms' evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful
   framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting
   immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that
   depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being
   increasingly recognized and sometimes applied to species with ARTS, but
   we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the
   effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.},

Title = {Evolution of trustfulness in the case where resources for cooperation
   are sometimes absent},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {63-79},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is worth investigating the existence of cooperation, which is costly
   for the actor but beneficial to the recipient (precisely because it is
   costly for the former). If players, when they approach defectors, stop
   their relationship with them, cooperation can pay off and favorably
   emerge in the course of evolutionary dynamics. The present study
   examines the situation in which animals, even when they want to
   cooperate, sometimes lack the necessary resources, and are thereby
   prevented from cooperating with others. In addition, it is also
   considered that the underlying information about the presence or absence
   of these resources can be conveyed to the opponent player. Here, the
   opponent who defects-has no resources for cooperation-may be a
   cooperator or a defector. Therefore, it is not clear which behavior is
   more likely to evolve, if it is keeping the interaction with such an
   opponent (i.e., being trustful) or stopping the interaction with such an
   opponent (i.e., being not trustful). By using evolutionary game theory,
   it is revealed that those who want to keep the interaction with those
   without the resources to cooperate are favored by natural selection.
   This study sheds new light on the role of keeping and stopping
   interaction in the evolution of cooperation under variable availability
   of resources.},

Title = {Follow the Footsteps of Leonardo Fea: An Example of an Integrative

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Leonardo Fea, an Italian explorer and traveler, sampled a comprehensive
   collection of continental Mollusca during his travels throughout the
   former British Burma (currently Myanmar) in 1885-1887. Cesare Maria
   Tapparone-Canefri, an Italian malacologist, studied this sample and
   published a paper with a description of numerous terrestrial and
   freshwater molluscan taxa new to science. This collection was partly
   deposited in the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova (MSNG), Italy
   and the Indian Museum (ZSI: Zoological Survey of India) in Kolkata.
   Here, we provide a re-analysis of C.M. Tapparone-Canefri's Burmese
   Unionidae collection. Our study reveals that the type series of only
   four nominal taxa described by Tapparone-Canefri as new to science in
   1889 are still available in the MSNG, i.e. Unio rectangularis, U.
   pulcher, U. protensus var. obtusatus, and U. marginalis var.
   subflabellata. The first taxon is a valid species belonging to the genus
   Yaukthwa, while U. pulcher and U. protensus var. obtusatus are
   considered here as junior synonyms of the widespread Lamellidens
   generosus, and the last nominal taxon corresponds to L. savadiensis. The
   MSNG collection also contains shell lots of Indochinella pugio pugio, I.
   pugio paradoxa, Indonaia andersoniana, Radiatula chaudhurii, R. mouhoti
   haungthayawensis, Lamellidens savadiensis, L. generosus, Yaukthwa
   nesemanni, and Y. zayleymanensis, most of which were listed in
   Tapparone-Canefri's work under incorrect names. We revise all the
   freshwater mussel taxa listed by Tapparone-Canefri based on the original
   descriptions, available DNA sequences, morphological data, and
   biogeographic evidence. A freshwater mussel from the Haungthayaw River
   that was identified by Tapparone-Canefri as Unio exolescens is described
   here as Trapezoideus mitanensis sp. nov., a fourth species in this small
   Contradentini genus with a restricted range. Finally, new taxonomic
   opinions are proposed here for Leoparreysia tavoyensis, Trapezidens
   dolichorhynchus, Lamellidens generosus, and Lamellidens savadiensis.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of individual admixture (IA) assumes that the genome of
   individuals is composed of alleles inherited from K ancestral
   populations. Each copy of each allele has the same chance qk to
   originate from population k, and together with the allele frequencies p
   in all populations at all M markers, comprises the admixture model.
   Here, we assume a supervised scheme, i.e. allele frequencies p are given
   through a reference database of size N, and q is estimated via maximum
   likelihood for a single sample. We study laws of large numbers and
   central limit theorems describing effects of finiteness of both, M and
   N, on the estimate of q. We recall results for the effect of finite M,
   and provide a central limit theorem for the effect of finite N,
   introduce a new way to express the uncertainty in estimates in standard
   barplots, give simulation results, and discuss applications in forensic
   genetics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Limiting distribution of X-chromosomal coalescence times under
   first-cousin consanguineous mating},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {By providing additional opportunities for coalescence within families,
   the presence of consanguineous unions in a population reduces
   coalescence times relative to non-consanguineous populations.
   First-cousin consanguinity can take one of six forms differing in the
   configuration of sexes in the pedigree of the male and female cousins
   who join in a consanguineous union: patrilateral parallel, patrilateral
   cross, matrilateral parallel, matrilateral cross, bilateral parallel,
   and bilateral cross. Considering populations with each of the six types
   of first-cousin consanguinity individually and a population with a
   mixture of the four unilateral types, we examine coalescent models of
   consanguinity. We previously computed, for first-cousin consanguinity
   models, the mean coalescence time for X-chromosomal loci and the
   limiting distribution of coalescence times for autosomal loci. Here, we
   use the separation-of-time-scales approach to obtain the limiting
   distribution of coalescence times for X-chromosomal loci. This limiting
   distribution has an instantaneous coalescence probability that depends
   on the probability that a union is consanguineous; lineages that do not
   coalesce instantaneously coalesce according to an exponential
   distribution. We study the effects on the coalescence time distribution
   of the type of first-cousin consanguinity, showing that
   patrilateral-parallel and patrilateral-cross consanguinity have no
   effect on X-chromosomal coalescence time distributions and that
   matrilateral-parallel consanguinity decreases coalescence times to a
   greater extent than does matrilateral-cross consanguinity. (C) 2022

Abstract = {Gene gain-loss-duplication models are commonly based on continuous-time
   birth-death processes. Employed in a phylogenetic context, such models
   have been increasingly popular in studies of gene content evolution
   across multiple genomes. While the applications are becoming more varied
   and demanding, bioinformatics methods for probabilistic inference on
   copy numbers (or integer-valued evolutionary characters, in general) are
   scarce.\& nbsp;\& nbsp;We describe a flexible probabilistic framework
   for phylogenetic gain-loss-duplication models. The framework is based on
   a novel elementary representation by dependent random variables with
   well-characterized conditional distributions: binomial, Polya (negative
   binomial), and Poisson.\& nbsp;The corresponding graphical model yields
   exact numerical procedures for computing the likelihood and the
   posterior distribution of ancestral copy numbers. The resulting
   algorithms take quadratic time in the total number of copies. In
   addition, we show how the likelihood gradient can be computed by a
   linear-time algorithm. (C)\& nbsp;2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {A time-since-infection model for populations with two pathogens},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick (1927, 1932, 1933) is now
   most known for introducing the SIR model, which divides a population
   into discrete compartments for susceptible, infected and removed
   individuals. The SIR model is the archetype of widely used compartmental
   models for epidemics. It is sometimes forgotten, that Kermack and
   McKendrick introduced the SIR model as a special case of a more general
   framework. This general framework distinguishes individuals not only by
   whether they are susceptible, infected or removed, but additionally
   tracks the time passed since they got infected. Such
   time-since-infection models can mechanistically link within-host
   dynamics to the population level. This allows the models to account for
   more details of the disease dynamics, such as delays of infectiousness
   and symptoms during the onset of an infection. Details like this can be
   vital for interpreting epidemiological data.
   The time-since-infection framework was originally formulated for a host
   population with a single pathogen. However, the interactions of multiple
   pathogens within hosts and within a population can be crucial for
   understanding the severity and spread of diseases. Current models for
   multiple pathogens mostly rely on compartmental models. While such
   models are relatively easy to set up, they do not have the same
   mechanistic underpinning as time-since-infection models. To approach
   this gap of connecting within-host dynamics of multiple pathogens to the
   population level, we here extend the time-since-infection framework of
   Kermack and McKendrick for two pathogens.
   We derive formulas for the basic reproduction numbers in the system.
   Those numbers determine whether a pathogen can invade a population,
   potentially depending on whether the other pathogen is present or not.
   We then demonstrate use of the framework by setting up a simple
   within-host model that we connect to the population model. The example
   illustrates the context-specific information required for this type of
   model, and shows how the system can be simulated numerically. We verify
   that the formulas for the basic reproduction numbers correctly specify
   the invasibility conditions. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A two-sex renewal model and its population projection},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {46-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Population projections rely on one-sex renewal models. Consequently,
   changing the projection of male mortality does not affect the projection
   of birth, contradicting commonsense. A two-sex renewal model is
   presented in this paper to provide a better description of reproduction
   and more reasonable population projections. This model is nonlinear and
   includes the one-sex renewal models as special cases. In this model,
   age-specific birth rates are defined for two sexes jointly; total
   fertility, net reproduction rate, and intrinsic growth rate are also
   derived for two sexes jointly; and age-specific populations approach or
   converge to stable status. Applying the two-sex renewal model to
   Australia, it indicates that one-sex models underestimated the intrinsic
   growth rate by 14 percent. Compared to the results of one-sex models,
   the two-sex model would provide higher growth rate for low-fertility
   countries, and lower growth rate for high-fertility countries. In other
   words, the one-sex models are commonly biased. If the two-sex model is
   applied to all the countries, it would project smaller populations for
   the world in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concept of the average effect of an allele pervades much of
   evolutionary population genetics. In this context the average effect of
   an allele is often considered as the main component of the ``fitness''
   of that allele. It is widely believed that, if this fitness component
   for an allele is positive, then the frequency of this allele will
   increase, at least for one generation in discrete-time models. In this
   note we show that this is not necessarily the case since the average
   effect of an allele on fitness may be different from its marginal
   additive fitness even in a one-locus setting in non-random-mating

Title = {The best of both worlds: Combining population genetic and quantitative
   genetic models},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {49-75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Numerous traits under migration-selection balance are shown to exhibit
   complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect
   sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures
   are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence
   of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial
   polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity
   of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a
   haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from
   population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is
   stable in the symmetric case, there exist no analytical predictions on
   how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes
   to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a
   new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined
   contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background
   resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according
   to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small
   variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits
   are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal
   distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a
   reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time
   scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of
   polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for
   local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts
   the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is
   confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how
   segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics
   of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns. We also provide
   a comprehensive toolbox designed to describe how to apply our method to
   more complex population genetic models.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ancestral state reconstruction is one of the most important tasks in
   evolutionary biology. Conditions under which we can reliably reconstruct
   the ancestral state have been studied for both discrete and continuous
   traits. However, the connection between these results is unclear, and it
   seems that each model needs different conditions. In this work, we
   provide a unifying theory on the consistency of ancestral state
   reconstruction for various types of trait evolution models. Notably, we
   show that for a sequence of nested trees with bounded heights, the
   necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a consistent
   ancestral state reconstruction method under discrete models, the
   Brownian motion model, and the threshold model are equivalent. When tree
   heights are unbounded, we provide a simple counter-example to show that
   this equivalence is no longer valid.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Success-biased social learning in a one-consumer, two-resource model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {29-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Previous analyses have predicted that social learning should not evolve
   in a predator-prey system. Here we examine whether success-biased social
   learning, by which social learners copy successful demonstrators, allows
   social learning by foragers to evolve. We construct a one-predator,
   two-prey system in which foragers must learn how to feed on depletable
   prey populations in an environment where foraging information can be
   difficult to obtain individually. We analyze two models in which social
   learning is success-biased: in the first, individual learning does not
   depend on the resource dynamics, and in the second model it depends on
   the relative frequency of the resource. Unlike previous results, we find
   that social learning does not cause predators to over-harvest one type
   of prey over the other. Furthermore, increasing the probability of
   social learning increases the probability of learning a successful
   foraging behavior, especially when individually learned information
   tends to be inaccurate. Whereas social learning does not evolve among
   individual learners in the first model, the assumption of
   resource-dependent learning in the second model allows a mutant with an
   increased probability of social learning to spread through the forager
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {We study the effect of variability in payoffs on the evolution of
   cooperation (C) against defection (D) in multi-player games in a finite
   well-mixed population. We show that an increase in the covariance
   between any two payoffs to D, or a decrease in the covariance between
   any two payoffs to C, increases the probability of ultimate fixation of
   C when represented once, and decreases the corresponding fixation
   probability for D. This is also the case with an increase in the
   covariance between any payoff to C and any payoff to D if and only if
   the sum of the numbers of C-players in the group associated with these
   payoffs is large enough compared to the group size. In classical social
   dilemmas with random cost and benefit for cooperation, the evolution of
   C is more likely to occur if the variances of the cost and benefit, as
   well as the group size, are small, while the covariance between cost and
   benefit is large.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Gene drives and population persistence vs elimination: The impact of
   spatial structure and inbreeding at low density},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {109-125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease
   vectors, invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed
   random mating population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to
   eliminate a target population, but it is not clear whether the same is
   true when spatial processes play a role. In species with an appropriate
   biology it is possible that drive-induced reductions in density might
   lead to increased inbreeding, reducing the efficacy of drive, eventually
   leading to suppression rather than elimination, regardless of how strong
   the drive is. To investigate this question we analyse a series of
   explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range of scenarios
   for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and
   analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y
   chromosome and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find
   in all cases a sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the
   population will be eliminated, except in the one life history scenario
   (reproduction and mating in patches followed by dispersal) where low
   density leads to increased inbreeding, in which case the population
   persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable equilibrium or a limit
   cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have reduced mating
   success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer sisters to
   mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a
   homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive,
   if there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be
   rescued by inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the
   potentially critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and
   inbreeding depression (and, by extension, other sources of Allee
   effects) can have on the eventual impact of a gene drive on a target
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Theoretical analysis of principal components in an umbrella model of
   intraspecific evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {11-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most frequently-used
   approach to describe population structure from multilocus genotype data.
   Regarding geographic range expansions of modern humans, interpretations
   of PCA have, however, been questioned, as there is uncertainty about the
   wave-like patterns that have been observed in principal components. It
   has indeed been argued that wave-like patterns are mathematical
   artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to data in which
   genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. Here, we
   present an alternative theory for the observation of wave-like patterns
   in PCA. We study a coalescent model - the umbrella model - for the
   diffusion of genetic variants. The model is based on genetic drift
   without any particular geographical structure. In the umbrella model,
   splits from an ancestral population occur almost continuously in time,
   giving birth to small daughter populations at a regular pace. Our
   results provide detailed mathematical descriptions of eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors for the PCA of sampled genomic sequences under the model.
   When variants uniquely represented in the sample are removed, the PCA
   eigenvectors are defined as cosine functions of increasing periodicity,
   reproducing wave-like patterns observed in equilibrium
   isolation-by-distance models. Including singleton variants in the
   analysis, the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
   exhibit complex wave shapes. The accuracy of our predictions is further
   investigated with coalescent simulations. Our analysis supports the
   hypothesis that highly structured wave-like patterns could arise from
   genetic drift only, and may not always be artificial outcomes of
   spatially structured data. Genomic data related to the peopling of the
   Americas are reanalyzed in the light of our new theory. (c) 2022 The

Abstract = {The Gini coefficient of the life table is a concentration index that
   provides information on lifespan variation. Originally proposed by
   economists to measure income and wealth inequalities, it has been widely
   used in population studies to investigate variation in ages at death. We
   focus on the complement of the Gini coefficient, Drewnowski's index,
   which is a measure of equality. We study its mathematical properties and
   analyze how changes over time relate to changes in life expectancy.
   Further, we identify the threshold age below which mortality
   improvements are translated into decreasing lifespan variation and above
   which these improvements translate into increasing lifespan inequality.
   We illustrate our theoretical findings simulating scenarios of mortality
   improvement in the Gompertz model, and showing an example of application
   to Swedish life table data. Our experiments demonstrate how Drewnowski's
   index can serve as an indicator of the shape of mortality patterns.
   These properties, along with our analytical findings, support studying
   lifespan variation alongside life expectancy trends in multiple
   species.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Title = {Analytical Bayesian models to quantify pest eradication success or

Abstract = {It is not possible to establish the absence of a population with
   certainty using imperfect zero-sighting records, but absence can be
   inferred. In this paper we use Bayesian methods to formulate analytical
   inferred distributions and statistics. When such formulations are
   available, they offer a highly efficient and powerful means of analysis.
   Our purpose is to provide accessible and versatile formulations to
   support an assessment of population absence for management decisions,
   using data from a series of regular and targeted surveys with
   zero-sightings. The stochastic processes considered here are prior
   population size, growth and imperfect detection, which are combined into
   a single distribution with sufficient flexibility to accommodate
   alternative distributions for each of the driving processes. Analytical
   solutions formulated include the inferred mean and variance for
   population size or number of infested survey-units, the probability of
   absence, the probability of a series of negative surveys conditional on
   presence, and the probability a population is first detected in a given
   survey, although we also formulate other statistics and provide explicit
   thresholds designed to support management decisions. Our formulation and
   results are straightforward to apply and provide insight into the
   nonlinear interactions and general characteristics of such systems.
   Although motivated by an assessment of population absence following a
   pest eradication program, results are also relevant to the status of
   threatened species, to `proof-of-freedom' requirements for trade, and
   for inferring population size when a population is first detected. (C)\&

Title = {Phylogeography and Wolbachia Infections Reveal Postglacial
   Recolonization Routes of the Parthenogenetic Plant Louse Cacopsylla
   myrtilli (W. Wagner 1947), (Hemiptera, Psylloidea)},

Abstract = {To reveal the phylogeographic pattern of the parthenogenetic psyllid
   Cacopsylla myrtilli (W. Wagner 1947) (Hemiptera, Psylloidea), we
   sequenced a 638 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene from 962
   individuals. These insects originated from 46 sampling sites, which
   cover a significant part of the northern Palearctic distribution range
   of the species. The sequence data revealed 40 haplotypes, with three
   main (H1, H2, and H3) and 37 derived ones. The main haplotypes H1 or H2
   or both were present at all sampling sites. The star-like shape of the
   haplotype networks indicated recent population expansion. In most cases,
   the derived haplotypes were specific for each country, suggesting that
   the main haplotypes H1 and H2 are of refugial origin, and the derived
   haplotypes have emerged after the postglacial recolonization process.
   Based on the haplotype sequences, we suggest H3 to represent the
   ancestral haplotype from which H1 and H2 have evolved. We suggest that
   the main haplotype H3 together with its derived haplotypes represents
   bisexual C. myrtilli, which shows a limited distribution on both sides
   of the border between Finland and Russia in northern Fennoscandia. The
   genetic diversity was the highest in Sjoa in southern Norway and also
   high in the White Sea region in northwest Russia. Higher diversity in
   Sjoa was attributed to both earlier recolonizations compared to that of
   the White Sea region and the absence of Wolbachia infection. We suggest
   that these sites were colonized from different Pleistocene refugia,
   i.e., from western and eastern refugia, respectively. From the White Sea
   region, recolonization continued eastwards to Ural Mountains and
   westwards to Finland and further north to Kola Peninsula. From northern
   Finland, recolonization continued to Finnmark, Norway, and further to
   Sweden and finally reached a secondary contact zone with colonizers from
   Norway in Central Sweden. The Caucasus and Siberian/Manchurian refugial
   regions have played an important role in the origin of C. myrtilli
   populations in Siberia and the Russian Far East.},

Title = {Cystic Echinococcosis: An Impact Assessment of Prevention Programs in
   Endemic Developing Countries in Africa, Central Asia, and South America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background. Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the tapeworm species,
   Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1), is one of many primary
   neglected zoonoses worldwide. Within endemic developing countries, CE
   has multiple effects on animal and human health and well-being. To
   address such effects, veterinary and human medical sector collaboration
   on prevention program delivery is essential. To begin preliminary
   evaluations of county specific prevention programs, a critically
   appraised topic (CAT) was conducted. It sought to answer: What impact do
   CE prevention programs have on human and animal disease prevalence, in
   populations living in endemic developing countries within Africa,
   Central Asia, and South America? Methodology. The aim was to assess the
   ability of prevention and control program outputs to produce measurable
   differences in health, social, and economic outcomes (e.g., improved
   access to medical services, positive behavioral change, or reduced
   treatment costs, respectively). Included articles were obtained using
   predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria from the four databases (CAB
   Abstracts and Global Health; the National Library of Medicine (PubMed);
   ScienceDirect; and WHO Institutional Repository of Information Sharing
   (IRIS)). The articles were appraised using three checklists: the Royal
   College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the Critical Appraisals Skills
   Programme (CASP), and the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Results.
   Ten articles were selected. Geographically, 20\% of studies were
   conducted in South America, 30\% in Africa, and 50\% in Central Asia.
   For definitive hosts, dogs, CoproELISA antigen testing, before and after
   Praziquantel (PZQ) de-worming, was a primary focus. For humans, who are
   intermediate hosts (IH), disease surveillance methods, namely ultrasound
   (US), were commonly assessed. Whilst for sheep, also acting as IH,
   disease prevention methods, such as the EG95 livestock vaccine and
   de-worming farm dogs, were evaluated. Common to all studies were issues
   of program sustainability, in terms of regular human US screening, dog
   de-worming, and annual sheep vaccination. This was attributed to
   transient and remote human or animal populations; limited access to
   adequate roads or hospitals; few skilled health workers or
   veterinarians; an over-reliance on communities to administer
   preventatives; and limited resources. Conclusion. Despite variations in
   result validity and collection periods, useful comparisons of CE endemic
   countries produced key research and program recommendations. Future
   research recommendations included testing the significance of multiple
   program outcomes in relation to prevalence (e.g., the social outcome:
   behavioral change), further research on the impact of livestock
   vaccinations, and the CE transmission role of waterways and sanitation.
   Program recommendations included calculating and distinguishing between
   stray versus owned dog populations; formal representation of internal
   and external stakeholder interests through institutional organization;
   establishing sustainable guidelines around the frequency of PZQ and
   vaccination administration; improved veterinary-human medical training
   and resource sharing; and combined prevention methods and multiple
   canine disease management.},

Title = {Landscape Genetics and Species Delimitation in the Andean Palm Rocket
   Frog (Aromobatidae, Rheobates)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {The complex topography of the species-rich northern Andes creates
   heterogeneous environmental landscapes that are hypothesized to have
   promoted population fragmentation and diversification by processes such
   as vicariance or local adaptation. Previous phylogenetic work on the
   palm rocket frog (Anura: Aromobatidae: Rheobates spp.), endemic to
   midelevation forests of Colombia, suggested that valleys were important
   in promoting divergence between lineages. In this study, we first
   evaluated previous hypotheses of species-level diversity, then fitted an
   isolation-with-migration (IM) historical demographic model, and tested
   two landscape genetic models to explain genetic divergence within
   Rheobates: isolation by distance and isolation by environment. The data
   consisted of two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes from 24 samples
   covering most of the geographic range of the genus. Species delimitation
   by Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography recovered five highly
   divergent genetic lineages within Rheobates, among which few to no
   migrants are exchanged according to IM. We found that isolation by
   environment provided the only variable significantly correlated with
   genetic distances for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, suggesting
   that local adaptation may have a role in driving the genetic divergence
   within this frog genus. Thus, genetic divergence in Rheobates may be
   driven more by variation among the local environments where these frogs
   live rather than by geographic distance.},

Title = {Reproductive Variability in Hippolytid Shrimp Shape Morphotypes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Shape morph-specific studies in hippolytid shrimps revealed significant
   results on their ecomorphology and evolutionary adaptations. Among the
   species of the genus Hippolyte, only one exhibits an unusual, sharp
   rostral dimorphism and has been used as an animal model for the
   investigation of mechanisms of the morph-specific adaptation: the
   intertidal Hippolyte sapphica. The species is endemic of the
   Central/Eastern Mediterranean basin and exhibits morph-A with a long
   dentate rostrum and morph-B with a short, juvenile-like one. The two
   morphotypes were recently confirmed to be conspecific, while offspring
   and morphological studies showed significant microevolutionary
   adaptations, which balance the disadvantage of the ``rostral loss.{''}
   The present study aims to investigate the effect of such phenotypic
   variation on the reproductive traits of the species. We collected
   ovigerous females of H. sapphica in mixed (morph-A and morph-B) and
   unmixed populations (morph-A) along the species geographical range. We
   measured seven morphometric and maternal investment traits: carapace
   length, fecundity, embryo volume, egg density, female dry weight, brood
   dry weight, and reproductive output. Our results showed that ovigerous
   females were bigger in morph-A than in morph-B, whereas fecundity did
   not show any significant differences between the two morphotypes. High
   egg volume might be attributed to the latitudinal differences of our
   sampling sites compared to congenerics. Interestingly, the reproductive
   output was found to be bigger in morph-A specimens, suggesting that the
   maternal energy investment is selectively determined from the rostral
   presence/absence and the morphotype's higher viability in the species
   populations.},

Abstract = {We study local adaptation of a peripheral population by investigating
   the fate of new mutations using a haploid two-locus two-allele

   maladaptive gene flow affect the invasion probability of weakly
   beneficial de-novo mutations that arise on the island at an arbitrary
   physical distance to a locus that already maintains a stable
   migration-selection polymorphism. By assuming a slightly supercritical
   branching process, we deduce explicit conditions on the parameters that
   permit a positive invasion probability and we derive approximations for
   it. They show how the invasion probability depends on the additive and
   epistatic effects of the mutant, on its linkage to the polymorphism, and
   on the migration rate. We use these approximations together with
   empirically motivated distributions of epistatic effects to analyze the
   influence of epistasis on the expected invasion probability if mutants
   are drawn randomly from such a distribution and occur at a random
   physical distance to the existing polymorphism. We find that the
   invasion probability generally increases as the epistasis parameter
   increases or the migration rate decreases, but not necessarily as the
   recombination rate decreases. Finally, we shed light on the size of
   emerging genomic islands of divergence by exploring the size of the
   chromosomal neighborhood of the already established polymorphism in
   which 50\% or 90\% of the successfully invading mutations become
   established. These `window sizes' always decrease in a reverse sigmoidal
   way with stronger migration and typically increase with increasing
   epistatic effect. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chan, Durrett, and Lanchier introduced a multitype contact process with
   temporal heterogeneity involving two species competing for space on the
   d-dimensional integer lattice. Time is divided into two seasons. They
   proved that there is an open set of the parameters for which both
   species can coexist when their dispersal range is sufficiently large.
   Numerical simulations suggested that three species can coexist in the
   presence of two seasons. The main point of this paper is to prove that
   this conjecture is incorrect. To do this we prove results for a more
   general ODE model and contrast its behavior with other related systems
   that have been studied in order to understand the competitive exclusion
   principle. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A number of powerful demographic inference methods have been developed
   in recent years, with the goal of fitting rich evolutionary models to
   genetic data obtained from many populations. In this paper we
   investigate the statistical performance of these methods in the specific
   case where there is continuous migration between populations. Compared
   with earlier work, migration significantly complicates the theoretical
   analysis and requires new techniques. We employ the theories of
   phase-type distributions and concentration of measure in order to study
   the two-island and isolation-withmigration models, resulting in both
   upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence for parametric estimators
   in migration models. For the upper bounds, we consider inferring rates
   of coalescent and migration on the basis of directly observing pairwise
   coalescent times, and, more realistically, when (conditionally)
   Poisson-distributed mutations dropped on latent trees are observed. We
   complement these upper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds
   which establish a limit, in terms of sample size, below which inference
   is effectively impossible.},

Title = {Amitosis as a strategy of cell division-Insight from the proliferation
   of Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclei},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {52-62},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cell division is a necessity of life which can be either mitotic or
   amitotic. While both are fundamental, amitosis is sometimes considered a
   relic of little importance in biology. Nevertheless, eukaryotes often
   have polyploid cells, including cancer cells, which may divide
   amitotically. To understand how amitosis ensures the completion of cell
   division, we turn to the macronuclei of ciliates. The grand scheme
   governing the proliferation of the macronuclei of ciliate cells, which
   involves chromosomal replication and amitosis, is currently unknown,
   which is crucial for developing population genetics model of ciliate
   populations. Using a novel model that encompasses a wide range of
   mechanisms together with experimental data of the composition of mating
   types at different stages derived from a single karyonide of Tetrahymena
   thermophila , we show that the chromosomal replication of the
   macronucleus has a strong head-start effect, with only about five copies
   of chromosomes replicated at a time and persistent reuse of the
   chromosomes involved in the early replication. Furthermore the fission
   of a fully grown macronucleus is non-random with regard to chromosome
   composition, with a strong tendency to push chromosomes and their
   replications to the same daughter cell.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Survival in branching cellular populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We analyze evolutionary dynamics in a confluent, branching cellular
   population, such as in a growing duct, vasculature, or in a branching
   microbial colony. We focus on the coarse-grained features of the
   evolution and build a statistical model that captures the essential
   features of the dynamics. Using simulations and analytic approaches, we
   show that the survival probability of strains within the growing
   population is sensitive to the branching geometry: Branch bifurcations
   enhance survival probability due to an overall population growth (i.e.,
   ``inflation ``), while branch termination and the small effective
   population size at the growing branch tips increase the probability of
   strain extinction. We show that the evolutionary dynamics may be
   captured on a wide range of branch geometries parameterized just by the
   branch diameter N0 and branching rate b. We find that the survival
   probability of neutral cell strains is largest at an ``optimal ``
   branching rate, which balances the effects of inflation and branch
   termination. We find that increasing the selective advantage s of the
   cell strain mitigates the inflationary effect by decreasing the average
   time at which the mutant cell fate is determined. For sufficiently large
   selective advantages, the survival probability of the advantageous
   mutant decreases monotonically with the branching rate. (c) 2022

Abstract = {During embryonic development of the Caspian thin-toed gecko migration,
   formation of myoblast and myosatellite cells occurs in the
   cranial-distal direction. Somite formation begins in the body part close
   to the skull and ends in the tail. The time of separation of somites
   from the proximal mesoderm depends on the temperature of the air and the
   substrate. Myoblast cells reach their targets and are connected, and the
   membranes in the area of their contact are destroyed. Myoblast's fusion
   creates myosymplasts. The intermediate stage is observed after the
   formation of small myosymplasts. After that, the chain shape of
   myosymplasts are transformed into an intermediate plaque form. At this
   intermediate stage, the number of a nucleus is small, the shape of the
   nucleus differs from each other, and the location of the nucleus varies.
   Afterward, the connection of the intermediate forms with each other and
   with myoblasts forms a rounded shape, where the initial development of
   myotubules takes place. A fully formed myotubular and myosatellite cells
   are surrounded by a basal membrane and shape a muscle fiber. The
   skeletal muscles of the adult Caspian thin-toed gecko are mainly
   composed of white fibers. Thus, it allows the gecko to move very fast in
   a short time. Due to the small number of mitochondria in the myotubes,
   oxygen gas demand is decreased and the body is prevented from
   overheating.},

Title = {DNA Barcoding and Phylogeny of Acari Species Based on ITS and COI
   Markers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Acari harbor numerous minute species of agricultural economic
   importance, mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Great efforts have
   been established by means of recovering morphological, molecular, and
   phylogenetic traits for species identification. Traditional
   identification still relies on external diagnostic characters, which are
   limited and usually exhibit large phenotypic plasticity within the
   species, rendering them useless for species delimitation and
   identification. We decided to increase the number of sequences of the
   Acari mitochondrial COI (Cytochrome C oxidase I) marker and ITS nuclear
   ribosomal DNA region for species identification in Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae. The molecular data allow us to establish species
   boundaries and phylogenetic relationships among several clades of Acari,
   mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Sequence comparisons between
   complete COI and the Acari mitochondrial COI, ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, and ITS2
   among all Acari sequences have demonstrated that the selected regions,
   even small, gave enough informative positions for both species'
   identification and phylogenetic studies. Analyses of both DNA regions
   have unveiled their use as species identification characters, with
   special emphasis on Acari mitochondrial COI for Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae species in comparison with the Folmer fragment, which has
   been universally used as a barcode marker. We demonstrated that the
   Acari mitochondrial COI region is also a suitable marker to establish a
   barcode dataset for Acari identification. Our phylogenetic analyses are
   congruent with other recent works, showing that Acari is a monophyletic
   group, of which Astigmata, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Oribatida, and
   Prostigmata are also monophyletic.},

Abstract = {The study of avian species diversity and abundance at the Taunsa Barrage
   Ramsar site was carried out from September 2019 to March 2020. Taunsa
   Barrage is an important wetland for international and local migratory
   birds, including waterfowls, waders, and long-distance migrant avifauna.
   Data were collected by direct counts made on four-point transects
   representing a disturbance gradient due to humans and different
   habitats. Species diversity indices, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
   other statistical methods were used to analyze data. A total of 150
   avian species of 19 orders and 53 families were recorded. These included
   66 migrant species and 84 resident species. The spotting of ten globally
   threatened species also highlights the importance of wetland for avian
   species. On average, 1511 +/- 373 (mean +/- SD) species of birds were
   recorded every month. Shannon's diversity index indicated that Transect
   Point 2 had higher species diversity (H'=3.779), followed by Transect
   Points 3, 4, and 1 (H'=3.769, H'=3.491, and H'=3.457, respectively).
   Evenness index showed that birds evenly distributed in September
   (E=0.5584) than November (E=0.3109). ANOVA showed a significant
   difference (F=4.800, df=3, P=0.002) of avian diversity and abundance
   among the transect points. But there was no statistically significant
   interaction between months (F=1.23, df=6, P=0.233). The results showed
   that the Taunsa Barrage Ramsar site harbors plenty of resident migratory
   and threatened bird species. Hence, it is important to protect its
   habitat and need to protect avian diversity by overcoming major threats.},

Abstract = {Species with large distributions provide unique opportunities to test
   how geography has influenced biotic diversification. In this work, we
   aimed to explore the effect of geographic barriers on the distribution
   of the phenotypic and genetic variation of a spider species that is
   widespread in continental and insular America. We obtained an alignment
   of the mitochondrial locus Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) for 408
   individuals across the geographic range of Gasteracantha cancriformis.
   We used phylogenetics, population genetics, and morphology to explore
   the genetic and phenotypic variation of this species. We found five
   genetically differentiated and geographically structured populations.
   Three of them are distributed in continental America, separated by the
   Andes mountains, and two are in the Caribbean and Galapagos Islands.
   Some of these geographic clades shared haplotypes between them, which
   may be a consequence of dispersal. We detected at least 20 phenotypes of
   G. cancriformis, some of which were exclusive to a geographic region,
   while others occurred in multiple regions. We did not observe
   well-defined morphological differences across male genitalia. This
   evidence suggests that G. cancriformis is a widespread species with high
   phenotypic variation that should be explored in more depth.},

Title = {A hidden Markov model to estimate homozygous-by-descent probabilities
   associated with nested layers of ancestors},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {38-51},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inbreeding results from the mating of related individuals and has
   negative consequences because it brings together deleterious variants in
   one individual. Genomic estimates of the inbreeding coefficients are
   preferred to pedigree-based estimators as they measure the realized
   inbreeding levels and they are more robust to pedigree errors. Several
   methods identifying homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments with hidden
   Markov models (HMM) have been recently developed and are particularly
   valuable when the information is degraded or heterogeneous (e.g.,
   low-fold sequencing, low marker density, heterogeneous genotype quality
   or variable marker spacing). We previously developed a multiple HBD
   class HMM where HBD segments are classified in different groups based on
   their length (e.g., recent versus old HBD segments) but we recently
   observed that for high inbreeding levels with many HBD segments, the
   estimated contributions might be biased towards more recent classes
   (i.e., associated with large HBD segments) although the overall
   estimated level of inbreeding remained unbiased. We herein propose a new
   model in which the HBD classification is modelled in successive nested
   levels with decreasing expected HBD segment lengths, the underlying
   exponential rates being directly related to the number of generations to
   the common ancestor. The non-HBD classes are now modelled as a mixture
   of HBD segments from later generations and shorter non-HBD segments
   (i.e., both with higher rates). The new model has improved statistical
   properties and performs better on simulated data compared to our
   previous version. We also show that the parameters of the model are
   easier to interpret and that the model is more robust to the choice of
   the number of classes. Overall, the new model results in an improved
   partitioning of inbreeding in different HBD classes and should be
   preferred. (C)\& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The curse of the plateau. Measuring confidence in human mortality
   estimates at extreme ages},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {24-36},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In recent years, the importance of describing mortality at the limits of
   the life span has led to a number of relevant and controversial studies.
   Whereas considerable efforts have been devoted to collecting data and
   estimating models on the oldest-old individuals, the testing of
   statistical confidence about the conclusions of analyses at extreme ages
   has been largely neglected. How certain can we be in saying that the
   risk of dying increases, levels out, or, paradoxically, decreases over
   age 105? Can we recognize particular mortality age patterns at such high
   ages? In this paper, it is shown that very little can be confidently
   asserted about mortality at extreme ages. Instead of analyzing actual
   data, we perform a series of simulation studies mimicking actual
   scenarios from controlled mechanisms. Our findings are thus robust with
   respect to factors such as particular observation schemes,
   heterogeneity, and data quality issues. Given the sample sizes currently
   available and the levels of mortality experienced in present
   populations, we show that before age 110, only a Gompertzian increase of
   mortality may be detected. Afterwards a plateau will be regularly
   recognized as the most suitable pattern, regardless of the complexity of
   the true underlying mortality. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {92-104},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We study a finite population of individuals evolving through mutation
   and selection. We generalize the Eigen quasispecies model to a finite
   population with the Moran model. This model also presents an asymptotic
   phase transition, and a proper definition of the critical parameter is
   discussed. We retrieve the same expression for the error threshold
   appearing in the Eigen model along with a correction term due to the
   finiteness of the population. To achieve this, we estimate the average
   lifetime of master sequences and find it grows like an exponential in
   the size of the population. Our technique consists in bounding from
   above and below the number of master sequences in the Moran model by two
   simpler birth and death chains. The expectation of this lifetime is then
   computed with the help of explicit formulas which are in turn expanded
   with Laplace method. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   component},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {22-37},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We introduce a new model for plant metapopulations with a seed bank
   component, living in a fragmented environment in which local extinction
   events are frequent. This model is an intermediate between population
   dynamics models with a seed bank component, based on the classical
   Wright- Fisher model, and Stochastic Patch Occupancy Models (SPOMs) used
   in metapopulation ecology. Its main feature is the use of ``ghost ``
   individuals, which can reproduce but with a very strong selective
   disadvantage against ``real `` individuals, to artificially ensure a
   constant population size. We show the existence of an extinction
   threshold above which persistence of the subpopulation of ``real ``
   individuals is not possible, and investigate how the seed bank
   characteristics affect this extinction threshold. We also show the
   convergence of the model to a SPOM under an appropriate scaling,
   bridging the gap between individual-based models and occupancy models.

Title = {The effect of human vaccination behaviour on strain competition in an
   infectious disease: An imitation dynamic approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {62-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Strain competition plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of
   multiple pathogen outbreaks in a population. Competition may lead to
   exclusion of some pathogens, while it may influence the invasion of an
   emerging mutant in the population. However, little emphasis has been
   given to understand the influence of human vaccination choice on
   pathogen competition or strain invasion for vaccine-preventable
   infectious diseases. Coupling game dynamic framework of vaccination
   choice and compartmental disease transmission model of two strains, we
   explore invasion and persistence of a mutant in the population despite
   having a lower reproduction rate than the resident one. We illustrate
   that higher perceived strain severity and lower perceived vaccine
   efficacy are necessary conditions for the persistence of a mutant
   strain. The numerical simulation also extends these invasion and
   persistence analyses under asymmetric cross-protective immunity of these
   strains. We show that the dynamics of this cross-immunity model under
   human vaccination choices is determined by the interplay of parameters
   defining the cross-immune response function, perceived risk of
   infection, and vaccine efficacy, and it can exhibit invasion and
   persistence of mutant strain, even complete exclusion of resident strain
   in the regime of sufficiently high perceived risk. We conclude by
   discussing public health implications of the results, that proper risk
   communication in public about the severity of the disease is an
   important task to reduce the chance of mutant invasion. Thus,
   understanding pathogen competitions under social interactions and
   choices may be an important component for policymakers for strategic
   decision-making. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Conformity and content-biased cultural transmission in the evolution of
   altruism},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {52-61},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The evolution of altruism has been extensively modeled under the
   assumption of genetic transmission, whereas the dynamics under cultural
   transmission are less well understood. Previous research has shown that
   cultural transmission can facilitate the evolution of altruism by
   increasing (1) the probability of adopting the altruistic phenotype, and
   (2) assortment between altruists. We incorporate vertical and oblique
   transmission, which can be conformist or anti-conformist, into models of
   parental care, sibling altruism, and altruism between individuals that
   meet assortatively. If oblique transmission is conformist, it becomes
   easier for altruism to invade a population of non-altruists as the
   probability of vertical transmission increases. If oblique transmission
   is anti-conformist, decreasing vertical transmission facilitates
   invasion by altruism in the assortative meeting model, whereas in other
   models, there is a trade-off: greater vertical transmission produces
   greater assortment among genetically related altruists, but lowers the
   probability of adopting altruism via anti-conformity. Compared to
   conditions for invasion under genetic transmission, e.g., Hamilton's
   rule, we show that invasion can be easier with sufficiently strong
   anti-conformity, and in some models, with sufficiently high assortment
   even if oblique transmission is conformist. We also explore invasion by
   an allele A that increases individuals' content bias for altruism, in
   the absence of other forms of cultural transmission. If costs and
   benefits combine additively, A invades under previously known
   conditions. If costs and benefits combine multiplicatively, invasion by
   A and by altruism become more difficult than in the corresponding
   additive models. (C) 2021 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Cryptic Marine Diversity in the Northern Arabian Gulf: An Integrative
   Approach Uncovers a New Species of Oyster (Bivalvia: Ostreidae), Ostrea
   oleomargarita},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {Animal biodiversity is greatly underestimated in nontemperate marine
   regions, especially for intertidal benthic organisms such as oysters.
   Recent surveys in the northern Arabian Gulf suggest the presence of
   numerous unidentified species, some of which form shallow reef
   ecosystems while others are cryptic and found under rocks. In this
   study, we focused on small oysters from Kuwait, which show typical
   characteristics in common with the genus Ostrea except for the presence
   of lophine chomata that would link it to the genera Lopha, Dendostrea,
   and Alectryonella. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial and
   nuclear markers unambiguously placed the Kuwait oyster within the
   Ostreinae as a sister to the Japanese species Ostrea futamiensis. The
   hypothesis that the Kuwait oyster represents a new species was assessed
   with phylogenetic and species delimitation methods combined with a
   morphological assessment. Results corroborated the Kuwait oysters as a
   new species herein described as Ostrea oleomargarita Oliver, Salvi, and
   Al-Kandari, sp. nov. The phylogeny of the Ostreinae shows extensive
   disagreement between morphology-based genera and phylogenetic clades.
   The genus Ostrea is polyphyletic, and the form and distribution of
   taxonomic characters such as chomata are not as definitive as suggested
   in previous studies. This study, along with other recent investigations,
   confirmed the Arabian Gulf as a key region for discovering marine animal
   diversity and suggested a possible biogeographic divide between the
   Eastern and Western Indo-Pacific. A pattern that has been documented in
   a growing number of taxa and that warrants further research attention.},

Title = {A New Interactive Web-Based Polytomous Key for Species Identification of
   Pin Nematodes of the Genus Paratylenchus Micoletzky, 1922 (Nematoda:
   Paratylenchinae) with the Use of Ribosomal and Mitochondrial Genes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Pin nematodes of the genus Paratylenchus comprise 140 species. This
   group of nematodes is characterized by a quite homogeneous morphology
   and cosmopolitan distribution and is prevalent in cultivated and natural
   soil ecosystems. The present study describes the first interactive and
   illustrated web-assisted polytomous identification key for the genus
   Paratylenchus. The updated Paratylenchus species polytomous key was
   based on a wide list of 24 diagnostic characters generated for the 140
   species comprising this genus. Here we developed a web-assisted method
   to achieve an easy and accurate Paratylenchus species characterization
   that will greatly improve the identification of these plant-parasitic
   nematodes for many diagnostic laboratories and researchers. However,
   this identification needs to be completed with the use of molecular
   markers available for the species due to the existence of species
   complexes studied in former researches. This idea is pointed in the
   polytomous key in the specific species complexes up-to-know. In some
   cases, the presence in the soil as survival stage of few individuals in
   the fourth-stage juvenile (J4) required the use of molecular markers for
   species identification. We suggest the use of at least a fragment of
   mitochondrial COI gene for species identification or the combination of
   nuclear D2-D3 regions of the 28S rRNA and the COI to complement each
   marker. However, for some species complexes, the use of the D2-D3
   regions alone has not enough resolution to separate the putative species
   inside the species complex. Web-based polytomous key was constructed
   using the free software Xper3, for computers and mobile devices
   (smartphones, tablets, and pocket PCS).},

Abstract = {The majority of population genetic theory assumes fully haploid or
   diploid organisms with obligate sexuality, despite complex life cycles
   with alternating generations being commonly observed. To reveal how
   natural selection and genetic drift shape the evolution of
   haploid-diploid populations, we analyze a stochastic genetic model for
   populations that consist of a mixture of haploid and diploid
   individuals, allowing for asexual reproduction and niche separation
   between haploid and diploid stages. Applying a diffusion approximation,
   we derive the fixation probability and describe its dependence on the
   reproductive values of haploid and diploid stages, which depend strongly
   on the extent of asexual reproduction in each phase and on the
   ecological differences between them. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Prophalangopsidae was a diverse family during the Late Mesozoic, but the
   variation and sexual dimorphism in their forewing morphologies are
   rarely discussed. Based on 43 specimens - of both sexes - from eight
   species, an investigation into wing venation variation among/within
   species of Prophalangopsidae was performed using geometric morphometrics
   and morphological comparisons. The results indicate that wing characters
   are reliable for taxonomy in fossil Prophalangopsidae and that variation
   in wing shape and venation is common within species. The structures of
   the forewings are analogous between sexes within species, and it is
   possible to pair males and females for a fossil species. Due to the
   potential existence of synonyms arising from the lack of knowledge on
   wing venation variation within species and sexes, the species richness
   of fossil prophalangopsids is probably over-estimated. The role of wing
   venation characters in systematics and phylogenetic analysis needs to be
   further analysed. In addition, two new species of Prophalangopsidae from
   the Middle Jurassic are described.},

Title = {Variances and covariances of linear summary statistics of segregating
   sites},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {95-108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Each mutation in a population sample of DNA sequences can be classified
   by the number of sequences that inherit the mutant nucleotide, the
   resulting frequencies are known as mutations of different sizes or site
   frequency spectrum. Many summary statistics can be defined as a linear
   function of these frequencies. A flexible class of such linear summary
   statistics is explored analytically in this paper which include several
   well-known quantities, such as the number of segregating sizes and the
   mean number of nucleotide differences between two sequences. Some
   asymptotic variances and covariances are obtained while the analytical
   formulas for the variances and covariances of nine such linear summary
   statistics are derived, most of which are unknown to date. This study
   not only provides some theoretical foundations for exploring linear
   summary statistics, but also provides some newlinear summary statistics
   that may be utilized for analyzing sample polymorphism. Furthermore it
   is showed that a newly developed linear summary statistics has a smaller
   variance almost uniformly than Watterson's estimator, and that a class
   of linear summary statistics given too heavy weights on mutations of
   smaller sizes result in asymptotically non-zero variance. (C) 2022

Title = {Hominin forager technology, food sharing, and diet breadth},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {37-48},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We propose a predator-prey model to explain diachronic changes in
   Palaeolithic diet breadth. The fraction of rapidly-reproducing
   hard-to-catch hares and birds among small animals in the hominin diet
   shows a significant increase between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic
   in the Levant, with an associated decrease in slowly-reproducing
   easily-caught tortoises. Our model interprets this fraction in terms of
   foraging effort allocated to, and foraging efficiency for each of these
   two classes of resource, in addition to their abundances. We focus on
   evolutionary adjustments in the allocation of foraging effort. The
   convergence stable strategy (CSS) of foraging effort and the dietary
   fraction of hares/birds are both highly sensitive to variation in the
   foraging efficiencies, which may have been upgraded by advanced
   technology introduced from Africa or developed locally. A positive
   correlation (not necessarily a cause and effect relationship) is
   observed between this fraction and forager population when the foraging
   efficiency for hares/birds is varied. Overexploitation can however
   result in a reduction of both diet breadth and forager population, as
   can food sharing within the forager group. Food sharing is routine among
   recent (and perhaps also Palaeolithic) foragers. We speculate that some
   controversial issues regarding this public goods problem might be
   resolved if we could incorporate sexual selection into our model. (c)

Volume = {19},
Number = {19},
Pages = {1367-1393},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Pareiasaurs were relatively abundant, globally-distributed, herbivorous
   parareptiles of the mid to late Permian. The basal-most forms, all
   members of the Bradysauria, are restricted to the Guadalupian
   (mid-Permian) of South Africa and went extinct in the late Capitanian
   near the top of the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone. Currently four
   species are recognized in this group: Bradysaurus seeleyi, B. baini,
   Embrithosaurus schwarzi and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. These taxa have
   been poorly defined historically and based on a limited number of
   specimens, leaving the taxonomic diversity of the group open to doubt
   and limiting their utility in biostratigraphy. Here, we present our
   fourth and final contribution to improve the understanding of this group
   by providing a taxonomical and phylogenetic review, updated
   stratigraphical ranges, and updated diagnoses for each taxon within
   Bradysauria. Bradysaurus seeleyi is synonymized with Bradysaurus baini,
   resulting in three valid mid-Permian pareiasaur taxa: Bradysaurus baini,
   Embrithosaurus schwarzi and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. Our cladistic
   analysis of cranial and postcranial characters supports the monophyly of
   Bradysauria with five synapomorphies. Embrithosaurus schwarzi is
   recovered as the sister taxon to a clade containing Bradysaurus baini
   and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. By identifying 157 pareiasaur specimens in
   fossil collections we show that the Bradysauria are stratigraphically
   restricted to the Abrahamskraal Formation of the Beaufort Group and
   suggest a staggered appearance. Bradysaurus baini is first to appear,
   followed by Nochelesaurus alexanderi, and lastly by Embrithosaurus
   schwarzi. All three taxa perished during the Capitanian mass extinction,
   and have their highest occurrences near the top of the Abrahamskraal
   Formation.},

Title = {Re-description of the sexually dimorphic peltopleuriform fish
   Wushaichthys exquisitus (Middle Triassic, China): taxonomic implications
   and phylogenetic relationships},

Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Wushaichthys exquisitus, a small fish from the Ladinian of Xingyi,
   Guizhou Province, southern China, was named a few years ago and
   interpreted as the most primitive species in the Thoracopteridae
   (Triassic `flying' fishes with a Euro-Asian distribution). However, this
   hypothesis was questioned, because Wushaichthys also shares features
   with Peltopleuridae. A detailed morphological re-description of
   Wushaichthys was conducted based on new specimens, plus a revision of
   previously studied ones, as well as of members of Peripeltopleurus and
   thoracopterids, and their relationships were tested with a phylogenetic
   analysis based on 137 characters and 54 taxa. The results suggest that
   Wushaichthys is a member of a Glade that is interpreted here as the new
   superfamily Thoracopteroidea, which contains Wushaichthyidae fam. nov.
   (Wushaichthys Peripeltopleurus) and Thoracopteridae and is the sister
   taxon of the nonmonophyletic Peltopleuridae among Peltopleuriformes.
   Thoracopteroidea superfam. nov. is strongly supported by numerous
   synapomorphies (e.g. frontal (= parietal) bone slightly expanded
   laterally; posttemporal contacts the extrascapular anterolaterally
   separating it from its counterpart; suspensorium is vertically oriented;
   narrow and deep rectangular preopercle, vertically oriented; preopercle
   sutured with the rear edge of the maxilla throughout the maxillary
   process; enlarged pectoral fins in most genera; and deeply forked
   hypocercal caudal fin). Although Thoracopteridae is monophyletic, one of
   its genera, Thoracopterus, is not. Consequently, the content of
   Thoracopteridae was re-evaluated and now includes Thoracopterus,
   Gigantopterus, Potanichthys comb. nov. and Italopterus gen. nov.
   Wushaichthyidae is supported by a unique combination of characters, and
   the results confirm it as a thoracopteroid, but not a thoracopterid. The
   characters of Wushaichthys are relevant for understanding the taxonomy
   and systematics of thoracopteroids, especially the evolutionary
   morphological modifications of the pectoral and pelvic fins and the
   lower lobe of the caudal fin, which are some of the main characters of
   these fishes.},

Abstract = {Dortokidae is an endemic family of stem-pleurodiran turtles, known
   exclusively from the Cretaceous and early Paleogene of Europe. Here we
   describe a new dortokid taxon from the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian)
   Sinpetru Formation of the southern Hajeg Basin, Romania The type
   material of Dortoka vremiri sp. nov. comprises a well-preserved carapace
   and a nearly complete plastron as well as the in situ right scapula and
   right pubis. Phylogenetic analyses performed to assess the position and
   interrelationships of Dortoka vremiri sp. nov. within Dortokidae as well
   as within the wider Pleurodira recovered the new taxon firmly nested
   within Dortokidae, and together with other dortokids, placed along the
   stem lineage of pleurodires. Our analysis provides evidence for
   allopatric speciation in Dortoka through the presence of two distinct
   lineages - an eastern and a western European lineage, respectively. A
   similar east/west disjunct distribution pattern has also been
   established previously for several vertebrate groups such as other
   turtles, dinosaurs and mammals, probably resulting from isolation due to
   the particular palaeogeographical setting of the Late Cretaceous
   European Archipelago. The phylogeny demonstrates local survival of
   Dortoka across the K-Pg boundary as the sister-taxon of D. vremiri is D.
   botanica from the uppermost Paleocene deposits of Romania and points to
   geographical selectivity, as the western lineage of Dortoka went extinct
   before the Paleogene. Osteology and novel taphonomical data imply a
   semi-terrestrial lifestyle for Kallokibotion bajazidi, a turtle
   occurring in coeval faunas with the aquatic and smaller-sized D. vremiri
   and most likely going extinct at the K-Pg boundary. Altogether, this
   pattern is consistent with selective extinction of terrestrial taxa
   previously observed for other continental vertebrate assemblages across
   the end-Cretaceous mass extinction with only two other examples from
   turtles.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of the gastropod genus Calliotropis Seguenza, 1902
   (Vetigastropoda: Calliotropidae), including fossil and living species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The taxonomic content of the genus Calliotropis and the systematic
   positions of the fossil species referred to this genus have been under
   debate because of the striking resemblance they bear to their extant
   counterparts in terms of general shell morphology and ornament pattern.
   In a recent contribution, two subgenera of Calliotropis were
   preliminarily distinguished and considered to be a result of
   ecomorphological variation translated into evolutionary changes:
   shallow-reef ecomorphotypes, representing the fossil species of
   Calliotropis (Riselloidea), and deep-water ecomorphotypes, grouping the
   living forms of Calliotropis (Calliotropis). However, this division of
   Calliotropis species was based on qualitative grounds, lacking a
   quantitative phylogenetic analysis sampling both modern and fossil taxa.
   The present research aims to comprehensively revisit this systematic
   scheme after a morphological delimitation of calliotropid lineages. We
   use a quantitative phylogenetic analysis to shed light on the
   evolutionary history of this group of gastropods. Our results indicate
   that the Mesozoic genus `Calliotropis' is not monophyletic, but living
   species comprise a monophyletic group with a Pliocene-Recent
   distribution. Fossil `Calliotropis' species represent a paraphyletic
   assemblage composed of different clades: the monophyletic Riselloidea
   (Cossmann) including only Jurassic species; a Palaeogene group
   represented by the new genus Arachnotropis gen. nov.; and a monophyletic
   Triassic group that matches the content of the previously described
   genus Trochonodus Niitzel et al., 2003. The genus Ambercyclus Ferrari et
   al., 2014 is monophyletic and also related to the above-mentioned taxa.},

Title = {A new hadrosaurid (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Late Cretaceous of

Abstract = {Here we describe a new hadrosaurid from the Upper Cretaceous
   (Campanian-Maastrichtian) Allen Formation of Rio Negro Province,
   north-west Patagonia. The new taxon is based on cranial and postcranial
   elements from subadult and adult specimens. The new taxon may have
   reached 8-9 m in total body length, and it is diagnosed by a unique
   combination of characters, including a very low maxilla with respect to
   the dentary, and a dentary with a prominent and elongate anterior
   process with a deep groove on its anterior end, among other features.
   The new taxon is known from well-preserved elements and constitutes one
   of the most complete hadrosaurids known from South America. Features of
   the teeth, cranial and postcranial bones of the new taxon overlap with
   those of other hadrosaurid specimens previously recorded from this
   continent. This new evidence allows us to recognize that Secernosaurus
   koerneri, Bonapartesaurus rionegrensis and `Kritosaurus' australis are
   valid taxa. The latter can be distinguished from the other South
   American taxa, as well as from Kritosaurus from North America. Thus, a
   new generic name is proposed for the species `Kritosaurus' australis.
   Phylogenetic analysis recovers a new Glade of South American
   hadrosaurids composed of the new taxon, `Kritosaurus' australis,
   Bonapartesaurus and Secernosaurus. The new South American Glade is
   tentatively nested among Kritosaurini and is supported by several
   traits, including an ilium with a subhorizontal ridge separating the
   preacetabular notch from the pubic pedicle, a longitudinal ridge on the
   dorsal surface of the postacetabular process, and a twisted distal end
   of the postacetabular process. The recovery of a monophyletic Glade of
   South American hadrosaurids indicates that the history of the Glade on
   Gondwanan landmasses is far from well understood, and new discoveries
   may change the current picture of the taxonomy and phylogenetic
   relationships of southern duckbilled dinosaurs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We report a new small podocnemidid, Gestemys powelli gen. et sp. nov.,
   based on one nearly complete skull, lower jaw, two shells, and remains
   of the appendicular skeleton belonging to two specimens from the Eocene
   Geste Formation of the San Antonio de la Cobres Basin, Salta Province,
   north-western Argentina. As in other podocnemidid genera, Gestemys
   exhibits a fully developed and medially extensive cavum pterygoidei, an
   incisura columellae auris enclosing the stapes and Eustachian tube, and
   lacks an exoccipital quadrate contact. Gestemys powelli bears a huge
   foramen palatinum posterius and a short pterygoid flange that does not
   reach the basisphenoid suture, exposing the cavum pterygoid.
   Phylogenetic analyses place Gestemys powelli as a member of
   Podocnemididae more closely related to Erymnochelyinae than
   Podocnemidinae. In regards to the palaeoenvironmental settings of the
   Palaeogene formations (Maiz Gordo and Geste) of north-western Argentina,
   at least two features differentiate the palaeoenvironment where G.
   powelli was recovered and those of other podocnemidid turtles from the
   Maiz Gordo Formation: 1) G. powelli was found in situ with very little
   re-working; and 2) in contrast to the muddy rocks indicating the
   marginal lacustrine setting and humid climate of the Maiz Gordo
   Formation, G. powelli is associated with a coarse-grained floodplain
   setting and a dry, temperate climate. Such differences highlight the
   contrasting environmental dynamics in which podocnemidid turtles lived
   during the Palaeogene.},

Abstract = {Four complete isolated neurocrania excavated during the nineteenth
   century in the Autun Basin (Saone-et-Loire, France) were used by Heyler
   \& Poplin (1982) to erect two species: the symmoriiform Bibractopiscis
   niger and the xenacanthiform Orthacanthus commailli. However, the
   specimens have not been mechanically prepared and only a portion of
   their anatomy is available, complicating their systematic attribution.
   We revise their systematic status by using X-ray computed
   microtomography and new comparative material from the Bourbon
   l'Archambault Basin (Allier, France). This method allows access to the
   hidden anatomy of the specimens and new systematic revision: we propose
   O. commailli to be left in open nomenclature as ?Xenacanthimorpha. The
   specimens attributed to B. niger encompass two distinct morphologies:
   the holotype, one paratype and a neurocranium from the Bourbon
   l'Archambault Basin are identified as cf. Triodus sp. The last paratype
   is left in open nomenclature as `Ctenacanthiformes' indet. We included
   these neurocrania in geometric morphometric and cladistic analyses of a
   large sample of Palaeozoic chondrichthyans. Based on the results we
   propose an evolutionary scenario for the neurocranial transition between
   the orders `Ctenacanthiformes' and Xenacanthiformes. This transition
   mostly affects the ethmo-orbital region. The revision of the diversity
   of these chondrichthyan faunas calls into question potential differences
   in trophic structures between the different European
   Carboniferous-Permian basins.},

Abstract = {Archaebalaenoptera eusebioi is a new late Miocene (Tortonian)
   balaenopterid species from the Aguada de Lomas locality in the Pisco
   Formation, Peru. It is dated to 8.85-7.93 Ma and is represented by a
   nearly complete skull with cervical vertebrae. Its inferred body length
   and mass are respectively c. 7 m and 7-11 tonnes. Archaebalaenoptera
   eusebioi is characterized by a short and wide rostrum, outward bowed
   dentary with typical balaenopterid characters in the posterior portion
   (posteriorly faced articular surface of the mandibular condyle,
   comparatively long distance between condyle and coronoid process,
   vestigial postcoronoid crest and fossa) and wide temporal fossa with
   scarcely protruding temporal crest and posteriorly placed posterior apex
   of nuchal crest. Its morphology suggests that it fed similarly to the
   modern balaenopterid whales but with a comparatively wider gape and,
   possibly, with a limited number of ventral throat grooves.
   Palaeobiogeographical analysis shows that Archaebalaenoptera originated
   in the North Atlantic and the invasion of South Pacific and
   Mediterranean occurred by subsequent dispersal events. Our results
   suggest that the North Atlantic acted as a centre of origin for many
   balaenopterid radiations and as a starting basin for recurrent invasions
   of other oceanic basins.},

Title = {Phylogeny of the amphibamiform temnospondyls: the relationship of taxa
   known by adults, larvae and neotenes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Amphibamiformes, small temnospondyls from late Palaeozoic rocks,
   have been increasingly considered as the stem-group of some or all
   extant amphibians (Lissamphibia). Their relationships have become
   intensely studied after the discovery of new taxa and the revision of
   poorly known ones, but understanding is hampered by the fact that
   amphibamiforms fall into two very distinct groups: (a) terrestrial taxa
   known by adults only (Amphibamidae, Micropholidae) and (b) aquatic taxa
   known by larvae and neotenic adults (Branchiosauridae). The
   Branchiosauridae were recognized as a clade supported by a suite of
   larval synapomorphies, but the unknown larval morphology of the
   terrestrial clades leaves the question open to whether some
   branchiosaurid apomorphies might have been more widely distributed.
   Recently, some branchiosaurid specimens from NATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
   ACUTErany (Czech Republic) were proposed to be larvae of olsoniforms and
   amphibamids, and together with a revision of ancient branchiosaurid-like
   taxa from the United States and France prompt a re-analysis of this
   issue. In a phylogenetic analysis of 48 taxa and 113 characters, the
   Branchiosauridae were found to be monophyletic and nest in an unresolved
   trichotomy with Amphibamidae and the putative relatives of Lissamphibia.
   The present analysis finds the hypothesized olsoniform larvae from NATIN
   SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTErany to be adults of Branchiosaurus
   salamandroides, whereas some of the larvae from Mazon Creek (Illinois,
   USA) are not branchiosaurids, but immature specimens of the amphibamid
   Amphibamus grandiceps. Within branchiosaurids, four clades have been
   identified: (a) the Carboniferous Anthracobamus clade (Anthracobamus,
   Montceaubatrachus), (b) the mostly Carboniferous Branchiosaurinae
   (Branchiosaurus, Milnererpeton) and two largely Permian clades, the
   newly defined Apateoninae (genus Apateon) and Leptorophinae
   (Melanerpeton, Leptorophus, Schoenfelderpeton) clade. Branchiosaurid
   evolution involved a trend towards an enhanced paedomorphosis, a
   modification of branchial teeth, and successive reduction of bone in the
   scales and pectoral girdle.},

Abstract = {The genus Testudo was considered, for more than two centuries, to group
   almost all tortoises that are part of current biodiversity (i.e. the
   members of Testudinidae), as well as the extinct representatives of that
   successful lineage. However, only three extant species, as well as
   scarce late Miocene to late Pliocene extinct ones, are now considered
   attributable to that genus. The fossil record of the extinct
   representatives is restricted to postcranial elements. They correspond
   almost exclusively to shells or partial shells, most of the species
   being known on the basis of only one individual. Abundant material of
   testudinids from the late Miocene of eastern Romania (Cretesti 1 fossil
   site, Vaslui County) is presented here. This material is attributable to
   Testudo, representing a new species. This find is not only relevant for
   the abundance of specimens, but they stand out for their unusually good
   preservation. Most of them are represented by partial skeletons,
   preserving not only several bones in anatomical connection but also some
   regions of the peculiar ossified dermal armour that covered their limbs.
   Two of these skeletons preserve the skull, which allows us to perform
   both the first three-dimensional reconstruction of the cranial anatomy
   and the first neuroanatomical study of an extinct member of Testudo. The
   best-preserved extinct species of the reference genus of the only extant
   lineage of tortoises (i.e. Testudinidae), Testudo lohanica sp. nov., is
   characterized in detail.},

Title = {Xinjiangchelyid turtles from the Middle Jurassic of the Berezovsk coal

   variation, relationships and palaeobiogeographic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the description of a new species of
   xinjiangchelyid turtle - Annemys variabilis sp. nov. - represented by
   thousands of isolated bones and several more complete specimens from the
   Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) Itat Formation of the Berezovsk coal mine,
   Krasnoyarsk Territory, western Siberia, Russia. The description is based
   on a sample of the best-preserved specimens. The new species differs
   from other Annemys spp. by a combination of cranial and shell
   characters. The basisphenoids (about 200 specimens) of A. variabilis
   demonstrate variation in 12 characters, some of which are reported in
   turtles for the first time. About 20 shell characters of A. variabilis
   are subject to ontogenetic or interindividual variation. Some of these
   characters are variable in other Annemys spp. and other
   xinjiangchelyids. The formula of the cervical vertebrae
   {[}(2(3()4()5()6()7()8) or (2(3()4()5()6()7()8(] with two opisthocoelous
   vertebrae (2 and 3), four or five amphicoelous vertebrae (4-7 or 4-8),
   and one procoelous vertebra is unique for this species among
   xinjiangchelyids, which were previously known to have only amphicoelous
   cervicals. Other characters of the non-shell postcranium correspond to
   those of other xinjiangchelyids. Of the three phylogenetic analyses
   performed in this study, Analysis 1 does not support the monophyly of
   either Xinjiangchelyidae or Annemys, Analysis 2 shows paraphyly of
   Xinjiangchelyidae and monophyly of the Annemys clade (A. latiens, A.
   levensis, A. variabilis and A. wusu), and Analysis 3 supports monophyly
   of the Annemys clade with A. latiens, A. levensis and A. variabilis,
   only in the majority rule consensus tree. The diversity of the turtle
   assemblage of the Itat Formation is re-assessed as containing 2-3 taxa
   (A. variabilis {[}=Testudines indet. 2], Testudines indet. 1 and 3),
   which is in agreement with similar diversities seen in some other Middle
   Jurassic Asian turtle assemblages. The known record of Annemys spp. is
   restricted to the northern part of Asia.

Abstract = {The Silurian Waukesha Lagerstatte of Wisconsin, USA, hosts a fauna of
   distinctive soft-bodied organisms, including a range of graptolites,
   worms, trilobites and uncommon arthropods, but otherwise lacks most of
   the shelly fauna typical of contemporaneous deposits. While several
   species have been described, much of the Waukesha biota remains
   understudied. Here, we examine numerous specimens of a previously
   unnamed and undescribed vermiform arthropod that bears a cephalic
   carapace, a suite of specialized head appendages, a long, segmented
   trunk, and a battery of small swimming appendages. The taxonomic and
   phylogenetic evaluations presented herein establish this taxon as a
   novel genus and species, Acheronauta stimulapis gen. et sp. nov.,
   plausibly positioned within the basal mandibulates. Our phylogenetic
   analyses suggest that a new arthropod clade may be warranted, comprising
   Acheronauta gen. nov., Captopodus, and the thylacocephalans.},

Abstract = {The family Cynodontidae is composed of freshwater fishes inhabiting
   drainages east of the Andes in South America. Its fossil record is
   mostly represented by isolated teeth that are difficult to identify.
   Here we describe fossil cranial remains of the extant species Hydrolycus
   scomberoides as well as isolated teeth that were identified as
   Hydrolycus and cf. Rhaphiodon in sediments of the late Pliocene Ware
   Formation in the Guajira Peninsula, west of the Andes. Novel,
   phylogenetically informative characters were found including the number
   of symphysial teeth, the plane of insertion of the leading teeth onto
   the dentary, the presence of accessory posterior dentigerous patches,
   and depressions and outline of the dentary. We performed a phylogenetic
   analysis combining morphological and molecular characters including both
   extant and extinct specimens, producing a well-resolved topology that
   recovers a novel sister-group relationship between the genera Hydrolycus
   and Cynodon, while the genus Rhaphiodon falls to the base of this clade.
   This contradicts earlier studies recovering Hydrolycus and Rhaphiodon as
   sister taxa. The phylogenetic position of Hydrolycus wallacei was found
   to be unstable. The occurrence of H. scomberoides in the late Pliocene
   of Guajira is a puzzle that could be explained by different mechanisms,
   including a persistent drainage connection across the Andes during the
   late Pliocene, and/or the result of severe drying and subsequent
   extinction.},

Title = {A new cyprinid from the Oligocene of Qaidam Basin, north-eastern Tibetan

Abstract = {The Qaidam Basin, lying in the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, is
   key to understanding the Cenozoic climatic and biological changes that
   have occurred on the plateau; however, information from a
   palaeontological perspective on this Palaeogene basin is scant.
   Recently, fossil cyprinids were found in the middle portion of the
   Shangganchaigou Formation (= Upper Ganchaigou Formation; Oligocene) in
   the north-western Qaidam Basin. These share many osteological characters
   with barbines and `morphologically primitive clade schizothoracines' (=
   primitive schizothoracines; i.e. Schizothorax and Aspiorhynchus), and
   they closely resemble the latter in the size and shape of the scales:
   body scales are small and oval; the number of lateral line scales
   exceeds 100; and the long-oval scales from the pre-anal region are very
   similar to the `anal scales', which are unique to schizothoracines.
   Compared with another fossil fish, Paleoschizothorax qaidamensis, from
   the same formation, the major differences are: (1) the posterior part of
   the entopterygoid in the new material is normal and not expanded while
   that of P. qaidamensis is obviously expanded; and (2) the premaxilla
   process of maxilla is well developed in P. qaidamensis but weak in the
   new specimens. Therefore, they are described as a new species of the
   fossil genus Paleoschizothorax (subfamily Schizothoracinae):
   Paleoschizothorax diluculum sp. nov. A phylogenetic analysis, which
   included 13 extant genera and three fossil forms of barbines and
   schizothoracines and 70 morphological characters, also supports the
   close relationship between P. diluculum and primitive schizothoracines.
   A preliminary correlation analysis suggests that the degree of reduction
   of body scale size is negatively correlated with habitat mean
   temperatures among most Chinese cyprinids. Moreover, we speculate that
   the `primitive schizothoracines' likely originated in the
   north-eastern-central Tibetan Plateau based on the fossil records and
   molecular phylogeny of the extant taxa.},

Title = {Careful amendment of morphological data sets improves phylogenetic
   frameworks: re-evaluating placement of the fossil Amiskwia sagittiformis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Cambrian fossil Amiskwia sagittiformis has puzzled palaeontologists
   for more than a century, but recent re-investigation of its morphology
   suggested a close relationship with the bilaterian clade Gnathifera,
   comprising Rotifera, Gnathostomulida and Micrognathozoa. Since Amiskwia
   has already been considered closely related to Chaetognatha, this new
   interpretation of its morphology supports recent molecular and
   developmental studies finding a close phylogenetic relationship between
   Chaetognatha and Gnathifera. The recent re-description of the jaw
   apparatus of Amiskwia with the first phylogenetic analysis by Vinther \&
   Parry (2019) found a rather surprising topology with Amiskwia and
   Chaetognatha being sister groups and nested inside Gnathifera.
   Furthermore, a subsequent paper from Caron \& Cheung (2019) re-described
   the jaws of Amiskwia as very similar to the configuration found in
   Gnathostomulida, but did not include any phylogenetic analysis. Here we
   test the topology of Vinther \& Parry with various parsimony and
   Bayesian analyses, taking into account the new description of Caron \&
   Cheung with careful re-amendment of the matrix of Vinther \& Parry.
   According to our results and the recent findings on the molecular
   phylogeny of their extant members, we suggest a new systematization of
   these taxa. We recovered Amiskwia as a stem-group chaetognath within a
   clade Cucullophora nov., rejecting the Caron \& Cheung hypothesis of its
   close affinity to Gnathostomulida, and found a more consensual topology
   with monophyletic Gnathifera sister group to Cucullophora, all together
   forming the clade Chaetognathifera. Furthermore, Rotifera +
   Micrognathozoa form a clade named Gynognathifera nov. We discuss the
   characters supporting each clade and the reasons that account for the
   topology found by Vinther \& Parry. Finally, we hope that this carefully
   amended matrix focused on Gnathifera, Amiskwia and Chaetognatha,
   together with a formal classification and robust phylogeny, will be of
   use for future studies on the palaeontology and morphology of these
   clades.},

Title = {New rodents shed light on the age and ecology of late Miocene ape

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The Miocene ape (Sivapithecus) locality of Tapar in Kutch (Gujarat,
   India) has yielded a diverse rodent assemblage that includes: a new
   murine Progonomys prasadi sp. nov., a new gerbilline Myocricetodon
   gujaratensis sp. nov., a new rhizomyne Kanisamys kutchensis sp. nov. and
   a new sciurine Tamias gilaharee sp. nov., beside additional remains of
   Progonomys morganae, Dakkamys asiaticus, Prokanisamys sp., Sayimys
   sivalensis and Democricetodon fejfari. Morphometric and PAUP based
   phylogenetic analyses place Progonomys prasadi sp. nov. within the
   Progonomys lineage. The cladogram obtained for the Siwalik murines
   suggest that Progonomys was ancestral to all the modem and one extinct
   murine genera recovered from the Siwaliks. The advanced features of
   Myocricetodon gujaratensis sp. nov. indicate that it was an immigrant to
   the subcontinent in the late Miocene. The cladistic analysis performed
   on Kanisamys kutchensis sp. nov. shows that it shared several advanced
   characters with contemporaneous Kanisamys nagrii and Kanisamys
   sivalensis. Based on the biostratigraphical ranges of Siwalik rodents
   and the co-occurrence of advanced forms of new and already reported
   murines, a new gerbilline and a new sciurine, we propose an age of
   similar to 10 Ma to the primate-bearing Tapar locality. Already reported
   stable isotope data on murines, and ecological preferences of modem
   counterparts of the fossil rodents and associated sharks and rays from
   Tapar locality, indicate that the Miocene ape Sivapithecus may have
   lived in a subtropical monsoonal forest close to the coast, very
   different from the present day arid conditions.},

Title = {Towards a unifying systematic scheme of fossil and living billfishes
   (Teleostei, Istiophoridae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Extant istiophorids are open ocean apex predators that are extensively
   studied due to their ecological importance and high values for
   fisheries. Nevertheless, little is known about their evolution because
   of a fragmentary fossil record and extremely difficult taxonomy of
   fossil species. Here, we present a new phylogenetic hypothesis covering
   fossil and living istiophorids. Our results demonstrate that istiophorid
   richness is larger than previously assumed, comprising eight genera with
   15 species. The phylogenetic analysis shows that istiophorids are
   grouped into four clades: the Istiophorus Glade, which includes the
   sailfish; the Machairostra Glade, which comprises Makaira spp.,
   including two new species from the late Miocene (dagger Makaira
   colonense sp. nov. and dagger Makaira fierstini sp. nov.); the
   Gracilorostra Glade, which comprise all remaining istiophorids with
   exception of spearfishes and includes two new genera and one new species
   (dagger Morgula donosochagrense gen. et sp. nov. and dagger Spathochoira
   calvertense gen. et . comb. nov.); and the Tetrapturomorpha Glade is
   composed of the spearfishes and the extinct dagger Prototetrapturus
   courcelli gen. et . comb. nov. The family Istiophoridae shows an
   evolutionary trend toward reduction of the premaxillary thickness and
   increasing the extension of narial cavities. This reduction is related
   to an increase of adipose tissues in the rostrum base probably driven by
   the presence of the oleofera gland, an organ involved in feeding,
   healing, endothermy and hydrophobic functions. Our phylogeny shows a
   direct relationship between the rostral and cranial shape explained by
   body size and feeding behaviour. The larger istiophorids have lateral
   apophysis and the larger spines of the vertebral column. The spearfishes
   represent the smaller species of the family, with the extant Tetrapturus
   spp. first appearing in the late Pliocene. The Glade Tetrapturomorpha
   shows an extreme size reduction over time when compared with species of
   their sister Glade Gracilorostra, demonstrating an evolutionary trend
   towards size reduction.},

Title = {A new aetiocetid (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Aetiocetidae) from the late
   Oligocene of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The aetiocetids are a well-known extinct taxon of Oligocene toothed
   mysticetes in the North Pacific. They display a high degree of diversity
   contrasting with that of other tooth-bearing mysticetes such as
   mammalodontids, llanocetids and Coronodon spp. The disparate
   developmental patterns (heterochrony) and origin of the first kelp
   forests in the North Pacific during the Eocene-Oligocene transition
   might explain such diversity. Aetiocetidae have been the focus of debate
   regarding the origin of baleen and filter-feeding in Mysticeti. The
   current interpretation of aetiocetid feeding strategies is based on the
   presence of teeth, unfused mandibular symphysis and lateral palatal
   foramina. However, our understating of their feeding apparatus function
   is limited, leaving associated structures like the zygomatic arch
   unnoticed. The present study describes a new fossil of a small-sized
   mysticete (similar to 3 m long), Kaaucetus thesaurus gen. et sp. nov.,
   which belongs to Aetiocetidae. The protruded squamosal prominence and
   distinctive zygomatic process present in this new fossil highlight
   disparity in feeding morphology amongst aetiocetids. Moreover, the
   zygomatic arch complex and masticatory muscle system reconstruction are
   crucial to interpreting the likely capability of mastication (shearing
   motion) in aetiocetids and other toothed mysticetes. Lastly, the record
   of several aetiocetid genera in Mexico extends the geographical range of
   the group into the subtropical region.},

Title = {Unravelling the identity of the platanistoid Notocetus vanbenedeni
   Moreno, 1892 (Cetacea, Odontoceti) from the early Miocene of Patagonia
   (Argentina)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Platanistoidea remains one of the most evolutionarily intriguing
   lineages of toothed whales (Odontoceti). The clade comprises mostly
   extinct species from the late Oligocene-early Miocene onward and a
   single extant riverine genus (Platanista). There is an ongoing debate as
   to the membership of Platanistoidea and the causes of their near
   extinction. In Patagonia (Argentina), the most abundant platanistoid
   recorded in the lower Miocene Gaiman Formation is Notocetus vanbenedeni,
   first described by Moreno in 1892 based on two individuals. The goal of
   the present contribution is to conduct an updated anatomical,
   palaeobiological and phylogenetic analyses of Notocetus vanbenedeni and
   hence contribute to an understanding of the evolutionary history of the
   Platanistoidea. Our analyses, including at least 26 individuals (12
   undescribed), show that Notocetus vanbenedeni is a valid platanistoid
   taxon, recovered as part of a new clade. Among its most outstanding
   features, this taxon has an elevated dorsal tubercular supraorbital
   crest formed mainly by the frontal, the precursor of the pneumatized
   crest of the extant Platanista. Notocetus vanbenedeni also shows initial
   stages of the plesiomorphic bony connection between the earbones and
   skull as in Platanista, although the functional implications for hearing
   remain elusive. The nasal sac system, pterygoid sinus system and
   morphology of the earbones suggest that this species was able to hear
   high-frequency sounds and echolocate underwater, similar to extant
   odontocetes. Thus, Notocetus vanbenedeni presents a mosaic of features
   that suggest an intermediate platanistoid morphotype. Anatomical
   differences and phylogenetic analyses suggest that Peruvian specimens
   could not be referred to this species. The feeding apparatus of
   Notocetus vanbenedeni makes it the only combination suction-feeder
   recorded in the early Miocene of Patagonia and among the smallest
   odontocetes. Finally, the abundant records of Notocetus vanbenedeni in
   an inner shelf environment with freshwater influence suggest a possible
   early preference for such protected habitats.},

Abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of the species commonly referred to as
   `hypsilophodontids' remain one of the key questions in ornithischian
   dinosaur research, having profound implications for understanding the
   origin, evolution and taxonomical compositions of several more recently
   evolved neornithischian clades. Recent phylogenetic analyses have
   recovered two conflicting placements for these taxa: (1) primarily
   within Cerapoda (Ornithopoda + Marginocephalia), as a paraphyletic
   assemblage of early ornithopods; and (2) primarily outside of Cerapoda,
   within the clade Thescelosauridae. Here we assess three recent
   independent neornithischian phylogenetic studies that have recovered
   topologies congruent with one of these placements. We compare the
   compositions of these data matrices and test how each of them responds
   to manipulation of taxa and characters. The positions in which
   controversial clades are recovered is shown to be highly dependent on
   the sample of taxa analysed; however, taxon incompleteness or
   instability is not a contributing factor in altering topology. Character
   completeness and homoplasy is shown not to significantly alter tree
   topology either, although these factors can affect resolution. In one
   matrix investigated, femoral and dental characters are found to provide
   disproportionate support for the placement of key taxa outside of
   Cerapoda, and the exclusion of a small number of these characters
   results in `hypsilophodontids' falling within Ornithopoda. In contrast,
   matrices that originally recovered `hypsilophodontids' within Cerapoda
   are comparably more stable, with this array of taxa remaining in a
   consistent position throughout all analyses. There is still much work to
   be done to resolve these relationships, but our study provides several
   suggestions for future analyses with the aim of resolving areas of
   conflict within the neornithischian tree.},

Abstract = {Parvicursor remotus Karhu \& Rautian, 1996, based on a fragmentary
   skeleton from the Campanian Barungoyot Formation at Khulsan, in the Gobi
   Desert of Mongolia, is re-described in detail. Contrary to the original
   description, we find no evidence that the last dorsal vertebra is
   opisthocoelous. A biconvex last dorsal vertebra could be present in
   Parvicursor as in other parvicursorines. The transversely compressed
   sacral centrum with a sharp ventral keel is the last sacral, not the
   first sacral as originally alleged. The pelvic bones are not fused at
   the acetabulum. The holotype of P. remotus, the smallest known
   alvarezsaurid specimen, is a juvenile individual far from skeletal
   maturity. New morphological details of Parvicursor that are revealed
   include a ventral ridge on the posterior dorsal vertebrae; a horizontal
   supraacetabular crest of the ilium whose anterior end is placed anterior
   to the most ventrally projecting part of the pubic peduncle; the
   possible presence of a pubic obturator foramen; an entocondylar tuber on
   the femur; internal flexor flanges on metatarsals II and IV; a lateral
   flexor ridge on metatarsal IV; and a proximoventral notch on pedal
   phalanx IV-1. The Tugriken Shireh alvarezsaurid is not referable to
   Parvicursor because of its much larger ungual phalanx on the second
   pedal digit. Kol ghuva is excluded from Alzarezsauridae. The two
   successive sister taxa for Parvicursor are Ceratonykus and Linhenykus.
   Ceratonykus differs little from Parvicursor and might be a synonym of
   the latter. Linhenykus is very similar to Parvicursor in all overlapping
   skeletal elements. The Parvicursorinae includes all Asian Late
   Cretaceous alvarezsaurids except Qiupanykus and Nemegtonykus.},

Title = {A nearly complete skeleton of a new eusphenodontian from the Upper

Abstract = {We describe a new, small-bodied rhynchocephalian reptile, Opisthiamimus
   gregori gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of
   Wyoming, USA. Whereas many fossil rhynchocephalians are based on
   isolated incomplete jaws, the holotype of O. gregori includes most of
   the skull and postcranium and therefore represents one of the most
   complete specimens of Rhynchocephalia known from North America. We used
   micro-computed tomography to examine its skeletal anatomy in detail and
   to develop a three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull. The skull of
   O. gregori is similar to that of several non-neosphenodontian
   rhynchocephalians such as Planocephalosaurus (e.g. large orbits) and
   Clevosaurus (e.g. parietal parasagittal crests) yet exhibits a suite of
   other features related to the proal shearing mechanism that becomes
   increasingly elaborated among more phylogenetically nested taxa such as
   Sphenodon (e.g. lateral palatine tooth row parallels maxillary tooth row
   along its entire length, pyramidal dentary teeth with mesial shearing
   crests). The postcranial skeleton of O. gregori exhibits characteristics
   typical of a terrestrial rhynchocephalian. Our phylogenetic analyses use
   a substantially updated data set of 118 characters and 46 taxa, and both
   maximum parsimony and Bayesian frameworks. Results place O. gregori
   inside Eusphenodontia but outside Neosphenodontia, and therefore in a
   key position for contributing to character polarity for more deeply
   nested clades such as Clevosauridae, Sphenodontidae and Pleurosauridae.
   We also erect Leptorhynchia taxon nov., composed primarily of
   aquatically adapted taxa (e.g. Pleurosaurus, Sapheosaurus), which is
   supported by both cranial and postcranial characters. Because O. gregori
   is not particularly closely related to the other named Morrison
   rhynchocephalians (e.g. Opisthias rarus), it increases both the alpha
   and beta taxonomic diversities within the formation. Similarly, major
   differences in body size and inferred diet of the Morrison taxa imply
   considerable concomitant palaeoecological diversity just prior to a
   major global decline in rhynchocephalian diversity around the close of
   the Jurassic.},

Title = {The Ordovician diversification of sea urchins: systematics of the
   Bothriocidaroida (Echinodermata: Echinoidea)},

Abstract = {The echinoids of the order Bothriocidaroida represent the initial burst
   of sea urchin diversification. They were the first echinoids to achieve
   widespread biogeographical dispersal and achieved high levels of species
   richness compared to other clades of stem group echinoids. Following
   long-standing controversy regarding their phylogenetic affinities within
   the phylum Echinodermata, bothriocidaroids are now regarded as
   echinoids. The species- and genus-level phylogenetic relationships of
   the bothriocidaroids, are, however, less clearly known. We herein
   compile a database of bothriocidaroid occurrences, undertake detailed
   phylogenetic analyses of all named species within the Bothriocidaroida,
   and provide updated diagnoses for all species. Our phylogenetic analysis
   includes species belonging to three genera: Bothriocidaris,
   Unibothriocidaris and Neobothriocidaris. Furthermore, we describe a new
   species, Neobothriocidaris pentlandensis sp. nov., from the Silurian of
   Scotland and Sweden, using micro-computed tomography and scanning
   electron microscopy. This species has implications for understanding the
   diversity dynamics of bothriocidaroids before and after the Late
   Ordovician mass extinction and the palaeobiogeographical distribution of
   bothriocidaroids in the Silurian. Using Bayesian and parsimony-based
   phylogenetics, we demonstrate that Neobothriocidaris is a distinct
   clade, and depending upon the analytical technique, Unibothrioidaris and
   Bothriocidaris are also resolved as monophyletic. Unibothriocidaris
   appears to have become extinct in the Sandbian, while Neobothriocidaris
   and Bothriocidaris survived the Late Ordovician extinction events and
   lasted at least until the Ludlow. Furthermore, we performed statistical
   time-calibration of our phylogenetic trees and show that
   bothriocidaroids originated in the Dapingian or Darriwilian,
   diversifying in the Darriwilian to Sandbian and reaching peak diversity
   in the Sandbian and Katian. This Sandbian and Katian peak is similar to
   that observed in other echinoderm clades, as well as other animal groups
   during the Ordovician radiation, and may be linked to heightened sea
   level and expansive tropical shelves present in the Upper Ordovician,
   and to new inhabitable environments linked with Ordovician oxygenation.},

Abstract = {The Middle Jurassic lower Shaximiao Formation in Sichuan Province of
   south-western China has yielded a diverse terrestrial vertebrate fauna
   dominated by sauropod dinosaurs. However, many of these sauropods lack
   detailed descriptions or explicit phylogenetic diagnoses. Here, we
   present a comprehensive redescription of Dashanpusaurus dongi, a species
   of sauropod found only in the lower Shaximiao Formation. We define the
   revised autapomorphies of the species as follows: neural canals are
   sub-square in anterior dorsal vertebrae; the presence of a thin
   accessory lamina that contacts the prezygodiapophyseal and
   paradiapophyseal laminae of the middle dorsals, forming an angle of 75
   degrees to the horizontal; and four ridges on the anterodistal edge of
   the humerus. Often considered part of the epipophyseal-prezygapophyseal
   lamina, a strut invades the spinodiapophyseal fossa in the cervical and
   anterior dorsal vertebrae. Anatomical comparisons indicate that this
   feature was widespread among early-diverging Middle Jurassic eusauropod
   lineages. This comparative anatomical data provides an opportunity to
   revisit the phylogenetic position of Dashanpusaurus and the
   relationships of the neosauropod clade. Recovered as a macronarian, a
   better understanding of Dashanpusaurus dongi will allow for
   clarification of the origin, early evolution, and palaeogeographical
   distribution of neosauropods. This study also suggests that the
   diversity and dispersity of the neosauropod clade occurred much earlier
   than previously realized.},

Abstract = {Most Triassic terrestrial diapsids belong to two clades,
   Lepidosauromorpha or (the more diverse) Archosauromorpha. Nevertheless,
   the phylogenetic relationships of some Triassic diapsids have remained
   uncertain for decades because of the lack of preservation of
   phylogenetically relevant anatomical regions or because of unusual
   combinations of features. One of these enigmatic forms is the
   small-sized Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus from the Upper Triassic Hammer
   Creek Formation of the Newark Supergroup in Pennsylvania (USA). It was
   first identified as a procolophonid parareptile, later as a probable
   rhynchosaur archosauromorph, and more recently as an indeterminate
   neodiapsid. Here we revise the anatomy of Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus
   in order to include it for the first time in a quantitative phylogenetic
   analysis, which is focused on Permo-Triassic neodiapsids. Sphodrosaurus
   pennsylvanicus is recovered in this analysis as a doswelliid
   proterochampsian within Archosauromorpha. As a result, this taxon is
   added to the list of doswelliids known from the Carnian-Norian of the
   eastern and south-western USA. Previous authors recognized that the most
   unusual feature of Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus is its proportionally
   very large skull. Phylogenetic generalized least squares regressions
   confirmed that Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus has a larger skull than the
   vast majority of Permo-Triassic diapsids. Optimization in the phylogeny
   of the skull width to presacral length ratio shows the most likely
   scenario is that the extremely broad skull of Sphodrosaurus
   pennsylvanicus is autapomorphic, but it is not unique among
   archosauromorphs, being paralleled by hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs and
   the proterochampsian Proterochampsa barrionuevoi. Exploration of a
   morphospace of linear measurements shows that Sphodrosaurus
   pennsylvanicus shares strong similarities with the probably semi-aquatic
   Proterochampsa barrionuevoi, suggesting that the former species may have
   had a similar mode of life. A linear discriminant analysis of ungual
   functional categories found that the only preserved ungual of
   Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus was suitable for digging or some other way
   of substrate processing.},

Abstract = {Maomingosuchus acutirostris sp. nov. is a new tomistomine crocodile from
   the middle-upper Eocene deposits (late Bartonian-Priabonian age, 39-35
   Ma) of the Na Duong Basin in northern Vietnam M. acutirostris can be
   differentiated from the type species Maomingosuchus petrolicus by having
   an acute anterior tip of the premaxilla. Both species differ from
   another Maomingosuchus from Krabi (Thailand) by differences in the
   surangular-dentary suture and maxillary alveoli. According to our
   phylogenetic results, M. acutirostris seems to be the sister species to
   the group M. petrolicus + Krabi-Maomingosuchus. The close relationship
   between those three tomistomines is supported in the present
   phylogenetic analysis by three synapomorphies. In our phylogenetic
   analysis, Maomingosuchus was retrieved in a basal position forming the
   sister group to Paratomistoma + Gavialosuchus + Melitosaurus +
   Tomistoma, including the extant Tomistoma schlegelii. This phylogeny
   indicates three different dispersal events of Tomistominae from Europe
   towards eastern Asia: 1) for the stem lineage of Maomingosuchus, no
   later than the late Eocene; 2) for the stem lineage of Penghusuchus pani
   + Toyotamaphimeia machikanensis, no later than the early-middle Miocene;
   and (3) for the stem lineage of T. schlegelii, during the Neogene.},

Abstract = {We report new allotherian tooth specimens from the Middle Jurassic White
   Limestone Formation at Woodeaton Quarry (Oxfordshire), United Kingdom.
   Two teeth are assigned to Kermackodon (=Eleutherodon) oxfordensis, a
   taxon whose original generic name (Eleutherodon) was preoccupied and is
   here assigned to Kermackodon to form a new binomial combination for the
   species name. Butlerodon quadratus gen. et sp. nov. (family
   Kermackodontidae), based on 13 cheek teeth and incisors, shows dental
   features intermediate between K oxfordensis and the Late Triassic
   ``haramiyidans{''} (Haramiyavia and Thomasia). Woodeatonia parva gen. et
   sp. nov. (family indeterminate), based on three teeth, is characterized
   by its small size. A second upper molar from a multituberculate is
   identified as Hahnotherium cf H antiquum, which possesses characters
   typical for multituberculates but distinctive from ``haramiyidans{''}.
   The allotherian teeth from the Forest Marble Formation, previously
   assigned to the haramiyidans ``Eleutherodon{''}, ``Millsodon{''} and
   ``Kirtlingtonia{''}, and the multituberculate Kermackodon, are
   reinterpreted as teeth from different upper or lower dental loci of the
   same haramiyidan species K oxfordensis, which result in significant
   taxonomical modification of these allotherians ({''}haramiyidans{''} and
   multituberculates). Given that Kermackodon has been regarded as a
   transitional form between multituberculates and ``haramiyidans{''},
   these taxonomical modifications would affect interpretation of early
   evolution of allotherians. In a comparison of molars in known
   ``haramiyidans{''}, we delve into their occlusal patterns and cusp
   homologies that have been controversial but pivotal for understanding
   evolution of allotherians. We further conduct the first phylogenetic
   analysis of haramiyidan species. The European Late Triassic species form
   the stem-ward taxa of ``haramiyidans{''} and the Jurassic species from
   the United Kingdom are grouped with arboroharamiyids from the Yanliao
   Biota, China, and nested in ``haramiyidans{''}.},

Abstract = {Early sauropodomorphs were diverse in Gondwana, being particularly well
   represented in South America. Mussaurus patagonicus is one of the
   best-known non-sauropod sauropodomorphs that inhabited the Southern
   Hemisphere. Its importance relies on its phylogenetic position close to
   Sauropoda and also because it is known from a well-represented
   ontogenetic series, including embryos, neonate and late immature
   skeletons, which are particularly scarce among sauropodomorphs. In this
   regard, Mussaurus represents an excellent opportunity to explore
   anatomical and palaeobiological constraints during the ontogeny of early
   stages of the evolution of the group. We present the osteology of the
   postcranial skeleton of immature specimens of Mussaurus, highlighting
   the main anatomical changes that occurred during its ontogeny. The
   phylogenetic position of this taxon based on mature specimens is
   evaluated through a parsimony analysis, corroborating its position as
   closer to Sauropoda than most other early sauropodomorphs. Immature
   stages of this taxon were also evaluated phylogenetically, showing an
   overall phylogenetic signal that positioned them closer to the root of
   Sauropodomorpha than the mature specimens. However, the cranial and some
   postcranial anatomical partitions of neonates and late immature
   specimens have different phylogenetic signals, showing derived traits
   present in Sauropoda and related taxa (and supporting the hypothesis of
   paedomorphic evolution in certain regions of the skeleton). Our analysis
   shows that most of the appendicular apomorphies in Mussaurus appear late
   in ontogeny, whereas axial characters (in particular for OS 1),
   including those of the skull and the presacral vertebrae, show derived
   character states early in ontogeny that are congruent with the
   phylogenetic position of mature specimens. Ontogenetic series of other
   sauropodomorph species, however, are required to test if this pattern
   applies to the entire group.},

Abstract = {dagger Protosyngnathus sumatrensis is known from six specimens from
   Eocene lacustrine deposits of the Sangkarawang Formation of Sumatra,
   Indonesia. The fish was named almost 150 years ago, but has never been
   well described or figured. Probably because of this, it has not been
   included in phylogenies of extant pipefishes and seahorses
   (Syngnathiformes). A detailed description is provided, along with a new
   phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters that allows the Eocene
   fish to be confidently placed with the extant families Syngnathidae
   (pipefishes and seahorses) and Solenostomidae (ghost seahorses) along
   with the Paleocene marine fossil dagger Eekaulostomus cuevasae from
   Mexico. The vast majority of these fishes are marine inhabitants, with a
   few syngnathids entering brackish or freshwater habitats. dagger
   Protosyngnathus documents the occurrence of syngnathiform fishes in a
   lacustrine environment, indicating that this lineage invaded and became
   adapted to the freshwater environment early in the evolution of this
   group.},

Title = {Silicified cupulate seed-bearing structures from the Early Cretaceous of
   eastern Inner Mongolia, China: rethinking the corystosperm concept},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The group referred to informally as the corystosperms, described
   initially based on compression fossils from the Triassic of Gondwana,
   have long been considered critical extinct plants for understanding seed
   plant phylogeny, the evolution of seed plant reproductive structures and
   the relationships of angiosperms. Here we describe a new genus and
   species of corystosperm seed-bearing structure, Jarudia zhoui gen. et
   sp. nov., based on abundant silicified material collected from the newly
   discovered chert in the Early Cretaceous Huolinhe Formation of eastern
   Inner Mongolia, north-eastern China. Jarudia zhoui is a lax seed cone
   consisting of a flexible central axis bearing deciduous, helically
   arranged, lateral seed-bearing units. Individual seed-bearing units
   consist of an elongate bract partially fused to an unbranched cupule
   stalk that bears a single, reflexed cupule apically. Each cupule is
   formed by the strongly reflexed cupule stalk and one median and two
   lateral flaps. The cupule stalk supplied by two vascular bundles and
   three unvascularized flaps partially enclose two three-angled seeds.
   Jarudia zhoui bears a striking resemblance to Doylea tetrahedrasperma
   from the Early Cretaceous of Canada and similar plants from the Early
   Cretaceous of Mongolia. There are also strong similarities with ovulate
   structures of Umkomasia from the Triassic of Gondwana in the structure
   and anatomy of individual cupules, their axial nature, and the
   architecture of the entire seed-bearing structure that has two orders of
   branching. New information from Jarudia zhoui, together with information
   on other corystosperm ovulate organs from the Northern Hemisphere,
   significantly expands our understanding of this key group of extinct
   plants, suggests that the cupules of the Early Cretaceous and Triassic
   corystosperms are homologous, and raises critical questions about the
   definition and phylogenetic circumscription of the corystosperms,
   including how Early Cretaceous and Triassic corystosperms are related to
   each other and to other groups of seed plants, including angiosperms.},

Abstract = {The extinct fossil snake Boavus occurs in early-middle Eocene localities
   in the United States. Four species are currently recognized, but until
   now, no formal phylogenetic analyses have been conducted to test its
   relationships within snakes. Here, we provide an osteological
   redescription and systematic revision of the genus, accompanied by
   phylogenetic analyses using multiple methods. Based on new morphological
   information obtained through first-hand observation and published
   descriptions, differences between Boavus occidentalis, B. agilis and B.
   affinis can be ascribed to normal intracolumnar vertebral variation,
   making the latter two junior synonyms of the first species. Our
   phylogenetic analyses retrieved Boavus within crown-Booidea as an early
   booid but outside of Boidae. A morphological and molecular analysis of
   booids, with dense taxon sampling including fossil and living forms,
   results in a new booid phylogeny. Boavus, along with other fossil booids
   from Europe (Eoconstrictor, Messelophis, Rieppelophis, Rageryx),
   suggests that crown-Booidea likely diverged earlier than estimated by
   some molecular studies (similar to 45.4 Ma).},

Title = {New Oligocene Pseudocrenilabrinae cichlid fishes (Teleostei, Cichlidae)

Volume = {19},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Two species of fossil cichlid are described from Oligocene deposits of
   Libya. One is formally described as Libyachromis fugacior gen. et sp.
   nov. This species is considered to be the sister group to most of the
   remaining members of the African subfamily Pseudocrenilabrinae, perhaps
   close to Heterochromis, and is characterized by two predorsal bones,
   dorsal fin with 12-14 spines and 9-12 rays, 24-28 vertebrae, cycloid
   scales present on body and head including cheek, and only unicuspid
   teeth present on the oral and pharyngeal jaws. The second fossil form is
   less complete, and so we do not formally name it, but it appears to be
   most closely related to Tylochromis, and thus we place it in the
   Tylochromini. These new fossils increase our understanding of the
   diversity of cichlid lineages in the Palaeogene. The unnamed fossil
   supports the presence of Tylochromini in the Eocene and Oligocene of
   North Africa, as was previously suggested by the remains of partial
   lower pharyngeal jaws from Egypt and Libya. The named fossil adds to the
   known diversity of early Cenozoic cichlids that document the presence of
   probably Heterochromini along with Tylochromini in North Africa.},

Abstract = {In this study we describe a new kitefin shark (Dalatiidae) genus and
   species Dracipinna bracheri gen. et sp. nov. based on upper Oligocene
   and lower Miocene tooth fossils. The teeth were excavated at three
   different sites which all lie in transgression phases. The fossil shark
   teeth are diverse and, depending on the excavation site, indicate
   pelagic to mesopelagic habitats. As these fossils were not found in
   older or younger sediments, we suggest a patchy distribution of the
   species. The fossils show several dental morphological characteristics
   of extant Dalatiidae. Phylogenetic analyses of combined morphological
   and DNA sequence-based data set suggest a weakly supported sister-group
   relationship of D. bracheri to extant Dalatiidae. Based on the dental
   morphological characters, we assign the dentition to a tearing type,
   which is rare among squaliform sharks and only known from a single
   extant species with a pelagic lifestyle.},

Title = {A new proterochampsid (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia) from the Late
   Triassic of southern Brazil and the emergence of archosaurian hind limb
   traits},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Characterized by an elongated snout, proterochampsids are carnivorous
   non-archosaur archosauriforms. The clade is endemic to South America and
   its fossil record extends from the early Carnian to the late
   Carnian/early Norian. Nesting close to Archosauria, it is a key clade
   for understanding the origin and evolution of archosaurian traits.
   Unfortunately, hind limb elements are usually poorly preserved for the
   group. Therefore, the hind limb anatomy of proterochampsids still lacks
   detailed descriptions. In the present study, we partially fill this gap
   with the description of a new proterochampsid represented by a complete
   and well-preserved hind limb. Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov.
   was excavated from the late Carnian/early Norian (Late Triassic) beds of
   southern Brazil. A phylogenetic investigation recovers the new taxon as
   a non-rhadinosuchine proterochampsid. The species bears an unusual set
   of traits for the group, which provides clues on the evolutionary
   origins of some muscle attachment structures. For instance, the femur of
   Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov. possesses an anterior
   trochanter and an anterolateral scar. So far, these features have not
   been reported in other non-archosaurian archosauriforms. Therefore, the
   new specimen indicates that some typical archosaurian features evolved
   earlier than previously thought. The taxon also carries additional
   uncommon features for proterochampsids, such as an iliofibularis
   tubercle on the anterior margin of the fibula and a vestigial phalanx in
   digit V. In sum, Stenoscelida aurantiacus has one of the best-preserved
   hind limbs within Proterochampsidae and sheds light on the polarization
   of important traits regarding the evolutionary context of Archosauria.},

Abstract = {The most representative ankylosaurian remains from Argentina have been
   found in sediments of the Allen Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian) in
   Salitral Moreno, Rio Negro Province. Several authors have discussed the
   identity and history of these remains In this study, we review all
   published material along with some new remains in order to summarize all
   the knowledge about these ankylosaurs. Previously published material
   includes a tooth, dorsal and anterior caudal vertebrae, a femur and
   several osteoderms. The new remains include synsacral and caudal
   elements, a partial femur and osteoderms. The anatomy of the tooth, the
   synsacrum, the mid-caudal vertebra, the femur and the osteoderms, and
   the histology of the post-cervical osteoderms, support a nodosaurid
   identification, as proposed in previous descriptions of the Salitral
   Moreno material. Patagopelta cristata gen. et sp. nov. is a new
   nodosaurid ankylosaur characterized by the presence of unique cervical
   half-ring and femoral anatomies, including high-crested lateral
   osteoderms in the half rings and a strongly developed muscular crest in
   the anterior surface of the femur. The similar to 2 m body length
   estimated for Patagopelta is very small for an ankylosaur, comparable
   with the dwarf nodosaurid Struthiosaurus. We recovered Patagopelta
   within Nodosaurinae, related to nodosaurids from the `mid'-Cretaceous of
   North America, contrasting the previous topologies that related this
   material with Panoplosaurini (Late Cretaceous North American
   nodosaurids). These results support a palaeobiogeographical context in
   which the nodosaurids from Salitral Moreno, Argentina, are part of the
   allochthonous fauna that migrated into South America during the late
   Campanian as part of the First American Biotic Interchange.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary history of Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic ray-finned
   fishes (Actinopterygii) is obscured by an incomplete fossil record and
   under-study of late Palaeozoic (Permo-Carboniferous) actinopterygians.
   To help address this issue, we describe a new species of ray-finned
   fish, Concentrilepis minnekahtaensis gen. et sp. nov., from the late
   early Permian (Kungurian) Minnekahta Limestone of South Dakota (USA).
   This taxon is represented by Field Museum of Natural History FMNH PF
   3721, an exceptionally well-preserved partial three-dimensional head and
   trunk preserving the external anatomy and some internal elements from
   the skull, paired fins and scale cover. Concentrilepis is also
   represented by Yale Peabody Museum 18649, a laterally compressed
   individual that preserves the posterior portion of the body. This taxon
   has features of the paraphyletic `paleoniscoids', including an immobile
   maxilla with a narrow suborbital process and a broad postorbital
   expansion, a heterocercal caudal fin, and rhombic ganoid scales.
   Concentrilepis is distinguished from similar species by the dual lateral
   expansions on its frontal (= parietal of sarcopterygians), the exclusion
   of the lacrimal from the oral margin, and lateral scales that are longer
   than deep and ornamented with straight, concentric ridges at their
   margins and diagonal ridges at their centres. We conducted a maximum
   parsimony analysis in PAUP and a Bayesian analysis with the Mkv model in
   MrBayes with 73 other taxa and 222 characters that placed this taxon in
   a polytomy with other late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic
   `paleoniscoids'. We also found that the application of Bayesian and
   parsimony techniques in tandem provided the necessary caution in
   interpreting our results and focused direction for future study.
   Continued efforts to gather more morphological data from `paleoniscoids'
   in concert with the development and testing of novel phylogenetic
   characters and inference techniques will be necessary to improve our
   understanding of the interrelationships of late Palaeozoic and early
   Mesozoic actinopterygians.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of Ceratophryidae (Anura: Hyloidea) including

Abstract = {The Neotropical frog family Ceratophryidae is composed of wide-mouthed
   frogs with stout bodies. Living species of the family are consistently
   recovered as a monophyletic group, but with disparities among analyses
   regarding internal relationships. Ceratophryidae presents one of the
   richest fossil records in Anura. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses
   including both extant and extinct species are still scarce, and the
   position of fossils is persistently debated. In this sense, the
   systematics of the family has changed considerably in the last decade
   with the exclusion of Baurubatrachus pricei (Late Cretaceous),
   Beelzebufo ampinga (Late Cretaceous) and Wawelia gerholdi (early
   Miocene). Herein, a morphologically based phylogeny for Ceratophryidae,
   including living species (11 spp.) and fossil specimens (10 spp.), is
   used as a background to discuss the evolutionary history of the family
   and its classification. We phylogenetically placed Baurubatrachus
   pricei, Beelzebufo ampinga and Wawelia gerholdi as non-ceratophryids. We
   recovered a monophyletic Ceratophryidae: Lepidobatrachus and Ceratophrys
   form a clade, with Chacophrys as its sister group. Our analysis
   corroborates the C. cornuta and C. aurita groups. Among fossils, L.
   australis and C. sagani were recovered as valid species based on
   autapomorphies, and C. rusconii was found to be the sister of all
   Ceratophrys. Ceratophrys ensenadensis, C. ameghinorum, C. aurita NHMUK
   PV OR18895/6 and C. sagani belong to the C. aurita group. We also
   discuss homoplasies in Ceratophryidae, divergence-time estimates, and
   the evolution of ploidy and a dorsal shield in the family.},

Title = {A new dagger Pachycormiformes (Actinopterygii) from the Upper Jurassic

Abstract = {As part of the transition from Holostei to Teleostei, dagger
   Pachycormiformes represent a key group of fishes. However, the anatomy
   and phylogenetic relationships of the group in the context of the
   neopterygians are far from being understood. In this contribution we
   describe a new pachycormiform, dagger Kaykay lafken gen. et sp. nov.,
   from the Upper Jurassic of Argentina. We made an exhaustive review of
   morphological characters of holostean and teleostean fishes and explore
   through a cladistic analysis the phylogenetic relationships of the new
   species. dagger Kaykay gen. nov. is retrieved among dagger
   Pachycormiformes as being the sister taxon of the macrocarnivorous Glade
   composed of dagger Orthocormus and dagger Hypsocormus. Among dagger
   Pachycormiformes the pattern of relationships mostly agrees with
   previous hypotheses, although our study highlights the still poor
   knowledge of the anatomy of this group. According to our results dagger
   Saurostomus is the sister taxon of other toothed pachycormids. dagger
   Orthocormus species are recovered as a monophyletic group. The unsolved
   position of dagger Pachycormus and dagger Sauropsis might be a
   consequence of poor preservation, revealing a lack of understanding of
   their anatomy. Our phylogenetic analysis also confirms the rapid
   radiation of holosteans and teleosteomorphs in the Early Triassic and
   the radiation of pholidophoriforms in the Middle Triassic. dagger
   Aspidorhynchoidei radiate in the Early Jurassic. The large ghost ranges
   (e.g. between dagger Aspidorhynchoidei and Teleosteomorpha) evidence
   biases in the fossil record.

Abstract = {Baird's pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps) is the only species of pocket
   gopher in Louisiana. Interest in this species' natural history has
   increased due to its close association with the Louisiana pine snake
   (Pituophis ruthvnu), which recently was listed as threatened under the
   Endangered Species Act. Approximately 75\% of P. ruthveni's estimated
   prey biomass consists of G. breviceps, whose burrow systems also provide
   shelter and hibernacula. Therefore, increasing densities of G. breviceps
   may assist in the recovery and management of P. ruthveni Previous
   studies have identified specific habitat characteristics that are
   preferred by G. breviceps, but none have assessed how different habitats
   affect pocket gopher density. Live trapping was conducted at sixteen
   sites throughout Louisiana to determine relative density of G.
   breviceps. Vegetation and soil data were collected, and a multi-model
   selection approach was used to determine which variable (s) best
   explained variation in relative density. Relative densities of G.
   breviceps ranged from 0 to 12.5 gophers/ha with an average of 3.44
   gophers/ha. Canopy cover best predicted numbers of G. breviceps across
   the study area. Soil data was not a good predictor; however, all
   sampling plots possessed sandy loam or loamy sand soils, which is
   preferred by Geomys spp. Management strategies aimed at increasing
   density of G. breviceps should focus on continued restoration of
   longleaf pine forest and supplemented by opening patches of forest,
   especially in areas with preferred soil textures.},

Abstract = {The unintentional introduction and rapid spread of chestnut blight
   (caused by Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr) in the early 20th
   century resulted in the demise of American chestnut (Castanea dentata
   (Marsh.) Borkh.; Fagaceae) as a major component of forest canopies
   resulting in negative impacts on eastern forest communities. Research
   efforts over the last century have documented the persistence of
   occasional trees and root crown/stump sprouts throughout much of the
   species' historic range, providing the basis for ongoing breeding of
   blight-resistant trees and restoration efforts. Here we use
   environmental niche modeling to investigate whether environmentally
   suitable habitat remains for remnant trees throughout the southwestern
   historical range, and to evaluate the reintroduction potential of this
   relatively understudied part of the historical distribution. We also use
   stage-structured matrix projection models to investigate the potential
   demographic future of C. dentata near the historical southwestern range
   limit based on observations of American chestnut in these areas over the
   last several decades. We found suitable upland habitat with areas of
   high forest canopy cover occurs throughout much of the southwestern
   portion of the historical range and that populations of American
   chestnut in these areas are predicted to drastically decline over the
   coming decades. These results highlight the continued presence of
   suitable C. dentata habitat throughout the southwestern extent of its
   historical distribution, which should be incorporated into evaluations
   for future reintroduction, and emphasize the need for efforts to locate,
   conserve, and introduce genetic material from individuals with locally
   adapted genotypes into active restoration programs.},

Volume = {187},

Abstract = {The visual capabilities of prey species such as white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) must be specialized to enhance predator
   detection and traverse a complex physical environment. Although aspects
   of the visual system of deer have been investigated, there has been no
   evaluation of the species' spatial resolution abilities. We used a
   behavioral assay to estimate visual acuity of three adult female deer
   using operant conditioning techniques. We estimated the spatial
   resolution is between four and six cycles/degree. Our results suggest
   the white-tailed deer eye allows relatively low spatial resolution,
   consistent with prior studies that reported high temporal resolution.
   The combination of low spatial resolution and high temporal resolution
   allows for efficient detection of movement and enhanced capability to
   transverse a complex environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Eurasian fossil record is rich with the remains of sminthid rodents,
   a Glade today represented by a single genus, Sicista. In contrast, the
   North American record of the family is sparse and exclusively composed
   of species of Plesiosminthus, an animal bearing a grooved incisor,
   during the Oligocene. This fossil record is the product of dispersal
   events from Eurasia. We here present the first occurrence of a
   smooth-incisor sminthid from North America. The new species, Heosminthus
   teredens from the Arikareean-aged Cabbage Patch beds of Montana,
   represents a rare occurrence of cranial material showing the clear
   association between incisors and cheek teeth, and the first postcranial
   remains for fossil sminthids. Our phylogenetic analysis, expanding on
   prior work, shows that Heosminthus teredens is most closely related to
   Heosminthus borrae, from Mongolia. In combination with published
   radioisotopic dating, our phylogenetic framework of sminthids provides
   evidence for an additional dispersal of sminthid rodents from Eurasia to
   North America 30 million years ago via Beringia. Our morphometric
   analysis of the tibia and metatarsal supports a terrestrial ecology for
   the new species; it is possible the animal had limited scansorial and/or
   saltatorial abilities. The large sample size of teeth available for the
   new taxon enables an analysis of morphological variation and indicates a
   high degree of polymorphism as well as a large size variation, even when
   controlling for stratigraphical and geographical range.},

Abstract = {Skorpiovenator bustingorryi is a derived abelisaurid theropod
   represented by a fairly complete skeleton from the Late Cretaceous
   sedimentary beds of north-western Patagonia. Although some features were
   described in the original paper, mainly related to the skull, the
   appendicular anatomy remains undescribed. The aim of the present
   contribution is to provide a detailed description and analysis of the
   available appendicular bones, including comparisons with other
   ceratosaurian theropods close to Skorpiovenator. In this way, new
   autapomorphies emerged to further distinguish Skorpiovenator from its
   relatives. Furthermore, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was
   performed and several characteristics of the hind limb, in particular
   some of the autopodium, resulted in the identification of new apomorphic
   traits for Ceratosauria and Abelisauridae. These features might prove to
   be useful for future phylogenetic analyses and may help to resolve the
   still confusing and debated internal relationships of abelisaurid
   theropods.},

   The beaver had a broken upper incisor, which may have contributed to it
   foraging on land during the winter. While it is common for injured
   animals to have increased vulnerability to predation, injuries can also
   influence foraging decisions that may indirectly increase vulnerability
   to predation.},

Abstract = {Amphibians are a highly vulnerable taxonomic group that have suffered
   population declines worldwide. As amphibians serve critical links
   between trophic levels and facilitate nutrient recycling, it is critical
   to understand how their species richness, abundance, and phenology shift
   over time. Because amphibian populations naturally fluctuate, short-term
   monitoring can provide insight into how amphibian communities respond to
   proximate changes in weather conditions, which is helpful for predicting
   long-term responses to climate change. We used pitfall traps to examine
   interannual variation of the amphibian community at Powdermill Nature
   Reserve (PNR) in Pennsylvania during 2020-2021 to provide critical
   details for future long-term monitoring. Mean monthly temperature and
   precipitation did not vary significantly between years, but monthly
   captures per sampling effort declined and monthly biomass per sampling
   effort increased from 2020 to 2021. Despite a lack of significant
   relationships between total amphibian captures and temperature and
   precipitation, peak abundance shifted earlier, and individuals were
   larger in 2021 compared to 2020. Interestingly, individual species
   biomass was predicted by an interaction between temperature and
   precipitation, suggesting individual species will vary in vulnerability
   to climate change, but the amphibian community as a whole at PNR is
   resilient to minor fluctuations in temperature and precipitation.},

Volume = {188},

Abstract = {Black fly larval collection sites at three rivers in central Washington
   state all possess taxa of the Simulium arcticum Malloch complex with the
   autosomal inversion, IS-1, in high enough frequency to test for
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium independently at each site. Such tests
   determine reproductive status of the taxa present. These situations in
   which the IS-1 autosomal inversion is in relative high frequency are
   rare. Moreover, earlier molecular comparisons suggest a single taxon for
   the S. arcticum complex and cytogenetic studies at the local level may
   or may not support earlier molecular work. Such knowledge could further
   our understanding of the proper taxonomy of these taxa, that is, whether
   they arc good biological species or not. I scored the three genotypes of
   the IS-1 inversion in 247 larvae to test the reproductive status of
   populations of three members of the Simulium arcticum complex (Simulium
   brevicercum, S. saxasum, and the newly discovered cytotype (S. arcticum
   IIL- 81) at the Methow, Entiat and Wenatchee rivers of Washington state.
   In all three cases, larvae conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
   suggesting these populations were panmictic when the collections were
   made. Thus, these results support earlier molecular work and indicate
   that the three taxa at these sites can freely interbreed.},

Abstract = {Descendants of introgressive hybridization between species may have
   evolutionary advantages over their parental species. Prior studies have
   documented evidence of introgressive hybridization between coyotes,
   dogs, grey wolves and eastern wolves. This study attempts to attribute
   morphology and pelage patterns of Pennsylvania coyotes to sex,
   ecoregion, and the degree of coyote-wolf introgressive hybridization. A
   total of 192 coyotes were genotyped at 63 ancestry informative SNPS to
   determine the percent of coyote genome attributable to wolf origin
   (percent wolf). Females had higher percent wolf than males, which could
   be the result of lower survivorship in hybrid males. Percent wolf, sex,
   and ecoregion each were found to independently influence size using
   general linear model analysis, and the effect of sex was most
   pronounced. Coyotes from Northeastern and northcentral ecoregions of
   Pennsylvania were larger in size and possessed a higher percent wolf.
   Moreover, coyotes with higher percent wolf were larger, less red in some
   parts of their pelage, and had a different pelage patchiness
   composition. This correlates with previous studies that showed
   ecoregions with increased deer density correlated to coyotes with higher
   percent wolf. Size and percent wolf may be adaptively advantageous in
   Northeastern Pennsylvania where there is a relatively high deer
   population abundance. Furthermore, the degree of redness within coyotes
   may be used as an indicator for introgression levels for population
   managers, aiding in understanding the shifting ecological role of
   coyotes.},

Title = {Summer Populations of Northern Long-eared Bat in an Eastern Kentucky
   Forest Following Arrival of White-nose Syndrome},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Myotis bats have experienced significant population losses due to
   white-nose syndrome (WNS) throughout large portions of their
   distributions in eastern North America. As closed-space foragers, these
   species comprise an important feeding guild within eastern forests. An
   understanding of where summer populations remain and how their ecology
   has changed following impact from WNS is needed to assess fully the
   recovery potential of Myotis bats. We used acoustic sampling, capture
   surveys, radiotelemetry and roost surveys from 2015 to 2018 to evaluate
   the status of northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) in an
   eastern Kentucky forest following region-wide impacts from WNS to this
   species. Acoustic activity of Myotis remained unchanged over the 4 y of
   sampling, with activity of these bats greatest in mid- to late July.
   Northern long-eared bats represented 97\% of the Myotis captured,
   indicating activity levels likely reflected patterns for this species.
   We located 18 roost trees of northern long-eared bats in five tree
   species, including both live and dead trees. All roost trees were on
   upper slopes within 100 m of ridge top roads. Maximum exit counts, 24
   and 21, at two roosts occurred in late May and early June, suggesting
   these dates represented the summer maternity period of northern
   long-eared bats in this forest. Our results demonstrated that post-WNS
   populations of northern long-eared bats on Robinson Forest formed small
   colonies, day-roosted in trees near roads on forested ridge tops, were
   reproductively active, and maintained steady levels of activity across
   the 4 y of sampling. These data suggest that local populations of
   northern long-eared bats are surviving WNS and continue to persist
   during summer months in forests of the Appalachian Mountain region. We
   hypothesize presence of ridge top roads, often associated with forest
   logging operations, may be important habitat elements for increasing
   availability of preferred roosting habitat for summer populations of
   northern long-eared bats in actively managed forests.},

Title = {Mercury Contamination of Fish and Their Prey Across a Riverine Food Web},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {2},
Pages = {234-243},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs are frequently monitored by researchers for
   elevated mercury concentrations in sportfish. Rivers and streams,
   especially those of smaller orders, are less frequently monitored for
   mercury contamination and nonsport fishes and invertebrates, although
   important components of the food web, are rarely examined. We addressed
   this gap by surveying mercury levels in a stream community in the
   Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, U.S., by sampling fish and
   macroinvertebrates at ten sites in the river. We found elevated levels
   of mercury across taxa within the river including individuals of
   smallmouth bass populations 10-25 cm in length having concentrations
   (2986 +/- 1053 ng/g dry weight) above the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency human limit. Furthermore, we observed high concentrations in
   darters and logperch (1133 +/- 464 ng/g dry weight), nonsport fishes
   found predominantly in rivers and streams. Our results indicate mercury
   contamination can reach elevated concentrations in rivers and stream
   food webs, posing risks to both humans and wildlife.},

Title = {Shade-tolerance Classification of the Upland Herbaceous Flora of the
   Carolina and Virginia Piedmont},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},
Number = {2},
Pages = {113-147},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Historical accounts describe savanna-like conditions over portions of
   the Piedmont of the southeastern United States dating at least as far
   back as the 1500s. These open habitats are thought to have declined
   because of human development, fire suppression, and loss of native
   grazing animals. Unfortunately, conservation efforts to restore and
   sustain Piedmont savanna are hampered by our current rudimentary
   understanding of community assembly and maintenance dynamics. Such
   understanding would be facilitated by a robust classification of species
   into specialist and generalist guilds related to canopy openness, a
   classification that is currently unavailable on a broad scale.
   Consequently, our objective was to develop a shade-tolerance
   classification for the upland Piedmont herbaceous flora of the Carolinas
   and Virginia, based on quantitative plot data from the region. To
   achieve this objective, we utilized a dataset of plot records
   (representing natural and semi-natural vegetation) from the Carolina
   Vegetation Survey. These arc permanent plots on public and private land
   that were surveyed between 1977 and 2015. Following quality control, the
   dataset contained 1300 plots and 1550 species (including 835 native
   herbaceous species after single occurrences were removed), with species
   abundances in plots reported in cover classes. We estimated the canopy
   cover of each plot from the cover codes of its tree species and assigned
   each plot to habitat shade classes: open (<25\% canopy cover; n = 63),
   semi-open (25-75\% canopy cover; n=140), or closed (>75\% canopy cover;
   n =1097). We calculated point biserial correlation coefficients (r(pb)),
   which provided a positive or negative value for each species, dependent
   on its abundance and habitat association. We considered single (open,
   semi-open, or closed) and combined (open+semi-open, closed+semi-open, or
   open+closed) habitat classes during our analysis. Of the 835 native
   herbaceous species in the dataset, we found 141 (17\%) to be heliophytes
   (specialists of open habitats with canopy cover <25\%), and only 81
   (10\%) to be sciophytes (specialists of closed habitats with canopy
   cover >75\%), despite 84\% of plots in the dataset being classified as
   closed habitats. Our work suggests that open and semi-open habitats may
   contain a disproportionate diversity of regional herbaceous flora and
   provides the first quantitative shade-tolerance classification for over
   800 herbaceous species. This work provides a resource that can be used
   by field biologists and land managers to identify heliophyte
   communities, and to assess the success of habitat restoration and
   creation efforts.},

Title = {Eastern Spotted Skunks Alter Nightly Activity and Movement in Response
   to Environmental Conditions},

Number = {1},
Pages = {33-55},

Abstract = {Daily and seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions can
   significantly impact the survivorship and reproductive success of
   animals by altering energetic costs and predation risks. Behaviorally,
   animals often respond to changes in their environment through regulation
   of activity and associated movement patterns. We used
   accelerometer-informed GPS telemetry to assess nightly activity and
   movement patterns in response to environmental conditions in a small
   endotherm, the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale !Morita). Nightly
   movements and activity of skunks were monitored in association with
   ambient temperature, precipitation, and moon illumination during late
   winter through summer in Alabama. Eastern spotted skunks were strictly
   nocturnal, exhibiting almost no daytime activity. Total time active and
   total distance moved each night increased with ambient temperature and
   rainfall. Variation in moon illumination, which may affect predation
   risk, did not impact skunk nightly activity or movement. Eastern spotted
   skunks likely reduce predation risk by being active between sunset and
   sunrise when they are less visible to predators. Lower activity and
   movement at cooler temperatures significantly reduces thermoregulatory
   costs for small endotherms. Increased activity of skunks during or
   shortly after precipitation may be driven by increased prey
   availability. Our findings indicate that small endotherms, like the
   eastern spotted skunk, rely extensively on behavioral thermoregulation,
   instead of physiological adaptation, to buffer themselves against
   changing environmental conditions. Behavioral flexibility may promote
   species persistence as climate changes, and should be considered in
   conservation strategies of vulnerable species, such as eastern spotted
   skunks.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Patterns of Snake Captures and Activity in Upland Pine
   Forests},

Abstract = {Patterns of species' occurrences across space and time are fundamental
   components to understanding their ecology, as this variation often
   reflects responses to local environmental gradients. We built
   species-specific models to understand the spatial and temporal factors
   predicting captures and activity of five snake species in upland pine
   forests: copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), racer (Coluber
   constrictor), coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum), western ratsnake
   (Pantherophis obsoletus), and western ribbonsnake (Thamnophis proximus).
   From mid-May to mid-July across 3 y (2018, 2019, 2020), we monitored
   boxtraps in two upland pine forests experiencing different management
   regimes: (1) subjected to frequent thinning and prescribed burning, and
   (2) subjected to infrequent thinning and prescribed burning.
   Significantly more copperheads and western ribbonsnakes were captured at
   the infrequently thinned and burned forest, whereas significantly more
   racers were captured at forest subjected to frequent thinning and
   burning. As the summer progressed, captures decreased each subsequent
   month for both racers and western ratsnakes, with the fewest captures in
   July. Western ratsnakes were the only species to exhibit a response to
   the weather in that activity decreased with increasing rainfall. No
   variables were significant predictors of coachwhip captures. The
   variation in captures across space may be attributed to the
   physiological tolerances of each species based on their habitat
   preferences or differences in prey availability at each forest.
   Interactions between the physiological tolerances, foraging behaviors,
   or their reproductive phenology may be underlying the temporal variation
   in activity patterns.},

Title = {Assessing Effects of Impounded Water on Life History, Reproduction, and
   Diets of a Fluvial Specialist Fish},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Species richness and abundances of fluvial specialist fishes often
   decrease within waters impounded by dams, but mechanisms underlying
   these decreases arc poorly understood. Purpose of this study was to
   assess the effects of impounded water on fluvial specialist Greenthroat
   Darter Etheostama lepidum by quantifying differences in life history
   (i.e., age structure, life span), reproduction (i.e., gonadosomatic
   index {[}GSI] stages of ovarian development), and stomach contents
   (i.e., diet items and parasites) between a population taken from a
   lentic environment (Lake Site) and a lotic environment (River Site).
   Among fishes taken from both sites, Greenthroat Darters lived up to 1.5
   y, spawned for 11 mo, and consumed primarily aquatic insects and
   crustaceans. Differences in reproduction were not detected between
   populations at the Lake Site and at the River Site. Greenthroat Darters
   taken from Lake Site consumed fewer diet items, fewer aquatic insects,
   and greater number of crustaceans than those taken from River Site;
   however, diet weight, percent stomach fullness, and percent empty
   stomachs were similar between sites. Greenthroat Darters taken from Lake
   Site exhibited lower condition factors than those taken from River Site,
   which corresponded with a greater number of parasites (i.e.,
   Acanthocephala and Nematoda) in individuals taken from Lake Site.
   Differences quantified herein were not sufficient to cause extirpation
   of Greenthroat Darters in the impounded waters, given the species has
   persisted in the impounded water at least since the late 1800s; however,
   differences in diets and parasites might explain the lower abundance of
   Greenthroat Darters in Lake Site compared to River Site.},

Title = {Drivers of Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans Aggregation Size
   in South Carolina, USA},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-32},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although it is known that southern flying squirrels (Glaticomys volans)
   nest in larger groups to offset the energetic costs of low temper:mires.
   the influence of other variables on aggregation size remains relatively
   unknown. Therefore, the influence of environmental variables and
   individual characteristics of G. volans on nest box aggregation size was
   studied from 1992-1998 at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.
   Over the study period, 5859 occupied boxes were observed, representing
   11,238 captures and 2671 unique individuals. The majority of occupied
   boxes (60.3\%) contained solitary individuals, while 26.1\% contained
   aggregations (>= 2 individuals) of adult and/or subadult individuals and
   13.6\% contained litters. Although ambient temperature is widely
   believed to be the most important variable influencing aggregation size
   of G. volans, the final model explaining nest aggregation size for G.
   volans included not only minimum daily ambient temperature, but also
   Julian date and individual G. volans characteristics of sex, age, and
   reproductive status. Minimum ambient temperature was inversely related
   to aggregation size, with larger aggregation sizes associated with
   winter months, although aggregation size sharply increased between the
   months of Aug.- Sept. The retention of Julian date in the final model,
   in addition to minimum ambient temperature, indicates that behavioral
   shifts due to seasonal changes, independent of temperature, should be
   considered. Nestlings were associated with larger aggregation sizes, as
   were inactive and lactating females and inactive males. However, sex
   alone did not significantly contribute to the final model. This study
   demonstrates that in addition to temperature, there are a suite of
   predictors of nest aggregation size for G. volans that should be
   considered when evaluating nest box occupancy for this species.},

Volume = {187},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Nonnative, invasive plant species have been notoriously problematic for
   many ecosystems by outcompeting native plant species and disrupting
   habitat for insects and other animal life. Within the last decade, a
   nonnative orchid, Epipactis helleborine L. Crantz (Orchidaceae), has
   become increasingly present in Minnesota and is considered invasive in
   some eastern states, including Wisconsin. This study provides insights
   into the presence and habitat preferences of E. helleborine in Winona
   County, in southeastern Minnesota. A large portion of Winona County lies
   within the Driftiess region, which is characterized by bluff land and
   unique plant communities that have been greatly impacted by invasive
   species. This study used MaxEnt software to create a habitat suitability
   model for E. helleborine using six environmental predictors: elevation,
   slope, aspect, soil type, land cover, and distance to roads. The results
   were a model with high habitat suitability predictability with elevation
   and slope being the most important predictors, whereas other variables
   contributed little to the final model. The final model showed relatively
   small areas with high suitability, where management efforts should be
   concentrated. Based on the model, this species does not seem to be a
   substantial threat to areas of great conservation concern, such as
   southwestern facing bluff prairies.},

Title = {An Assessment of Prairie Management Practices for Maintaining Habitat
   Quality for the Endangered Poweshiek Skipperling Butterfly in Canada},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek) was once a common prairie
   butterfly in central North America, but is now critically endangered in
   Canada and the United States. The Poweshiek skipperling is confined to
   the largest remaining tall grass prairie in Canada, which is currently
   managed using grazing and fire to maintain prairie habitat and prevent
   forest and shrub encroachment. To support re-introduction, restocking,
   and recovery of this critically endangered species, it is necessary to
   understand the habitat conditions preferred by skipperlings. By
   surveying prairie sites with Poweshiek skipperling across age and
   treatment categories (1-2 y since burn, 4-6 y since burn, >15 y since
   burn, and grazing), we identified commonly-used nectar plants and
   recorded physical variables known to influence plant diversity. We
   measured soil variables, including macronutrients, compaction, pH,
   texture, and moisture content, and used multivariate statistics to test
   for significant differences in site characteristics and plant community
   across treatments. For each site, we captured plant diversity,
   abundance, and cover, as well as total plant biomass. We found the
   oldest burn sites had the fewest skipperlings. Intermediate burn sites
   and lightly grazed sites contained the most skipperlings. In 95\% of
   nectaring observations, adult skipperlings were feeding on Black-eyed
   Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), upland white aster (Solidago ptarmicoides), and
   Self-heal (Prunella vulgaris). Characteristics in the physical
   components of sites and plant communities did not significantly differ
   across treatment types for most variables with the exception of the
   oldest burns, which showed significantly higher levels of soil
   compaction, live biomass, bare ground, less flowering species during the
   flight period, less flowering stems, and increased presence of nonnative
   and invasive species. Poweshiek skipperling is at high risk of imminent
   extirpation, and we recommend that the management regimes be adjusted to
   plan for a consistent supply of habitat conditions and plant species
   composition exemplified by our intermediate burn sites. We suggest fire
   return intervals of 4-6 y using patch burns in combination with grazing,
   permitted at times that minimize the impact on immature stages of
   Poweshick skipperling. This management is needed to provide suitable
   habitat conditions to maintain the current population and allow for
   successful restocking and recovery.},

Title = {Five-Year Effects of Introduced Mountain Goats and Recreation on Plant
   Communities and Species of Conservation Concern in an Alpine Sky Island},

Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems in the arid southwestern United States are vulnerable
   to climate change. Many of these ecosystems are experiencing increased
   recreational use and introductions of nonindigenous ungulates. In the La
   Sal Mountains of southeastern Utah, alpine plant communities support an
   endemic plant species, Erigeron mancus, 11 plant and two animal species
   of conservation concern, and a United States Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) Forest Service Research Natural Area. Nonindigenous mountain
   goats (Oreamnos americanus) were introduced by the Utah Division of
   Wildlife Resources (UDWR) in 2013 and 2014, and recreational use has
   increased in the intervening period. To evaluate potential effects of
   mountain goat and recreational use, vegetation monitoring was initiated
   by the USDA Forest Service in 2016. We used 5 y monitoring data
   (2016-2020) and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the separate
   and interacting effects of year, recreational use, and mountain goat use
   on: (1) populations of plant species of conservation concern; (2)
   vascular and nonvascular plant cover; and (3) ground cover. Our analyses
   revealed decreases in proportional frequency of E. mancus at the end of
   the monitoring. Proportional cover of dominant plant growth forms,
   especially forbs, declined, while proportional cover of litter and
   ineffective ground cover (bare soil and pavement) increased.
   Recreational or goat use were a factor in several of the observed
   changes, although weather and climate likely also influenced the
   results. Management complexity arises because of the different missions
   of USDA Forest Service and UDWR, but adjustments in mountain goat
   numbers and recreational use may be needed to maintain ecologically
   resilient ecosystems. Continued monitoring can provide the basis for
   adaptive management.},

Abstract = {Bird-window collisions (BWCs) constitute a significant source of
   mortality for both resident and migratory birds. Because windows reflect
   surrounding landscape components, such as vegetation or sky, birds do
   not always perceive glass as a barrier. Here we demonstrate a novel
   technique to classify and quantify reflections in windows on the Radford
   University campus in southwest Virginia, U.S.A. We deployed a
   consumer-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, i.e., drone, to photograph 14
   contiguous or near-contiguous window columns across five campus
   buildings in August 2020. For each study aspect, the drone (equipped
   with an RGB camera) captured images at ca. 5 m altitudinal increments
   from the ground floor to the roof of each building (three to six
   images/vertical column). We then manually classified each image in
   ImageJ to calculate approximate proportions of reflected: (1)
   vegetation, (2) sky, (3) and artificial structures or impervious
   surfaces, plus (4) nonreflective glass. We used a generalized linear
   model to determine how proportional reflections of vegetation, sky,
   buildings, and nonreflective glass varied across vertical increments. We
   found the proportion of sky significantly decreased with increasing
   photo heights, whereas proportion of nonreflective glass significantly
   increased with increasing heights. This supports previous findings that
   because birds are drawn to sky reflections, they may collide at
   relatively lower positions on buildings. Inconsistency in landscape
   design and building positioning on the campus precluded trends in
   vegetative or building reflections by height. Our pilot study
   demonstrates the applicability of a consumer-grade drone for
   investigating visual characteristics of reflections that influence BWCs
   from variable observation angles. We suggest the expanded use of drone
   images as a straightforward technique to measure changes in reflection
   characteristics from varying degrees of observation. They are a novel
   method in developing a BWC risk assessment as well as potential
   mitigation strategies in a suburban or campus environment with buildings
   of intermediate heights.},

Title = {Satellite Tracking Data Reveals High-Use Areas for Immature Bald Eagles

Abstract = {Immature raptors often travel long distances and move nomadically from
   the time they leave their natal area to the time they are recruited into
   the breeding population. Emphasis on identifying the nesting and winter
   habitat of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) has overshadowed the
   need to understand the habitat and spatial use of young eagles prior to
   reaching maturity. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of
   immature Bald Eagles hatched in western Kentucky during 2010-2016. We
   analyzed movement data to identify high-use areas for eagles in their
   first and second years during warm and cool periods. Five out of seven
   eagles migrated north to the Great Lakes region during their first year.
   Using Brownian Bridge Movement Modelling, we identified 47 noncontiguous
   high-use areas during the warm period and 67 during the cool period.
   Public lands comprised 17\% of warm period high-use areas and 43\% of
   cool period high-use areas. High-use areas were located in Illinois,
   Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee, and were often near
   federally-owned dams, rivers with sandbars, or areas with abundant
   waterfowl. Our small sample of tracked eagles correctly identified known
   Bald Eagle concentration areas within the study area; thus, we infer
   that previously unrecognized high-use areas identified by this study are
   likely to be concentration areas important to the larger population. We
   further suggest remote sensing data, even in limited datasets, as an
   efficient way to identify Bald Eagle concentration areas.},

Title = {A Multi-year Adult Emergence Study of the Cicada Neotibicen canicularis

Abstract = {Based on daily collections of final instar exuviae, the widespread
   annual cicada adult emergence of Neotibicen canicularis (Harris)
   (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) was studied in southeastern Wisconsin in a
   combined plot containing 15 mature trees and suburban lawns for seven
   successive years and in a separate plot of two trees for four years. The
   daily numbers of males and females were recorded. Over the entire seven
   years of the 15-tree plot, total female and male exuviae were equal, a
   summative 50:50 ratio. However, there was considerable deviation from
   this ratio three of the seven years. More females than males eclosed in
   the first two years and more males eclosed in the final year, yet the
   overall trend was for females to eclose later than males for the entire
   seven-year study of the 15-tree plot, with many more females emerging in
   the last twenty plus days. Although ambient temperatures varied over the
   study (cooler in the first two years and warmer later), they did not
   have any discernible effect on the timing of female and male eclosions.
   The overall annual emergence period was 56.7 (SE 4.48) d for a
   seven-year total of 2967 exuviae, with the annual average emergence
   being 437.6 (SE 34.6) per year. The average density of exuviae, an
   estimate of the emerging adult population, was 1.3 +/- 0.09 (SE) per
   m(2). In the separate two-tree plot, a greater number of males emerged
   than females for all four years.},

Title = {How mutation shapes the rate of population spread in the presence of a
   mate-finding Allee effect},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Although past work has considered how evolution and Allee effects each
   shape population spread, these factors have rarely been considered
   together. We develop an integrodifference equation model that tracks
   individuals of multiple dispersal types (i.e., short- and long-distance
   dispersers) of male and female individuals subject to a strong Allee
   effect due to mate-finding process. We use our model to explore how
   mutation between different dispersal types affects the rate of
   population spread, since this evolutionary mechanism has been shown to
   lead to both faster and slower spread in a previous individual-based
   model. We ask, under what conditions does mutation cause the population
   to spread faster (or slower) than it spreads without mutation (from the
   same initial conditions)? We find that mutation can both speed up and
   slow down invasions. Speeding up occurs in a relatively small range of
   parameter space near the Allee threshold of the population. Slowing down
   occurs across a broad range of parameters.},

Title = {Estimation of the present status of the species based on the theoretical

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Sibly et al. (2005) described that most species have a fundamental
   characteristic to follow the theta-logistic growth trait with the convex
   downward trend. The fundamental yardstick of this research work builds
   under the deterministic setup, whereas the involvement of the external
   noise in any growth system is inevitable. But, the involvement of
   external affairs in any species growth can not be well judged only
   through its density dependence; it requires a further assessment. So, we
   frame the theta-logistic model with the stochastic analog in two
   directions, i.e., the discrete and continuous setup. The analysis of the
   discrete stochastic model is manifested by the bifurcation analysis,
   which shows that the attainment of the chaotic regime enhances with the
   increase in noise intensity level. Although the role of chaos in species
   extinction is debatable, a literature survey suggests that chaos with
   stochasticity accelerates the extinction of species. Similarly, in the
   case of the continuous version, we performed a theoretical study on the
   stochastic theta-logistic model to provide a critical value of the noise
   intensity parameter. This threshold magnitude acts as the sustainability
   criterion of any species environmental tolerability. In this connection,
   we use the data of four major taxonomic groups, i.e., Bird, Insect,
   Mammal, and Fish, from the GPDD database and classifies the species
   based on environmental sensitivity. The highly sensitive species have a
   low tolerance level, associated with the small magnitude of
   environmental noise intensity parameter. Moreover, the simulation
   prediction model on these four taxonomic classes also shows that the
   overall extinction probability of the considered birds in our research
   work is almost negligible for the current time window.},

Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 1},
Abstract = {Previous work involving integro-difference equations of a single species
   in a homogenous environment has emphasized spreading behavior in
   unbounded habitats. We show that, under suitable conditions, a simple
   scalar integro-difference equation incorporating a strong Allee effect
   and overcompensation can produce solutions where the population persists
   in an essentially bounded domain without spread despite the homogeneity
   of the environment. These solutions are robust in that they occupy a
   region of full measure in parameter space. We develop orbit diagrams
   showing various patterns of nonspreading solutions from stable
   equilibria, period-two, to higher periodicity. We show that from a
   relatively uniform initial density with small stochastic perturbations,
   a population consisting of multiple isolated patches can emerge. In
   ecological terms, this work suggests a novel endogenous mechanism for
   the creation of patch boundaries.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Critical slowing down-based early warning signals (EWSs) are well-known
   indicators that precede an approaching collapse in complex systems. To
   date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical
   transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated
   noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic
   transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed
   with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can
   advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously
   progresses the system's recovery. However, noise correlation does not
   have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic
   transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the
   occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening.
   Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the
   efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy
   of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However,
   temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated
   noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical
   to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.},

Abstract = {All individuals transition through various life stages over the course
   of their development and nearly all organisms must contend with
   infectious disease at some point in their lives. Yet the intersection of
   these two universal features of life-stage structure and infectious
   disease-and their joint effects on population dynamics are poorly
   understood. Here, we develop a two-stage population model in which
   density dependence acts on juvenile maturation, and infectious disease
   affects either juveniles or adults via reduction in maturation,
   reproduction, or survival. In the absence of disease, this form of
   density dependence can generate persistent population oscillations. We
   examine whether infectious disease further accentuates these
   oscillations (by augmenting their amplitude) or stabilizes them (by
   reducing their amplitude). We find that, for moderate transmission rates
   (a proxy for disease incidence), disease can stabilize dynamics. In
   contrast, fast disease transmission is not generally stabilizing, which
   is, at least in part, due to disease overexploitation of the infectious
   class. Hydra effects are possible in the model due to density
   overcompensation and occur when disease increases juvenile mortality or
   decreases adult fecundity (but do not occur when disease augments adult
   mortality or reduces maturation). Slow maturation, large disease-free
   population size, and strong density-dependent population regulation can
   each lower the transmission rate required for the infectious disease to
   invade the population.},

Title = {The combined effects of dispersal and herbivores on stable states in
   coral reefs},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Theory and empirical work suggest that coral reefs may exhibit
   alternative stable states of coral versus macroalgal dominance. However,
   it is unclear how dispersal of coral and macroalgae among reefs might
   impact this bistability and the resilience of the coral-dominated state.
   We develop a mathematical model to investigate how reef cover dynamics
   are affected by (1) coral and macroalgal dispersal between two reefs and
   (2) heterogeneous grazer abundances. We find that at low coral and
   macroalgal dispersal levels, a new type of stable state emerges with
   both coral and macroalgae present. Furthermore, we show that a reef
   abundant with coral and grazers can support a coral-dominated stable
   state in a second reef depauperate of grazers by dispersal of coral
   larvae. These results help explain previous empirical findings on reefs
   once thought to be incongruent with traditional coral-macroalgal
   alternative stable states theory-such as intermediate coral and
   macroalgal cover stable states and high coral-low grazing scenarios. Our
   findings indicate that changing dispersal levels (e.g., due to climate
   change, reef degradation) between reefs changes the possible stable
   states and the grazing rate at which the coral-dominated state is
   predicted to be stable. This work demonstrates the relevance of
   accounting for the level of dispersal among coral reefs or other
   bistable ecosystems when designing conservation management plans.},

Title = {Analysis of the invasion of a city by Aedes aegypti via mathematical

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {We analysed data from the invasion of a city by Aedes aegypti by using a
   series of models based on Fisher's reaction-diffusion equation with
   Richard's growth model and Bayesian statistics. The model that best
   explains the invasion of the city was defined through a step-by-step
   process of model selection based on a series of candidate models. As
   explanatory variables, we used the effect of urbanization type and
   climate variables on the parameters of Fisher's equation: carrying
   capacity (K), population growth rate (r), and the diffusion coefficient
   (D). The resulting model is a reaction-diffusion equation with a
   near-zero shape parameter, similar to a Gompertz-type growth. The
   population advance rate of 60.19 m/day allowed Aedes aegypti to fully
   occupy a medium-sized city in 5 months from the estimated date of
   colonization. We found that the carrying capacity was dependent on
   temperature and urbanization type. While the results are coherent with
   existing literature on this species, most of the theory on population
   dynamics of Aedes aegypti usually assumes a logistic growth instead of
   Gompertz population dynamics. This type of growth is faster than
   logistic at densities lower than the inflexion point but slower at
   higher densities. Therefore, it is possible that in a regime in which
   the K depends on the climate, Gompertz dynamics could stabilize the
   population of this species of mosquito faster than assumed by the
   existing theory.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The dynamics of trait-based metacommunities have attracted much
   attention, but not much is known about how dispersal and spatial
   environmental variability mutually interact with each other to drive
   coexistence patterns and diversity. Here, we present a spatially
   explicit model of competition for two essential resources in a
   metacommunity on a one-dimensional environmental gradient. We find that
   both the strength of dispersal and the range of spatial environmental
   variability affect coexistence patterns, spatial structure, trait
   distribution, and local and regional diversity. Without dispersal,
   species are sorted according to their optimal growth conditions on the
   gradient. With the onset of dispersal, source-sink effects are
   initiated, which increases the effects of environmental filtering and
   interspecific competition and generates trait lumping, so that only a
   few species from an environment-defined trait range can survive.
   Interestingly, for very large dispersal rates, species distributions
   become spatially homogeneous, but nevertheless two species at the
   extreme ends of the trade-off curve can coexist for large environmental
   variability. Local species richness follows a classic hump-shaped
   dependence on dispersal rate, while local and regional diversity exhibit
   a pronounced peak for intermediate values of the environmental
   variability. Our findings provide important insights into the factors
   that shape the structure of trait-based metacommunities.},

Abstract = {Insectivorous lizards can alter arthropod community structure and
   composition. Collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) are believed to be
   keystone predators for Ozark glade grasshopper (Orthoptera) communities
   by increasing species richness on smaller glades. However, the
   interaction between collared lizard presence and glade area on
   orthopteran species richness has been inconsistent between studies on
   glades in southeastern Missouri. In this study, we explored the effects
   of collared lizard presence on orthopteran abundance, diversity, and
   assemblage composition in Ozark glades located in northern Arkansas. We
   found the presence of predatory collared lizard populations
   significantly affected orthopteran assemblage composition. However, the
   presence of collared lizards did not affect orthopteran abundance or
   diversity. Additionally, there were no interaction effects between
   collared lizard presence and glade area on orthopteran assemblages. We
   did find that month had the most consistent effect on orthopteran
   abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. These results contrast
   with other studies that indicate collared lizards influence orthopteran
   species richness on other glade communities within the region. In this
   study, seasonal effects, glade area, and unmeasured bottom-up effects
   appear more important for determining orthopteran diversity than
   predation. Our results provide further evidence that the strength of
   top-down effects can vary across a predator's range and could have
   implications for glade restoration plans in the region.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-189},

Abstract = {Prey species make choices about whether to employ costly predator
   avoidance behaviors throughout their growth and lifecycle. Here, we
   explore the effects of prey size at a given age (ontogenetic size) and
   prey growth on optimal behavior using a dynamic optimization model.
   Under the assumption that prey experience greatest predation risk at
   intermediate or large sizes, and that growth is fastest at intermediate
   or large sizes, we find that prey should generally forage when they are
   small in size and hide when they are larger due to a critical strategy
   switching size threshold. But this is dependent both on the mortality
   risks and on the rate of growth. Higher background mortality rates or
   lower predator-induced detection costs of foraging reduce the size at
   which prey switches from foraging to hiding. Rapid initial growth leads
   to decreased overall survival and a wider range of conditions under
   which the prey hides from the predator. As a test case, the model is
   parametrized with data and applied to understand differing risk-reducing
   behaviors between cannibal and non-cannibal Leptinotarsa decemlineata,
   Colorado potato beetle, larvae. The model predicts that a wide range of
   parameter values lead to differing behaviors of cannibals and
   non-cannibals of the same age due to differences in ontogenetic size. We
   also see that individuals with swifter early growth switch to hiding at
   larger sizes but will often have earlier strategy switching times. This
   increases survival of cannibals to the critical pupation size with the
   largest increases occurring when the baseline death rate is high. Our
   findings suggest that ecological factors that affect the rate of growth
   during development, even if final size is not affected, may have an
   important role in prey responses to predators.},

Abstract = {Despite their visibility, abundance, and widespread distribution, the
   movements of Isabella moth larvae (a.k.a ``woolly worms:'' Pyrrharctia

   poorly studied. We observed these larvae to assess the relationship
   between their movement and local environmental conditions. Twice each
   day for 83 d, nearly 52 km of highway were observed in northwest
   Missouri. A total of 264 larvae were encountered during 664 total visits
   to four road sections, peaking in the first week of October. Analyses
   revealed increased larva abundance (n >= 159 road-section visits)
   associated with temperature, wind speed, pale pavement tint, and
   afternoon time-of-day. The best overall model to explain larval movement
   patterns, based on 163 visits and all measured conditions, incorporated
   temperature, north wind speed, west wind speed, and humidity (P =
   0.015), but no other factors. In addition, larvae showed a significant
   tendency to travel in the same direction as the wind, and to travel
   eastward in the afternoons. These observations provide insights into the
   fall movements of a common larva, and provide directions for future

Abstract = {Grassland insect pollinators have undergone population declines due to
   habitat loss and degradation. Patch-burning is a management method used
   to reduce woody plant encroachment and maintain grassland habitats.
   However, the impacts of fire on the quality and quantity of floral
   resources (nectar volume, total sugar, and sucrose concentration)
   available to insect pollinators are understudied. Evaluating how time
   since last fire and season of fire impact nectar quality and quantity is
   vital to understanding the overall impact of fire on insect pollinator
   communities. For this study, 10 flowering forb species (Asclepias
   vindis, Baptisia alba, Cirsium undulatum, Desmodium canadense, Monarda
   citriodora, Monarda fistulosa, Oenothera speciosa, Penstemon
   tubaeflorus, Ruellia humilis, Spiranthes cernua) were selected in The
   Nature Conservancy's Joseph II. William's Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in
   an area managed with patch-burning and cattle grazing. Study sites were
   burned in spring 2018, summer 2018, summer 2019, and spring 2020, with
   three replicates of each treatment (for 12 total burn units). In each
   unit, we collected nectar from flowering individuals of each plant
   species with microcapillary tubes to measure standing crop or the nectar
   in flowers at any given time that is available to insect pollinators.
   Total volume of nectar and sucrose concentration were recorded, and
   total mg of sugar was calculated. Desmodium canaden se flowering
   individuals were only located in units burned the previous spring,
   whereas P. tubaeflorus flowering individuals were only located in units
   burned the previous summer. For the eight remaining species, total
   volume of nectar, total mg of sugar, and sucrose concentration varied
   with different burn regimens for different species. Cirsium undulatum
   inflorescences with crab spiders (Thomisidae) had higher volumes of
   nectar and higher amounts of sugar available. This study highlights how
   a patch-burn approach with different fire return intervals may benefit
   insect pollinators at the community level by providing a wide range of
   nectar qualities and quantities to support insect pollinators with
   different nutritional needs.},

Abstract = {Overcompensation to herbivory is prevalent among plant species. However,
   we do not yet fully understand why plant species vary in their
   compensatory abilities. It is highly likely that overcompensation is
   determined by the ability of plants to elevate photosynthesis in
   response to herbivory, which is dictated by evolutionary exposure to
   grazing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic
   overcompensation should be predictable based on plant life form by
   simulating herbivore damage on four plant species: two common range
   grasses with long evolutionary exposure to grazing (Andropogon gerardii,
   Bouteloua curtipendula) and two common understory forbs that are
   resistant to, and therefore experience little, grazing (Alliaria
   petiolata, Symplocarpus foetidus). We measured leaf-level gas exchange
   in a high-resolution time series that extended throughout the growing
   season. We found no evidence of photosynthetic compensation for three of
   the four plant species. Interestingly, only A. petiolata, a highly
   invasive species, demonstrated increased photosynthesis and stomatal
   conductance following clipping. Further, the effects were short-lived,
   as both photosynthesis and stomatal conductance returned to baseline
   levels within 24 h. Our results suggest that elevated photosynthesis to
   herbivory might not be a general mechanism by which plants either resist
   or tolerate herbivory.},

Abstract = {Mutualisms (reciprocally beneficial heterospecific interactions) are
   thought as susceptible to exploitation by ``cheaters{''} receiving
   benefits from partners without fair return. Theoretical studies suggest
   that partner discrimination is one of the key mechanisms to prevent
   cheaters from prevailing, but recently, a paradox is suggested that
   costly partner discrimination might collapse as the result of decreasing
   in quality variation among potential partners imposed by partner
   discrimination itself. Here, I develop a simple general mathematical
   model that consists of two host strains
   (discriminators/indiscriminators) and two symbiont strains
   (cooperators/non-cooperators) to establish a framework for the
   coevolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. First, I present a basic model, a
   positive equilibrium of which is neutrally stable. Secondly, I derive a
   formula to describe how the equilibrium shifts with a change in
   arbitrary parameters: I show a counter-intuitive result that the
   equilibrium frequency of discriminator hosts decreases as discrimination
   efficiency increases. Finally, I examine how the equilibrium and its
   stability changes by adding dependence of fitness of symbionts or hosts
   on their own frequencies: I find that negative or positive frequency
   dependence makes the equilibrium asymptotically stable or unstable,
   respectively. I also find that mutation and immigration of symbionts
   always make the equilibrium asymptotically stable, even if it does not
   increase low-quality symbionts.},

Title = {Host plant limitation of butterflies in highly fragmented landscapes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-175},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Insect herbivores can be limited by host plants in two ways:
   density-dependent competition for food resources or density-independent
   search time limitation. Our understanding of density-dependent host
   plant limitation is relatively well developed and well integrated into
   conservation plans for at-risk insects. Search time limitation, a
   density-independent process, is much less well developed. Here, we
   explore both mechanisms using empirically based models of monarch
   butterfly population dynamics. These mechanisms differ fundamentally in
   their predictions: resource competition leads to matching of herbivore
   densities to host plant densities, and visible competition via
   consumption of host plants. Search time limitation leads to changes in
   population growth rate that can cause herbivore numbers to decline when
   host plant densities are constant. Search time limitation also implies
   that host plants can limit herbivores, even when many individual plants
   are uneaten. For monarch butterflies, our calculations suggest that many
   parts of North America have host plant densities below the threshold for
   search time limitation, which contrasts with the typical assumption of
   resource competition. More generally, incorporating search time
   limitation into conservation plans is important for reframing our
   understanding of how host plants limit insect herbivores in highly
   fragmented landscapes.},

   electric transmission line ROW in central Pennsylvania. The overall
   abundance of birds was significantly lower within the wire and border

   cycle at State Game Lands (SGL 33) than in the years prior to
   management. Sections of ROW with no border zones contained the lowest
   abundance and species richness of breeding birds compared to sections
   with borders prior to the initiation of a new management cycle. Sections
   of ROW with no border zones and mowing sections had the lowest bird
   abundance and species richness of all ROW sections at the onset of a new
   management cycle, and contained the lowest number of bird species
   displaying evidence of breeding, both prior to and at the beginning of
   management cycles. Sections of ROW managed using herbicides were
   comparable or more beneficial to bird communities in terms of abundance,
   species richness, indices of productivity, and nesting success than
   sections maintained via mechanical treatments (mowing and hand cutting),
   both at the end and beginning of management cycles within a forested

   first clutch failed and renests hatched from late May to early July
   (95\% CI: 23 May-8 Jul.). Known territorial birds began congregating in
   mid-Sept, and fall migration typically occurred in late Nov. Territory
   use by adults occurred at all stages of the annual cycle and may be a

Title = {Sea-level rise can reverse the conditions that promote the spread of
   ecosystem engineers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Climate change and its consequences such as sea-level rise will modify
   environmental gradients, altering the spatial spread and persistence of
   plant populations. However, ecosystem engineers can also modify
   environmental gradients. To quantify the potential interactive effects
   of climate change and ecosystem engineering on population spread rates,
   we develop a spatial model that explicitly focuses on feedbacks between
   coastal vegetation growth and the environmental gradient of marsh
   elevation. We use the model to determine how sea-level rise could change
   how ecosystem engineering affects the spread rate of marsh populations.
   The model demonstrates that low levels of ecosystem engineering can
   produce the highest population spread rates in the absence of sea-level
   rise in initially low-elevation marshes. However, higher rates of
   ecosystem engineering and initially higher elevation marshes produce the
   highest population spread rates in the presence of sea-level rise.
   Sea-level rise can therefore reverse the conditions that drive high
   rates of spatial spread: engineers with low rates of spatial spread
   prior to sea-level rise may spread faster as sea levels rise. This
   result suggests that sea-level rise may promote the spread of invasive
   ecosystem engineers that previously experienced low rates of spatial
   spread. Moreover, ecosystem engineering can serve as a mechanism for
   adaptation to climate-driven changes in environmental gradients.
   Ecosystem engineering has the potential to rescue both native and exotic
   plant populations from climate-driven decreases in habitat suitability.},

Abstract = {We consider the collective motion of animals in time-varying
   environments, using as a case the diel vertical migration of marine
   copepods. The animals are distributed in space such that each animal
   moves optimally, seeking regions which offer high growth rates and low
   mortalities, subject to costs on excessive movements as well as being in
   regions with high densities of conspecifics. The model applies to
   repeated scenarios such as diel or seasonal patterns, where the animals
   are aware of both current and future environmental conditions. We show
   that this problem can be viewed as a differential game of mean field
   type, and that the evolutionary stable solution, i.e., the Nash
   equilibrium, is characterized by partial differential equations, which
   govern the distributions and migration velocities of animals. These
   equations have similarities to equations that appear in the fluid
   dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid
   fluids. If the environment is constant, the ideal free distribution
   emerges as an equilibrium. We illustrate the theory with a numerical
   example of vertical migrations of oceanic copepods, where animals are
   attracted to nutrient-rich surface waters while repulsed from light
   during daytime due to the presence of visual predators, aiming to reduce
   both proximity to conspecifics and swimming efforts. For this case, we
   show that optimal movements are diel vertical migrations in qualitative
   agreement with observations of copepods.},

Title = {Herbivore population dynamics in response to plant allocation strategies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {191-202},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {When herbivores feed, plants may respond by altering the quantity of
   edible biomass available to future feeders through mechanisms such as
   compensatory regrowth of edible structures or allocation of biomass to
   inedible reserves. Previous work showed that some forms of compensatory
   regrowth can drive insect outbreaks, but this work assumed regrowth
   occurred without any energetic cost to the plant. While this is a useful
   simplifying assumption for gaining preliminary insights, plants face an
   inherent trade-off between allocating energy to regrowth versus storage.
   Therefore, we cannot truly understand the role of compensatory regrowth
   in driving insect outbreaks without continuing on to more realistic
   scenarios. In this paper, we model the interaction between insect
   herbivores and plants that have a trade-off between compensatory
   regrowth and allocation to inedible reserves in response to herbivory.
   We found that the plant's allocation strategy, described in our model by
   parameters representing the strength of the overcompensatory response
   and the rates at which energy is stored and mobilized for growth,
   strongly affects whether herbivore outbreaks occur. Additional factors,
   such as the strength of food limitation and herbivore interference while
   feeding, influence the frequency of the outbreaks. Overall, we found a
   possible new role of overcompensation to promote herbivore fluctuations
   when it co-occurs with allocation to inedible reserves. We highlight the
   importance of considering trade-offs between tolerance mechanisms that
   plants use in response to herbivory by showing that new dynamics arise
   when different plant allocation strategies occur simultaneously.},

   populations},

Pages = {95-113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plasticity is the extent to which life history processes such as growth
   and reproduction depend on the environment. Plasticity in individual
   growth varies widely between taxa. Nonetheless, little is known about
   the effect of plasticity in individual growth on the ecological dynamics
   of populations. In this article, we analyse a physiologically structured
   population model of a consumer population in which the individual growth
   rate can be varied between entirely plastic to entirely non-plastic. We
   derive this population level model from a dynamic energy budget model to
   ensure an accurate energetic coupling between ingestion, somatic
   maintenance, growth and reproduction within an individual. We show that
   the consumer population is either limited by adult fecundity or juvenile
   survival up to maturation, depending on the level of growth plasticity
   and the non-plastic individual growth rate. Under these two regimes, we
   also find two different types of population cycles which again arise due
   to fluctuation in, respectively, juvenile growth rate or adult
   fecundity. In the end, our model not only provides insight into the
   effects of growth plasticity on population dynamics, but also provides a
   link between the dynamics found in age- and size-structured models.},

Title = {Effects of predator novelty on intraguild predation communities with
   adaptive prey defense},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding coexistence within community modules such as intraguild
   predation (IGP), where an omnivore both preys on and competes with an
   intermediate consumer for a shared resource, has provided insight into
   the mechanisms that promote the persistence of complex food webs.
   Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to
   enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet
   to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have an accurate
   perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses,
   assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator.
   We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP
   coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense,
   whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response;
   and naivete toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to
   accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native
   predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs.
   The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of
   adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would
   persist in the absence of novelty and inducing unstable dynamics in
   previously stable regions of parameter space. Coexistence is predicted
   to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense than to
   naivete, and differentially leads to the exclusion of native predators
   in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low.
   Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a
   trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore
   exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy
   to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our analyses suggest that
   models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding
   predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has
   significant implications for food web dynamics.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dispersal is crucial in governing species response toward climate
   warming. Previous studies suggest that intermediate and
   density-dependent dispersal enables the functioning of a metacommunity,
   stabilizing populations at local and regional scales. Here, we consider
   a spatial ecological model with temperature-dependent traits to
   elucidate dispersal effects in stabilizing population dynamics under
   climate warming. Specifically, we analyze the effect of species
   temperature-dependent life-history traits on a metacommunity dynamics
   with diverse dispersal strategies (i.e., constant and density-dependent
   dispersal), tracked along with different dispersal rates of species
   (relative dispersal). At low and intermediate temperatures, different
   dispersal strategies synchronize or desynchronize the population
   dynamics depending upon dispersal rates. However, high temperatures
   completely synchronize the population trailing constant dispersal,
   weakening the stabilizing dynamics. Furthermore, density-dependent
   dispersal strongly affects the stability of metacommunity at high
   temperatures by increasing or decreasing spatial synchrony depending on
   dispersal rates. In metacommunities with many patches, conditional upon
   temperature, species abundance exhibits coexistence of synchronous and
   asynchronous oscillations, namely the chimera state. Overall, our
   results show that rising temperature may destabilize the dynamics by
   synchronizing populations; however, some dispersal mechanisms might
   impede the adverse outcomes.},

Abstract = {Urban prairie ``gardens/plots{''} are gaining popularity for providing
   similar ecological services as remnant and restored prairies, which are
   predominantly found in rural areas. However, it is not known to what
   extent small urban prairies can sustain the plant-pollinator
   interactions that are vital to both the insects and the plants. The goal
   of our research was to examine plant/pollinator interactions in three
   urban prairies in southwest Missouri and compare them to rural
   managed/restored prairies using a visit-based approach. Urban prairies
   were all in Springfield, Mo. and shared similar habitat matrices (within
   an area of 8 km(2)); rural prairies were located within 68 km of urban
   prairies, shared similar habitat matrices to each other, and shared soil
   edaphic characteristics with an urban prairie. From May through August
   2018 in all six prairies, we observed the five most abundant forbs in
   bloom, the number of pollinator visits by bees, butterflies/moths,
   wasps, beetles, and flies; and, pollinator fidelity from dawn to dusk.
   The areas observed within a prairie, hereafter ``plot(s){''}, were
   determined randomly by where at least two plants of the same species,
   out of the five most abundant forbs, were located. Using these criteria
   of observations on the five most abundant species across six prairies
   and four months, a total of 66 forb species were identified, with 58 of
   the species native to tallgrass prairies. However, only eight of the 58
   native forb species were shared across urban and rural prairies. Jaccard
   similarity indices indicate lower similarity of the five abundant forbs
   within urban plots (9\%) when compared to rural plots (24\%), and low
   similarity between urban and rural plots (9\%). Insect visitation varied
   by prairie type (rural/urban), month, and insect group; however, urban
   plots received 61\% of the total visits compared to 39\% in rural plots.
   Bees accounted for 5913 visits out of 10,113 visits recorded; high bee
   visits were similar in urban and rural plots. Insect fidelity was over
   97\% and did not significantly differ between rural and urban prairies.
   Therefore, the lack of similarity among and across urban and rural
   prairies in dominant species did not affect insect visitation rates or
   fidelity in our study. Our results suggest that establishment and
   management of urban prairie gardens and plots of various size may
   sustain the same or greater levels of pollinator services as rural
   prairies.},

Abstract = {Forest bats, including evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis), sometimes
   roost in manmade structures, such as barns and bridges, but here we
   report the first observations of evening bats using bird nest boxes for
   roosting on multiple occasions between 2012 and 2019, a few kilometers
   north of Jonesboro, Arkansas. Most encounters were in August, when the
   nesting season is almost finished. We discuss timing and factors that
   may explain use of bird nest boxes for roosting by bats.},

Abstract = {Recolonization by native species following removal of invasive plant
   species can often be uneven and lead to the rapid increase of one or a
   few native plant species. This can result in the formation of a
   significant resource pulse that may consequently affect populations of
   herbivorous species and their natural enemies. Here we present results
   from observations of parasitism rates during a localized outbreak of the
   Asimina webworm moth, Omphalocera munroei, a locally monophagous
   herbivore of the common paw-paw. Asimina triloba. This outbreak
   initiated from locations of increased understory growth of A. triloba,
   following the removal of Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii ).
   Parasitism rates during the outbreak reached 50\%, with higher
   parasitism rates observed in larvae collected at the end of the local
   outbreak relative to those the year following the peak of the outbreak.
   Parasitism rates remained high 3 y after the end of the local O. munroei
   outbreak, indicating >7 y of high parasitoid densities. O. munroei
   emerges late in the growing season, making it fairly inaccessible as a
   host or prey to many generalist predators/parasitoids, which emerge
   earlier the following year. This suggests the O. munroei outbreak
   potentially contributed to an increase in natural enemy pressure of
   other native species in the community.},

Title = {Population and Community Responses of Small Mammals to Single-tree
   Selection Harvest in Laurentian Hardwood Forests},

Pages = {1-19},

Abstract = {Small mammals are ubiquitous members of vertebrate communities that are
   sensitive to habitat change. In the Great Lakes region of North America,
   small mammal communities have changed rapidly, but experimental tests of
   potential mechanisms are lacking. Using a before-alter,
   control-treatment design, we quantified the response of small mammals to
   single-tree selection harvest in Laurentian hardwood forests of
   Wisconsin, United States. We documented changes in forest structure and
   small mammal abundance, species diversity, and community similarity from
   silvicultural treatment. Treatment reduced tree density and canopy cover
   and increased mean tree diameter, woody stern density, variation in
   woody stem density, and volume of coarse woody debris. Peromyscus and
   northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were dominant
   community members across treatments and years. White-footed mice (P.
   leucopus) outnumbered woodland deer mice (P. maniculatus gracilis)
   before treatment, but declined by almost fifty percent after treatment;
   deer mice and total rodent (i.e., Rodentia) abundances were unchanged.
   Small mammal species diversity increased twofold following treatment.
   Our experiment identified species-specific responses within Peromyscus
   to timber harvest: white-footed mice, the numerically dominant and
   generalist species, were most sensitive to habitat change, and their
   response produced cascading effects to small mammal community
   .structure. Future experiments should assess these small mammal
   responses in a multi-year framework and quantify their effects on the
   broader vertebrate community.},

Title = {Oxbow Restorations for Topeka Shiner (Notropis topeka) Recovery:
   Defining Success},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-73},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Within the Great Plains region of North America, oxbow wetlands were
   lost as streams were channelized and straightened to allow for
   agricultural use of the landscape. Topeka Shiner, which rely on these
   oxbow wetlands, have declined in abundance, currently occupy 20\% of
   their historical geographic range, and are now an endangered species. A
   large emphasis has been placed on restoring oxbow wetlands to recover
   Topeka Shiner populations. As the number of oxbow restorations has
   increased, so has the number of monitoring projects focused on these
   habitats. Currently, conservation practitioners rely on the presence of
   Topeka Shiner to determine the success of an oxbow restoration. Given
   the rarity of the species, this method is likely ineffective. Within
   this study we attempt to create a model that can be used to determine
   the success of an oxbow restoration that will benefit the Topeka Shiner
   without relying on the presence of the species in the wetland. We used
   multiple fish community metrics and modelling strategies to determine
   the best model for predicting Topeka Shiner CPUE and presence/absence
   within oxbows. We determined that the top models were ineffective at
   predicting Topeka Shiner CPUE and presence/absence. Our findings
   illustrate the random nature by which fish communities become
   established within oxbows, and the island-like nature of oxbows in terms
   of how fish communities may become established and change over time.
   These findings indicate that the success of oxbow restoration for Topeka
   Shiner needs to be defined at a larger scale than for individual oxbows.
   Furthermore, our findings corroborate the inability of previous studies
   to determine reproducible associations of Topeka Shiner with various
   fish community metrics.},

Title = {Improving Genetic Status Despite Fragmentation and Small Effective
   Population Size in Hill's Thistle (Cirsium hillii)},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {187},

Abstract = {Small, fragmented populations are at greater risk of extirpation due to
   reduced genetic diversity from inbreeding and genetic drift. These
   processes ultimately decrease individual fitness and reduce the ability
   of a population to adapt. Hill's thistle (Cirsium hillii) is classified
   as a threatened species throughout much of its range, primarily due to
   the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat. This study addresses
   the impact of population size and isolation on the genetic diversity of
   Hill's thistle. We used microsatellite markers to genotype plants
   collected from the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in 2001, and from the
   Lower Peninsula and Drummond Island in 2012, in order to assess genetic
   differentiation across time and space, as well as to investigate rates
   of inbreeding in isolated and nonisolated populations. Genetic
   differentiation between the sample sites in the mainland population of
   Hill's thistle increased significantly between 2001 and 2012, indicative
   of increased fragmentation and isolation of the sample sites. However,
   the 2012 population exhibited lower inbreeding and no difference in
   heterozygosity or allelic diversity compared to 2001, suggesting the
   population is stable, or growing, in spite of isolation. Conversely, the
   population on Drummond Island displayed higher levels of inbreeding and
   lower number of effective alleles and heterozygosity compared to the
   mainland, typical of a small, isolated population. Our results indicate
   that the mainland population of Hill's thistle is persisting but should
   continue to be monitored demographically due to ongoing habitat loss.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {It has been a century since the species-area relationship (SAR) was
   first proposed as a power law to explain how species richness scales
   with area. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of this
   predominant form. Apart from the power law, numerous empirical studies
   also report a semi-log form of the SAR, but very few have addressed its
   incidence. In this work, we test whether these relationships could
   emerge from the assembly of large random communities on island-like
   systems. The clustering of same-species individuals is central to our
   results, which we incorporate by modifying the self-interaction term in
   the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Our analysis demonstrates that
   the two most widely reported relationship forms can emerge due to
   differences in immigration rates and skewness towards weak interactions.
   We particularly highlight the incidence of the semi-log SAR for low
   immigration rates from a source pool, which is consistent with several
   previous empirical studies. The two SAR forms might show good fits to
   data over a large span of areas but a power-law overestimates species
   richness on smaller islands in remote archipelagoes.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Consumers must track and acquire resources in complex landscapes. Much
   discussion has focused on the concept of a `resource gradient' and the
   mechanisms by which consumers can take advantage of such gradients as
   they navigate their landscapes in search of resources. However, the
   concept of tracking resource gradients means different things in
   different contexts. Here, we take a synthetic approach and consider six
   different definitions of what it means to search for resources based on
   density or gradients in density. These include scenarios where consumers
   change their movement behavior based on the density of conspecifics, on
   the density of resources, and on spatial or temporal gradients in
   resources. We also consider scenarios involving non-local perception and
   a form of memory. Using a continuous space, continuous time model that
   allows consumers to switch between resource-tracking and random motion,
   we investigate the relative performance of these six different
   strategies. Consumers' success in matching the spatiotemporal
   distributions of their resources differs starkly across the six
   scenarios. Movement strategies based on perception and response to
   temporal (rather than spatial) resource gradients afforded consumers
   with the best opportunities to match resource distributions. All
   scenarios would allow for optimization of resource-matching in terms of
   the underlying parameters, providing opportunities for evolutionary
   adaptation, and links back to classical studies of foraging ecology.},

Abstract = {Past and current anthropogenic practices have resulted in dramatic
   alterations to ungulate population densities worldwide. When ungulate
   populations are overabundant, they can alter the dynamics, structure,
   and function of ecosystems. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
   specifically, can occur at densities far greater than their historical
   records in parts of their native range, which includes forests in the
   northeastern U.S. They have been shown to alter community structure of
   native plants, indirectly impact animal communities, and promote the
   success of invasive species. Despite much research into the effects of
   overabundant ungulates and deer in particular, less is known about the
   effects of deer on soil microbial communities. Here, we utilized soil
   samples from inside and outside of six deer exclosures located in a
   regional second growth mixed hardwood forest on the Binghamton
   University campus in Vestal NY, USA. A metagenomic analysis was
   conducted on DNA extracted from the soil to identify the microbes
   present. Soil characteristics, including soil organic matter, soil
   moisture, pH, and electrical conductivity were also measured. Soil
   samples from inside exclosures had on average lower pH, higher soil
   moisture and organic matter, and higher electrical conductivity. The
   microbial communities across all samples were dominated by
   Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. However, the
   structure of the microbial soil community appeared to differ between
   samples taken inside and outside the exclosures, with those taken
   outside more closely resembling other outside samples and those sampled
   inside soils showing more variability in community structure. Overall,
   our results suggest that overabundant deer may have a homogenization
   effect on the soil abiotic environment and the soil microbial community.},

Abstract = {Ecology and evolution under changing environments are important in many
   subfields of biology with implications for medicine. Here, we explore an
   example: the consequences of fluctuating environments on the emergence
   of antibiotic resistance, which is an immense and growing problem.
   Typically, high doses of antibiotics are employed to eliminate the
   infection quickly and minimize the time under which resistance may
   emerge. However, this strategy may not be optimal. Since competition can
   reduce fitness and resistance typically has a reproductive cost,
   resistant mutants' fitness can depend on their environment. Here we show
   conditions under which environmental varying fitness can be exploited to
   prevent the emergence of resistance. We develop a stochastic
   Lotka-Volterra model of a microbial system with competing phenotypes: a
   wild strain susceptible to the antibiotic, and a mutant strain that is
   resistant. We investigate the impact of various pulsed applications of
   antibiotics on population suppression. Leveraging competition, we show
   how a strategy of environmental switching can suppress the infection
   while avoiding resistant mutants. We discuss limitations of the
   procedure depending on the microbe and pharmacodynamics and methods to
   ameliorate them.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation promotes coexistence under competition for
   essential resources},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Intraspecific variation may be key to coexistence in diverse
   communities, with some even suggesting it is necessary for large numbers
   of competitors to coexist. However, theory provides little support for
   this argument, instead finding that intraspecific variation generally
   makes it more difficult for species to coexist. Here we present a model
   of competition where two species compete for two essential resources and
   individuals within populations vary in their ability to take up
   different resources. We found a range of cases where intraspecific
   variation expands the range of conditions under which coexistence can
   occur, which provides a mechanism that allows the ecologically neutral
   evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to become ecologically stable. We
   demonstrate that this result relies on nonlinearity in the function that
   describes how traits map onto ecological function. A sigmoid mapping
   function is necessary in order to model essential resources because it
   allows for variation in an unbounded trait while maintaining
   biologically realistic boundaries on uptake rates, and differs from
   other kinds of nonlinearity, which only unidirectionally increase or
   decrease ecological function. The sigmoid function's nonlinearity
   spreads individuals unevenly along the growth function, which allows
   positive growth contributions from some individuals to compensate for
   growth loses from others, akin to source-sink dynamics, leading to
   coexistence. In this way, intraspecific trait variation is able to
   amplify niche differences, thereby strengthening coexistence. We discuss
   empirical systems beyond competition for essential resources in which
   piecewise functions (i.e., thresholds) are important.},

Abstract = {Science is based on studying some aspects of the world while holding
   others constant. The assumptions of what can and cannot be ignored
   implicitly shape our understanding of the world around us. This truth is
   particularly evident when studying biology through mathematical models,
   where one must explicitly state assumptions during the process of model
   building. Although we often recognize that all models are ``wrong{''} in
   their assumptions, we often overlook the corollary that developing
   multiple models that are wrong in different ways can help us triangulate
   truth in our understanding. Theoretical biologists build models in the
   image of how they envision the world, an image that is shaped by their
   scientific identity, experiences, and perspectives. A lack of diversity
   in any of these axes handicaps our ability to understand biological
   systems through theory. However, we can overcome this by collectively
   recognizing our own assumptions, by understanding how perspective shapes
   the development of theory, and - most importantly - by increasing the
   diversity of theoretical biologists (in terms of identity, experiences,
   and perspectives). Combined, this will lead to developing theory that
   provides a richer understanding of the biological world.},

   species using data from BirdLife International, the Global Biodiversity
   Information Fund database, e-Bird, and the Naturalista. We used the
   Mexican Woodnymph records in Jalisco and projected them on a vegetation
   map. We documented a female constructing a nest, later nesting, until
   the nestlings flew out of the nest in the cloud forest in
   central-western Mexico: Jalisco state. The nest site was characterized
   and the materials used for the nest construction were determined. In
   addition, we documented several observations made on territorial and

Abstract = {The ability of an animal to acquire enough food to meet its caloric
   needs is key to its survival and fitness. Understanding the composition
   of that animal's diet is a crucial element to consider when assessing
   the species' health and overall role in its ecosystem. We conducted a
   dietary study of Northern River Otter (Lontra canadensis) at 18 sites
   across 12 different watersheds in Wisconsin, U.S.A., from summer 2017
   through winter 2018. We report the frequency of prey remains found in
   river otter scats (n =190) collected at these sites. Fish of any kind
   appeared in 86\% (n = 163) of all scat samples, while crayfish
   (Cambaridae) were the most commonly occurring individual prey item,
   appearing in 62\% (n = 117) of all scat samples. The second most common
   prey groups were the bottom feeder fish (Catostomidac and Cyprinidae)
   group and the panfish (Centrarchidae) group, which both occurred in 45\%
   of all scats. While identifying prey species, we found small, spherical
   objects that did not appear to be of biological origin in 48\% (n = 92)
   of all scats. After testing the objects using multiple approaches, we
   confirmed the objects as microbeads, defined as small beads of plastic
   composition no larger than 5mm in size. This is the first recorded
   observation of plastic microbeads associated with river otters in North
   America, and may indicate bioaccumulation of these objects in inland
   waterways.},

Abstract = {We assessed a large-scale fish die off event resultant of prolonged
   anoxic conditions on Grand Lake St. Marys in west central Ohio, U.S.,
   during the summer of 2020, and used this as the basis for comparing
   long-term species diversity in the lake over the past century. Fish
   collections were made along a series of shoreline and open water
   transects, totaling approximately 1.5\% of the entire 5220 ha lake area
   (majority of surveys were shoreline), wherein we identified a total of
   12,351 fish comprised of 25 taxa. We used this die off event, combined
   with recent near shore seine survey data, as an opportunity to assess
   the modern assemblage structure and to serve as a reference point to
   prior collected data over the past century. Combining these recent data
   with historical records, we found that although 57 species have been
   recorded from the lake dating back to the mid-1800s, only 30 taxa are
   known to inhabit the lake today. Some of the lost taxa predictably
   include more intolerant species from the Darter (Percidae), Minnow
   (Cyprinidae), and Sucker (Catostomidae) families; however, there were
   also instances of increases in taxa resulting from both state stocking
   efforts (e.g. Flathead Catfish, Pylodictis olivaris) and natural
   distribution expansions (e.g. Freshwater Drum, Aplodinotus grunniens).
   Overall, we attribute the changes to the fish assemblage as negative,
   given no intolerant taxa currently inhabit the lake. We attribute these
   long-term changes to watershed wide destruction of natural forest,
   wetland, and prairie habitats that once typified the region.},

Abstract = {The ability of organisms to survive ingestion and digestion by their
   predators, or endozoochory, is a fascinating ecological phenomenon that
   can facilitate predator-mediated dispersal of prey and alter interaction
   strengths within ecological networks. However, the role of endozoochory
   in the context of invasive species is considered less often. Throughout
   the United States, Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are
   prolific invaders that often alter food web structure of recipient
   ecosystems through the consumption of basal resources. Despite the
   biogeochemical and food web effects of Silver Carp, there is limited
   understanding of plankton prey survival after Silver Carp consumption
   and digestion, and even less known about the ecological effects of
   selective diets and potential survival. In this study, we quantify
   hindgut contents of Silver Carp collected from Kentucky Lake, Kentucky,
   Tennessee River Valley, United States. We found the majority (83\%) of
   phytoplankters within hindguts of Silver Carp showed little digestion
   prior to egestion. Our study suggests digestion limitations of Silver
   Carp may have important ecological implications for invaded
   environments. These results may be applicable in understanding how this
   rapidly spreading invasive fish can influence food web dynamics and
   biogeochemical cycles pertinent to toxic algal blooms within recently
   invaded ecosystems, and forecasting invasion in the near future.},

Title = {Long Term Progress in Riparian Restoration with Concurrent Avian
   Declines in the Southern San Francisco Bay Area (CA)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},

Abstract = {The restoration of riparian habitats aims to provide habitat for birds
   and other environmental benefits; yet the evaluation of long-term
   outcomes is rare. To address this knowledge gap, we used bird and
   vegetation data from Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS), in the southern
   San Francisco Bay Area, to assess the progress of two riparian
   revegetation projects (1987 Revegetation, 1993 Revegetation) over nearly
   two decades. Restoration success was measured by changes in 1)
   vegetation structure and composition, and 2) avian abundance, diversity,
   and community composition. We compared the two revegetated areas to a
   remnant riparian reference site and a managed floodplain overflow
   channel in three time periods (1996-1998, 2004-2006, 2012-2014) using
   ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and beta diversity analysis of avian community
   composition. Over time, the restored areas became more similar to the
   remnant riparian reference site in four of seven indices. The avian
   community became more similar across the habitat areas over time,
   although differences remained. Migratory birds declined across all
   habitat areas, while resident and wintering birds declined in one
   revegetated habitat only. Overall we found that different types of data
   told different stories, indicating both convergence with the reference
   site and ongoing differences. Our findings highlight the need for
   multifaceted approaches to evaluating restoration success.},

Title = {Limits to Local Sourcing in Herbaceous Plant Restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The appropriate collection zone for seeds and transplants is a key
   concern for plant restoration ecology, with local sourcing thought to be
   the ``gold standard.{''} Local sourcing is based on the premise that
   most plant species are genetically adapted to the local environment
   through the action of natural selection, and that non-local ecotypes
   will disrupt this adaptation. However, a number of factors may allow
   practitioners to expand sourcing. These include genetic variation that
   is non-adaptive, phenotypic plasticity, climate change, disturbance, and
   a host of practical issues. These factors are reflected in the range of
   collection zone protocols that have been developed by practitioners,
   ranging from local sourcing to bypassing species identity in favor of
   function. In addition, phenotypic plasticity, because it allows a single
   genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental
   variation, may also allow for a broadened collection zone. Little is
   known about the degree of genetic variation and local adaptation for
   most plant species. More evidence-based sourcing could result from
   collaboration between researchers and practitioners, including tracking
   seed and plant sources, their performance at restoration sites, and
   conducting reciprocal transplant studies. Inferring the degree of gene
   flow based on morphological characters has also shown some promise for
   inferring genetic variation among populations. Research that includes
   more robust sampling of populations within species would lead to more
   precise estimates of gene flow in relation to plant traits.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Trial plantings of Castanea dentata (American chestnut) are currently
   underway using reclaimed surface mines as reintroduction sites for
   hybrids bred for disease resistance to canker causing Cryphonectria
   parasitica (chestnut blight). Coalfields of the eastern US coincide with
   the species range, but little is known of its ecological interactions as
   it had largely been extirpated from the landscape by the 1940s.
   Non-native species such as Lespedeza cuneata (sericea lespedeza) have
   been planted extensively in the region for both agriculture and mine
   reclamation and often dominate disturbed sites to form novel systems in
   place of native forests. We investigated the influence of herbaceous
   species on BC2F3 chestnut hybrid establishment and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   root colonization on three surface mines in eastern Tennessee that were
   restored using methods to avoid soil compaction. Hybrid chestnut growth,
   vegetation density, and species composition surrounding each seedling
   was assessed after eight growing seasons. ECM fungi present on root
   samples was quantified and identified by DNA sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Sites differed significantly in
   herbaceous cover and seedling growth. Larger seedlings were found on the
   site that was comprised primarily of L. cuneata. Average ECM
   colonization was similar across sites, and groundcover vegetation
   diversity or L. cuneata did not influence ECM species richness. There
   was a difference in ECM community composition among the three sites with
   some fungi displaying subtle changes in species rank. Results suggest
   that in the absence of soil compaction, L. cuneata does not impede
   hybrid chestnut establishment or ECM root colonization in Appalachian
   afforestation projects.},

Title = {Comparison of the Absolute and Relative Difference Spectral Indices to
   Estimate Burn Severity: The Case of Endangered Nothofagus alessandrii
   (ruil)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accurate information is needed about burn severity caused by fires to
   design strategies for ecosystem recovery. The Mediterranean zone of
   Chile holds a high level of plant endemism. In summer 2017, nearly half
   a million hectares were severely burnt by fire in this zone. In this
   paper, we assessed the performance of three spectral indices used in
   mapping burn severity (difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}dNBR],
   Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}RdNBR], and Relativized
   Burn Ratio {[}RBR]) on fragmented populations of the endangered ruil
   tree Nothofagus alessandrii, an endemic species of central Chile. The
   indices were obtained from Sentinel 2 images and their results
   contrasted with field measurements of severity recorded using the
   Composite Burn Index (CBI). The indices estimated the severity
   categories with a high overall accuracy obtained from error matrices and
   reaching values of 77.3, 76.0 and 69.3\% for RdNBR, RBR, and dNBR,
   respectively. The surface estimated for the categories without damage
   (ND), low (L), and medium (M) were greater for the RdNBR and RBR indices
   than for the dNBR, while an opposite tendency was observed for the high
   severity category (H). Our results properly described the spatial
   variability of burn severity. This information may be useful for
   creating and managing plans for the recovery of highly fragmented and
   threatened deciduous ecosystems such as those dominated by ruil. We
   suggest that strategies for recovery or restoration should be oriented
   to the high fire severity zones, where reproductive individuals were
   lost, and the successful seedling recruitment is expected to diminish.},

Abstract = {Non-native, invasive grasses can pose a threat to biodiversity in the
   southern U.S. Pennisetum ciliare (buffelgrass) is an example of an
   introduced invasive grass that has established in southwestern
   rangelands and negatively influenced biodiversity. Since its
   introduction, millions of hectares in the southwestern U.S. have been
   planted with, or invaded by, buffelgrass. Buffelgrass can form
   monocultures that not only reduce biodiversity but can also change
   ecosystem processes. Native-grassland restorations may be able to
   mitigate such negative impacts of non-native grasses. We con-ducted a
   study to document the response of herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs)
   and wildlife (grassland breeding birds, grassland wintering birds, and
   butterflies) to a 118-ha grassland restoration (involving prescribed
   fire, multiple discing and herbicide applications, and native-plant
   seeding) in La Salle County, Texas during 2013-2019. In general, we
   documented a numerical increase for all three taxa (native plants,
   birds, and butterflies) in species richness and relative abundance on
   the restoration site compared to a control. Our results suggest that
   native-grassland restoration is possible in a landscape dominated by
   buffelgrass. These restoration efforts can increase plant and wildlife
   diversity, although the time and expense required to achieve such
   responses are great.},

Title = {Nurse Rocks as a Minimum-Input Restoration Technique for the Cactus
   Opuntia basilaris},

Abstract = {Much plant recruitment in deserts occurs in shaded microsites below
   canopies of mature perennial plants. Absence of ``nurse plants{''} from
   disturbed sites often hinders ecological recovery. Given uncertainty and
   expense of directly restoring live plants in deserts, we explored using
   abiotic structures-nurse rocks- as a restoration option for
   reestablishing Opuntia basilaris (beavertail pricklypear) on a disturbed
   site in the Sonoran Desert, of the U.S. Wild populations at this site
   were strictly associated with large varnished surface rocks. To examine
   whether rocks functioned similarly as nurses for O. basilaris
   recruitment in disturbed and undisturbed reference habitats, we
   transplanted 30 rooted individuals each into habitat in which large
   varnished surface rocks were removed and into nearby undisturbed
   habitat. Within habitats, half the individuals were transplanted into
   open (no rocks) or rock (rocks surrounding transplants) microsites. In
   the first 15 months after planting, which had average precipitation,
   transplant survival did not differ between microsite types in either
   habitat but functional measures were influenced positively by nurse
   rocks. Nurse rocks sharply increased vegetative growth in 91.7\% of
   transplants in undisturbed habitat and in flowering occurrence in 28.6\%
   of transplants in disturbed habitat. Nurse rocks became even more
   important during extreme drought as the experiment progressed. By 27
   months after planting, 2x (disturbed habitat) and 8x (undisturbed
   habitat) more transplants survived with nurse rocks compared to without.
   As a low-cost technique utilizing on-site material, nurse rocks show
   promise for enhancing revegetation success on disturbed desert sites,
   especially during drought.},

Pages = {36-43},

Abstract = {Encroachment of Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass), a non-native
   perennial grass species, challenges land managers in the southwestern
   United States due to its tendency to increase fire frequency and
   displacement of natives. In areas characterized by disturbance, E.
   lehmanniana displaces Agave palmeri (Palmer's agave), an ecologically
   and socioculturally significant native plant species in the Sonoran
   Desert. We explored strategies to enhance short-term A. palmeri
   establishment using a greenhouse experiment. We assessed survival and
   growth responses of transplanted A. palmeri exposed to a variety of
   manipulated variables, including biotic (agave size at planting and E.
   lehmanniana competition) and abiotic (simulated precipitation and
   surface litter). We found a significant increase in A. palmeri biomass
   in the absence of E. lehmanniana in the high and medium watering
   treatments compared to agave in the presence of clipped E. lehmanniana
   neighbors. The presence of E. lehmanniana did not significantly affect
   A. palmeri biomass in the low water treatment. In the medium and low
   watering treatments, A. palmeri with litter had nearly twice the biomass
   as those without litter. The absence of E. lehmanniana with the high
   watering treatment and litter resulted in the largest agave biomass. For
   improved A. palmeri growth (and likely its survival) in restoration
   projects, we recommend supplemental watering and litter addition.
   Removal of E. lehmanniana is also suggested (by hand if possible);
   however, this species could operate as a nurse plant for agaves.},

Abstract = {Fox genes encode transcription factors that contain a DNA binding
   domain, the forkhead domain, and are known from diverse animal species.
   The exact homology of the Fox genes of different species is debated and
   this makes inferences about the evolution of the Fox genes, and their
   duplications and losses difficult. We have performed phylogenetic
   analyses of the Fox gene complements of 32 panarthropod species. Our
   results confirm an ancestral complement of FoxA, FoxB, FoxC, FoxD, FoxF,
   FoxG, FoxJ1, FoxJ2/3, FoxK, FoxL1, FoxL2, FoxN1/4, FoxN2/3, FoxO, FoxP,
   and FoxQ2 in the Arthropoda, and additionally FoxH and FoxQ1 in the
   Panarthropoda (including tardigrades and onychophorans). We identify a
   novel Fox gene sub-family, that we designate as FoxT that includes two
   genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Circadianly Regulated Gene (Crg-1) and
   forkhead domain 3F (fd3F). In a very recent paper, the same new Fox gene
   sub-family was identified in insects (Lin et al. 2021). Our analysis
   confirms the presence of FoxT and shows that its members are present
   throughout Panarthropoda. We show that the hitherto unclassified gene
   CG32006 from the fly Drosophila melanogaster belongs to FoxJ1. We also
   detect gene losses: FoxE and FoxM were lost already in the panarthropod
   ancestor, whereas the loss of FoxH occurred in the arthropod ancestor.
   Finally, we find an ortholog of FoxQ1 in the bark scorpion Centruroides
   sculpturatus, confirmed not only by phylogenetic analysis, but also by
   forming an evolutionarily conserved gene cluster with FoxF, FoxC, and
   FoxL1. This suggests that FoxQ1 belongs to the ancestral Fox gene
   complement in panarthropods and also in chelicerates, but has been lost
   at the base of the mandibulate arthropods.},

Abstract = {Cotton cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has been extensively studied;
   however, information regarding its molecular mechanisms has not yet been
   disclosed. Therefore, to explore the molecular mechanism of pollen
   abortion of cotton CMS line H276A, transcript profiles of 30
   mitochondrial protein-encoding genes at tetrad stage were conducted with
   northern blot and a differential expression gene cox3 was identified.
   Quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that
   the expression level of cox3 in the CMS line H276A was 0.39-fold
   compared to its maintainer line H276B. In addition, the immunoblot
   analysis revealed that the amount of COX3 protein was decreased to
   59.38\% in CMS line H276A. The 5` and 3` terminals of the transcript of
   cox3 in two materials were determined simultaneously with circularized
   RNA reverse-transcribed PCR (CR-RT-PCR). The data indicated that seven
   5` end of transcript of cox3 in H276A
   (-451/-464/-465/-467/-471/-472/-508 respect to ATG) were identified
   which were different from that of H276B (-411/-412). A total of 15
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was detected by clone sequencing
   analysis of upstream of cox3. To our knowledge, we are the first to
   comprehensively analyze the transcripts of the mitochondrial genome in
   the cotton CMS line and to identify the 5` and 3` terminals of the
   transcript of cox3 in cotton. Our data will provide a framework for a
   better understanding of molecular mechanisms of CMS and mitochondrial
   gene expression in cotton.},

Title = {Cold acclimation diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana: CRISPR/Cas9 as a

Abstract = {In this period of climate change, it is of major importance to increase
   knowledge about the mechanisms by whose plants adapt to their
   environment. Tandem gene arrays (TAG) are overrepresented in the pool of
   tandem duplicates involved in stress response and are consequently of
   special interest. Nevertheless, until recently, addressing questions
   about individual genes or fine regulations in such structures was very
   difficult due to the close arrangement of the genome, almost preventing
   the production of targeted simple or multiple mutants. The CRISPR/Cas9
   new tool offers new opportunities as the setting of gene deletion
   strategies in various genetic backgrounds. Here, we used this technology
   on the cold acclimation CBF pathway in different accessions of
   Arabidopsis thaliana with the same set of guide RNAs. Deleted lines free
   of T-DNA have been produced for simple or multiple copies of CBF genes
   and evaluated for cold tolerance after acclimation. Expression levels of
   CBF genes and five COR genes have also been analyzed. Our data suggest
   first that two or three missing CBF genes are necessary to induce a
   strong reduction in cold tolerance and secondly that most deletions have
   a low impact on the expression of remaining CBF copies which contradicts
   the previous hypothesis in the literature. Our results thus show that
   the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion strategy is a useful performance tool to
   investigate how tandem gene arrays work.},

Abstract = {Melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), which is expressed in the terminally
   differentiated sebaceous gland, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).
   MC5R exists mostly in mammals but is completely lost in whales; only the
   relic of MC5R can be detected in manatees, and phenotypically, they have
   lost sebaceous glands. Interestingly, whales and manatees are both
   aquatic mammals but have no immediate common ancestors. The loss of MC5R
   and sebaceous glands in whales and manatees is likely to be a result of
   convergent evolution. Here, we find that MC5R in whales and manatees are
   lost by two different mechanisms. Homologous recombination of MC5R in
   manatees and the insertion of reverse transcriptase in whales lead to
   the gene loss, respectively. On one hand, in manatees, there are two
   ``TTATC{''} sequences flanking MC5R, and homologous recombination of the
   segments between the two ``TTATC{''} sequences resulted in the partial
   loss of the sequence of MC5R. On the other hand, in whales, reverse
   transcriptase inserts between MC2R and RNMT on the chromosome led to the
   loss of MC5R. Based on these two different mechanisms for gene loss in
   whales and manatees, we finally concluded that MC5R loss might be the
   result of convergent evolution to the marine environment, and we
   explored the impact on biological function that is significant to
   environmental adaptation.},

Abstract = {The core molecular mechanisms of dorsal organizer formation during
   gastrulation are highly conserved within the chordate lineage. One of
   the key characteristics is that Nodal signaling is required for the
   organizer-specific gene expression. This feature appears to be
   ancestral, as evidenced by the presence in the most basally divergent
   chordate amphioxus. To provide a better understanding of the evolution
   of organizer-specific gene regulation in chordates, we analyzed the
   cis-regulatory sequence of amphioxus Chordin in the context of the
   vertebrate embryo. First, we generated stable zebrafish transgenic
   lines, and by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, characterized in
   detail the expression pattern of GFP driven by the cis-regulatory
   sequences of amphioxus Chordin. Next, we performed a 5'deletion analysis
   and identified an enhancer sufficient to drive the expression of the
   reporter gene into a chordate dorsal organizer. Finally, we found that
   the identified enhancer element strongly depends on Nodal signaling,
   which is consistent with the well-established role of this pathway in
   the regulation of the expression of dorsal organizer-specific genes
   across chordates. The enhancer identified in our study may represent a
   suitable simple system to study the interplay of the evolutionarily
   conserved regulatory mechanisms operating during early chordate
   development.},

Title = {Exploring the roles of FGF/MAPK and cVG1/GDF signalling on mesendoderm
   induction and convergent extension during chick primitive streak
   formation},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},

Abstract = {During primitive streak formation in the chick embryo, cells undergo
   mesendoderm specification and convergent extension at the same time and
   in the same cells. Previous work has implicated cVG1 (GDF3) as a key
   factor for induction of primitive streak identity and positioning the
   primitive streak, whereas FGF signalling was implicated in regulating
   cell intercalation via regulation of components of the WNT-planar cell
   polarity (PCP) pathway. FGF has also been reported to be able to induce
   a primitive streak (but lacking the most axial derivatives such as
   notochord/prechordal mesendoderm). These signals emanate from different
   cell populations in the embryo, so how do they interact to ensure that
   the same cells undergo both cell intercalation and acquire primitive
   streak identity? Here we begin to address this question by examining in
   more detail the ability of the two classes of signals in regulating the
   two developmental events. Using misexpression of inducers and/or
   exposure to inhibitors and in situ hybridisation, we study how these two
   signals regulate expression of Brachyury (TBXT) and PRICKLE1 as markers
   for the primitive streak and the PCP, respectively. We find that both
   signals can induce both properties, but while FGF seems to be required
   for induction of the streak by cVG1, it is not necessary for induction
   of PRICKLE1. The results are consistent with cVG1 being a common
   regulator for both primitive streak identity and the initiation of
   convergent extension that leads to streak elongation.},

Abstract = {The origin, diversification, and secondary loss of sexually dimorphic
   characters are common in animal evolution. In some cases, structurally
   and functionally similar traits have evolved independently in multiple
   lineages. Prominent examples of such traits include the male-specific
   grasping structures that develop on the front legs of many dipteran
   insects. In this report, we describe the evolution and development of
   one of these structures, the male-specific ``sex brush.{''} The sex
   brush is composed of densely packed, irregularly arranged modified
   bristles and is found in several distantly related lineages in the
   family Drosophilidae. Phylogenetic analysis using 250 genes from over
   200 species provides modest support for a single origin of the sex brush
   followed by many secondary losses; however, independent origins of the
   sex brush cannot be ruled out completely. We show that sex brushes
   develop in very similar ways in all brush-bearing lineages. The dense
   packing of brush hairs is explained by the specification of bristle
   precursor cells at a near-maximum density permitted by the lateral
   inhibition mechanism, as well as by the reduced size of the surrounding
   epithelial cells. In contrast to the female and the ancestral male
   condition, where bristles are arranged in stereotypical, precisely
   spaced rows, cell migration does not contribute appreciably to the
   formation of the sex brush. The complex phylogenetic history of the sex
   brush can make it a valuable model for investigating coevolution of
   sex-specific morphology and mating behavior.},

Abstract = {Aphids are hemimetabolous insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis
   without pupation. The annual life cycle of most aphids includes both an
   asexual (viviparous) and a sexual (oviparous) phase. Sexual reproduction
   only occurs once per year and is followed by many generations of asexual
   reproduction, during which aphids propagate exponentially with
   telescopic development. Here, we discuss the potential links between
   viviparous embryogenesis and derived developmental features in the pea
   aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, particularly focusing on germline
   specification and axis determination, both of which are key events of
   early development in insects. We also discuss potential evolutionary
   paths through which both viviparous and oviparous females might have
   come to utilize maternal germ plasm to drive germline specification.
   This developmental strategy, as defined by germline markers, has not
   been reported in other hemimetabolous insects. In viviparous females,
   furthermore, we discuss whether molecules that in other insects
   characterize germ plasm, like Vasa, also participate in posterior
   determination and how the anterior localization of the hunchback
   orthologue Ap-hb establishes the anterior-posterior axis. We propose
   that the linked chain of developing oocytes and embryos within each
   ovariole and the special morphology of early embryos might have driven
   the formation of evolutionary novelties in germline specification and
   axis determination in the viviparous aphids. Moreover, based upon the
   finding that the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is closely associated
   with germ cells throughout embryogenesis, we propose presumptive roles
   for B. aphidicola in aphid development, discussing how it might regulate
   germline migration in both reproductive modes of pea aphids. In summary,
   we expect that this review will shed light on viviparous as well as
   oviparous development in aphids.},

Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the arthropod model species Drosophila melanogaster, a dipteran fly,
   segmentation of the anterior-posterior body axis is under control of a
   hierarchic gene cascade. Segmental boundaries that form morphological
   grooves are established posteriorly within the segmental expression
   domain of the segment-polarity gene (SPG) engrailed (en). More important
   for the development of the fly, however, are the parasegmental
   boundaries that are established at the interface of en expressing cells
   and anteriorly adjacent wingless (wg) expressing cells. In Drosophila,
   both segmental and transient parasegmental grooves form. The latter are
   positioned anterior to the expression of en. Although the function of
   the SPGs in establishing and maintaining segmental and parasegmental
   boundaries is highly conserved among arthropods, parasegmental grooves
   have only been reported for Drosophila, and a spider (Cupiennius salei).
   Here, we present new data on en expression, and re-evaluate published
   data, from four distantly related spiders, including Cupiennius, and a
   distantly related chelicerate, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Gene
   expression analysis of en genes in these animals does not corroborate
   the presence of parasegmental grooves. Consequently, our data question
   the general presence of parasegmental grooves in arthropods.},

Abstract = {Johnston's organ has been shown to act as an antennal auditory organ
   across a spectrum of insect species. In the hemimetabolous desert locust
   Schistocerca gregaria, Johnston's organ must be functional on hatching
   and so develops in the pedicellar segment of the antenna during
   embryogenesis. Here, we employ the epithelial cell marker Lachesin to
   identify the pedicellar domain of the early embryonic antenna and then
   triple-label against Lachesin, the mitosis marker phosphohistone-3, and
   neuron-specific horseradish peroxidase to reveal the sense-organ
   precursors for Johnston's organ and their lineages. Beginning with a
   single progenitor at approximately a third of embryogenesis, additional
   precursors subsequently appear in both the ventral and dorsal pedicellar
   domains, each generating a lineage or clone. Lineage locations are
   remarkably conserved across preparations and ages, consistent with the
   epithelium possessing an underlying topographic coordinate system that
   determines the cellular organization of Johnston's organ. By
   mid-embryogenesis, twelve lineages are arranged circumferentially in the
   pedicel as in the adult structure. Each sense-organ precursor is
   associated with a smaller mitotically active cell from which the
   neuronal complement of each clone may derive. Neuron numbers within a
   clone increase in discrete steps with age and are invariant between
   clones and across preparations of a given age. At mid-embryogenesis,
   each clone comprises five cells consolidated into a tightly bound
   cartridge. A long scolopale extends apically from each cartridge to an
   insertion point in the epithelium, and bundled axons project basally
   toward the brain. Comparative data suggest mechanisms that might also
   regulate the developmental program of Johnston's organ in the locust.},

Volume = {232},
Number = {2-4},
Pages = {67-79},

Abstract = {Mechanical influencers have long been shown to affect mature bone. Bone
   mechanosensation is a key feature that allows the skeleton to adapt to
   environmental constraints. In this study, we describe the response of
   immature, developing bones to a mechanical stimulus. To do so, zebrafish
   larvae at different stages of development were exposed to whole-body
   vibration (WBV) at a low frequency of 20 Hz, for up to 4 days. Whole
   mount Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining revealed age-related and
   bone type-specific defects. Specifically, the parhypural and hypural 1
   caudal fin endoskeletal elements were affected when the exposure to WBV
   started early during their development. We show that these WBV-induced
   parhypural and hypural 1 patterning defects are triggered by a
   Sox9-independent pathway, potentially by reducing the distance
   separating adjacent chondrogenic condensations in the developing tail
   skeleton. The remaining hypurals were unaffected by the WBV treatment.
   Altogether, our results indicate that, upon exposure to vibration,
   chondrogenic cell progenitors can react to mechanical stimuli early
   during their development, which ultimately affects the skeletal
   patterning of the growing zebrafish larvae. These findings open a new
   research avenue to better understand the cellular processes involved in
   developing, patterning, and maintaining skeletal tissue.},

Abstract = {Spiders have emerged as one of the leading model organisms in many
   research fields due to their compelling biology. Often, scientific
   investigations involving the use of spiders face inevitable problems
   associated with the lack of specimens from laboratory stock, resulting
   in difficulties in yielding reproducible investigations for predictive
   research. Thus, several species of well-studied spiders, including
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum, have been successfully bred for such
   purposes. Crossopriza lyoni is a Haplogyne spider, globally distributed
   and widespread in human inhabitants, prompting interest in various
   studies over the last decades. Despite its scientific importance, no
   laboratory-bred C. lyoni has been documented. Therefore, we describe a

Abstract = {In this study, we focused on the effects of microclimatic, climatic, and
   anthropogenic factors on culturable microfungal communities in the soil
   of the north-facing slope (NFS) and the south-facing slope (SFS) at the
   Metzar ``Evolution Canyon{''} in the Golan Heights, Israel. Using the
   soil dilution plate method, 94 species from 47 genera were isolated. The
   communities' composition was subjected to pronounced interslope
   variations in both summer and winter. Whereas xerotolerant
   melanin-containing species and thermotolerant Aspergillus spp.
   pre-dominated in the SFS soil, peaking in the summer, mesophilic
   Penicillium spp. were especially abundant in the NFS soil. The
   quantitative parameter-density of microfungal isolates-exhibited the
   strongest seasonal varia-tions, showing that it was the most sensitive
   to the fluctuation in soil temperature and moisture. Comparison of
   microfungal communities in the currently recovered and previously
   disturbed SFS soil showed that intensive pasturage followed by soil
   degradation led to the simplification of communities, decreased their
   diversity level, and resulted in the prevalence of species with
   different ecological preferences. Comparison of the native NFS
   communities isolated in the summers of 2002 and 2019 revealed changes in
   the community structure, which could be related to global warming. These
   changes were associated with stress-tolerant fungal traits, which may be
   useful under increasing soil temperature and desiccation.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal patterns of earthworm abundance suggest time-limited
   food availability for a subalpine bird species},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Changes in food availability may act as a major mechanism by which
   global change impacts populations of birds, especially in seasonal
   environments at high elevations or latitudes. Systematic sampling of
   invertebrates, which constitute the diet of many bird species during the
   breeding season, is however largely missing in mountain ecosystems and
   is overall very rare for soil-dwelling species or stages. Here, we
   repeatedly sampled earthworms (Lumbricidae), the staple prey of the Ring
   Ouzel Turdus torquatus, over a whole breeding season in a study area in
   the Swiss Alps. Our main goal was to finely characterise spatio-temporal
   patterns of food availability for this declining bird species, in
   relation to elevation, habitat type and snowmelt stage. In 24 sampling
   plots, we extracted two soil cores every week for 6-10 weeks and
   hand-sorted soil invertebrates separately for two 5-cm soil layers. We
   then analysed the abundance of earthworms in those two layers in
   relation to various environmental parameters. We show that within our
   study area, edaphic and topographical parameters are poor predictors of
   the mean abundance of earthworms over the breeding season. Ground
   vegetation cover and soil moisture, however, are suitable predictors for
   the number of earthworms within the soil profile at each sampling time,
   i.e., of their availability for Ring Ouzels. Moreover, we provide
   evidence for a clear seasonal peak in earthworm availability, which was
   more pronounced in open grasslands compared to forested areas and
   happened later in the season where snow lingered. This study, by
   improving our understanding of the factors driving food availability for
   a mountain bird species, provides insights into how shifts in land-use
   and climate might lead to altered predator-prey interactions.},

Title = {Rehabilitation promotes rapid recovery of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   in iron mining areas},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform important ecological
   functions in the rehabilitation of degraded areas, acting through
   several mechanisms, such as the production of glomalin-related soil
   proteins (glomalin), which act as cementing agents and nutritional
   reserves and sequester carbon in soil. The aim of the present study was
   to determine whether a short rehabilitation time influenced the soil AMF
   community diversity and glomalin production in areas undergoing
   rehabilitation after iron mining. We analyzed the number of spores,
   mycorrhizal colonization, AMF species richness, and concentrations of
   easily extractable and total glomalin-related soil proteins. Species
   richness was reduced by approximately 50 \% after mining activity.
   However, after the initial rehabilitation of degraded areas, we observed
   an increase in the number of spores, colonization, and AMF species.
   Families Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae were considered dominant in the
   studied areas. Glomus sp.1 and Acaulospora mellea were the most frequent
   morphotypes. The relationship between glomalin and the levels of
   dissolved organic carbon, total carbon, and total nitrogen in the soil
   was found to be an interesting and easily interpretable parameter of the
   influence of AMF on the storage of organic matter in the soil,
   indicating the degree of equilibrium and/or recovery of revegetated
   environments. Rehabilitation, even in early stages, favored
   im-provements in AMF status and provided increases in total
   glomalin-related soil protein production, which may have contributed to
   the enrichment of carbon and nitrogen in the soil. These characteristics
   are indicative of the success of the rehabilitation actions carried out
   in these areas after mining activity.},

Title = {A standardized and miniaturized method to investigate rhizosphere
   microorganisms, with a focus on methanogenic archaea and methanotrophic
   bacteria},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Plant-microorganism interactions and associations play a fundamental
   role in terrestrial ecosystems and mainly occur in the rhizosphere, an
   interaction zone around plant roots. However, the definitions and
   handling strategies described in the literature differ considerably, and
   the aim of the present work was to develop a standardized and
   miniaturized experimental setup that enables a simple and comparable
   investigation of the rhizosphere. After methodological optimization
   steps, we applied and evaluated our method to examine the effects of
   plants and increased methane (CH4) concentrations on the abundance and
   activity of rhizosphere microorganisms engaged in the CH4-cycle.
   Seedlings of black radish (Raphanus sativus) and yellow mustard (Sinapis
   alba) were grown in soil-filled reaction tubes, and the growth
   conditions were adapted for optimal plant root development. Since plant
   roots pervaded the entire volume of the soil, we could assume the entire
   soil to be influenced by the plants and regarded it as rhizosphere soil.
   Additionally, the application of plant growth chambers allowed to
   investigate plant and microbial growth at defined headspace
   compositions. The results demonstrate that bulk and rhizosphere soil
   differed significantly regarding the dissolved carbon and nitrogen
   contents. The abundances of cultivable microorganisms (CFU) and of
   methanotrophic bacteria (type Ia) were significantly increased in
   rhizosphere soil. Growth under increased CH4 concentration in the
   headspace revealed an increased abundance of methanotrophic and
   methanogenic microorganisms in the rhizosphere. A higher capacity to
   oxidize CH4 in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soil was demonstrated,
   extending the effect of the influence of plants on microbial activity
   and confirming the suitability of this approach to study
   plant-soil-microbe interactions. Since the headspace composition in the
   plant growth chambers can easily be adjusted, the current setup is also
   suitable for investigating further gas cycles and the microorganisms
   involved.},

Title = {Changes in urban soil yeast communities after a reduction in household
   waste during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The soils of streets, urban parks and suburban areas were examined for
   yeasts in the summer of 2020 on the territory of the southern cities of
   Russia and the Republic of Crimea: Krasnodar, Maykop, Sochi and
   Simferopol. The results of this study are compared with the results of a
   previous study carried out in these cities in 2019. This study was
   conducted three months after the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
   which led to a sustained decline in household waste deposition in these
   areas. The number of tourists visiting these southern cities decreased
   significantly, and the number of walkers and visitors to urban parks
   fell sharply. In 2020, after the decline of household waste loads, the
   yeast abundance was slightly but reliably higher than in 2019. A total
   of 30 yeast species were observed -11 ascomycetes and 19 basidiomycetes.
   This was more than in 2019 and was caused by twice as many autochthonous
   basidiomycetous yeast species (natural core community), which were found
   in urban soils only after the reduction in household waste in the
   environment -Apiotrichum dulcitum, A. laibachii, Saitozyma podzolica
   Solicoccozyma terricola. And at the same time, the proportion of
   clinically sig-nificant (opportunistic) yeasts, Candida sake and
   Meyerozyma guilliermondii, was much lower in 2020 than in 2019. Thus,
   the observed changes in yeast communities in urban soils could be a
   short-time response of the microbial community to a reduction in
   household waste.},

Title = {Responses of edaphic factors and microbial community to terrestrial
   succession and experimental warming in coastal salt marshes},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To date, how the combined effects of terrestrial succession and climate
   warming will affect the edaphic factors and microbial community of
   coastal salt marshes remains unclear. To address this question, we
   compared the growth traits (i.e., morphology and biomass), edaphic
   properties, microbial community and function of Phragmites australis and
   Imperata cylindrica communities under natural vegetation succession
   (i.e., shift from P. australis to I. cylindrica) with or without warming
   treatment of I. cylindrica over two growing seasons (2019-2020). The
   results showed that after terrestrial succession, soil water content
   (SWC), electrical conductivity, clay content, total organic carbon and
   total nitrogen decreased significantly, while soil pH and contents of
   nitrate (NO3--N) and ammonium (NH4+-N) increased. The microbial
   community structure was greatly altered by terrestrial succession. The
   combination of terrestrial succession and experimental warming
   reinforced the change trends of SWC and pH but caused NO3--N and NH4+-N
   to decline to levels as low as those before succession. Although little
   response in microbial community structure was detected, the relative
   abundances of some dominant microorganisms and functional groups
   involved in C and N cycling were altered under the combination
   treatment. These variations in dominant microorganisms and predicted
   functional groups were related to changes in SWC, pH and particle size
   fractions and further influenced soil aeration and C/N availability. We
   concluded that in coastal salt marshes, experimental warming could
   further alter soil edaphic factors after terrestrial succession with
   little effect on microbial community structure. The changes in microbial
   community composition and function had a close correlation with edaphic
   factors. Our results suggested that adaptive soil management practices
   (i.e., inoculation of important microorganisms) should be considered to
   mitigate the soil degradation of coastal salt marshes with terrestrial
   succession under predicted climate warming.},

Abstract = {Exotic plantations and urbanization are serious threats to biodiversity.
   This study compared community structures of terrestrial isopods among
   urban habitat, grass, exotic bamboo forest and broad-leaved forest. A
   total of 9553 terrestrial isopod specimens from 11 native and 5 exotic
   species were collected from 102 sites. Nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling (NMDS) and non-hierarchical clustering showed that the community
   structure in exotic bamboo forest was similar to that in broad-leaved
   forest, and the communities were characterized by four native and one
   exotic species. However, the abundance in exotic bamboo forest was the
   lowest among the four habitats. The urban habitat was dominated by
   exotic species, and the species richness was the highest out of the four
   habitats. The results showed that exotic bamboo forest maintained an
   isopod community similar to that in broadleaved forest, and that
   urbanization encouraged invasion of exotic species and increased species
   richness at a local scale.},

Title = {Communities of Collembola show functional resilience in a long-term
   field experiment simulating climate change},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil ecosystems, and the fauna they host, are known to provide many
   services and communities of Collembola can be used as bioindicators of
   soil functionality. Climate change is often expected to threaten
   Collembola, however, it is possible that it could also favour them.
   Previous studies have shown that the structure of collembolan
   communities can be shaped by long-term adaptation to climate, and that
   temperature plays a major role in the variation of species traits. In
   this study, we evaluated how the functional composition and structure of
   collembolan communities are impacted by climate change using an
   experimental climate manipulation design. The study used data from the
   CLIMAITE experiment, which was carried out in Denmark in an unmanaged
   heath/grassland ecosystem that was subjected to the simulated predicted
   climate for the year 2075. The climate manipulation experiment
   parameters included elevated temperature, elevated concentration of
   atmospheric CO2 and extended drought, which were tested alone and in
   combination on a total of 48 plots, including controls. Collembola were
   sampled using 10-cm-depth soil cores after 1, 2 and 8 years of climate
   manipulation. We posited (i) that a stimulating factor (elevated CO2)
   would increase mean body length, and (ii) that an inhibiting factor
   (drought) would favour traits indicating a euedaphic life or an ability
   to present resistance mechanisms (scales, ecomorphosis) and would reduce
   functional structure indices through environmental filtering. The
   results did not support these hypotheses. While the findings showed
   sporadic effects of the climatic treatments on the functional
   composition and structure, they did not demonstrate any general
   community response pattern. This may be due to limitations of the study
   in terms of climatic intensity or community assembly, opening
   perspectives for future experiments in terms of the choice of traits and
   measurements.},

Title = {Abundance, isolation, and characterization of halotolerant microbes from
   common oligosaline soils},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Halotolerant microbes that grow at high NaCl concentrations were studied
   in common soils with low salinity. The abundance of microbes in common
   oligosaline (< 1.0\% salinity) soils was measured by most probable
   number analyses, where statistically valid replicates of serial
   dilutions were assessed for growth in liquid Salt Plains medium with
   0.1, 10, or 20\% (w/v) NaCl. Common Kansas soils were collected from
   oligosaline agri-cultural fields (corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybean),
   pond margin, prairie grassland, and woodland. The abundance of microbes
   able to grow at 10\% NaCl was 0.0025-0.32\% of the total counts at 0.1\%
   NaCl. Only marginal growth was observed at 20\% NaCl, about 100-fold
   lower than at 10\% NaCl. Bacterial isolates were collected from 20\%
   NaCl enrichments of oligosaline turf soil by repetitive streak-plating.
   The bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
   characterized. The isolates clustered with low G+C Gram-positive genera
   (Bacillus, Halobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Virgibacillus). Broad
   halotolerances (0.1-20\% NaCl) were observed for most isolates, but all
   grew at low salt. Soils were boiled to kill vegetative cells and
   compared by most probable number analyses with unboiled specimens. The
   abundance of microbes able to grow at 10\% NaCl showed a 3-log decrease
   with boiling, while microbes able to grow at 0.1\% NaCl showed a 5-log
   decrease in abundance with boiling. It appears that halotolerant
   microbes in oligosaline soils are cultivable vegetative cells, not
   perennating structures such as spores. Discrete salt phases are not
   obvious in oligosaline soils, but could provide a selective advantage to
   autochthonous halotolerant microbes. Allochthonous microbes associated
   with salt evaporite particles may be transported by winds, thereby
   dispersing deliquescent hypersaline microhabitats.},

Title = {Forest type and pH affecting the occurrence and life status of land
   snails in South American temperate forest},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The genus Plectostylus (Stylommatophora: Bothriembryontidae) is found in
   temperate and Mediterranean eco-systems in central Chile, which are
   highly fragmented landscapes and vulnerable to human perturbations.
   However, it is unknown what habitat or environmental variables influence
   their occurrence and life status. This study analyzed how different
   habitat and environmental predictors influence the occurrence and life
   status (alive vs. dead) of Plectostylus chilensis species in central
   Chile. The snails (or shells) were sampled in different frag-ments (n =
   50). In each fragment, land snails were searched in different
   microhabitats (e.g., leaf litter or trunks) with different environmental
   conditions (shady, sunny, humid, dry). At the landscape level,
   temperature, pre-cipitation, and pH at two levels were incorporated into
   the analysis. Predictors and responses were analyzed with logistic
   regression models. Land snail abundance was also analyzed with path
   analysis. The native forest type (open sclerophyllous scrub) was the
   only variable that influenced the occurrence of land snails. The life
   status of P. chilensis was also influenced by forest pH at depths of 0-5
   cm, with open sclerophyllous forests, and average top layer pH of 6.1
   exhibited higher probabilities of finding alive individuals. The
   Non-Metrical Multidimen-sional Scaling associated the land snail
   abundance with the microsite conditions and the dominant tree species.
   However, path analysis has not shown significant effects. The smaller
   privately-owned native forest fragments are key for the occurrence and
   life status of P. chilensis, although the absence of high-quality
   microhabitats at any forest patch size could limit their
   abundance/presence of land snails in time. Facing the ecological and
   climatic crisis that Chile will experience in the coming decades, the
   resilience of Chile's terrestrial mollusks will depend on the potential
   measures of management to protect the remaining native forest patches.},

Title = {Mesofauna community influences litter chemical trajectories during
   early-stage litter decay},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decomposition of organic material is moderated by both litter chemistry
   and decomposer communities. Chemical alteration of the litter occurs
   throughout decomposition, yet our understanding of the nature of
   chemical change during decomposition is limited, particularly beyond
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The decomposer food web likely interacts
   with these chemical changes in their basal resource to alter the
   trajectories of chemical changes during decay. To investigate how
   decomposer mesofauna influence patterns of litter chemical change
   throughout early stages of decay, we tracked mass loss, macro-and
   micronutrient elements, and fiber chemistry dynamics in Arizona sycamore
   (Platanus wrightii) leaves decomposed in a mesocosm of optimal decay
   conditions in a bio-tically diverse compost pile. By using litterbags of
   two different mesh sizes to manipulate the mesofauna gaining access to
   the litter, we identify how the complexity of the soil mesofauna
   community changes the trajectory of litter chemistry, beyond the typical
   focus on mass loss and N dynamics. Counter to many examples in the
   literature, the more abundant and complex arthropod community slowed
   mass loss and enhanced nutrient immobilization, perhaps due to
   competition and grazing pressure on the microbial community to
   immobilize N, P, and Ca sooner from the surrounding compost.},

Title = {Functional significance of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes
   (Formicidae) in coffee plantations: An enemy or an ally?},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Leaf-cutter ants are appreciated as ecosystem engineers. Conversely,
   under agricultural scenarios, they are considered serious pests. Coffee
   is one of the crops selectively foraged by this species either under
   traditional shading or unshaded intensified systems. Despite the
   economic importance of coffee in Neotropical regions, there are few
   observational field studies on the impact of leaf-cutter ants on coffee
   plantation soils and how impact may differ in response to shade
   management. Three hypotheses were tested in coffee plantations in
   presence of Atta cephalotes: (1) bioturbation activity by leaf-cutter
   ants depends on the soil properties, which in turn, are affected by
   agronomic management of the coffee plantations; (2) a relatively higher
   concentration of resources (i. e., coffee plants) results in greater
   leaf-cutter ant activity in unshaded plantations than in shaded
   plantations; and (3) the effect of ant defoliation on fruit production
   depends on the level of foliar damage. Ten active ant nests were
   selected from each management system in ten farm plots. Soil samples
   were collected from nests and from outside the nests (control),
   physical, chemical and biological properties were analysed, and
   leaf-cutter ant herbivory was also assessed. No significant differences
   in microbial activity, evaluated through respiration, were found between
   nest and control soils. Nest soils had higher and lower percentages of
   sand and silt, respectively, than the control soils. Nest soils
   contained significantly higher amounts of sulphur, regardless of shade
   management. A. cephalotes translocated mineral soils and improved water
   infiltration in nest soils. The herbivory index and proportion of damage
   were greater in unshaded coffee, although fruit production tended to
   increase, possibly due to a compensatory effect as coffee plants
   responded to low levels of foliar damage. Therefore, the first
   hypothesis was only partially supported since bioturbation depended on
   soil properties, and certain soil properties were affected by coffee
   management, while the second and third hypotheses were supported by the
   data, suggesting that leaf-cutter ants differentially affect coffee
   plantations based on their shade management and on the moment the coffee
   plants are affected. Our results form the basis for the development of
   future studies that evaluate production impacts and economic damage in
   coffee varieties by leaf-cutter ants. Depending on the ecological
   context of the agroecosystem and management practices used, leaf-cutter
   ants can have positive or negative impacts for coffee production.},

Title = {Do local-scale context dependencies shape how ectomycorrhizal fungal
   diversity structures with reduced or sustained experimental N addition?},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution visibly and rapidly changes forest
   systems, for example impacting the diversity of forest ectomycorrhizal
   (EcM) fungi. EcM fungi are measurable by components that vary in
   longevity, hence, reflecting different temporal scales of presence: EcM
   root-tips are viable for, at most, a couple growing seasons, compared to
   fungal structures that may persist in soil as DNA for decades or longer.
   In-growth mesh bags, in contrast, typically capture a single growing
   season of hyphal growth. The different components might portray
   different diversity responses by EcM fungi to large-scale N pollution,
   as well as any subsequent reductions from improved environmental
   standards. Within an established oak forest study system, we examined
   the impact of sustained and recently reduced experimental N addition on
   EcM fungal diversity and composition, measured in three main fungal
   components (root-free soil, root-tips, and mesh bag hyphae). We
   hypothesized that elevated soil N would reduce EcM fungal diversity, and
   that composition would change, but with differences among fungal
   components related to the temporal longevity of the components. Our
   expectations were largely met, in that richness primarily declined with
   increased soil N, and all trends were most pronounced with the soil EcM
   fungi (the only component potentially reflective of long-term fungal
   presence). We discovered that abatement of the experimental N treatment
   did not revert fungal trends to those of the same-site plots with
   ambient N treatment. Instead, the stochastic nature of local-scale
   disturbances, related to invasive earthworms and forest stand dynamics,
   likely impacted N levels and, thus, EcM fungal trends. Due to the
   context-dependency of localized disturbance(s), assessing the effects of
   reduced large-scale N deposition on EcM fungi can prove to be
   challenging.},

Title = {Effect of reclamation of abandoned salinized farmland on nematode in
   arid northwest China},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil salinization is a serious problem worldwide and has resulted in
   large areas of abandoned land in Northwest China. In order to ensure the
   stability of cultivated land and food security, abandoned salinized
   farmland was reclaimed. However, the response of the nematode community
   to the reclamation remains unclear. In order to assess the response of
   the nematode community to reclamation and examine the relationships
   between soil properties and nematodes, we identified nematodes to the
   genus levels and determined their trophic groups from four reclamation
   treatments: natural succession (CK), cropland (CL), grassland (GL), and
   woodland (WL). The results showed that the artificial reclamation
   treatments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total
   nitrogen (TN), while significantly decreased electrical conductivity
   (EC) in compared with that of CK. Compared with CK, CL and GL
   significantly increased significantly in the total nematode abundance.
   However, CL had the lowest Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H'), generic
   richness (GR) and trophic diversity (TD) among four treatments. Compared
   with CK, nematode food webs of GL and WL were more mature. SOC and DOC
   were the main factors driving nematode community variation. The analysis
   of nematode community structure provided important indicators of changes
   in soil food webs during the reclamation of salinized farmland.},

Title = {Fast improvement of macrofauna communities and soil quality in plantain
   crops converted to agroecological practices},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Plantain (Musa paradisiaca AAB) is one of the main staple food crops in
   tropical areas, particularly in the Caribbean region. Therefore,
   supporting a sustainable production of plantain in this zone is crucial
   to secure food and to provide income to millions of people. We
   hypothesized that agroecological practices based on multi -functionality
   and biodiversity and that preserve soil should i) increase macrofauna
   abundance, ii) enhance soil chemical fertility, iii) improve soil
   physical structure, iv) reduce plant infestation by parasitic nematodes,
   and v) immediately achieve similar yield as in conventional systems. For
   this purpose, we compared plantain conventional and agroecological
   systems at the farm scale. The agroecological system consisted in a
   combination of three innovations: i) inputs of vermicompost to replace
   mineral fertilizers, ii) use of healthy planting material and iii) use
   of a mulching of living crop to control weeds. Ten months after the
   plantation, soil macrofauna abundance had doubled and taxonomic richness
   had increased by 45\% in the agroecological system. In addition, soil
   structure was improved in the agroecological system (52\% of biogenic
   aggregates in the agroecological system vs. 21 \% in conventional
   systems), as well as the abundance of free-living nematodes associated
   to plantain roots increased by 73 \% in the agroecological system. The
   abundance of Radopholus similis, one of main plant parasitic nematodes,
   decreased in the agroecological system. Moreover, the agroecological
   system achieved similar crop yield level than conventional systems.
   Agroecological practices are thus an efficient option to allow a fast
   transition from conventional to environmentally friendly cropping
   systems.},

Title = {Crop residues in corn-wheat rotation in a semi-arid region increase CO2
   efflux under conventional tillage but not in a no-tillage system},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Appropriate management of crop residue plays a key role in mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions. However, it has been inadequately implemented
   in general agricultural management practices. In a field investigation
   using static chambers, we evaluated the effects of crop residue at three
   different rates -100 \% (R100), 50 \% (R50), and residue removal (R0)
   -on carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux. The field study was conducted in
   corn-wheat rotation under conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems
   in a semi-arid region. The main results showed that CO2 efflux was
   positively correlated with higher soil temperature (0.43-0.79) and
   microbial biomass carbon (0.66-0.89). The crop residue treatments
   affected these traits. A strong positive relationship between CO2 efflux
   and the crop residue (R-2 = 0.96, CT and R-2 = 0.9 for NT) was observed.
   In the CT system, significant increases were detected among residue
   rates on cumulative CO2 efflux, where R100 and R50 resulted in 36 \% and
   25 \% higher cumulative CO2 efflux, respectively, than R0. In contrast,
   there was no significant difference in cumulative CO2 efflux among the
   crop residue retention (R100 and R50) and removal (R0) treatments under
   the NT system. Our study revealed that crop residue retention led to
   increased CO2 efflux under the CT system in semi-arid conditions during
   the first year of application, while under the NT system, CO2 efflux was
   not impacted by crop residue. Our results indicate that there is
   considerable potential for improving soil management practices in the
   context of soil degradation, climate change, increasing crop
   productivity, and carbon (C) sequestration.},

Title = {Invasive earthworms Amynthas tokioensis and Amynthas agrestis alter
   macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K, P) in field and laboratory forest soils},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pheretimoid earthworms of the family Megascolecidae are invading
   deciduous forests across the northern and northeastern United States
   with unknown consequences on soil and nutrient dynamics. This study
   investigated plant macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and P) at partially
   invaded forest sites in Madison, WI, USA, and in forest soil incubated
   with Amynthas agrestis or Amynthas tokioensis. Exchangeable,
   organic-bound, and/or inorganic Ca, Mg, K, and P concentrations and
   pools were typically greater inside than outside the invasion front.
   Exchangeable K and organic K were significantly increased by Amynthas
   earthworms. These changes in nutrient status were associated with an
   increased pH and greater soil organic matter (SOM), suggesting litter
   decomposition by Amynthas was likely responsible for nutrient additions.
   Under laboratory soil incubations, increases in Ca, Mg, K, and P
   occurred for A. tokioensis but this was less consistent for A. agrestis.
   Soil incubations also demonstrated that A. tokioensis stabilized more
   nutrients and SOM than A. agrestis despite being fed one-third less oak
   litter. Thus, while Amynthas earthworms alter forest soils due to
   differences in feeding, digestion, and mineralization among species,
   whether these differences facilitate co-invasion or bring about
   long-term changes in ecosystem soil pools remains unclear.},

Title = {Cover crop selection affects maize susceptibility to the fungal pathogen
   Fusarium verticillioides},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, we show the impact of cover crop legacy in soil towards
   susceptibility of next generation maize to the fungal pathogen Fusarium
   verticillioides. The use of different plant species as cover crops in
   organic cropping systems has been shown to provide several ecosystem
   services. The direct benefits of using leguminous cover crops such as
   pea or mycorrhizal species such as cereal rye or oats for soil fertility
   and cash crop yield are well known. However, the impacts of different
   cover crop species on subsequent cash crop pest suppression is rarely
   accounted for in agricultural management. Legacy of cover crop species
   are of importance considering recent findings that plants promoting
   arbuscular mycorrhizal communities, such as cereal rye and oats as cover
   crops, can provide increased benefits to successive maize crops against
   insect pests. In this study, we test whether such benefits might also
   include resistance against pathogens. We examined progression of rot
   lesions in ear, stalk and seedling blight by Fusarium verticillioides in
   maize plants that were grown in soil with a cover crop monoculture
   history of either winter pea, triticale or radish. This study shows for
   the first time that soil legacy of mycorrhizal monocot triticale as a
   cover crop renders maize plants more susceptible to ear rot and seedling
   blight by Fusarium verticillioides as compared to a soil legacy of
   radish. This suggests that although soil legacy of radish may be
   detrimental to management of insects, it is effective in suppressing
   progression of Fusarium verticillioides in maize. This work demonstrates
   the significance of cover crop selection to manage fungal pathogens such
   as Fusarium verticillioides, it further suggests trade-offs in plant
   resistance to various pests' taxa at the cover crop species level.},

Title = {Response of soil biodiversity to global change},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil systems are highly biodiverse and responsible for important
   ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and carbon
   storage. Aspects of global change, including CO2 enrichment, climate
   change, land use alteration, and shifts in aboveground biodiversity all
   have the potential to affect soil biodiversity, as well as the
   ecosystem-level processes that they regulate. While there is a growing
   body of scientific literature recognising and addressing community and
   ecosystem response to multiple, interacting elements of global change,
   soil biodiversity and soil systems are still relatively underrepresented
   in this literature. Yet, at the same time, soils play a major role in
   global carbon budgets, and therefore hold the key to understanding
   future climate scenarios. This special issue highlighted the current
   knowledge of how soil biodiversity responds to pertinent global change
   factors, and the ecosystem-level consequences of those changes. We
   received empirical and theoretical studies on land use change, nitrogen
   deposition, warming, elevated CO2 atmospheric concentration as well as
   drought and flood. Based on the contributions included, we discuss
   responses of global change in different soil taxonomic groups, and
   identify next steps.},

Title = {Reasons to move far away: studying the drivers of Carpetania matritensis
   (Hormogastridae: Crassiclitelatta) dispersal behaviour},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dispersal is a crucial process for animal populations as it allows the
   colonisation of new habitats and the maintenance of genetic diversity.
   However, it has not been studied enough for soil fauna, which is the
   basis for a wide variety of ecosystem services. Therefore, the study of
   their dispersal and the factors that trigger this behaviour is a
   relevant area of knowledge for the maintenance of the services they
   provide. For this work, Carpetania matritensis, an endogeic earthworm
   species endemic to the central Iberian Peninsula, has been used as a
   model to study the effect of habitat quality and conspecific density on
   dispersal and exploratory behaviour. The experiment was carried out in
   horizontal mesocosms divided into three sectors of the same dimensions:
   an inoculation section (left), a crossing section (centre) and a target
   sector (right). Those sectors were occupied by soil, a favourable
   habitat for earthworms, or sand, which represents an unsuitable habitat
   for earthworms and a physical barrier for their displacement. Earthworms
   were inoculated at two different densities (2 and 6 in-dividuals per
   mesocosm; 848.86 and 2546.58 individuals/m3 respectively) and at two
   experimental durations (4 and 8 days) for each of the three different
   experimental treatments (unsuitable-unsuitable-suitable (U-U-S),
   suitable-unsuitable-suitable (S-U-S) and suitable-suitable-suitable
   (S-S-S), depending on the habitat type filling the inoculation, crossing
   and target section respectively). The results showed a large effect of
   treatment on the dispersal rate, being higher when earthworms were
   inoculated in an adverse environment, establishing habitat quality as a
   driver of the species' dispersal behaviour. No significant effects of
   conspecific density, experimental duration or its interactions were
   found. Further studies are needed to clarify the species dispersal
   behaviour with a view to its conservation.},

Title = {Topography is more important than forest type as a determinant for
   functional trait composition of Collembola community},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The relative importance of topography and vegetation in shaping local
   soil invertebrate communities is poorly understood. We investigated
   changes in the species and trait compositions of Collembola communities
   associated with different topography and forest types. Our study sites
   encompassed various topographies with different slope aspects and forest
   types; specifically, natural deciduous broad-leaved forests and
   deciduous coniferous plantations in Japan. The body length and edaphic
   adaptation score, which are representative of a certain life -form, were
   used as Collembola traits. Across a topographic gradient from south to
   north-facing slopes, the total biomass of Collembola was higher in dry
   plots than in humid plots, and the forest types did not affect either
   abundance, biomass, or species diversity. Variation partitioning
   analysis revealed that topography played an important role in
   determining species composition and functional traits, whereas forest
   types and spatial distance had minor roles. The responses of community
   weighted mean traits (CWMs) to environmental change were more pronounced
   than those of species composition. The CWM and functional diversity of
   body length were higher in the dry plots than in the humid plots. These
   changes in traits might be explained by food supply or habitat structure
   increasing large individuals via topography, rather than by physical
   stress filtering out intolerant small individuals. These results suggest
   that slope topography is an important determinant of the Collembola
   com-munity structure in cool-temperate forest ecosystems.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the effect on litter decomposition of the
   geographical and land-use gradient from the dry Cerrado in Mato Grosso
   to the southern Amazonian rainforest in Par ` a, Brazil. The study area
   also rep-resents a gradient of land-use intensification, reaching from
   the southern Cerrado region which had the most active land use change
   and agricultural intensification in the past to the northern rainforest
   region where agricultural use is currently intensifying. We assessed the
   effects on litter decomposition of climate (seasonality: rainy vs dry),
   litter quality (litter type: standard maize litter vs local habitat
   litter), disturbance (land-use: forest vs pasture vs cropland), soil
   organisms (soil fauna: inclusion vs exclusion), and original land
   cover/vegetation gradient (region: savanna vs transitional zone vs rain
   forest). Our results showed that the contribution of the different soil
   organism groups (mesh size) to litter decomposition was strongly
   influenced by the change in land -use, but also by the original
   land-cover/vegetation of the region. The overall effect of climate
   seasonality on decomposition was particularly pronounced at higher
   latitudes, whereas at lower latitudes only minimal effects were found.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The links between vegetation and soil biota are responsible for a
   variety of ecosystem processes and services that can be affected by
   grazing. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of grazing
   frequency in natural grasslands' biodiversity (plant and collembola
   communities) and on ecosystem processes (decomposition and biomass
   accumulation). For so, we carried out a clipping experiment over a
   natural area of subtropical grassland in southern Brazil. The plots were
   submitted during three years to three different clipping frequencies
   (high, intermediate, and low) to simulate defoliation caused by grazing.
   We found the highest aboveground biomass accumulation and detritivore
   activity in the low defoliation frequency, which also promoted the
   dominance of tussocks. The synergies between higher vegetation height
   and biomass tend to provide microclimatic conditions that favors
   decomposition, which releases nutrients to plants, promoting their
   growth. The defoliation frequencies applied in this study were not
   sufficient to provide effects on plant community, since its
   co-evolutionary history with grazing. The Collembola community was not
   affected by defoliation. It seems to be more influenced by other factors
   associated with grazing.},

   in tropical forests than in non-tropical natural terrestrial ecosystems:
   A meta-analysis},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In phosphorus (P)-poor tropical forests, soil microorganisms are
   hypothesized to depend on organic P sources more intensively than in
   other natural terrestrial ecosystems. I tested this hypothesis by
   conducting a metaanalysis to compare soil phosphatase activity responses
   to experimental P fertilization between tropical forests and other
   natural terrestrial ecosystems. I found that P fertilization
   significantly reduced soil phosphatase activity in tropical forests, and
   to a significantly greater extent than in non-tropical natural
   terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, supporting the above
   hypothesis. I suggest three potential mechanisms for this result. First,
   inorganic P supply may be lower in tropical forests; however, this
   mechanism is less likely because inorganic P input into tropical forests
   soils via biological processes is not necessarily small. Second, the
   strong P adsorption capacity of tropical soils may substantially reduce
   inorganic P availability, thereby enhancing microbial organic P
   dependence. Third, higher P demand due to higher biological productivity
   in tropical forests may intensify microbial organic P dependence.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Digging mammals displace a large amount of soil, thereby strongly
   altering soil ecosystem processes such as nitrogen cycling through
   bioturbation. Although it is well known that bears displace a large
   amount of soil by digging for food and denning, there is negligible
   empirical evidence of the effects on soil properties. In the Shiretoko
   World Heritage site, we investigated the effects of brown bear digging
   for cicada nymphs on soil properties, such as soil water content,
   organic and inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and nitrogen
   mineralization rate that are important components of soil ecosystem
   function and are essential for plant growth. We compared the properties
   of soil recently dug by brown bears with undisturbed soil in larch
   plantations. We found that brown bear digging decreased soil water
   content, organic matter, inorganic nitrogen concentration, net
   mineralization rates. Our results suggest that soil digging by brown
   bear may reduce plant growth by decreasing soil nutrient availability,
   thereby diminishing the net primary production of the larch plantation
   at the study site.},

Title = {Acquisition of nitrogen from tannin protein complexes in ectomycorrhizal
   pine seedlings},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal and ericoid fungi are increasingly recognized for their
   capacity to break down soil organic matter and getting access to organic
   nitrogen (N). In many forest ecosystems proteins complexed by
   plantproduced tannins constitute a substantial amount of organic N. Yet,
   it is currently unknown to what extent these N sources are accessible to
   ectomycorrhizae and their associated plants. In a pot experiment, we
   provided ectomycorrhizal pine (Pinus pinea) seedlings with exactly the
   same amount of N either in mineral form, as protein, or as two different
   tannin-protein complexes, formed with commercially available tannins or
   tannins isolated from pine leaf litter. Over a period of 18 months, pine
   seedlings grew at least two times bigger in all Ntreatments. However,
   growth and N acquisition were roughly two and three times larger,
   respectively, with mineral N or protein supply compared to
   tannin-protein complexes as the sole N source (no difference between the
   two different complexes). With tannin-protein complexes, pine seedlings
   allocated relatively more biomass into fine roots. In addition, the
   decrease in tissue N concentration in the tannin-protein complex
   treatments was lower in fine roots (30\%) than in needles (53\%). Our
   results showed that tannins strongly influence N nutrition in
   ectomycorrhizal pine seedlings. Tannin-protein complexes are an
   accessible N source for ectomycorrhizal pine seedlings although they
   grew better with easier accessible N. The respective contributions of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi and other free or root-associated microorganisms
   in the breakdown of tannin protein complexes recquires further
   exploration. Tannin-protein complexes may be an important N source in
   ecosystems where organic nitrogen dominates, but the respective
   contributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi and other free or root-associated
   microorganisms in the breakdown of tannin protein complexes recquires
   further exploration.},

Title = {Nematode contributions to the soil food web trophic structure of two
   contrasting boreal peatlands in Canada},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Free-living soil nematodes span several trophic levels and play a key
   role in soil food webs. As such, the relative abundances and diversity
   of nematode feeding groups, along with nematode body size that is
   correlated with trophic transfer efficiency may provide useful
   information in understanding carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil
   systems. Yet, despite their role in soil carbon dynamics, there is a
   lack of knowledge regarding nematode trophic diversity in high carbon
   storage systems such as boreal peatlands. Here we assessed nematode
   communities using feeding groups (bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores,
   omnivores, and predators) based on mouthpart morphology, and their body
   sizes (length and mass) in two contrasting boreal peatlands in Northern
   Ontario, Canada that differ in vegetation (Sphagnum vs Carex),
   hydrology, nutrient availability, and microbial decomposition. We found
   that nematode trophic diversity was higher in the Sphagnum-dominated
   fen, and that the dominant nematode group corresponded to the dominant
   microbial group at each site. Predatory nematodes were significantly
   more abundant and larger in the Sphagnum-dominated fen, consistent with
   greater food web complexity, but the average body size of nematodes (all
   feeding groups included) was not significantly different between the
   fens. Taken together, these observed trends in nematode feeding groups
   and body sizes, along with higher microbial biomass in the
   Sphagnum-dominated fen supports the idea that the two sites may differ
   ecologically, and generally follow differences in microbial communities.
   Our study provides important baseline information for understanding
   peatland soil food web dynamics and their implications for carbon and
   nutrient dynamics.},

Title = {Nematode grazing increases the allocation of plant-derived carbon to
   soil bacteria and saprophytic fungi, and activates bacterial species of
   the rhizosphere},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Microbially driven soil processes are crucial for ecosystem functions
   such as soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling. The functioning of the
   microbial community, in turn, largely depends on plant-derived carbon
   inputs. However, besides the energy supply by plants, the microbial
   community also underlies a top-down control by higher trophic levels,
   which has often not been considered when investigating soil microbial
   processes. Here we investigated the impact of bacterivore and
   fungivore-grazing nematodes on the net assimilation of carbon into the
   bacterial and fungal biomass in a microcosm experiment. We manipulated
   bacterivorous or fungivorous nematodes to obtain different grazing
   densities. In combination with a (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling we traced
   the carbon flow from plants into the soil microbial community using PLFA
   biomarkers. Furthermore, we investigated if nematode grazing,
   independent of the carbon flow, shifted the active bacterial community
   using (H2O)-O-18 DNA stable isotope probing. We found that the microbial
   biomass was unaffected by nematode grazers. However, bacterivore
   nematodes stimulated the incorporation of the C-13 label directly into
   biomarkers of bacteria groups and indirectly into biomarkers of
   saprophytic fungi. The nematode grazing furthermore enhanced the
   activity of bacterial taxa typically for the rhizosphere microbiome that
   utilize mainly root deposits, while bacterial groups that degrade
   already stored soil organic matter were inhibited. We conclude that
   grazing of higher trophic levels impacts soil processes and likely the
   entire soil biota via two mechanisms: firstly, through the constant
   grazing on soil microorganisms and their constant regrowth, the
   allocation of plant-derived carbon that enters the soil food web
   increases; and secondly, it preferentially activates bacteria of the
   rhizosphere micmbiome that putatively contribute to soil organic matter
   storage.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Earthworms and their casts act as biocatalysts and regulators of the
   biotic and abiotic processes in soil ecosys-tems. However, the relative
   importance of the presence of earthworms and earthworm casts in
   affecting other soil biota remains underexplored. In this study, we
   conducted a manipulative mesocosm experiment in a 30-year -old
   subtropical broadleaved plantation forest to determine how epi-endogeic
   earthworms (Amynthas corticis) and their casts affect soil nematode
   communities individually and additively. We found that the addition of
   the epi-endogeic earthworms significantly increased the proportion of
   the Ba1 guild nematodes and enhanced the enrichment index of the soil
   nematode community, but decreased the channel index. These results
   indicate that the soils become enriched in nutrients with a higher
   activity in bacterial-based decomposition pathways in the presence of
   earthworms. However, cast addition alone had a minor effect on soil
   nematodes. Results of a redundancy analysis suggest that elevated
   contents of soil ammonium and available phosphorous were the major
   influencing factors on soil nematode abundances in the presence of
   epi-endogeic earthworms. Our results indicate that epi-endogeic
   earthworms rather than through their casts contributed to the
   structuring of the nematode communities and enhancing of the
   bacterial-based energy channel. This finding contributes to our
   understanding of soil biodiversity maintenance mechanisms and how the
   relationship of the soil biota affects their functions in soil food
   webs.},

Title = {Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil
   attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in
   the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density,
   and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to
   intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity,
   and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers,
   are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The
   slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in
   Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other
   regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its
   potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with
   soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in
   the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often
   used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by
   land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates
   the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch
   system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density,
   and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical
   and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and
   secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil
   fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity
   and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional
   groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with
   slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change.
   Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth
   forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil
   invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their
   conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show
   the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance
   the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil
   quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of
   soil functionality and agriculture productivity.},

Title = {Revegetation of mined areas influences the physiological profile of
   bacterial communities and improves the biochemical functions of soil},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mining activities have expanded worldwide to meet industrial demands and
   technological development. However, these activities have a negative
   impact on the environment that must be addressed. Thus, this study aimed
   to monitor the effects of the revegetation process on microbial proxies
   in an iron mine-degraded landscape using the biomass, activity, and
   metabolic capacity of the soil microbial community. We analysed an area
   that was recently mined and nonrevegetated (NR), areas that were mined
   and were under active revegetation (for 2 yrs and 3 yrs) and an unmined
   area covered with native vegetation (RA) in the mining province of
   Corumb ` a, Brazil. The results showed that there was an average gain of
   44.6\% and 48.15\% in microbial biomass carbon in the 2 yr and 3 yr
   revegetated areas, respectively, compared to the NR area. We observed
   that after 3 yrs of revegetation, microbial biomass nitrogen increased
   by 86\% compared to that in the nonrevegetated area. The enzymatic
   activity of phosphatase, fluorescence diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), and
   urease also increased as a function of revegetation time compared to the
   NR area. Phosphatase increased by 90\% in the 3 yr revegetated area, FDA
   increased by 53\% in the 2 yr revegetated area and 68\% in the 3 yr
   revegetated area, and urease increased by 52\% and 66\% in the 2 yr and
   3 yr revegetated areas, respectively, when compared to the NR area. The
   metabolic capacity of microorganism communities to degrade carbon
   sources returned rapidly, indicating an improvement in soil functioning
   in short time periods. Soil microbial proxies showed a high sensitivity
   to soil alterations in response to revegetation activities, highlighting
   their role as potential indicators in the rehabilitation process of
   mining-degraded landscapes.},

   Phylogenetic and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Month = {2022 DEC 8},
Abstract = {A fossil Mycetophilidae from the Aptian Crato Formation-Cretomanota
   gondwanica gen. nov., sp. nov.-is described, which is the first
   mycetophilid from the Crato Formation and corresponds to the oldest
   known fossil leiine and only the second Gondwanan fossil mycetophilid
   described so far. Cretomanota gondwanica and both species of Alavamanota
   Blagoderov and Arillo were added as terminals to the data matrix of a
   general phylogenetic analysis of the Mycetophilidae, and both fit into
   the Leiinae. Alavamanota is monophyletic, sister to the clade composed
   by Cretomanota and the extant genus Manota Williston. The biology of the
   extant members of this fungivorous family corroborates the
   reconstruction of the Crato palaeoenvironment as including woodlands
   with humid habitats and microhabitats. The presence of a Cretaceous
   member of the tribe Manotini at low latitudes in South America
   reinforces the hypothesis that the clade with all manotines except
   Leiella Edwards corresponds to a Lower Cretaceous offshoot from a group
   in southern Gondwana expanding its distribution to more northern areas
   into the Gondwana and into Laurasia.},

Title = {Unraveling the evolutionary history of the snakefly family Inocelliidae

Volume = {38},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Inocelliidae is one of the two extant families of the holometabolan
   order Raphidioptera (snakeflies), with the modern fauna represented by
   seven genera and 44 species. The evolutionary history of the family is
   little-known. Here we present the first phylogenetic and biogeographical
   analyses based on a worldwide sampling of taxa and datasets combined
   with morphological characters and mitochondrial genomes, aiming to
   investigate the intergeneric phylogeny and historical biogeography of
   Inocelliidae. The phylogenetic inference from the combined analysis of
   morphological and molecular data recovered the sister-group relationship
   between a clade of (Negha + Indianoinocellia) + Sininocellia and a clade
   of Fibla + the Inocellia clade (interiorly nested by Amurinocellia and
   Parainocellia). Amurinocellia stat.r. and Parainocellia stat.r. et
   emend.n. are relegated to subgeneric status within Inocellia, whereas a
   newly erected subgenus of Inocellia, Epinocellia subgen.n., accommodates
   the former Parainocellia burmana (U. Aspock and H. Aspock, 1968) plus a
   new species Inocellia (Epinocellia) weii sp.n. Further, the Inocellia
   crassicornis group constitutes the nominotypical subgenus Inocellia
   stat.n., but the Inocellia fulvostigmata group is paraphyletic.
   Diversification within Inocelliidae is distinguished by an Eocene
   divergence leading to extant genera and a Miocene radiation of species.
   A biogeographical scenario depicts how the diverse inocelliid fauna from
   East Asia could have originated from western North America via dispersal
   across the Beringia during the early Tertiary, and how the Miocene
   ancestors of Inocellia could have accomplished long-distance dispersals
   via the Tibet-Himalayan corridor or eastern Palaearctic to western
   Palaearctic. Our results shed new light specifically on the evolution of
   Inocelliidae and, in general, the Raphidioptera.},

Abstract = {The Cenozoic Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of the
   Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau (HTP) are among the most important geological
   events in the world. They have affected the diversification of regional
   biota of many taxonomic groups on and around the HTP. However, the exact
   timing and model of the collision and uplift events and speciation on
   and around the HTP are still in debate. The Himalayas group of Scytodes
   spitting spiders (Araneae: Scytodidae) are distributed at high
   elevations of the HTP and northern Indochina. Here, we reconstruct a
   dated molecular phylogeny for pan-Himalayan Scytodes spiders, including
   the Himalayas group, with full geographical sampling of the species from
   the HTP and Indochina. We test a hypothesis to explain that the rich
   montane biodiversity of the region is uplift-driven diversification-that
   orogeny drives rapid in situ speciation of the resident Scytodes
   lineages. Our findings revealed that the separation of the Himalayas
   clade from the Myanmar clade took place during the middle Oligocene,
   reflecting the final collision of India with Eurasia. The deep
   divergences among three clades (the Himalayas, the Myanmar and the
   Indochina clades) occurred from the middle Eocene to the middle
   Oligocene, corresponding to two early uplift events of the HTP. The
   evolutionary split between the Himalayas + Myanmar and Indochina clades
   were simultaneous with the rapid lateral extrusion of Indochina by the
   initial Himalayan uplift around the Eocene. This study highlights the
   importance of the diversification of dispersal-limited, high-elevation
   invertebrates as independent lines of evidence to reflect key tectonic
   events in the Himalayan-Indochina region, supporting the stepwise model
   for the Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of HTP.},

Abstract = {The northern temperate genus Dracocephalum consists of approximately 70
   species mainly distributed in the steppe-desert biomes of Central and
   West Asia and the alpine region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).
   Previous work has shown that Dracocephalum is not monophyletic and might
   include Hyssopus and Lallemantia. This study attempts to clarify the
   phylogenetic relationships, diversification patterns, and the
   biogeographical history of the three genera (defined as Dracocephalum
   s.l.). Based on a sampling of 66 taxa comprising more than 80\% from
   extant species of Dracocephalum s.l., morphological, phylogenetic
   (maximum parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference based on nuclear
   ITS and ETS, plastid rpl32-trnL, trnL-trnF, ycf1, and ycf1-rps15, and
   two low-copy nuclear markers AT3G09060 and AT1G09680), molecular dating,
   diversification, and ancestral range estimation analyses were carried
   out. Our results demonstrate that both Hyssopus and Lallemantia are
   embedded within Dracocephalum and nine well-supported clades can be
   recognized within Dracocephalum s.l. Analyses of divergence times
   suggest that the genus experienced an early rapid radiation during the
   middle to late Miocene with major lineages diversifying within a
   relatively narrow timescale. Ancestral area reconstruction analyses
   indicate that Dracocephalum s.l. originated in Central and West Asia and
   southern Siberia, and dispersed from Central and West Asia into the QTP
   and adjacent areas twice independently during the Pliocene. The
   aridification of the Asian interior possibly promoted the rapid
   radiation of Dracocephalum within this region, and the uplift of the QTP
   appears to have triggered the dispersal and recent rapid diversification
   of the genus in the QTP and adjacent regions. Combining molecular
   phylogenetic and morphological evidence, a revised infrageneric
   classification of Dracocephalum s.l. is proposed, which recognizes nine
   sections within the genus.},

Title = {Somewhere I belong: phylogeny and morphological evolution in a
   species-rich lineage of ectoparasitic flatworms infecting cichlid fishes},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 30},
Abstract = {A substantial portion of biodiversity has evolved through adaptive
   radiation. However, the effects of explosive speciation on species
   interactions remain poorly understood. Metazoan parasites infecting
   radiating host lineages could improve our knowledge because of their
   intimate host relationships. Yet limited molecular, phenotypic and
   ecological data discourage multivariate analyses of evolutionary
   patterns and encourage the use of discrete characters. Here, we assemble
   new molecular, morphological and host range data widely inferred from a
   species-rich lineage of parasites (Cichlidogyrus, Platyhelminthes:
   Monogenea) infecting cichlid fishes to address data scarcity. We infer a
   multimarker (28S/18S rDNA, ITS1, COI mtDNA) phylogeny of 58 of 137
   species and characterize major lineages through synapomorphies inferred
   from mapping morphological characters. We predict the phylogenetic
   position of species without DNA data through shared character states, a
   morphological phylogenetic analysis, and a classification analysis with
   support vector machines. Based on these predictions and a cluster
   analysis, we assess the systematic informativeness of continuous
   characters, search for continuous equivalents for discrete characters,
   and suggest new characters for morphological traits not analysed to
   date. We also model the attachment/reproductive organ and host range
   evolution using the data for 136 of 137 described species and
   multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). We show that
   discrete characters not only can mask phylogenetic signals, but also are
   key for characterizing species groups. Regarding the attachment organ
   morphology, a divergent evolutionary regime for at least one lineage was
   detected and a limited morphological variation indicates host and
   environmental parameters affecting its evolution. However, moderate
   success in predicting phylogenetic positions, and a low systematic
   informativeness and high multicollinearity of morphological characters
   call for a revaluation of characters included in species
   characterizations.},

Abstract = {More than 95\% of phytophagous true bug (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) species
   belong to four superfamilies: Miroidea (Cimicomorpha), Pentatomoidea,
   Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea (all Pentatomomorpha). These iconic groups of
   highly diverse, overwhelmingly phytophagous insects include several
   economically prominent agricultural and silvicultural pest species,
   though their evolutionary history has not yet been well resolved. In
   particular, superfamily- and family-level phylogenetic relationships of
   these four lineages have remained controversial, and the divergence
   times of some crucial nodes for phytophagous true bugs have hitherto
   been little known, which hampers a better understanding of the
   evolutionary processes and patterns of phytophagous insects. In the
   present study, we used 150 species and concatenated nuclear and
   mitochondrial protein-coding genes and rRNA genes to infer the
   phylogenetic relationships within the Terheteroptera (Cimicomorpha +
   Pentatomomorpha) and estimated their divergence times. Our results
   support the monophyly of Cimicomorpha, Pentatomomorpha, Miroidea,
   Pentatomoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea. The
   phylogenetic relationships across phytophagous lineages are largely
   congruent at deep nodes across the analyses based on different datasets
   and tree-reconstructing methods with just a few exceptions. Estimated
   divergence times and ancestral state reconstructions for feeding habit
   indicate that phytophagous true bugs explosively radiated in the Early
   Cretaceous-shortly after the angiosperm radiation-with the subsequent
   diversification of the most speciose clades (Mirinae, Pentatomidae,
   Coreinae, and Rhyparochromidae) in the Late Cretaceous.},

Title = {New insights into the phylogeny of the complex thalloid liverworts

Abstract = {Marchantiopsida (complex thalloid liverworts) are one of the earliest
   lineages of embryophytes (land plants), and well-known for their air
   pores and chambers, pegged rhizoids, and absence of organellular RNA
   editing sites. Despite their importance to an understanding of early
   embryophyte evolution, many key nodes within this class remain poorly
   resolved, owing to the paucity of genetic loci previously available for
   phylogenetic analyses. Here, we sequenced 54 plastomes, representing 28
   genera, nearly all families, and all orders of Marchantiopsida. Based on
   these plastomes, we present a hypothesis of deep relationships within
   the class, and make the first investigations of gene contents and
   synteny. Overall, the Marchantiopsida plastomes were well-conserved,
   with the exception of the genus Cyathodium that has plastomes with
   higher GC content, fewer single sequence repeats (SSRs), and more
   structural variations, implying that this genus might possess RNA
   editing sites. Abundant repetitive elements and six highly divergent
   regions were identified as suitable for future infrafamilial taxonomic
   studies. The phylogenetic topology of Sphaerocarpales, Neohodgsoniales
   and Blasiales within Marchantiopsida was essentially congruent with
   previous studies but generally we obtained higher support values. Based
   on molecular evidence and previous morphological studies, we include
   Lunulariales in Marchantiales and suggest the retention of narrowed
   delimitation of monotypic families. The phylogenetic relationships
   within Marchantiales were better resolved, and 13 monophyletic families
   were recovered. Our analyses confirmed that the loss of intron 2 of ycf3
   is a synapomorphy of Marchantiidae. Finally, we propose a new genus,
   Asterellopsis (Aytoniaceae), and present an updated classification of
   Marchantiopsida. The highly supported phylogenetic backbone provided
   here establishes a framework for future comparative and evolutionary
   studies of the complex thalloid liverworts.},

   Acanthocorona and Lophocorona form a monophyletic group. It is likely

Title = {Distribution patterns of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the
   Americas: an analysis based on networks and endemicity},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are a group of
   approximately 150 species of hematophagous reduviids, some of which are
   vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas
   disease. Distributional patterns of triatomines have been studied based
   on macroecological and historical biogeographic approaches, but the
   definition of distributional patterns and areas of endemism are yet to
   be defined based on objective criteria. We used two methods to identify
   biogeographic units in the Triatominae: the endemicity analysis based on
   an optimality criterion (NDM/VNDM software) and a network approach aimed
   to simplify and highlight the underlying structure in species
   distributions (Infomap Bioregions). Information on species distributions
   was obtained from a data paper, comprising 21 815 records for 135
   triatomine species occurring in the Americas. The resulting areas of
   each method were clustered using a meta consensus criterion based on
   dissimilarities and interpreted as recurrent areas. The NDM areas show a
   nested structure, presenting greater restrictions to the inclusion of
   species in a given area, requiring broad sympatry. In contrast,
   bioregions emphasize spatial patterns with better-delimited areas and
   species occurrences do not need to be highly congruent. When areas were
   clustered based on their species composition two clear patterns arose
   from both methods: (i) areas within the southern Amazon and southeast
   South America, especially in the Chacoan subregion, formed a cluster,
   and (ii) areas north of the Amazon, Pacific, Mesoamerica, Mexican
   transition zone and Nearctic formed another cluster. Moreover, within
   each of these two clusters, there was a latitudinal gradient of the
   areas in the Americas showing spatial similarity between the areas found
   in both methods. Results of both methods show well-bound areas
   separating the triatomine fauna in the Brazilian subregions, resulting
   in the recognition of areas corresponding to the biomes Chaco, Pampa,
   Cerrado, and Caatinga, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic Forest. (c)

Title = {When phylogenetics met biogeography: Willi Hennig, Lars Brundin and the
   roots of phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Willi Hennig's (Beitr. Ent. 1960, 10, 15) Die Dipteren-Fauna von
   Neuseeland als systematisches und tiergeographisches Problem applied a
   phylogenetic approach to examine the distributional patterns exhibited
   by the Diptera of New Zealand. Hennig showed how phylogenetic trees may
   be used to infer dispersal, based on the progression and deviation
   rules, and also discussed the existence of vicariance patterns. The most
   important author who applied Hennig's phylogenetic biogeography was Lars
   Brundin, when analysing the phylogenetic relationships of two taxa of
   Chironomidae (Diptera) and using them to examine the biogeographic
   relationships of Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.
   The relevance of Brundin's contribution was noted by several authors, as
   it began the cladistic or vicariance approach to biogeography, that
   implies the discovery of vicariance events shared by different
   monophyletic groups. Both phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography have a
   place in contemporary biogeography, the former for analysing taxon
   biogeography and the latter when addressing Earth or biota biogeography.
   The recent use of the term ``phylogenetic biogeography{''} to refer to a
   posteriori methods of cladistic biogeography is erroneous and should be
   avoided.},

Title = {Highly diversified mitochondrial genomes provide new evidence for
   interordinal relationships in the Arachnida},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {452-464},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Arachnida is an exceptionally diverse class in the Arthropoda,
   consisting of 20 orders and playing crucial roles in the terrestrial
   ecosystems. However, their interordinal relationships have been debated
   for over a century. Rearranged or highly rearranged mitochondrial
   genomes (mitogenomes) were consistently found in this class, but their
   various extent in different lineages and efficiency for resolving
   arachnid phylogenies are unclear. Here, we reconstructed phylogenetic
   trees using mitogenome sequences of 290 arachnid species to decipher
   interordinal relationships as well as diversification through time. Our
   results recovered monophyly of ten orders (i.e. Amblypygi, Araneae,
   Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones, Ricinulei,
   Sarcoptiformes, Scorpiones and Solifugae), while rejecting monophyly of
   the Trombidiformes due to the unstable position of the Eriophyoidea. The
   monophyly of Acari (subclass) was rejected, possibly due to the
   long-branch attraction of the Pseudoscorpiones. The monophyly of
   Arachnida was further rejected because the Xiphosura nested within
   arachnid orders with unstable positions. Mitogenomes that are highly
   rearranged in mites but less rearranged or conserved in the remaining
   lineages point to their exceptional diversification in mite orders;
   however, shared derived mitochondrial (mt) gene clusters were found
   within superfamilies rather than interorders, confusing phylogenetic
   signals in arachnid interordinal relationships. Molecular dating results
   show that arachnid orders have ancient origins, ranging from the
   Ordovician to the Carboniferous, yet have significantly diversified
   since the Cretaceous in orders Araneae, Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes,
   and Trombidiformes. By summarizing previously resolved key positions of
   some orders, we propose a plausible arachnid tree of life. Our results
   underline a more precise framework for interordinal phylogeny in the
   Arachnida and provide new insights into their ancient evolution.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny of the tropical wandering spiders (Araneae,
   Ctenidae) and the evolution of eye conformation in the RTA clade},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Tropical wandering spiders (Ctenidae) are a diverse group of cursorial
   predators with its greatest species richness in the tropics.
   Traditionally, Ctenidae are diagnosed based on the presence of eight
   eyes arranged in three rows (a 2-4-2 pattern). We present a molecular
   phylogeny of Ctenidae, including for the first time representatives of
   all of its subfamilies. The molecular phylogeny was inferred using five
   nuclear (histone H3, 28S, 18S, Actin and ITS-2) and four mitochondrial
   (NADH, COI, 12S and 16S) markers. The final matrix includes 259
   terminals, 103 of which belong to Ctenidae and represent 28 of the
   current 49 described genera. We estimated divergence times by including
   fossils as calibration points and biogeographic events, and used the
   phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to reconstruct the evolution of the eye
   conformation in the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade. Ctenidae
   and its main lineages originated during the Paleocene-Eocene and have
   diversified in the tropics since then. However, in some analyses
   Ctenidae was recovered as polyphyletic as the genus Ancylometes Bertkau,
   1880 was placed as sister to Oxyopidae. Except for Acantheinae, in which
   the type genus Acantheis Thorell, 1891 is placed inside Cteninae, the
   four recognized subfamilies of Ctenidae are monophyletic in most
   analyses. The ancestral reconstruction of the ocular conformation in the
   retrolateral tibial apophysis clade suggests that the ocular pattern of
   Ctenidae has evolved convergently seven times and that it has originated
   from ocular conformations of two rows of four eyes (4-4) and the ocular
   pattern of lycosids (4-2-2). We also synonymize the monotypic genus
   Parabatinga Polotov \& Brescovit, 2009 with Centroctenus Mello-Leitao,
   1929. We discuss some of the putative morphological synapomorphies of
   the main ctenid lineages within the phylogenetic framework offered by
   the molecular phylogenetic results of the study.},

Abstract = {Sesiids are a diverse group of predominantly diurnal moths, many of
   which are Batesian mimics of Hymenoptera. However, their diversity and
   relationships are poorly understood. A multi-gene phylogenetic analysis
   of 48 North American sesiid species confirmed the traditional taxonomic
   tribal ranks, demonstrated the paraphyly of Carmenta and Synanthedon
   with respect to several other genera and ultimately provided minimal
   phylogenetic resolution within and between North American and European
   groups. Character support from each gene suggested inconsistency between
   the phylogenetic signal of the CAD gene and that of the other four
   genes. However, removal of CAD from subsequent phylogenetic analyses did
   not substantially change the initial phylogenetic results or return
   Carmenta and Synanthedon as reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting that
   it was not impacting the overall phylogenetic signal. The lack of
   resolution using genes that are typically informative at the species
   level for other lepidopterans suggests a surprisingly rapid radiation of
   species in Carmenta/Synanthedon. This group also exhibits a wide range
   of mimicry strategies and hostplant usage, which could be fertile ground
   for future study.},

Abstract = {A species complex is an assemblage of closely related species with
   blurred boundaries, and from which species could arise from different
   speciation processes and/or a speciation continuum. Such a complex can
   provide an opportunity to investigate evolutionary mechanisms acting on
   speciation. The Chrysanthemum zawadskii species complex in China, a
   monophyletic group of Chrysanthemum, consists of seven species with
   considerable morphological variation, diverse habitats and different
   distribution patterns. Here, we used Hyb-Seq data to construct a
   well-resolved phylogeny of the C. zawadskii complex. Then, we performed
   comparative analyses of variation patterns in morphology, ecology and
   distribution to investigate the roles of geography and ecology in this
   complex's diversification. Lastly, we implemented divergence time
   estimation, species distribution modelling and ancestral area
   reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of this complex. We
   concluded that the C. zawadskii complex originated in the Qinling-Daba
   mountains during the early Pliocene and then spread west and northward
   along the mountain ranges to northern China. During this process,
   geographical and ecological factors imposing different influences
   resulted in the current diversification and distribution patterns of
   this species complex, which is composed of both well-diverged species
   and diverging lineages on the path of speciation.},

Abstract = {We examined the impact of successive alignment quality-control steps on
   downstream phylogenomic analyses. We applied a recently published
   phylogenomics pipeline that was developed for the Angiosperms353
   target-sequence-capture probe set to the flowering plant order
   Celastrales. Our final dataset consists of 158 species, including at
   least one exemplar from all 109 currently recognized Celastrales genera.
   We performed nine quality-control steps and compared the inferred
   resolution, branch support, and topological congruence of the inferred
   gene and species trees with those generated after each of the first six
   steps. We describe and justify each of our quality-control steps,
   including manual masking, in detail so that they may be readily applied
   to other lineages. We found that highly supported clades could generally
   be relied upon even if stringent orthology and alignment quality-control
   measures had not been applied. But separate instances were identified,
   for both concatenation and coalescence, wherein a clade was highly
   supported before manual masking but then subsequently contradicted.
   These results are generally reassuring for broad-scale analyses that use
   phylogenomics pipelines, but also indicate that we cannot rely
   exclusively on these analyses to conclude how challenging phylogenetic
   problems are best resolved.},

Title = {Combined phylogenetic analysis of Pleurodema (Anura: Leptodactylidae:
   Leiuperinae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-319},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Pleurodema comprises 15 species distributed through the
   Neotropical region, from sea level up to 5000 m.a.s.l. A total-evidence
   analysis of Pleurodema is provided based on the parsimony criterion. The
   combined dataset included morphometric, phenotypic, and DNA evidence (34
   taxa, 4441 characters). The parsimony analysis yielded one
   most-parsimonious tree. Pleurodema was recovered as a well-supported
   clade composed of two major subclades. One subclade has an identical
   topology to that of previous analyses, the P. brachyops Clade (P. alium,
   P. borellii, P. brachyops, P. cinereum, P. diplolister, and P.
   tucumanum). The other subclade includes the remaining nine species of
   the genus, exhibiting a topology different from that of previous
   studies. According to the present phylogeny, this second lineage is
   formed by the P. nebulosum Clade (P. guayapae + P. nebulosum), P.
   marmoratum, the re-defined P. thaul Clade (P. bufoninum, P.
   somuncurense, P. thaul) and the P. bibroni Clade (P. bibroni, P.
   cordobae, P. kriegi). The reproductive modes of Pleurodema represent a
   unique combination of features within Leiuperinae, including three
   egg-clutch structures, two types of amplexus, and lack of vocalization.
   Also, some species of Pleurodema have been considered fossorial, because
   they are capable of digging with their hind-limbs and remaining in
   self-made burrows during dry seasons. The evolution of characters
   associated with reproductive biology and fossoriality is discussed in
   light of the obtained results.},

Title = {Evolution of cephalic structures in extreme myrmecophiles: a lesson from
   Clavigeritae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {335-358},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pselaphinae is a large subfamily, comprising over 10 000 species of the
   megadiverse Staphylinidae (rove beetles). A remarkable feature of this
   group is the extreme structural diversity of different body regions,
   especially the head and its appendages. Within Pselaphinae, Clavigeritae
   stand out as a clade of highly specialized myrmecophiles. We examined
   internal and external head structures of the clavigerite species
   Diartiger kubotai Nomura, using state-of-the-art techniques. The
   cephalic morphology indicates in a phylogenetic context that the loss of
   eyes in some Clavigeritae was the latest of major evolutionary changes.
   We compiled the largest set of morphological data ever scored for the
   subfamily, comprising 155 characters of the head. Parsimony analyses and
   Bayesian inference yielded a similar phylogenetic pattern, largely
   congruent with results published previously. We retrieved Pselaphinae as
   a clade, and Faronitae as sister to all remaining groups of the
   subfamily. Faronitae are followed by a ``Euplectitae grade{''} and
   non-monophyletic Goniaceritae, Batrisitae and Pselaphitae. Clavigeritae
   are monophyletic, but have evolved within the pselaphite grade. The
   enigmatic Colilodion Besuchet, recently shifted from Clavigeritae to a
   paraphyletic Pselaphitae, was placed as sister to extant clavigerites
   based on an array of cephalic synapomorphies. The current classification
   of Pselaphinae is unstable and deep changes should be made maintaining
   only monophyletic units, whereas most of the supertribes are
   paraphyletic. Characters of the head, with a concentration of mouthparts
   and sensory structures, and essential parts of the digestive tract and
   the nervous system, are highly informative phylogenetically. Study of
   internal structures, presently still at a very preliminary stage,
   obviously is essential for understanding the evolution of Pselaphinae.
   Future genetic investigations may reveal mechanisms behind the unique
   structural megadiversity in this exceptional group of rove beetles.},

Title = {Phylogeny and biogeography of the ancient spider family Filistatidae
   (Araneae) is consistent both with long-distance dispersal and vicariance
   following continental drift},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Filistatids, the crevice weavers, are an ancient family of cribellate
   spiders without extant close relatives. As one of the first lineages of
   araneomorph spiders, they present a complicated mixture of primitive and
   derived characters that make them a key taxon to elucidate the phylogeny
   of spiders, as well as the evolution of phenotypic characters in this
   group. Their moderate diversity (187 species in 19 genera) is
   distributed mainly in arid and semi-arid subtropical zones of all
   continents, except Antarctica. The objective of this paper is to
   generate a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for this family to
   advance the understanding of its morphological evolution and
   biogeography, as well as lay the basis for a natural classification
   scheme. By studying the morphology using optical and electronic
   microscopy techniques, we produced a matrix of 302 morphological
   characters coded for a sample of 103 species of filistatids chosen to
   represent the phylogenetic diversity of the family. In addition, we
   included sequences of four molecular markers (COI, 16S, H3 and 28S; 3787
   aligned positions) of 70 filistatid species. The analysis of the data
   (morphological, molecular, and combined) consistently indicates the
   separation of the Filistatidae into two subfamilies, Prithinae and
   Filistatinae, in addition to supporting several groups of genera:
   Filistata, Zaitunia and an undescribed genus from Madagascar; Sahastata
   and Kukulcania; all Prithinae except Filistatinella and Microfilistata;
   Antilloides and Filistatoides; a large Old World group including Pritha,
   Tricalamus, Afrofilistata, Labahitha, Yardiella, Wandella and putative
   new genera; and a South American group formed by Lihuelistata, Pikelinia
   and Misionella. Pholcoides is transferred to Filistatinae and
   Microfilistata is transferred to Prithinae, and each represents the
   sister group to the remaining genera of its own subfamily. Most genera
   are valid, although Pikelinia is paraphyletic with respect to
   Misionella, so we consider the two genera as synonyms and propose a few
   new generic combinations. Considering the new phylogenetic hypothesis,
   we discuss the evolution of some morphological character systems and the
   biogeography of the family. The ages of divergence between clades were
   estimated using a total-evidence tip-dating approach by including
   fossils of Filistatidae and early spider clades; this approach resulted
   in younger age estimates than those obtained with traditional
   node-dating. Filistatidae is an ancient family that started diversifying
   in the Mesozoic and most genera date to the Cretaceous. Clades
   displaying transcontinental distributions were most likely affected by
   continental drift, but at least one clade shows unequivocal signs of
   transoceanic long-distance dispersal.},

Abstract = {Extinct organisms provide crucial information about the origin and time
   of origination of extant groups. The importance of morphological
   phylogenetics for rigorously dating the tree of life is now widely
   recognized and has been revitalized by methodological developments such
   as the application of tip-dating Bayesian approaches. Traditionally,
   molecular clocks have been node calibrated. However, node calibrations
   are often unsatisfactory because they do not allow the fossil age to
   inform about phylogenetic hypothesis. The introduction of tip
   calibrations allow fossil species to be included alongside their living
   relatives, and the absence of molecular sequence data for these taxa to
   be remedied by supplementing the sequence alignments for living taxa
   with phenotype character matrices for both living and fossil taxa.
   Therefore, only phylogenetic analyses that take into account
   morphological characters can incorporate both fossil and extant species.
   Herein we present an unprecedented morphological dataset for a vast
   group of glirid rodents, to which different phylogenetic methodologies
   have been applied. We have compared the tree topologies resulting from
   traditional parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches and calculate
   stratigraphic congruence indices for each. Bayesian tip-dated clock
   methods seem to outperform parsimony with our dataset. The strict
   consensus tree recovered by tip dating invalidates the classic
   classification and allows dates to be proposed for the divergence and
   origin of the different clades.},

Abstract = {The Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary, one of Earth's five major
   extinction events, occurred just before the appearance of Placentalia in
   the fossil record. The Gobi Desert, Mongolia and the Western Interior of
   North America have important fossil mammals occurring just before and
   after the KPg boundary (e.g. Prodiacodon, Deltatheridium) that have yet
   to be phylogenetically tested in a character-rich context with molecular
   data. We present here phylogenetic analyses of >6000 newly scored
   anatomical observations drawn from six untested fossils and added to the
   largest existing morphological matrix for mammals. These data are
   combined with sequence data from 27 nuclear genes. Results show the
   existence of a new eutherian sister clade to Placentalia, which we name
   and characterize. The extinct clade Leptictidae is part of this
   placental sister clade, indicating that the sister clade survived the
   KPg event to co-exist in ancient ecosystems during the Paleogene
   radiation of placentals. Analysing the Cretaceous metatherian
   Deltatheridium in this character-rich context reveals it is a member of
   Marsupialia, a finding that extends the minimum age of Marsupialia
   before the KPg boundary. Numerous shared-derived features from multiple
   anatomical systems support the assignment of Deltatheridium to
   Marsupialia. Computed tomography scans of exquisite new specimens better
   document the marsupial-like dental replacement pattern of
   Deltatheridium. The new placental sister clade has both Asian and North
   American species, and is ancestrally characterized by shared derived
   features such as a hind limb modified for saltatorial locomotion.},

Title = {Female terminalia morphology and cladistic relations among Tok-Tok

Abstract = {Tok-tokkies are one of the most iconic lineages within Tenebrionidae. In
   addition to containing some of the largest darkling beetles, this tribe
   is recognized for its remarkable form of sexual communication known as
   substrate tapping. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships within
   the group remain poorly understood. This study investigates the
   usefulness of female terminalia morphology for delimiting Sepidiini and
   reconstructing relationships among it. Data on the structure of the
   ovipositors, genital tubes and spicula ventrali have been generated for
   >200 species representing 28 Pimeliinae tribes. This dataset was used in
   a comparative analysis at the subfamilial level, which resulted in
   recognition of several unique features of tok-tokkie terminalia.
   Additionally, new features linking phenotypically challenging tribes
   also were recovered (Cryptochilini + Idisiini + Pimeliini). Secondly, 23
   characters linked to the structure of female terminalia were defined for
   tok-tok beetles. Cladistic analysis demonstrates the nonmonophyletic
   nature of most of the recognized subtribes. The morphological dataset
   was analysed separately and in combination with available molecular data
   (CAD, Wg, cox1, cox2, 28S). All obtained topologies were largely
   congruent, supporting the following changes: Palpomodina Kaminski \&
   Gearner subtr.n. is erected to accommodate the genera Namibomodes and
   Palpomodes; Argenticrinis and Bombocnodulus are transferred from
   Hypomelina to Molurina; 153 species and subspecies previously classified
   within Psammodes are distributed over three separate genera (Mariazofia
   Kaminski nom.n., Piesomera stat.r., Psammodes sens.n.). Psammodes
   sklodowskae Kaminski \& Gearner sp.n. is described. Preliminary
   investigation of the ovipositor of Mariazofia basuto (Koch) comb.n. was
   carried out with the application of microcomputed tomography,
   illuminating the muscular system as a reliable reference point for
   recognizing homologous elements in highly modified ovipositors.},

Abstract = {High-elevation adaptation provides an excellent system for examining
   adaptive evolution, and adaptive variations may manifest at gene
   expression or any other phenotypic levels. We examined gene expression
   profiles of Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans) along an elevational
   gradient from both wild and common-garden acclimated populations.
   Asiatic toads originated from high altitudes have distinctive gene
   expression patterns. We identified 18 fixed differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs), which are different in both wild and acclimated samples,
   and 1217 plastic DEGs, which are different among wild samples. The
   expression levels of most genes were linearly correlated with altitude
   gradient and down-regulated in high-altitude populations. Expression
   variations of several genes associated with metabolic process are fixed,
   and we also identified a co-expression module that is significantly
   different between acclimated populations and has functions related to
   DNA repair. The differential expression of the vast majority genes,
   however, are due to phenotypic plasticity, revealing the highly plastic
   nature of gene expression variations. Expression modification of some
   specific genes related to metabolism and response to UV radiation play
   crucial role in adaptation to high altitude for Asiatic toads.
   Common-garden experiments are essential for evaluating adaptive
   evolution of natural populations.},

Volume = {90},

Pages = {352-361},

Abstract = {When a dispensable gene is duplicated (referred to the ancestral
   dispensability denoted by O+), genetic buffering and duplicate
   compensation together maintain the duplicate redundancy, whereas
   duplicate compensation is the only mechanism when an essential gene is
   duplicated (referred to the ancestral essentiality denoted by O-). To
   investigate these evolutionary scenarios of genetic robustness, I
   formulated a simple mixture model for analyzing duplicate pairs with one
   of the following states: double dispensable (DD), semi-dispensable (one
   dispensable one essential, DE), or double essential (EE). This model was
   applied to the yeast duplicate pairs from a whole-genome duplication
   (WGD) occurred about 100 million years ago (mya), and the mouse
   duplicate pairs from a WGD occurred about more than 500 mya. Both case
   studies revealed that the proportion of essentiality for those
   duplicates with ancestral essentiality {[}P-E(O-)] was much higher than
   that for those with ancestral dispensability {[}P-E(O+)]. While it was
   negligible in the yeast duplicate pairs, P-E(O+) (about 20\%) was shown
   statistically significant in the mouse duplicate pairs. These findings,
   together, support the hypothesis that both sub-functionalization and
   neo-functionalization may play some roles after gene duplication, though
   the former may be much faster than the later.},

Abstract = {Troponin-based Ca2+ regulation of striated muscle contraction emerged
   approximately 700 million years ago with largely conserved functions
   during evolution. Troponin I (TnI) is the inhibitory subunit of troponin
   and has evolved into three muscle type-specific isoforms in vertebrates.
   Cardiac TnI is specifically expressed in the adult heart and has a
   unique N-terminal extension implicating a specific value during natural
   selection. The N-terminal extension of cardiac TnI in higher vertebrates
   contains beta-adrenergic-regulated protein kinase A (PKA)
   phosphorylation sites as a mechanism to enhance cardiac muscle
   relaxation and facilitate ventricular filling. Phylogenic studies showed
   that the N-terminal extension of cardiac TnI first emerged in the
   genomes of early tetrapods as well as primordial lobe-finned fishes such
   as the coelacanth whereas it is absent in ray-finned fish. This
   apparently rapid evolution of beta-adrenergic regulation of cardiac
   function suggests a high selection value for the heart of vertebrate
   animals on land to work under higher metabolic demands. Sequencing and
   PKA phosphorylation data showed that lungfish cardiac TnI has evolved
   with an amphibian-like N-terminal extension with prototype PKA
   phosphorylation sites while its overall structure remained fish like.
   The data demonstrate that the submolecular structure of TnI may evolve
   ahead of the whole protein for cardiac muscle contractility to adapt to
   new environmental conditions. Understanding the evolution of the
   beta-adrenergic regulation of TnI and cardiac adaptation to the
   increased energetic demands of life on land adds knowledge for the
   treatment of human heart diseases and failure.},

Abstract = {Vertebrate blood coagulation is controlled by a cascade containing more
   than 20 proteins. The cascade proteins are found in the blood in their
   zymogen forms and when the cascade is triggered by tissue damage,
   zymogens are activated and in turn activate their downstream proteins by
   serine protease activity. In this study, we examined proteomes of 21
   chordates, of which 18 are vertebrates, to reveal the modular evolution
   of the blood coagulation cascade. Additionally, two Arthropoda species
   were used to compare domain arrangements of the proteins belonging to
   the hemolymph clotting and the blood coagulation cascades. Within the
   vertebrate coagulation protein set, almost half of the studied proteins
   are shared with jawless vertebrates. Domain similarity analyses revealed
   that there are multiple possible evolutionary trajectories for each
   coagulation protein. During the evolution of higher vertebrate clades,
   gene and genome duplications led to the formation of other coagulation
   cascade proteins.},

Title = {Epistasis-Driven Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Secondary Structure},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Epistasis is an evolutionary phenomenon whereby the fitness effect of a
   mutation depends on the genetic background in which it arises. A key
   source of epistasis in an RNA molecule is its secondary structure, which
   contains functionally important topological motifs held together by
   hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs. Here we study
   epistasis in the secondary structure of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by examining properties of derived
   alleles arising from substitution mutations at ancestral WC base-paired
   and unpaired (UP) sites in 15 conserved topological motifs across the
   genome. We uncover fewer derived alleles and lower derived allele
   frequencies at WC than at UP sites, supporting the hypothesis that
   modifications to the secondary structure are often deleterious. At WC
   sites, we also find lower derived allele frequencies for mutations that
   abolish base pairing than for those that yield G center dot U
   ``wobbles,{''} illustrating that weak base pairing can partially
   preserve the integrity of the secondary structure. Last, we show that WC
   sites under the strongest epistatic constraint reside in a three-stemmed
   pseudoknot motif that plays an essential role in programmed ribosomal
   frameshifting, whereas those under the weakest epistatic constraint are
   located in 3' UTR motifs that regulate viral replication and
   pathogenicity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of epistasis in
   the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure, as well as
   highlight putative structural and functional targets of different forms
   of natural selection.},

Title = {Adaptation and Exaptation: From Small Molecules to Feathers},

Abstract = {Evolution works by adaptation and exaptation. At an organismal level,
   exaptation and adaptation are seen in the formation of organelles and
   the advent of multicellularity. At the sub-organismal level, molecular
   systems such as proteins and RNAs readily undergo adaptation and
   exaptation. Here we suggest that the concepts of adaptation and
   exaptation are universal, synergistic, and recursive and apply to small
   molecules such as metabolites, cofactors, and the building blocks of
   extant polymers. For example, adenosine has been extensively adapted and
   exapted throughout biological evolution. Chemical variants of adenosine
   that are products of adaptation include 2 ` deoxyadenosine in DNA and a
   wide array of modified forms in mRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, and viral RNAs.
   Adenosine and its variants have been extensively exapted for various
   functions, including informational polymers (RNA, DNA), energy storage
   (ATP), metabolism (e.g., coenzyme A), and signaling (cyclic AMP).
   According to Gould, Vrba, and Darwin, exaptation imposes a general
   constraint on interpretation of history and origins; because of
   exaptation, extant function should not be used to explain evolutionary
   history. While this notion is accepted in evolutionary biology, it can
   also guide the study of the chemical origins of life. We propose that
   (i) evolutionary theory is broadly applicable from the dawn of life to
   the present time from molecules to organisms, (ii) exaptation and
   adaptation were important and simultaneous processes, and (iii) robust
   origin of life models can be constructed without conflating extant
   utility with historical basis of origins.},

Abstract = {To perform a quasispecies assessment of the effect of vaccine
   combinations and antibody titers on the emergence of Avian coronavirus
   (AvCoV) escape mutants, 5-week-old males from a commercial chicken
   breeder lineage were vaccinated intramuscularly with one dose of a
   monovalent (genotype GI-1) or a bivalent (genotypes GI-1 and GI-11 (n =
   40 birds/group) AvCoV vaccine. Seven birds were kept as controls. Six
   weeks later, pools of sera of each group were prepared and incubated at
   virus neutralization doses of 10 and 10(-1) with the Beaudette strain
   (GI-1) of AvCoV in VERO cells. Rescued viruses were then submitted to
   genome-wide deep sequencing for subconsensus variant detection. After
   treatment with serum from birds vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine at
   a titer of 10(-1), an F307I variant was detected in the spike
   glycoprotein that mapped to an important neutralizing region, which
   indicated an escape mutant derived from natural selection. Further
   variants were detected in nonstructural proteins and non-coding regions
   that are not targets of neutralizing antibodies and might be indicators
   of genetic drift. These results indicate that the evolution of AvCoV
   escape mutants after vaccination depends on the type of vaccine strain
   and the antibody titer and must be assessed based on quasispecies rather
   than consensus dominant sequences only because quasispecies may be
   otherwise undetected.},

Abstract = {Understanding the origin and early evolution of proteins is important
   for unveiling how the RNA world developed into an RNA-protein world.
   Because the composition of organic molecules in the Earth's primitive
   environment was plausibly not as diverse as today, the number of
   different amino acids used in early protein synthesis is likely to be
   substantially less than the current 20 proteinogenic residues. In this
   study, we have explored the thermal stability and RNA binding of
   ancestral variants of the ribosomal protein uS8 constructed from a
   reduced-alphabet of amino acids. First, we built a phylogenetic tree
   based on the amino acid sequences of uS8 from multiple extant organisms
   and used the tree to infer two plausible amino acid sequences
   corresponding to the last bacterial common ancestor of uS8. Both
   ancestral proteins were thermally stable and bound to an RNA fragment.
   By eliminating individual amino acid letters and monitoring thermal
   stability and RNA binding in the resulting proteins, we reduced the size
   of the amino acid set constituting one of the ancestral proteins,
   eventually finding that convergent sequences consisting of 15- or
   14-amino acid alphabets still folded into stable structures that bound
   to the RNA fragment. Furthermore, a simplified variant reconstructed
   from a 13-amino-acid alphabet retained affinity for the RNA fragment,
   although it lost conformational stability. Collectively, RNA-binding
   activity may be achieved with a subset of the current 20 amino acids,
   raising the possibility of a simpler composition of RNA-binding proteins
   in the earliest stage of protein evolution.},

Abstract = {Reactions involving water and oxygen are basic features of geological
   and biological processes. To understand how life interacts with its
   environment requires monitoring interactions with H2O and O-2 not only
   at timescales relevant to organismal growth but also over billions of
   years of geobiological evolution. Chemical transformations intrinsic to
   evolution and development were characterized by analyzing data from
   recent phylostratigraphic and proteomic studies. This two-stage analysis
   involves obtaining chemical metrics (carbon oxidation state and
   stoichiometric hydration state) from the elemental compositions of
   proteins followed by modeling the relative stabilities of target
   proteins against a proteomic background to infer thermodynamic
   parameters {[}oxygen fugacity, water activity, and virtual redox
   potential (Eh)]. The main results of this study are a rise in carbon
   oxidation state of proteins spanning the time of the Great Oxidation
   Event, a rise in virtual redox potential that coincides with the likely
   emergence of aerobic metabolism, and a rise in carbon oxidation state of
   proteins inferred from the transcriptome in late stages of Bacillus
   subtilis biofilm growth. Furthermore, stoichiometric hydration state of
   expressed proteins decreases through stages of biofilm development,
   drops at the same time as a drop in organismal water content during
   fruit fly development, and is lower for proteins with more recent gene

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that drive diversification of taxa across the
   tree of life is a key focus of macroevolutionary research. While the
   effects of life history, ecology, climate and geography on diversity
   have been studied for many taxa, the relationship between molecular
   evolution and diversification has received less attention. However,
   correlations between rates of molecular evolution and diversification
   rate have been detected in a range of taxa, including reptiles, plants
   and birds. A correlation between rates of molecular evolution and
   diversification rate is a prediction of several evolutionary theories,
   including the evolutionary speed hypothesis which links variation in
   mutation rates to differences in speciation rates. If it is widespread,
   such correlations could also have significant practical impacts, if they
   are not adequately accounted for in phylogenetic inference of
   evolutionary rates and timescales. Ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii)
   offer a prime target to test for this relationship due to their extreme
   variation in clade size suggesting a wide range of diversification
   rates. We employ both a sister-pairs approach and a whole-tree approach
   to test for correlations between substitution rate and net
   diversification. We also collect life history and ecological trait data
   and account for potential confounding factors including body size,
   latitude, max depth and reef association. We find evidence to support a
   relationship between diversification and synonymous rates of nuclear
   evolution across two published backbone phylogenies, as well as weak
   evidence for a relationship between mitochondrial nonsynonymous rates
   and diversification at the genus level.},

Title = {Amino Acid Specificity of Ancestral Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Prior to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Extant organisms commonly use 20 amino acids in protein synthesis. In
   the translation system, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) selectively
   binds an amino acid and transfers it to the cognate tRNA. It is
   postulated that the amino acid repertoire of ARS expanded during the
   development of the translation system. In this study we generated
   composite phylogenetic trees for seven ARSs (SerRS, ProRS, ThrRS,
   GlyRS-1, HisRS, AspRS, and LysRS) which are thought to have diverged by
   gene duplication followed by mutation, before the evolution of the last
   universal common ancestor. The composite phylogenetic tree shows that
   the AspRS/LysRS branch diverged from the other five ARSs at the deepest
   node, with the GlyRS/HisRS branch and the other three ARSs (ThrRS, ProRS
   and SerRS) diverging at the second deepest node. ThrRS diverged next,
   and finally ProRS and SerRS diverged from each other. Based on the
   phylogenetic tree, sequences of the ancestral ARSs prior to the
   evolution of the last universal common ancestor were predicted. The
   amino acid specificity of each ancestral ARS was then postulated by
   comparison with amino acid recognition sites of ARSs of extant
   organisms. Our predictions demonstrate that ancestral ARSs had
   substantial specificity and that the number of amino acid types
   amino-acylated by proteinaceous ARSs was limited before the appearance
   of a fuller range of proteinaceous ARS species. From an assumption that
   10 amino acid species are required for folding and function,
   proteinaceous ARS possibly evolved in a translation system composed of
   preexisting ribozyme ARSs, before the evolution of the last universal
   common ancestor.},

Title = {The Ancient Origins of Death Domains Support the `Original Sin'

Abstract = {The discovery of caspase homologs in bacteria highlighted the
   relationship between programmed cell death (PCD) evolution and
   eukaryogenesis. However, the origin of PCD genes in prokaryotes
   themselves (bacteria and archaea) is poorly understood and a source of
   controversy. Whether archaea also contain C14 peptidase enzymes and
   other death domains is largely unknown because of a historical dearth of
   genomic data. Archaeal genomic databases have grown significantly in the
   last decade, which allowed us to perform a detailed comparative study of
   the evolutionary histories of PCD-related death domains in major
   archaeal phyla, including the deepest branching phyla of Candidatus
   Aenigmarchaeota, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. We
   identified death domains associated with executioners of PCD, like the
   caspase homologs of the C14 peptidase family, in 321 archaea sequences.
   Of these, 15.58\% were metacaspase type I orthologues and 84.42\% were
   orthocaspases. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed a
   scattered distribution of orthocaspases and metacaspases in
   deep-branching bacteria and archaea. The tree topology was incongruent
   with the prokaryote 16S phylogeny suggesting a common ancestry of PCD
   genes in prokaryotes and subsequent massive horizontal gene transfer
   coinciding with the divergence of archaea and bacteria. Previous
   arguments for the origin of PCD were philosophical in nature with two
   popular propositions being the ``addiction{''} and `original sin'
   hypotheses. Our data support the `original sin' hypothesis, which argues
   for a pleiotropic origin of the PCD toolkit with pro-life and pro-death
   functions tracing back to the emergence of cellular life-the Last
   Universal Common Ancestor State.},

Abstract = {In the present note, the genomic compositional rule largely known as
   `Chargaff's 2nd parity rule' (asserting equimolarity between
   Adenine-Thymine and Guanine-Cytosine in any of the two DNA strands) is
   regarded in association with Noether's theorem linking symmetries with
   conservation laws in physics. In the case of the genome, the strict
   physical and mathematical prerequisites of Noether's theorem do not
   hold. However, we conclude that a metaphor can be established with
   Noether's theorem, as inter-strand symmetry concerning DNA functionality
   engenders specific features in genome composition. Inversely, when
   inter-strand symmetry does not hold, the corresponding quantitative
   relations fail to appear. This association is also considered from the
   point of view of the existence of emergent laws and properties in
   evolutionary genomics.},

Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive sequences of DNA that
   replicate and proliferate throughout genomes. Taken together, all the
   TEs in a genome form a diverse community of sequences, which can be
   studied to draw conclusions about genome evolution. TE diversity can be
   measured using models for ecological community diversity that consider
   species richness and evenness. Several models predict TE diversity
   decreasing as genomes expand because of selection against ectopic
   recombination and/or competition among TEs to garner host replicative
   machinery and evade host silencing mechanisms. Salamanders have some of
   the largest vertebrate genomes and highest TE loads. Salamanders of the
   genus Plethodon, in particular, have genomes that range in size from 20
   to 70 Gb. Here, we use Oxford Nanopore sequencing to generate
   low-coverage genomic sequences for four species of Plethodon that
   encompass two independent genome expansion events, one in the eastern
   clade (Plethodon cinereus, 29.3 Gb vs. Plethodon glutinosus, 38.9 Gb)
   and one in the western clade (Plethodon vehiculum, 46.4 Gb vs Plethodon
   idahoensis, 67.0 Gb). We classified the TEs in these genomes and found >
   40 TE superfamilies, accounting for 22-27\% of the genomes. We
   calculated Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices to quantify overall
   TE diversity. In both pairwise comparisons, the diversity index values
   for the smaller and larger genome were almost identical. This result
   indicates that, when genomes reach extremely large sizes, they maintain
   high levels of TE diversity at the superfamily level, in contrast to
   predictions made by previous studies on smaller genomes.},

Title = {d(N)/d(S)-H, a New Test to Distinguish Different Selection Modes in
   Protein Evolution and Cancer Evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the most popular measures in the analysis of protein sequence
   evolution is the ratio of nonsynonymous distance (d(N)) to synonymous
   distance (d(S)). Under the assumption that synonymous substitutions in
   the coding region are selectively neutral, the d(N)/d(S) ratio can be
   used to statistically detect the adaptive evolution (or purifying
   selection) if d(N)/d(S) > 1 (or d(N)/d(S) < 1) significantly. However,
   due to strong structural constraints and/or variable functional
   constraints imposed on amino acid sites, most encoding genes in most
   species have demonstrated d(N)/d(S) < 1. Consequently, the statistical
   power for testing d(N)/d(S) = 1 may be insufficient to distinguish
   between different selection modes. In this paper, we propose a more
   powerful test, called d(N)/d(S)-H, in which a new parameter H, a
   relative measure of rate variation among sites, was introduced. Given
   the condition of strong purifying selections at some sites, the
   d(N)/d(S)-H model predicts d(N)/d(S) = 1-H for neutral evolution,
   d(N)/d(S) < 1-H for nearly neutral selection, and d(N)/d(S) > 1-H for
   adaptive evolution. The potential of this new method for resolving the
   neutral-adaptive debates is illustrated by the protein sequence
   evolution in vertebrates, Drosophila and yeasts, as well as somatic
   cancer evolution (specialized as the C-N/C-S-H test).},

Abstract = {In the past few years, our understanding of the RNA virosphere has
   changed dramatically due to the growth and spurt of metagenomics,
   exponentially increasing the number of RNA viral sequences, and
   providing a better understanding of their range of potential hosts. As
   of today, the only conserved protein among RNA viruses appears to be the
   monomeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme belongs to the
   right-hand DNA-and RNA polymerases, which also includes reverse
   transcriptases and eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases. The ubiquity
   of this protein in RNA viruses makes it a unique evolutionary marker and
   an appealing broad-spectrum antiviral target. In this work pairwise
   structural comparisons of viral RdRps and RTs were performed, including
   tertiary structures that have been obtained in the last few years. The
   resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the RdRps from (+)ss- and dsRNA
   viruses might have been recruited several times throughout the evolution
   of mobile genetic elements. RTs also display multiple evolutionary
   routes. We have identified a structural core comprising the entire palm,
   a large moiety of the fingers and the N-terminal helices of the thumb
   domain, comprising over 300 conserved residues, including two regions
   that we have named the ``knuckles{''} and the ``hypothenar eminence{''}.
   The conservation of an helix bundle in the region preceding the
   polymerase domain confirms that (-)ss and dsRNA Reoviruses' polymerases
   share a recent ancestor. Finally, the inclusion of DNA polymerases into
   our structural analyses suggests that monomeric RNA-dependent
   polymerases might have diverged from B-family polymerases.},

Abstract = {``De novo{''} genes evolve from previously non-genic DNA. This strikes
   many of us as remarkable, because it seems extraordinarily unlikely that
   random sequence would produce a functional gene. How is this possible?
   In this two-part review, I first summarize what is known about the
   origins and molecular functions of the small number of de novo genes for
   which such information is available. I then speculate on what these
   examples may tell us about how de novo genes manage to emerge despite
   what seem like enormous opposing odds.},

Abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most lethal cancer
   types in the world. Currently, the molecular mechanisms and pathways
   underlying NSCLC oncogenesis are poorly understood. Using multiple Omics
   data, we systematically explored the differentially expressed circular
   RNAs (circRNAs) in NSCLC. We also investigated potential microRNA
   sponges (that absorb circRNAs) in NSCLC and downstream target genes with
   experimental verifications. hsa\_circ\_0003497 was down-regulated in
   NSCLC and played an inhibitory role in tumorigenesis. In contrast,
   miR-197-3p was up-regulated in NSCLC. hsa\_circ\_0003497 directly
   interacts with miR-197-3p and releases a target gene of miR-197-3p
   termed CTNND1 (a known tumor suppressor gene). Evolutionary analysis
   reveals fast evolution of this
   hsa\_circ\_0003497-miR-197-3p-CTNND1-NSCLC axis in mammals. This work
   clarified the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of how
   hsa\_circ\_0003497 suppresses NSCLC through miR-197-3p and CTNND1. We
   discovered molecular markers for the prognosis of NSCLC and provided
   potential intervention targets for its treatment.},

Abstract = {We draw attention to an under-appreciated simulation method for
   generating artificial data in a phylogenetic context. The approach,
   which we refer to as jump-chain simulation, can invoke rich models of
   molecular evolution having intractable likelihood functions. As an
   example, we simulate data under a context-dependent model allowing for
   CpG hypermutability and show how such a feature can mislead common codon
   models used for detecting positive selection. We discuss more generally
   how this method can serve to elucidate the ways by which currently used
   models for inference are susceptible to violations of their underlying
   assumptions. Finally, we show how the method could serve as an inference
   engine in the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework.},

Abstract = {Nucleic acids likely played a foundational role in the origin of life.
   However, the prebiotic chemistry of nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis
   has proved challenging on a number of fronts. The recent discovery of
   both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases in carbonaceous chondrite
   meteorites has garnered much attention from both the popular press and
   the scientific community. Here, we discuss these findings in the context
   of nucleoside/nucleotide prebiotic chemistry. We consider that the main
   challenge of prebiotic nucleoside synthesis, that of nucleosidic bond
   formation, is not addressed by the identification nucleobases in
   meteorites. We further discuss issues of selection that arise from the
   observation that such meteorites contain both canonical and
   non-canonical nucleobases. In sum, we argue that, despite the major
   analytical achievement of identifying and characterizing nucleobases in
   meteorites, this observation does little to advance our understanding of
   the prebiotic chemistry that could have led to the first genetic
   molecules that gave rise to us.},

Title = {Bayesian Cross-Validation Comparison of Amino Acid Replacement Models:
   Contrasting Profile Mixtures, Pairwise Exchangeabilities, and

Abstract = {Models of amino acid replacement are central to modern phylogenetic
   inference, particularly so when dealing with deep evolutionary
   relationships. Traditionally, a single, empirically derived matrix was
   utilized, so as to keep the degrees-of-freedom of the inference low, and
   focused on topology. With the growing size of data sets, however, an
   amino acid-level general-time-reversible matrix has become increasingly
   feasible, treating amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies as free
   parameters. Moreover, models based on mixtures of multiple matrices are
   increasingly utilized, in order to account for across-site
   heterogeneities in amino acid requirements of proteins. Such models
   exist as finite empirically-derived amino acid profile (or frequency)
   mixtures, free finite mixtures, as well as free Dirichlet process-based
   infinite mixtures. All of these approaches are typically combined with a
   gamma-distributed rates-across-sites model. In spite of the availability
   of these different aspects to modeling the amino acid replacement
   process, no study has systematically quantified their relative
   contributions to their predictive power of real data. Here, we use
   Bayesian cross-validation to establish a detailed comparison, while
   activating/deactivating each modeling aspect. For most data sets
   studied, we find that amino acid mixture models can outrank all
   single-matrix models, even when the latter include gamma-distributed
   rates and the former do not. We also find that free finite mixtures
   consistently outperform empirical finite mixtures. Finally, the
   Dirichlet process-based mixture model tends to outperform all other
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Diverse studies have shown that the content of genes present in
   sequenced genomes does not seem to correlate with the complexity of the
   organisms. However, various studies have shown that organism complexity
   and the size of the proteome has, indeed, a significant correlation.
   This characteristic allows us to postulate that some molecular
   mechanisms have permitted a greater functional diversity to some
   proteins to increase their participation in developing organisms with
   higher complexity. Among those mechanisms, the domain promiscuity,
   defined as the ability of the domains to organize in combination with
   other distinct domains, is of great importance for the evolution of
   organisms. Previous works have analyzed the degree of domain promiscuity
   of the proteomes showing how it seems to have paralleled the evolution
   of eukaryotic organisms. The latter has motivated the present study,
   where we analyzed the domain promiscuity in a collection of 84
   eukaryotic proteomes representative of all the taxonomy groups of the
   tree of life. Using a grammar definition approach, we determined the
   architecture of 1,223,227 proteins, conformed by 2,296,371 domains,
   which established 839,184 bigram types. The phylogenetic reconstructions
   based on differences in the content of information from measures of
   proteome promiscuity confirm that the evolution of the promiscuity of
   domains in eukaryotic organisms resembles the evolutionary history of
   the species. However, a close analysis of the PHD and RING domains, the

Title = {Stem Region of tRNA Genes Favors Transition Substitution Towards Keto
   Bases in Bacteria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Transversion and transition mutations have variable effects on the
   stability of RNA secondary structure considering that the former
   destabilizes the double helix geometry to a greater extent by
   introducing purine:purine (R:R) or pyrimidine:pyrimidine (Y:Y) base
   pairs. Therefore, transversion frequency is likely to be lower than that
   of transition in the secondary structure regions of RNA genes. Here, we
   performed an analysis of transition and transversion frequencies in tRNA
   genes defined well with secondary structure and compared with the
   intergenic regions in five bacterial species namely Escherichia coli,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae using a large genome sequence data set. In
   general, the transversion frequency was observed to be lower than that
   of transition in both tRNA genes and intergenic regions. The transition
   to transversion ratio was observed to be greater in tRNA genes than that
   in the intergenic regions in all the five bacteria that we studied.
   Interestingly, the intraspecies base substitution analysis in tRNA genes
   revealed that non-compensatory substitutions were more frequent than
   compensatory substitutions in the stem region. Further, transition to
   transversion ratio in the loop region was observed to be significantly
   lesser than that among the non-compensatory substitutions in the stem
   region. This indicated that the transversion is more deleterious than
   transition in the stem regions. In addition, substitutions from amino
   bases (A/C) to keto bases (G/T) were also observed to be more than the
   reverse substitutions in the stem region. Substitution from amino bases
   to keto bases are likely to facilitate the stable G:U pairing unlike the
   reverse substitution that facilitates the unstable A:C pairing in the
   stem region of tRNA. This work provides additional support that the
   secondary structure of tRNA molecule is what drives the different
   substitutions in its gene sequence.},

Abstract = {The influence of neighboring base composition, or context, on
   substitution bias at fourfold degenerate coding sites and in intergenic
   regions in plastid DNA is compared across the angiosperms, gymnosperms,
   ferns, liverworts, chlorophytes, stramenopiles and rhodophytes. An
   influence of flanking base G + C content on the relative rates of
   transitions and transversions is observed in all lineages and extends up
   to four nucleotides from the site of substitution in some. Despite
   finding context effects in all lineages, significant differences were
   observed between lineages. Overall, the data suggest that context is a
   general factor affecting mutation bias in plastid DNA but that the
   dynamics of the influence have evolved over time. It is also shown that,
   although there are similar effects of context on substitution bias at
   fourfold degenerate coding sites and at sites within intergenic regions,
   there are also small but significant differences, suggesting that there
   could be some selection on some of these sites and that there could be
   some difference in the mutation and/or repair process between coding and

Title = {Origin of Sex-Biased Mental Disorders: Do Males and Females Experience
   Different Selective Regimes? COMMENT},

Abstract = {The origins of sex-biased differences in disease and health are of
   growing interest to both medical researchers and health professionals.
   Several major factors have been identified that affect sex differences
   in incidence of diseases and mental disorders. These are: sex
   chromosomes, sex hormones and female immunity, sexual selection and
   antagonistic evolution, and differential susceptibility of sexes to
   environmental factors. These factors work on different time scales and
   are not exclusive of each other. Recently, a combined Sexual
   Selection-Sex Hormones (SS-SH) Theory was presented as an evolutionary
   mechanism to explain sex-biased differences in diseases and mental
   disorders (Singh in J Mol Evol 89:195-213, 2021). In that paper disease
   prevalence trends were investigated, and non-sex-specific diseases were
   hypothesized to be more common in males than in females in general. They
   showed signs of exceptions to this trend with inflammatory diseases and
   stress-related mental disorders that were more common in females. We
   believe that the SS-SH theory requires the consideration of
   psycho-social stress (PSS) to explain the predominance of female-biased
   mental disorders and some other exceptions in their findings. Here we
   present a theory of sex-differential experience of PSS and provide
   quantitative support for the combined SS-SH-PSS Theory using
   age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) recording the levels of male-
   and female-bias in data obtained from different countries. The grand
   theory provides an evolutionary framework for explaining patterns of
   sex-biased trends in the prevalence of disease and health. Further
   exploration of women's vulnerability to social factors may help to
   facilitate new treatments for female-biased diseases.},

Title = {A Closer Look at Non-random Patterns Within Chemistry Space for a
   Smaller, Earlier Amino Acid Alphabet},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {307-323},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recent findings, in vitro and in silico, are strengthening the idea of a
   simpler, earlier stage of genetically encoded proteins which used amino
   acids produced by prebiotic chemistry. These findings motivate a
   re-examination of prior work which has identified unusual properties of
   the set of twenty amino acids found within the full genetic code, while
   leaving it unclear whether similar patterns also characterize the subset
   of prebiotically plausible amino acids. We have suggested previously
   that this ambiguity may result from the low number of amino acids
   recognized by the definition of prebiotic plausibility used for the
   analysis. Here, we test this hypothesis using significantly updated data
   for organic material detected within meteorites, which contain several
   coded and non-coded amino acids absent from prior studies. In addition
   to confirming the well-established idea that ``late{''} arriving amino
   acids expanded the chemistry space encoded by genetic material, we find
   that a prebiotically plausible subset of coded amino acids generally
   emulates the patterns found in the full set of 20, namely an
   exceptionally broad and even distribution of volumes and an
   exceptionally even distribution of hydrophobicities (quantified as logP)
   over a narrow range. However, the strength of this pattern varies
   depending on both the size and composition the library used to create a
   background (null model) for a random alphabet, and the precise
   definition of exactly which amino acids were present in a simpler,
   earlier code. Findings support the idea that a small sample size of
   amino acids caused previous ambiguous results, and further improvements
   in meteorite analysis, and/or prebiotic simulations will further clarify
   the nature and extent of unusual properties. We discuss the case of
   sulfur-containing amino acids as a specific and clear example and
   conclude by reviewing the potential impact of better understanding the
   chemical ``logic{''} of a smaller forerunner to the standard amino acid
   alphabet.},

Abstract = {Mutations that reduce the biosynthetic cost of ATP production or
   increase the gene translation efficiency (tAI) are favorable for rapid
   cell growth and proliferation and therefore likely to be observed in
   tumors. Whether the mutations in tumors optimize the trade-off between
   the ATP biosynthesis cost and gene translation efficiency by increasing
   the tAI/ATP ratio is currently unknown. We retrieved transcriptome data
   of normal and osteosarcoma tissue samples from humans and mice and
   identified tumor-specific mutations in each species by using stringent
   cutoffs and outgroup information. We compared the tAI/ATP values of
   genes before and after mutation. The tAI/ATP profile was found to be
   highly conserved in humans and mice, and also correlated with the
   essentiality of genes. Tumor-specific rather than shared mutations were
   found to lead to increased tAI/ATP values in both species. Thus,
   tumor-specific mutations were found to optimize the cost-efficiency
   trade-off by increasing the tAI/ATP ratio of genes in osteosarcoma. This
   may indicate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that promotes
   tumorigenesis by facilitating rapid cell growth and proliferation.},

Abstract = {Codon usage is the outcome of different evolutionary processes and can
   inform us about the conditions in which organisms live and evolve. Here,
   we present R\_ENC', which is an improvement to the original S index
   developed by dos Reis et al. (2004). Our index is less sensitive to G+C
   content, which greatly affects synonymous codon usage in prokaryotes,
   making it better suited to detect selection acting on codon usage. We
   used R\_ENC' to estimate the extent of selected codon usage bias in 1800
   genomes representing 26 prokaryotic phyla. We found that
   Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes
   are the phyla/subphyla showing more genomes with selected codon usage
   bias. In particular, we found that several lineages within
   Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes show a similar set of functional
   terms enriched in genes under selected codon usage bias, indicating
   convergent evolution. We also show that selected codon usage bias tends
   to evolve in genes coding for the translation machinery before other
   functional GO terms. Finally, we discuss the possibility to use R\_ENC'
   to predict whether lineages evolved in copiotrophic or oligotrophic
   environments.},

Abstract = {DNA methylation is a crucial, abundant mechanism of gene regulation in
   vertebrates. It is less prevalent in many other metazoan organisms and
   completely absent in some key model species, such as Drosophila
   melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here a comprehensive
   study of the presence and absence of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in
   138 Ecdysozoa, covering Arthropoda, Nematoda, Priapulida, Onychophora,
   and Tardigrada. Three of these phyla have not been investigated for the
   presence of DNA methylation before. We observe that the loss of
   individual DNMTs independently occurred multiple times across ecdysozoan
   phyla. We computationally predict the presence of DNA methylation based
   on CpG rates in coding sequences using an implementation of Gaussian
   Mixture Modeling, MethMod. Integrating both analysis we predict two
   previously unknown losses of DNA methylation in Ecdysozoa, one within
   Chelicerata (Mesostigmata) and one in Tardigrada. In the early-branching
   Ecdysozoa Priapulus caudatus, we predict the presence of a full set of
   DNMTs and the presence of DNA methylation. We are therefore showing a
   very diverse and independent evolution of DNA methylation in different
   ecdysozoan phyla spanning a phylogenetic range of more than 700 million
   years.},

Abstract = {Diseases and environmental stresses are two distinct challenges for
   virtually all living organisms. In light of evolution, cellular
   responses to diseases and stresses might share similar molecular
   mechanisms, but the detailed regulation pathway is not reported yet. We
   obtained the transcriptomes and translatomes from several NSCLC
   (non-small-cell lung cancer) patients as well as from different species
   under normal or stress conditions. We found that the translation level
   of gene ATF4 is remarkably enhanced in NSCLC due to the reduced number
   of ribosomes binding to its upstream open reading frames (uORFs). We
   also showed the evolutionary conservation of this uORF-ATF4 regulation
   in the stress response of other species. Molecular experiments showed
   that knockdown of ATF4 reduced the cell growth rate while overexpression
   of ATF4 enhanced cell growth, especially for the ATF4 allele with
   mutated uORFs. Population genetics analyses in multiple species verified
   that the mutations that abolish uATGs (start codon of uORFs) are highly
   deleterious, suggesting the functional importance of uORFs. Our study
   proposes an evolutionarily conserved pattern that enhances the ATF4
   translation by uORFs upon stress or disease. We generalized the concept
   of cellular response to diseases and stresses. These two biological
   processes may share similar molecular mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Troponin T (TnT) is the thin filament anchoring subunit of troponin
   complex and plays an organizer role in the Ca2+-regulation of striated
   muscle contraction. From an ancestral gene emerged similar to 700
   million years ago in Bilateria, three homologous genes have evolved in
   vertebrates to encode muscle type-specific isoforms of TnT. Alternative
   splicing variants of TnT are present in vertebrate and invertebrate
   muscles to add functional diversity. While the C-terminal region of TnT
   is largely conserved, it contains an alternatively spliced segment
   emerged early in C. elegans, which has evolved into a pair of mutually
   exclusive exons in arthropods (10A and 10B of Drosophila TpnT gene) and
   vertebrates (16 and 17 of fast skeletal muscle Tnnt3 gene). The
   C-terminal alternatively spliced segment of TnT interfaces with the
   other two subunits of troponin with functional significance. The
   vertebrate cardiac TnT gene that emerged from duplication of the fast
   TnT gene has eliminated this alternative splicing by the fixation of an
   exon 17-like constitutive exon, indicating a functional value in slower
   and rhythmic contractions. The vertebrate slow skeletal muscle TnT gene
   that emerged from duplication of the cardiac TnT gene has the exon
   17-like structure conserved, indicating its further function in
   sustained and fatigue resistant contractions. This functionality-based
   evolution is consistent with the finding that exon 10B-encoded segment
   of Drosophila TnT homologous to the exon 17-encoded segment of
   vertebrate fast TnT is selectively expressed in insect heart and leg
   muscles. The evolution of the C-terminal variable region of TnT
   demonstrates a submolecular mechanism in modifying striated muscle
   contractility and for the treatment of muscle and heart diseases.},

Abstract = {Error-free protein synthesis relies on the precise recognition by the
   aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of their cognate tRNAs in order to attach the

   requires the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases provided by the genome of an
   organism to match the identity elements found in the cognate tRNAs in an
   evolution-independent manner. Identity elements tend to cluster in the
   tRNA anticodon and acceptor stem regions. However, in the arginine
   system, in addition to the anticodon, the importance of nucleotide A20
   in the tRNA D-loop for cognate enzyme recognition has been a sustained
   feature for arginyl-tRNA synthetase in archaea, bacteria and in the
   nuclear-encoded cytosolic form in mammals and plants. However,
   nuclear-encoded mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase, which can be
   distinguished from its cytosolic form by the presence or absence of
   signature motifs, dispenses with the A20 requirement. An examination of
   several hundred non-metazoan organisms and their corresponding tRNA(Arg)
   substrates has confirmed this general concept to a large extent and over
   numerous phyla. However, some Stramenopiles, and in particular, Diatoms
   (Bacillariophyta) present a notable exception. Unusually for non-fungal
   organisms, the nuclear genome encodes tRNA(Arg) isoacceptors with C or U
   at position 20. In this case one of two nuclear-encoded cytosolic
   arginyl-tRNA synthetases has evolved to become insensitive to the nature
   of the D-loop identity element. The other, with a binding pocket that is
   compatible with tRNA(Arg)-A20 recognition, is targeted to organelles
   that encode solely such tRNAs.},

Abstract = {The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family is ubiquitous in
   the living world. ABC proteins bind and hydrolyze ATP to transport a
   myriad of molecules across various lipid-containing membrane systems.
   They have been studied well in plants for transport of a variety of
   compounds and particularly, in vertebrates due to their direct
   involvement in resistance mechanisms against several toxic
   molecules/metabolites. ABC transporters in insects are found within
   large multigene families involved in the efflux of chemical insecticides
   and toxic/undesired metabolites originating from food and endogenous
   metabolism. This review deals with ABC transporter subfamilies of few
   agronomically important Lepidopteran pests. The transcriptional dynamics
   and regulation of ABC transporters during insect development emphasizes
   their functional diversity against insecticides, Cry toxins, and plant
   specialized metabolites. To generate insights about molecular function
   and physiological roles of ABCs, functional and structural
   characterization is necessary. Also, expansion and divergence of ABC
   transporter gene subfamilies in Lepidopteran insects needs more
   systematic investigation. We anticipate that newer methods of insect
   control in agriculture can benefit from an understanding of ABC
   transporter interactions with a vast range of natural specialized
   molecules and synthetic compounds.},

Abstract = {14-3-3 proteins are signal moderators in sensing various stresses and
   play essential functions in plant growth and development. Although,
   14-3-3 gene families have been identified and characterized in many
   plant species, its evolution has not been studied systematically. In
   this study, the plant 14-3-3 family was comprehensively analyzed from
   green algae to angiosperm. Our result indicated that plant 14-3-3
   originated during the early evolutionary history of green algae and
   expanded in terricolous plants. Twenty-six 14-3-3 genes were identified
   in the tea genome. RNA-seq analysis showed that tea 14-3-3 genes display
   different expression patterns in different organs. Moreover, the
   expression of most tea 14-3-3 genes displayed variable expression
   patterns under different abiotic and biotic stresses. In conclusion, our
   results elucidate the evolutionary origin of plant 14-3-3 genes, and
   beneficial for understanding their biological functions and improving
   tea agricultural traits in the future.},

Title = {Evolutionary History of TOPIIA Topoisomerases in Animals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-165},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {TOPIIA topoisomerases are required for the regulation of DNA topology by
   DNA cleavage and re-ligation and are important targets of antibiotic and
   anticancer agents. Humans possess two TOPIIA paralogue genes (TOP2A and
   TOP2B) with high sequence and structural similarity but distinct
   cellular functions. Despite their functional and clinical relevance, the
   evolutionary history of TOPIIA is still poorly understood. Here we show
   that TOPIIA is highly conserved in Metazoa. We also found that TOPIIA
   paralogues from jawed and jawless vertebrates had different origins
   related with tetraploidization events. After duplication, TOP2B evolved
   under a stronger purifying selection than TOP2A, perhaps promoted by the
   more specialized role of TOP2B in postmitotic cells. We also detected
   genetic signatures of positive selection in the highly variable
   C-terminal domain (CTD), possibly associated with adaptation to cellular
   interactions. By comparing TOPIIA from modern and archaic humans, we
   found two amino acid substitutions in the TOP2A CTD, suggesting that
   TOP2A may have contributed to the evolution of present-day humans, as
   proposed for other cell cycle-related genes. Finally, we identified six
   residues conferring resistance to chemotherapy differing between TOP2A
   and TOP2B. These six residues could be targets for the development of
   TOP2A-specific inhibitors that would avoid the side effects caused by
   inhibiting TOP2B. Altogether, our findings clarify the origin,
   diversification and selection pressures governing the evolution of
   animal TOPIIA.},
