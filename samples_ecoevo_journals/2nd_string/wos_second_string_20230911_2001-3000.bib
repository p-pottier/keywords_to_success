Title = {An impact assessment of alien invasive plants in South Africa generally
   dispersed by native avian species},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {189-207},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Invasive alien plant species have been identified as a major threat to
   biodiversity and the relationship with native avian dispersers may
   increase their invasion potential. The impact of invasive plant species
   needs to be quantified using comparable assessment tools across
   different habitats and species to allocate limited resources to
   high-priority species. Here, we used the Generic Impact Scoring System
   (GISS) to assess the impacts of 16 fleshy-fruited alien invasive plant
   species in South Africa generally dispersed by native avian species. The
   results showed that fleshy-fruited invasive species have both
   environmental and socio-economic impacts. The cumulated impact scores
   for lantana (Lantana camara) and the tree of heaven (Ailanthus
   altissima) were the highest, with scores of 42 and 32, respectively.
   Some species, such as white mulberry (Morus alba), camphor tree
   (Cinnamomum camphora), American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) and
   Brazilian pepper tree (Schinus terebinthifolius), had low overall impact
   scores of 8, 18, 14 and 16, respectively, but scored the maximum impact
   of 5 for certain mechanisms. Environmental impacts of fleshy-fruited
   invasive plant species had a high impact magnitude through effects on
   the ecosystem and vegetation. Socio-economic impacts were mainly through
   effects on forest production, agriculture and human health. Species with
   large crop sizes, small seeds and fruit sizes had higher environmental
   and socio-economic impact magnitude. The information generated in this
   study is important for guiding resource allocation and preventing the
   uncontrolled introduction of invasive species in South Africa. The
   impact of the fleshy-fruited invasive species transcended sectors and,
   therefore, effective management of invasive species will require the
   collaboration of multiple and inter-sectoral stakeholders in South
   Africa.},

Abstract = {The presence of a predator affects prey populations either by direct

   investigated whether the hatching time, developmental stage, and body
   size at hatching of common frog (Rana temporaria) embryos would alter in
   the presence of a red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) as a
   predator. The presence of a predator affected all factors examined. We
   found that in the absence of the slider, the embryos hatched in 12 days,
   while hatching was accelerated by two days in slider treatment. At the
   same time, the embryos hatched smaller and at a lower stage of
   development with the slider than without it. Our study extends the range
   of predators studied, including the effect on different phases of
   development of potential amphibian prey.},

Title = {From pattern to process: Towards mechanistic design principles for pest
   suppressive landscapes},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {157-171},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The challenge to reconcile agricultural production with the conservation
   of biodiversity and associated ecosystems services has triggered
   interest in the design of pest suppressive landscapes. However, the
   uniqueness of species -spe-cific responses to management and landscape
   context hamper our ability to make generalizations for landscape design,
   and we often lack quantitative indicators to make inferences about the
   pest suppressive potential of landscape designs. Here I examine the
   literature to underpin design principles based on source-sink theory.
   The potential of landscapes to support herbivore populations is
   associated with the area of source habitat, source strength, and the
   ability of herbivores to detect host plants. The potential of natural
   enemies to suppress herbivore populations is asso-ciated with their
   potential for numerical response, time to colonization and natural enemy
   diversity. Insecticide appli-cations and other intensive management
   practices can turn treated fields into sinks. The analysis reveals that
   landscape features or management practices influence multiple processes
   at the same time, and that well-documented landscape features associated
   with high pest suppression potential generally discourage herbivores
   and/or favour natu-ral enemies. The evaluation of landscapes in terms of
   source habitats for specific herbivores and their natural enemies may
   reveal context-specific information that allow a better quantitative
   understanding of pest suppression potential of landscapes.(c) 2022 The

Title = {Climate and human influence shape the interactive role of the honeybee
   in pollination networks beyond its native distributional range},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {186-195},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Empirical evidence has shown that introduced honeybees, Apis mellifera
   L., can change the structural organization of eco-logical networks
   involving pollinators and flowering plants. In this case, studies have
   shown that A. mellifera is highly connected within networks (i.e., high
   interactive role) mainly due to its high abundances, long colony
   lifetime, generalist diet, and great capacity of spread and adaptation
   to new environments. However, there is little knowledge on how the
   interactive role of A. mellifera in these flower-visitor networks
   changes spatially and the potential correlates of such variation across
   ecological and geographical gradients worldwide. In this study, we
   evaluated how native and exotic distribution ranges, local climate,
   human influence (i.e., anthropogenic disturbance), and latitude shape
   the interactive role of the honeybee in plant -floral visitor networks
   globally. To achieve that, we compiled 95 weighted plant -floral visitor
   networks encompassing ca. 87 degrees of latitude and 227 degrees of
   longitude across the globe. We found that the interactive role of A.
   mellifera is higher in its exotic range than in the native
   distributional range and positively associated with mean annual
   temperature and precipitation. Further, the interactive role of A.
   mellifera was high at intermediate values of global human influence and
   increased with latitude. Our findings help us to understand how
   different drivers related to rapid global change could affect the
   capacity of A. mellifera to colonize and increase its impact on other
   pollinator species in different environments. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {The Buffalo National River is a scenic and ecologically significant
   resource located in the Ozark Plateau of Arkansas, USA. As a
   free-flowing and protected river, the Buffalo offers natural benefits to
   humanity (e.g., food production, carbon storage, recreation), known as
   ecosystem services. Using both market and survey data, we performed the
   first comprehensive valuation of the ecosystem services that the Buffalo
   National River provides to Arkansas residents. The total ecosystem
   services benefits in 2018 USD were valued at \$20.5 million per year
   (\$550/ha). Most of the value was concentrated in cultural services
   (i.e., recreation, aesthetics, cognitive development), which were
   responsible for over 70\% of total value at \$384/ha. Air quality
   regulation and the provisioning of water also made important
   contributions to the total, with values of \$103/ha and \$36/ha,
   respectively. Our study highlights the considerable economic value
   provided by the Buffalo National River in its current state. Recent
   economic activity, in particular intensive agriculture, has threatened
   these services and in the process created conflicts between different
   industries. These values are important to consider when making
   management and policy decisions that affect the region.},

   Tradeoffs Between Deer Browse and Interspecific Competition},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {230-241},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Pectis imberbis is an endangered plant found in the Madrean Archipelago
   ecoregion of southern Arizona. Numerous, potentially interacting
   stressors, such as drought, shifting fire regimes, invasive species, and
   grazing by domesticated and wild ungulates, affect this species and
   region. We used Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to describe dynamics
   of the largest documented P. imberbis population. While collecting
   census data, we quantified impacts of species interacting with P.
   imberbis, including pollinators, Coues deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   couesi), and co-occurring vegetation, and evaluated their impact on P.
   imberbis population vital rates. Despite a large overall size (N= 794),
   the growth rate for this population was below replacement level (lambda=
   0.9519). Browse by Coues deer negatively impacted demographic vital
   rates. Woody species and perennial grasses afforded protection against
   browse, especially for small individuals, but in the absence of browse,
   coincidence with heterospecific vegetation decreased growth, survival,
   and reproduction of P. imberbis. We observed 12 taxa of invertebrates
   interacting with P. imberbis flowers, including native bees, flies, and
   wasps. Seed production by bagged flowers indicated that flowers are
   self-compatible. In summary, we detected a unique interplay between
   deer, which negatively impacted P. imberbis populations via browse, and
   vegetation, which reduced incidence of browse, while simultaneously
   depressing P. imberbis vital rates when no browse occurred. Findings
   suggest that shifts in community dynamics, such as introduction of
   invasive grasses or fluctuations in deer populations, could impact P.
   imberbis population trajectories. Management actions, including
   exclusion of herbivores and removal of invasive grasses, should be
   considered to aid species recovery.},

   describes the development and application of a multilingual electronic
   decision-support tool for screening terrestrial animals under current

   Assessment (WRA) and related WRA-type toolkits and complies with the
   `minimum requirements' for use with the recent European Regulation on
   invasive alien species of concern. The TAS-ISK consists of 49 basic
   questions on the species' biogeographical/historical traits and its
   biological/ecological interactions, and of 6 additional questions to
   predict how climate change is likely to influence the risks of
   introduction, establishment, dispersal and impact of the screened
   species. Following a description of the main features of this
   decision-support tool as a turnkey software application and of its
   graphical user interface with support for 32 languages, sample
   screenings are provided in different risk assessment areas for one
   representative species of each of the main taxonomic groups of
   terrestrial animals supported by the toolkit: mammals, birds, reptiles,
   amphibians, annelids, insects, molluscs, nematodes, and platyhelminths.
   The highest-scoring species were the red earthworm Lumbricus rubellus
   for the Aegean region of Turkey and the New Zealand flatworm
   Arthurdendyus triangulatus for Croatia. It is anticipated that adoption
   of this toolkit will mirror that of the worldwide employed AS-ISK, hence
   allowing to share information and inform decisions for the prevention of
   entry and/or dispersal of (high-risk) non-native terrestrial animal
   species - a crucial step to implement early-stage control and
   eradication measures as part of rapid-response strategies to counteract
   biological invasions.},

Title = {Comparing field-based management approaches for invasive Winter
   Heliotrope (Petasites pyrenaicus, Asteraceae)},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {171-187},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Winter Heliotrope (Petasites pyrenaicus, previously P. fragrans), is a
   persistent, rhizome-forming species found throughout the Mediterranean
   region and North Africa and is an Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) in the UK
   and Ireland. P. pyrenaicus excludes native flora by forming a dense,
   compact canopy that persists for much of the growing season, and is
   often found growing in rough ground, riparian areas and along
   communication routes, incurring significant management costs at sites of
   conservation interest. Our study describes the first field-based
   assessment of P. pyrenaicus control treatments, testing 12 physical
   and/or chemical treatments in replicated 1 m2 plots over four years and
   one chemical treatment over three years. Treatments focused on
   understanding phenology and resource allocation to exploit rhizome
   source -sink relationships in P. pyrenaicus. Multiple-stage
   glyphosate-and picloram-based treatments reduced leaf canopy cover to
   zero (\%) over time, though no treatment completely eradicated P.
   pyrenaicus. When designing management strategies, effective P.
   pyrenaicus control may be achieved by a single annual soil and/or foliar
   application of picloram at 1.34 kg AE ha(-1) in spring, or by a single
   annual foliar application of glyphosate in spring at 2.16 kg AE ha(-1).
   Control is not improved by the addition of other herbicides or physical
   treatment methods, underlining the importance of these herbicides for
   perennial invasive plant management. This work confirms the importance
   of considering plant phenology, resource allocation and rhizome
   source-sink relationships, to increase treatment efficacy and reduce the
   environmental impacts associated with the management of P. pyrenaicus
   and other invasive, rhizome forming species.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impacts of off-farm work on the technical
   efficiency (TE) of wheat production, using data collected from 549
   farming households in China. Unlike previous studies that only capture
   one dimension of off-farm work, in this study, we consider multiple
   dimensions, including off-farm work participation status of household
   heads, location choices (local or migrated off-farm work), and off-farm
   work intensity. We employ the stochastic frontier production model to
   estimate the TE of wheat production and a two-stage residual inclusion
   (2SRI) approach to address the endogeneity of the off-farm work
   variables. We find that: (1) household heads' off-farm work
   participation significantly increases TE of wheat production; (2) local
   (rather than migrated) off-farm work participation significantly
   increases TE; (3) off-farm work intensity significantly increases TE
   when household heads work off the farm for more than 9 months.
   Additional analysis reveals that off-farm work participation of
   household heads, rather than other members, plays a significant role in
   improving the TE of wheat production.},

Title = {Direct and indirect effects of multisensory modalities on visitor' s

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Thermal comfort in outdoor spaces is of vital importance to human health
   and well-being, and affects the livability of cities. In a humid-hot
   region with elevated temperatures, it is difficult to improve the
   thermal experience of urban residents by changing objective conditions
   such as the microclimate. This study created a set of experience indices
   in different dimensions including visual, auditory, and olfactory
   perceptions and psychological cognitions, to explore the influencing
   factors and mechanisms of visitor's thermal comfort in an urban park. We
   found that visual, auditory, and olfactory experience indices and
   psychological cognition indices were both strongly correlated with
   thermal comfort (Pearson correlation coefficients were above 0.3). By
   analyzing a survey data with a structural equation model, we found that
   Visual, auditory, and olfactory experiences have a complete, mediating
   effect on thermal comfort. Explicitly, visual, auditory, and olfactory
   perceptions affect thermal comfort through two mediating variables:
   thermal sensation and psychological cognitions. In turn, thermal
   sensation and psychological cognitions have a direct effect on visitor's
   thermal comfort. Psychological cognitions has the largest direct effect
   on thermal comfort. Quantitatively, a 1-unit increase in psychological
   cognitions produces an increase of 0.601 units in thermal comfort. A
   potential approach is to improve multisensory modalities that affect
   necessary sensory perception and psychological cognitions of visitors.
   The findings of this study provide a valuable reference for the planning
   and design of recreational spaces in humid-hot regions and for the
   studies of outdoor thermal comfort.},

Title = {Impacts of local conservation strategies on forest flora species of the

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Sustainable conservation of forest flora species is dependent on local
   conservation strategies. In the past, fringe communities of the Ambalara
   Forest Reserve were excluded from its conservation. In contemporary
   times, the participation of fringe communities in the conservation of
   forest flora species of the Ambalara Forest Reserve has been
   strengthened due to the Community Resource Management Area (CREMA)
   initiative. This study examines the impact of strategies used by local
   actors such as the land priest (tendaana), sectional heads, chiefs
   (naamene), diviners, women leaders (magazias) and youth groups on forest
   flora species of the forest reserve. The strategies used by local actors
   are taboos, creation of traditional firebelts, revered tree species,
   bans and awareness creation. The study reveals that, fringe communities
   endorse the chiefs (naamene) and the land priests (tendaana) as the most
   effective actors in the conservation of forest flora species of the
   reserve and the traditional fire belt creation as the most effective
   conservation strategy. The study concludes that, there exist local
   management actors and strategies in the conservation of forest flora
   species of the forest reserve, and fringe communities and the reserve
   are impacted positively by means of their engagement in alternative
   livelihood activities and species richness of forest flora species
   respectively. It is recommended that traditional awareness creation
   should be intensified by the chiefs and elders on the need to conserve
   forest flora species of the reserve for future generations and as a form
   of mitigating the effects of climate change on biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is an irreversible and dynamic process which affects the
   availability and quality of ecosystem services (ESs). The link between
   balanced urban growth and ESs is critical for sustainable urban
   development. The study followed pluralist approach for evaluating and
   comparing the land-cover-based economic assessment of sustainable,
   moderately sustainable, and unsustainable cities. The artificial
   intelligence-based future land cover changes were evaluated using
   geographic future land use simulation software with geographic
   information system. A case-specific modification of value coefficients
   for computing ecosystem service value (ESV) was applied on case cities.
   A workable scale was developed by exploring relation of ESs and built-up
   of three extreme cases. The scale has different combinations of ESs and
   built-up from worst to best scenario with related ESV changes for
   optimal utilization of land. The scale helped to assess the spatial
   resource and natural capital balance of any area. The results showed
   that the ideal ratio of ESs and built-up density range for balanced
   sustainable development is between 1.35 and 3.64 with ESVs between INR
   10.00 million/hectare and INR 8.45 million/hectare, respectively. On
   applying the scale, the results showed that only 25\% of the city
   peripheral area comes under ideal range. The study will help urban
   planners in conservation of ESs with economic development for promoting
   sustainable urban development.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, many declarations on sustainable development (SD)
   have been produced, various of which led to no real changes or
   improvements. This article discusses the role of declarations and
   international cooperation on SD, outlining their evolution. It also
   highlights the reasons why instruments and international cooperation
   have failed to meet their targets and specifies measures that may be
   deployed so that they may yield the SD's expected benefits. To this end,
   it is recommended that more significant efforts be made to
   operationalise the commitments established in the declarations and
   international cooperation. Also, it is important to develop and
   implement SD follow-up strategies, once these have been agreed upon. The
   implications of this article to society and other studies are two-fold.
   Firstly, it shows the need for greater care when writing declarations on
   SD, since they are not always followed up and do not fulfill their
   purposes. Secondly, it is important to mobilise the relevant actors so
   that the actions the SD declarations expected to trigger, through
   international cooperation, are implemented. Moreover, future
   declarations and commitments should ideally have institutions and
   infrastructures in place to implement the SD actions called upon. The
   evidence gathered in this article also points out the need to intensify
   investment in education, science, technology, and innovation, while
   encouraging the expansion of international cooperation strategies aimed
   at supporting the declarations and promoting SD.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to assess the sustainability of tourism destinations. To
   this end, various methodologies have been considered, among which
   composite indicators constitutes a valuable tool. A non-compensatory
   methodology has been applied in order to address the problem caused by
   the compensation of low values in certain indicators of a particular
   destination with high scores in other aspects. The proposed methodology
   provides a clear ranking of units and permits a post-optimization
   analysis for the design of strategies with a view to the improvement of
   the relative position regarding the sustainability of a destination. It
   is applied in an island context, for which tourism represents its main
   economic activity and, therefore, its dependence on natural, social,
   economic, and cultural resources, among others, for its development. The
   analysis demonstrates the possibility associated with each destination
   to improve its position, acting in just a single indicator while
   maintaining major values in the remaining indicators, this being a more
   restrictive methodology in sustainability assessment. The originality is
   the methodology being supported by the combination of the
   non-compensatory approach with participative methods to include the
   considerations of the stakeholders throughout the weights in a regional
   initiative in the Caribbean Zone of Sustainable Tourism. The findings
   reveal that the economic aspects receive more importance than those in
   the Cuban context that are social and patrimonial. The method can be
   applied to other destinations and regions, allowing the inclusion of
   external and reducing the absence of incomparability issues in ranking
   destinations supporting managerial decisions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing a shift to earlier spring budburst in
   deciduous temperate trees, which may predispose them to greater risk of
   damage from growing season frosts. Populus tremuloides may be
   particularly vulnerable to growing season frosts, which can defoliate
   entire canopies and damage woody tissue. These growing season frost
   events may shift in frequency under continued climate change and alter a
   disturbance regime that disproportionately impacts deciduous,
   cold-sensitive vegetation. We used Populus tremuloides tree cores from
   14 sites across the montane and subalpine forests of Utah, USA, to
   identify characteristic tree rings, namely `white rings', associated
   with growing season frost damage over the period 1767-2016. Early
   growing season frost was estimated using a frost intensity index using
   local data sourced from 22 long-term weather stations and was correlated
   with white ring occurrence. Over the last 150 years, the frequency of
   white rings was between 5 and 6\% of all years. Growing season frost
   occurrence was similar in northern and southern Utah and highly
   synchronous across stands indicating widespread defoliation. Populus
   tremuloides radial growth declined nearly 40\% during years of
   frost-associated defoliation. Our results highlight a severe disturbance
   that disproportionately impacts Populus tremuloides. Our methods are
   broadly applicable in identifying historical frost-induced defoliation
   in deciduous trees and emphasize the potential for discrete weather
   events to impact tree health},

Title = {Herbivore Dung Promotes Plant Litter Decomposition Rate in a Semi-arid

Abstract = {The decomposition of plant litter and animal dung is the key processes
   of nutrient cycling and has been studied in a wide range of grassland
   ecosystems. However, most studies focus on the separate processes of
   either plant litter or animal dung decomposition, while the interactions
   between these two processes, which occur in grazed grassland ecosystems,
   are rarely studied. We conducted an experiment in a semi-arid grassland
   in Central Inner Mongolia, to examine the mass loss rates and chemical
   composition changes of two plant litter species and three herbivore dung
   types separately or in combination over a 2-year period. Twenty
   litterbag treatments were used to represent 2 treatments of plant litter
   only, 6 treatments of herbivore dung only at two addition levels, and 12
   treatments of litter and dung combinations. We found that horse dung had
   the biggest mass loss rate, followed by cattle dung and sheep dung,
   either separately or mixed with plant litter. Dung addition promoted the
   mass loss, nitrogen release and fiber fraction (hemicellulose, cellulose
   and lignin) loss of plant litter, and the promotion was strongest for
   cattle dung, weakest for sheep dung, and stronger at high dung addition
   levels and in the early stages. However, the effect of litter addition
   on dung decomposition, a negative effect, was significant only when the
   dung proportion was low in the litter and dung mixture (that is, in the
   treatment of 10 g litter + 6 g dung). Furthermore, a significant
   positive non-additive effect of mixing litter and dung on their total
   mass loss was detected for the mixture at a litter:dung ratio of 10:6,
   the ratio in the major grazing area of the grassland. Our findings
   suggest that mixture of herbivore dung with plant litter, as in actual
   grassland ecosystems, promotes litter decomposition, and the composition
   of the litter and dung in mixture, though it may inhibit dung
   decomposition, due to the changes in chemical stoichiometry of
   decomposing materials and biophysical microenvironment by the mixing. It
   is necessary to incorporate the non-additive effect of litter and dung
   mixture in modeling carbon and nutrient cycling of grassland ecosystems.},

   deep time remains unknown. Populations are dynamic entities, yet their
   representation in the fossil record is a static snapshot of often
   isolated individuals. Here, we apply for the first time contemporary
   integral projection models (IPMs) to fossil data to link individual
   development with expected population variation. IPMs describe the
   effects of individual growth in discrete steps on long-term population
   dynamics. We parameterize the models using modern and fossil data of the
   planktonic foraminifer Trilobatus sacculifer. Foraminifera grow by
   adding chambers in discrete stages and die at reproduction, making them
   excellent case studies for IPMs. Our results predict that somatic growth
   rates have almost twice as much influence on population dynamics than
   survival and more than eight times more influence than reproduction,
   suggesting that selection would primarily target somatic growth as the
   major determinant of fitness. As numerous paleobiological systems record
   growth rate increments in single genetic individuals and imaging
   technologies are increasingly available, our results open up the
   possibility of evidence-based inference of developmental plasticity
   spanning macroevolutionary dynamics. Given the centrality of ecology in
   paleobiological thinking, our model is one approach to help bridge
   eco-evolutionary scales while directing attention toward the most
   relevant life-history traits to measure.},

Title = {Eyes on the aliens: citizen science contributes to research, policy and
   management of biological invasions in Europe},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are a key driver of global biodiversity
   loss. Reducing their spread and impact is a target of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDG target 15.8) and of the EU IAS Regulation
   1143/2014. The use of citizen science offers various benefits to alien
   species' decision-making and to so-ciety, since public participation in
   research and management boosts awareness, engagement and scientific
   literacy and can reduce conflict in IAS management. We report the
   results of a survey on alien species citizen science initiatives within
   the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology
   (COST) Action Alien-CSI. We gathered metadata on 103 initiatives across
   41 countries, excluding gen-eral biodiversity reporting portals,
   spanning from 2005 to 2020, offering the most comprehensive account of
   alien species citizen science initiatives on the continent to date. We
   retrieved information on project scope, policy relevance, engagement
   methods, data capture, data quality and data management, methods and
   technologies applied and performance indicators such as the number of
   records coming from projects, the numbers of participants and
   publications. The 103 initiatives were unevenly distributed
   geographical-ly, with countries with a tradition of citizen science
   showing more active projects. The majority of projects were contributory
   and were run at a national scale, targeting the general public, alien
   plants and insects, and terrestrial ecosystems. These factors of project
   scope were consistent between geographic regions. Most projects focused
   on collecting species presence or abundance data, aiming to map presence
   and spread. As 75\% of the initiatives specifically collected data on
   IAS of Union Concern, citizen science in Europe is of policy relevance.
   Despite this, only half of the projects indicated sustainable funding.
   Nearly all projects had validation in place to verify species
   identifications. Strikingly, only about one third of the projects shared
   their data with open data repositories such as the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility or the European Alien Species Information Network.
   Moreover, many did not adhere to the principles of FAIR data management.
   Finally, certain factors of engagement, feedback and support, had
   significant impacts on project performance, with the provision of a map
   with sightings being especially beneficial. Based on this dataset, we
   offer suggestions to strengthen the network of IAS citizen science
   projects and to foster knowledge exchange among citizens, scientists,
   managers, policy-makers, local authorities, and other stakeholders.},

Title = {Distribution and pathways of introduction of invasive alien plant
   species in Romania},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},

Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the main drivers of modern human-induced
   species losses. Research on the distribution of alien species and their
   pathways of introduction is essential for understanding and tackling the
   invasion process. A comprehensive overview on invasive alien plant (IAP)
   species in Romania is lacking. With this paper, we aim to contribute to
   filling this gap and to provide a visualization of national patterns
   regarding plant species invasions, geographical origins and pathways of
   introductions. Based on plant species occurrence records in the
   published literature and herbaria we compiled a national database of 102
   invasive and potentially invasive alien plant species. We georeferenced
   42776 IAP species occurrences and performed an analysis of their spatial
   patterns. The spatial analyses revealed a biased sampling, with clear
   hotspots of increased sampling efforts around urban areas. We used chord
   diagrams to visualize the pathway of introduction and geographical
   origins of the IAP species, which revealed that species in Romania
   originate mainly in North and Central America, while the dominant
   pathway of plant introduction was horticulture. Our results provide an
   important baseline in drafting management and action plans, as invasive
   alien plant species represent a priority for the European Union through
   the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and a good starting point for
   various analyses as the database is further developed and regularly
   updated.},

Title = {Words matter: a systematic review of communication in non-native aquatic

Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {1-28},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {How scientists communicate can influence public viewpoints on invasive
   species. In the scientific litera-ture, some invasion biologists adopt
   neutral language, while others use more loaded language, for example by
   emphasizing the devastating impacts of invasive species and outlining
   consequences for policy and practice. An evaluation of the use of
   language in the invasion biology literature does not exist, preventing
   us from understanding which frames are used and whether there are
   correlations between message framing in scientific papers and local
   environmental impacts associated with invasive species. Thus, we
   conducted a systematic literature review of 278 peer-reviewed articles
   published from 2008-2018 to understand communication styles adopted by
   social and natural scientists while reporting on aquatic non-native
   spe-cies research. Species-centered frames (45\%) and human-centered
   frames (55\%) were adopted to nearly equal degrees. Negative valence was
   dominant in that 81.3\% of articles highlighted the negative risks and
   impacts of invasive species. Additionally, the use of terminology was
   found to broadly align with the stage of invasion, in that
   ``invasive{''} was most commonly used except when the research was
   conducted at early stages of invasion, when ``non-native{''} was most
   commonly used. Terminology use therefore enables readers of scientific
   papers to infer the status and severity of ongoing invasions. Given that
   science communication within the peer-reviewed literature affects public
   understanding of research outcomes, these findings provide an important
   point of reflection for researchers.},

Title = {Using spatially-explicit plant competition models to optimise crop
   productivity in intercropped systems},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Intercropping, by capitalizing on positive biodiversity-productivity
   relationships, represents a promising option to increase agricultural
   sustainability. However, the complexity and context-dependency of
   plant-plant interactions can make it challenging for farmers to find
   suitable crop combinations. Furthermore, intercropping is usually
   implemented with standard inter-row spacing and plant densities based on
   monoculture practices, which might not be the ideal configuration to
   maximize yield.
   Here we present a spatially-explicit yield analysis method based on
   plant ecological interaction models that allowed to optimize crop
   species combinations and spatial configurations for maximal yield in
   intercropped systems. We tested this method with three crop species,
   namely oat, lupine, and camelina. In a first step, field experiments in
   which crop density and adjacent crop type were varied provided us with
   indications on which species would compete more with each other. The
   results showed us that oat and camelina strongly competed with each
   other. In addition, the distance experiments allowed us to understand
   how the changes in yield associated with the presence of neighbors vary
   with distance. This allowed us to find the sets of parameters (identity
   of neighbors, sowing density, distances between individuals) that
   optimise intercrop yield (measured as Land Equivalent Ratio {[}LER]) for
   the three considered species. Specifically, we show that alternating
   rows of species led to higher LERs than a homogeneous species mixing,
   and that 3-species combinations are not necessarily more performant than
   the best 2-species combinations. In addition, we show that increasing
   the density of oat is generally beneficial for LER, while increasing the
   density of lupine is not.
   By modelling crop yield from simple and reproducible density and
   distance experiments, our results allow to optimize crop mixtures in
   terms of species combinations and spatial configurations, for maximal
   crop yield. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf

Title = {Effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on soil
   structure and function},

Abstract = {Soils are impacted globally by several anthropogenic factors, including
   chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental
   persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function.
   However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and
   microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored
   the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic
   acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at
   environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week
   microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g(-1) for PFBS) significantly
   increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on
   beta-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS
   concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct
   consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil
   respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this
   effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were
   negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS
   affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and
   certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of
   PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a
   factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in
   terrestrial ecosystem functioning. (C) The Author(s) 2022.},

Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {142-150},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technology is increasingly used in the study
   of nematode biodiversity. However, the annotation difference of commonly
   used primers and reference databases on nematode community is still
   unclear. We compared two pairs of primers (3NDf/C\_1132rmod,
   NF1F/18Sr2bR) and three databases (NT\_v20200604, SILVA138/18s Eukaryota
   and PR2\_v4.5 databases) on the determination of nematode community from
   four different vegetation types in Changbai Mountain, including mixed
   broadleaf-conifer forest, dark coniferous forest, betula ermanii Cham
   and alpine tundra. Our results showed that the selection of different
   primers and databases influenced the annotation of nematode taxa, but
   the diversity of nematode community showed consistent pattern among
   different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary
   to select appropriate primer and database according to the target
   taxonomic level. The difference in primers will affect the result of
   nematode taxa at different classification levels, so sequencing analysis
   cannot be used for comparison with studies using different primers. In
   terms of annotation effect in this study, 3NDf/C\_1132rmod primers with
   NT\_v20200604 database could provide more information than other
   combinations at the genus or species levels. (c) Higher Education Press

Title = {Effect of plant composition on epigeal spider communities in northern
   New Zealand forest remnants},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Te Paki Ecological District (TPED) in northern Northland, New Zealand,
   is well known as an ecologically significant centre of endemism.
   However, due to extensive anthropogenic habitat degradation, native
   forest has been reduced to small, isolated remnants and many of its
   endemic species are threatened with extinction. Epigeal spider
   communities (species living on or near the ground) were surveyed within
   TPED by pitfall trapping at seven native forest remnants differing in
   plant composition and apparent seral stage to investigate how spider
   communities varied within them. Surveys were conducted four times over a
   12-month period coinciding with winter, spring, summer and autumn.
   Changes in spider communities were related to differences in plant
   composition, which were in turn associated with differences in apparent
   seral stage of the vegetation. Spider communities in forests at later
   seral stages were dominated by species such as Rinawa sp., Porrhothele
   sp. and Uliodon sp., whereas Euryopis nana, Cambridgea reinga,
   Stanwellia hollowayi and Hypodrassodes apicus were most prevalent in
   remnants at earlier seral stages. These species could potentially serve
   as useful bioindicators of ecological succession or restoration. Apart
   from soil organic matter content none of the predictor variables tested,
   including plant species richness, were significantly correlated with
   spider richness or diversity. Spider richness and diversity are most
   likely determined by a complex interaction of environmental and temporal
   factors that operate at different spatial scales. This study has
   increased our understanding of the ecological associations of spider
   communities and established that TPED is an important centre of endemism
   for spiders in New Zealand. We have also demonstrated the importance of
   forest remnants as reservoirs of indigenous spider diversity and helped
   resolve several historical taxonomic issues. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   the need for taxonomic research in this region of New Zealand and
   highlight the value of such biodiversity surveys.},

Title = {Native-alien populations-an apparent oxymoron that requires specific
   conservation attention},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {57-74},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Many countries define nativity at a country-level???taxa are categorised
   as either alien species or native species. However, there are often
   substantial within-country biogeographical barriers and so a taxon can
   be native and alien to different parts of the same country. Here, we use
   the term ???native-alien populations??? as a short-hand for populations
   that result from the human-mediated dispersal of individuals of a
   species beyond a biogeographical barrier to a point beyond that
   species??? native range, but that is still within the same political
   entity as parts of the species??? native range. Based on these criteria,
   we consider native-alien populations to be biological invasions.
   However, we argue that, in comparison to other alien populations,
   native-alien populations: 1) are likely to be closer geographically to
   their native range; 2) are likely to be phylogenetically and
   ecologically more similar to native species in their introduced range;
   and 3) options to control their introduction or manage them will likely
   be more limited. We argue this means nativealien populations tend to
   differ from other alien populations in the likelihood of invasion, the
   types of impacts they have, and in how they can be most effectively
   managed. We also argue that native-alien populations are similarly a
   distinct phenomenon from native populations that are increasing in
   abundance or range extent. And note that native-alien populations are
   expected to be particularly common in large, ecologically diverse
   countries with disjunct biomes and ecoregions. Reporting, monitoring,
   regulating and managing native-alien populations will, we believe,
   become an increasingly important component of managing global change.},

Abstract = {We studied the long-term demographic structure of the endangered
   hemiparasitic plant, Schwalbea americana (American chaffseed), in the
   New Jersey Pine Barrens from 1991 to 2020 in order to address important
   questions about its population biology, life history, and responses to
   management. These included the relative contributions of dormancy,
   recruitment, and other life stages to annual population changes, as well
   as its ecological responses to fire, mowing, and other factors over
   time. Following baseline surveys in 1991, we conducted annual censuses
   from 1993 to 2020 and individualistic plant monitoring from 1999 to
   2020. The Schwalbea population initially exhibited positive growth, with
   major increases observed in the early 2000s, followed by steady,
   long-term declines. We used generalized linear models and mixed effects
   models to analyze the relationships between demographic and
   environmental variables at the population and individual levels,
   respectively. Dormant season prescribed burning and mowing yielded
   significant increases in flowering, stems, and survival, with apparent
   residual benefits in subsequent years following repeated treatments.
   Germination declined to 0\% after 4 y in seed viability experiments, and
   recruitment was more strongly correlated with estimated seed bank sizes
   than with flowering alone. Dormant plants represented an average of 21\%
   of the total population, with 20\% of above ground plants entering
   dormancy annually. Most dormancy events (92\%) were 1-3 y in duration,
   indicating that mortality cannot be distinguished from dormancy for a
   minimum of 3 y after disappearance. Annual survivorship was high (mean =
   88\%), with 9\% of individuals surviving 18 y on average, but differed
   significantly by cohort and increased with management. Significant
   differences were observed in size and flowering by age/stage class.
   However, size alone was insufficient to identify Schwalbea recruits from
   older plants, due to overlap of their lower size ranges. Long-term
   declines in survival and recruitment persisted despite suppression of
   woody succession by hand clipping and intermittent mowing and burning.
   Increased frequency of mowing or burning may be needed to sustain this
   population in the future. The relationships of growth and vital rates to
   other factors are provided, and the benefits of individualistic data for
   informing Schwalbea monitoring and management are discussed.},

   the impact of sampling protocol strategies using a data-rich fossil
   record to calculate effective diversity using Hill numbers for the first
   time on Paleogene planktonic foraminifera. We sample 22,830 individual
   tests, in two different size classes, across a 7 Myr time slice of the
   middle Eocene featuring a major transient warming event, the middle
   Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; similar to 40 Ma), at study sites in the
   midlatitude North Atlantic. Using generalized additive models, we
   investigate community responses to climatic fluctuations. After
   correcting for arty effects of fossil fragmentation, we show a peak in
   generic diversity in the early and middle stages of the MECO as well as
   divergent trajectories between the typical size-selected community (>180
   mu m) and a broader assemblage, including smaller genera (>63 mu m).
   Assemblages featuring smaller genera are more resilient to the climatic
   fluctuations of the MECO than those assemblages that feature only larger
   genera, maintaining their community structure at the reference Hill
   numbers for Shannon's and Simpson's indices. These results raise
   fundamental questions about how communities respond to climate
   excursions. In addition, our results emphasize the need to design
   studies with the aim of collecting the most inclusive data possible to
   allow detection of community changes and determine which species are
   likely to dominate future environments.},

Abstract = {This study compares the delta N-15 values and the trophic position of
   two seabird species throughout the late Holocene in three regions in the
   southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess the hypothesis that the decimation
   of megafauna led to changes in the trophic position of mesopredators.
   Modern and ancient mollusk shells were also analyzed to account for
   changes in the isotopic baseline through time. Results revealed that
   modern Magellanic penguins have higher delta N-15 values than their
   ancient conspecifics in the three regions, after controlling for changes
   in the isotopic baseline. This was also true for modern Imperial shags
   compared with ancient unidentified cormorants/shags from the two areas
   where ancient specimens were recovered (southern Patagonia and the
   Beagle Channel). Such temporal variability might be caused by three
   non-mutually exclusive processes: decreased availability of pelagic
   squat lobster resulting from decreasing primary productivity through the
   late Holocene, increased availability of small fishes resulting from the
   sequential depletion of other piscivores (South American fur seal and
   sea lion and Argentine hake) since the late eighteenth century, and
   modification of the migratory patterns of Magellanic penguins. Although
   disentangling the relative contribution of all those processes is
   impossible at this time, the results reported here demonstrate that the
   ecology of Magellanic penguins and Imperial shags has undergone major
   changes since the late Holocene.},

   structure},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-119},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A dramatic shift from carbonate-rich to chert-rich marine strata
   occurred during the Permian and is frequently attributed to the
   increased activity of siliceous sponges and their biosiliceous
   sedimentation. The first-order ecologic consequences of this transition,
   if any, remain opaque. We analyze fossil occurrence data from the
   Phosphoria Basin (western North America) to test whether the presence of
   siliceous sponges, which are correlated with basin-wide chert strata,
   influenced the recruitment of benthic fauna. Using published lithologic
   descriptions, we categorized fossil collections by formation, facies,
   and lithology and used these data to code detrended correspondence
   analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We also
   analyzed the clustering of taxa into faunal units termed biofacies.
   Results from these analyses indicate that fossil collections occurring
   in chert and carbonate are closely associated in faunal composition and
   community structure. These collections preferentially occur in the
   inner- to mid-ramp facies, in agreement with previous studies. Although
   largely similar in composition, collections of chert and carbonate
   lithology exhibit differences in the frequency and abundance of
   accessory brachiopod taxa (e.g., Composita and Hustedia), possibly a
   result of greater biosiliceous sedimentary input.},

Title = {Landscape attributes shape dung beetle diversity at multiple spatial

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Land-use change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss
   worldwide, but its negative effects can vary depending on the spatial
   scale analyzed. Considering the continuous expansion of agricultural
   demand for land, it is urgent to identify the drivers that shape
   biological communities in order to balance agricultural production and
   biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. We used a
   patch-landscape design and a multimodel inference approach to assess the
   effects of landscape composition and configuration at two spatial scales
   (patch and landscape) on the structure of dung beetle assemblages. We
   performed our study in the Caatinga, the largest dry forest in South
   America. We sampled 3,526 dung beetles belonging to 19 species and 11
   genera. At patch scale, our findings highlight the positive relationship
   of forest cover and landscape heterogeneity with dung beetle diversity,
   which are the major drivers of beetle assemblages. Edge density, in
   turn, is a major driver at the landscape scale and has a negative effect
   on beetle diversity. Our results support the hypothesis that landscapes
   combining natural vegetation remnants and heterogeneous agricultural
   landscapes are the most effective at conserving the biodiversity of dung
   beetles in the Caatinga landscapes. Directing efforts to better
   understand the dynamics of dung beetles in agricultural lands can be
   helpful for policymakers and scientists to design agri-environment
   schemes and apply conservation strategies in tropical dry forests. (C)

Title = {Co-flowering plants support diverse pollinator populations and
   facilitate pollinator visitation to sweet cherry crops},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many food crops depend on animal pollination to set fruit. In light of
   pollinator declines there is growing recognition of the need for
   agro-ecosystems that can sustain wild pollinator populations, ensuring
   fruit production and pollinator conservation into the future. One method
   of supporting resident wild pollinator populations within agricultural
   landscapes is to encourage and maintain floral diversity. However,
   pollinator visitation to crop plants can be affected either positively
   (facilitation) or negatively (competition) by the presence of
   co-flowering plants. The strength and direction of the
   facilitative/competitive relationship is driven by multiple factors,
   including floral abundance and the degree of overlap in pollinator
   visitation networks. We sought to determine how plant-pollinator
   networks, within and surrounding sweet cherry (Prunus avium) orchards,
   change across key time points during the cherry flowering season, in
   three growing regions in Australia. We found significant overlap in the
   suite of flower visitors, with seven taxa (including native bees, flies,
   hoverflies and introduced honey bees, Apis mellifera) observed visiting
   cherry and other co-flowering species within the orchard and/or the
   wider surrounding matrix. We found evidence of pollinator facilitation
   with significantly more total cherry flower visits with increasing
   percent cover of co-flowering plants within the wider landscape matrix
   and increased visitation to cherry by honey bees with increasing
   co-flowering plant richness within the orchard. During the cherry
   flowering period there was a significant positive relationship between
   pollinator richness on cherry and pollinator richness on co-flowering
   plants within the orchard and the area of native vegetation surrounding
   orchards. Outside of the crop flowering season, co-flowering plants
   within the orchard and wider landscape matrix supported the same
   pollinator taxa that were recorded visiting cherry when the crop was
   flowering. This shows wild plants help support the pollinators important
   to crop pollination, outside of the crop flowering season, highlighting
   the role of co-flowering plants within pollinator-dependent cropping
   systems. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Invasive round goby shows higher sensitivity to salinization than native
   European perch},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {23-38},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Salinity is an influential abiotic environmental factor in aquatic
   species, specifically in freshwater, where salinization causes ecosystem
   degradation. Secondary salinization, that is increases in salinity due
   to an-thropogenic activities, can affect both osmoregulation and
   behaviour in freshwater fishes. It is generally believed that invasive
   species handle climatic change and environmental degradation better than
   native species, which is one reason for their invasion success. However,
   how invasive and native species cope with salinity changes remains
   little understood. Therefore, we investigated how low (500 mu S/cm) and
   high salinity (2000 mu S/cm) conditions affected oxygen consumption and
   behaviour in the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the
   native European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Our results showed that in
   round goby oxygen consumption increased and swimming and non-swimming
   movements changed in response to salinity increments, whereas European
   perch was not affected by salinity. Thus, it seems as if the invasive
   round goby is more sensitive to changes in salinity than the native
   European perch. Our results fit with the minority of studies indicating
   invasive species being less tolerant than some native spe-cies to
   environmental changes. This finding could be explained by the adaptation
   of round goby to low salinity due to its long establishment in River
   Rhine. Further, our results are also confirming that the effect of
   salinity is species-specific. In addition, European perch and round goby
   show diametrically different behavioural response to disturbance which
   could be an effect of holding different ecological niches as well as
   their anatomical differences.},

Title = {Exploring trade-offs in agro-ecological landscapes: Using a
   multi-objective land-use allocation model to support agroforestry
   research},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {103-119},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Finding the optimal land allocation for providing ecosystem services,
   conserving biodiversity and maintaining rural liveli-hoods is a key
   challenge of agricultural management and land-use planning. Agroforestry
   has been widely discussed as a sus-tainable land-use solution and as one
   strategy to improve the provision of multiple ecological and economic
   functions in agricultural landscapes. In this study, we use the backdrop
   of agroforestry research to evaluate a method from the multi-criteria
   decision analysis toolbox: robust multi-objective optimization. The key
   feature of this modelling approach is its capacity to integrate
   uncertain ecological and socio-economic data. We illustrate the
   optimization model with a case study from eastern Panama, showing how
   the model can bring together scientific and practical knowledge to
   provide potentially desirable land-scape compositions from the
   perspective of farmers, a public perspective, and a compromise solution.
   Example results of our case study show how to assess whether
   agroforestry is a desirable component in a landscape composition to
   satisfy multiple objectives of different interest groups. Furthermore,
   we use the model to demonstrate how different objectives influence the
   optimal area share and type of agroforestry. Due to its parsimonious
   nature, the model could be used as a starting point of an interactive
   co-learning process with decision-makers, researchers and other
   stakeholders. The model, however, is not yet suit-able for an exact
   prediction of future land-use dynamics, for questions of spatially
   explicit land-use configuration, studies going beyond the regional scale
   or for socio-economic interactions of agents. Therefore, we outline
   future research needs and recom-mendations for other types of models or
   hybrid approaches.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Title = {Increasing habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes as a weed
   management strategy reconciling ecology and agronomy},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {116-130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While studies have explored how habitat amount drives weed assemblages
   in agroecosystems, knowledge remains limited of the effects of habitat
   connectivity. The response-effect trait framework provides insights into
   the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between landscape structure
   and the taxonomic diversity and abundance of weed assemblages. This
   study evaluated how habitat connectivity and habitat amount affect weed
   diversity and abundance in winter cereal fields, and whether these
   effects are driven by the functional composition of weed assemblages. We
   sampled weeds in 27 winter cereal fields. We measured habitat
   connectivity and habitat amount provided by wooded, grassland and
   cropland elements. We selected five traits related to the dispersal,
   establishment, and competitive abilities of weed species likely to
   respond to landscape structure: seed number per plant, type of
   reproduction, seed dry mass, plant vegetative height and seed
   germination rate. The functional composition of weed assemblages was
   assessed using community weighted mean trait values. Weed diversity and
   abundance were used as proxies of weed management. The taxonomic
   approach did not reveal any effect of landscape structure on weed
   diversity and abundance. Only the grassland elements that contributed to
   habitat connectivity, and to a lesser extent to habitat amount, drove
   the functional composition of weed assemblages. High habitat amount
   favoured species with many seeds, while high habitat connectivity
   favoured species with fewer seeds, a higher ability to reproduce
   vegetatively and higher seed germination rates. In turn, higher seed
   germination rates increased weed evenness and reduced weed abundance.
   Some of these relationships were influenced by the presence of rare
   species. Overall, high connectivity provided by grassland elements
   increases weed evenness and reduces weed abundance by shaping weed
   functional composition. Our study suggests that land-use planning
   policies that enhance the connectivity provided by grassland elements
   could be considered as a weed management strategy reconciling ecology
   and agronomy.

Title = {Landscape- and time-dependent benefits of wildflower areas to
   ground-dwelling arthropods},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {44-58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wildflower areas are a popular agri-environment scheme to counteract
   agro-biodiversity loss. Yet, their benefits are controversially
   discussed. Since inconsistent benefits may be owed to landscape context
   and temporal dynamics, we applied a multiyear study to unravel effects
   of permanent and transient habitats on ground-dwelling arthropods in
   wildflower areas and cereal fields.
   Across three consecutive years, we studied activity density, species
   richness and community composition of rove beetles, carabid beetles and
   spiders in ten pairs of wildflower areas and cereal fields along
   independent gradients of proportions of permanent semi-natural habitats
   or transient wildflower areas.
   Arthropod responses to the proportions of permanent semi-natural
   habitats often followed a hump-shaped pattern, whereas transient
   wildflower areas seemed to drive linear responses. An interactive effect
   on rove beetle richness in wildflower areas implies that benefits were
   highest either at intermediate proportions of permanent semi-natural
   habitats or at lower proportions, but with additional availability of
   transient wildflower areas or in landscapes with low proportions of
   permanent semi-natural habitats, but high proportions of wildflower
   areas. However, ground-dwelling arthropod activity density or species
   richness did not systematically increase over the three study years.
   Our results suggest that both permanent and transient habitats differ in
   how they affect biodiversity, possibly due to different temporal
   continuity and resource diversity. Benefits of permanent semi-natural
   habitats seemed highest at an equilibrium between an increasing
   resource-related species pool and an increasing diversity dilution,
   whereas benefits of transient wildflower areas seemed to increase with
   resource complementarity and connectivity at the landscape scale.
   Nevertheless, both habitats seem to complement each other and considered
   in concert, seem to be most effective in promoting benefits of
   wildflower areas to ground-dwelling arthropods at intermediate landscape
   complexity. The substantial variation in diversity patterns among years
   with weather extremes, suggests that optimizing benefits of wildflower
   areas requires further multi-year studies. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Abstract = {Circular economy (CE), which has emerged with the integration of
   environmental science and sustainable development, has a significant
   contribution to human development and is a constantly developing concept
   that can be measured at the country, region, city, or enterprise level.
   Evaluating the CE performances of the European Union (EU) member
   countries at specific periods is crucial for monitoring their
   development. This study bridges the gap in the literature in terms of
   the method, dataset, and comparative analysis used while measuring the
   CE performances, and this is one of the first studies to look at the
   importance weights of CE criteria. In this study, a novel approach is
   proposed to evaluate the CE performances of EU member countries. The
   evaluation criteria are based on the European Commission CE monitoring
   framework in the proposed approach. The importance weights of criteria
   are determined using the fuzzy Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique
   (SMART) approach. The EU member countries are ranked according to their
   CE performances with the Combinative Distance-Based Assessment (CODAS)
   method considering the weights of the evaluation criteria. The proposed
   evaluation approach is applied by taking 2014, 2016, and 2018 years data
   into account. As a result of the application, according to the CE
   efficiency, the top five countries are the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
   Belgium, France, and Germany. The study's findings can assist
   researchers and policymakers in gaining a better understanding of
   countries' CE performance levels.},

Abstract = {Human disturbances to soils can lead to dramatic changes in soil
   physical, chemical, and biological properties. The influence of
   agricultural activities on the bacterial community over different orders
   of soil and at depth is still not well understood. We used the concept
   of genoform and phenoform to investigate the vertical (down to 1 m
   depth) soil bacterial community structure in paired genosoils
   (undisturbed forests) and phenosoils (cultivated vineyards) in different
   soil orders. The study was conducted in the Hunter Valley area, New
   South Wales, Australia, where samples were collected from 3 different
   soil orders (Calcarosol, Chromosol, and Kurosol), and each soil order
   consists of a pair of genosoil and phenosoil. The bacterial community
   structure was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA.
   Results showed that bacterial-diversity decreased with depth in
   phenosoils, however, the trend is less obvious in genoform profiles.
   Topsoil diversity was greater in phenosoils than genosoils, but the
   trend was reversed in subsoils. Thus, cropping not only affected topsoil
   bacteria community but also decreased its diversity in the subsoil.
   Bacterial community in topsoils was influenced by both soil orders and
   soil forms, however, in subsoils it was more impacted by soil orders.
   Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates revealed that cropping
   increased the similarity of bacterial structures of different soil
   orders. This study highlighted the strong influence of agricultural
   activities on soil microbial distribution with depth, which is
   controlled by soil order. (C) Higher Education Press 2020},

Abstract = {In well-established flowering plant invasions, floral phenotypes that do
   not attract pollinators are predicted to be eliminated through natural
   selection. We explored this hypothesis in the invasive plant species
   Scotch broom ( Cytisus scoparius), which has yellow flowers frequented
   by a diverse community of bee species, as well as red-tinged flowers
   that are predicted to be pollinated at a significantly lower rate. We
   predicted that plants with the red-flower phenotype will have fewer
   flowers visited, produce fewer seed pods per flower, and produce fewer
   seeds per pod than the yellow-flowered type. To investigate this, we
   measured the proportion of flowers pollinated for red- and
   yellow-flowered phenotypes, observed the number of seed pods produced
   per flower, and counted seeds per pod. Although we found lower
   pollination in the red-flowered phenotype, we did not see differences in
   female fitness. Scotch broom is an invader predicted to be limited in
   fecundity by the rate of pollinator visits and would be expected to lose
   phenotypes that attract fewer pollinators. We found the persistence of a
   less-attractive phenotype, likely because the reduction in male fitness
   is not paired with a reduction in female fitness.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Responses of Wintering Bald Eagles to Changes in Salmon
   Carcass Availability in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},

Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {307-316},

Abstract = {Each winter, thousands of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from
   across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed
   on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta).
   However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are
   reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source
   for eagles. The ability of eagles to adjust to these impacts is crucial
   to their survival, and their responses are currently unknown. I
   hypothesized that eagles are responding by redistributing to non-river
   habitat in search of alternative food sources. Specifically, I examined
   the redistribution of over-wintering eagles from river habitat to nearby
   agricultural areas in response to seasonal declines in carcass
   availability. Over two consecutive winters, I conducted weekly eagle
   surveys on a 30-km stretch of the Nooksack River and a 22.5-km stretch
   of farmland northwest of the river. I examined the association between
   salmon carcass distribution and eagle abundance on the Nooksack River,
   and evaluated the temporal relationship between eagle abundance on the
   Nooksack River versus neighboring farmland. I found a strong negative
   association between eagle abundance on the river versus adjacent
   farmland, and observed eagles primarily concentrated near dairy farms
   and waterfowl rafts. My results suggest that eagles are responding to
   declining carcass availability by redistributing to non-river habitat in
   search of alternative food sources, and that a substantial fraction may
   migrate to agricultural areas.},

Abstract = {Bergmann's rule predicts a larger body size for endothermic organisms in
   colder environments. The contrasting results from previous studies may
   be due to the differences in taxonomic (intraspecific, interspecific and
   community) and spatial (latitudinal vs elevational) scales. We compared
   Bergmann's patterns for endotherms (Aves) and ectotherms (Lepidoptera:
   Sphingidae) along the same 2.6 km elevational transect in the eastern
   Himalayas. Using a large data spanning 3,302 hawkmoths (76
   morpho-species) and 15,746 birds (245 species), we compared the patterns
   at the intraspecific (hawkmoths only), interspecific and community
   scales. Hawkmoths exhibited a positive Bergmann's pattern at the
   intraspecific and abundanceweighted community scale. Contrary to this,
   birds exhibited a strong converse Bergmann's pattern at interspecific
   and community scales, both with and without abundance. Overall, our
   results indicate that incorporation of information on intraspecific
   variation and/or species relative abundances influences the results to a
   large extent. The multiplicity of patterns at a single location provides
   the opportunity to disentangle the relative contribution of
   individualand species-level processes by integrating data across
   multiple nested taxonomic scales for the same taxa. Wesuggest that
   future studies of Bergmann's patterns should explicitly address
   taxonomic and spatial scale dependency, with species relative abundance
   and intraspecific trait variation as essential ingredients especially at
   short elevational scales.},

Abstract = {Subterranean rodents can act as ecosystem engineers by shaping the
   landscape due to soil perturbation and herbivory. At the same time,
   their burrow density is affected by environmental conditions, vegetation
   and anthropogenic factors. Disentangling this complex interplay between
   subterranean rodents and their environment remains challenging. In our
   study, we analysed the interplay of abiotic conditions, vegetation
   patterns and human land-use and the burrow density of the giant root-rat
   (GRR; Tachyoryctes macrocephalus), a subterranean rodent endemic to the
   Afroalpine ecosystem of the Bale Mountains in south-east Ethiopia.
   Specifically, we examined the effects of GRR on plant species richness
   and vegetation cover and vice-versa, and how these reciprocal effects
   might be modulated by temperature, habitat wetness and grazing. Our
   results showed that increasing GRR burrow density led to decreased
   vegetation cover, and that effects of GRR on vegetation cover were
   slightly stronger than vice -versa. Considering the reciprocal causation
   models, we found that increasing plant species richness led to increased
   GRR burrow density, while GRR burrow density decreased as vegetation
   cover increased. Increases in habitat wetness and livestock grazing
   intensity also directly led to increased GRR burrow density. Our results
   stress the importance of subterranean ecosys-tem engineers on vegetation
   and highlight the vulnerability of these complex interactions to human
   activity.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Microclimate influences plant reproductive performance via an
   antagonistic interaction},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {13-29},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climatic conditions can influence plant reproduction directly, but also
   via changes in plant traits, interactions with animals, and the
   surrounding environment. Such indirect effects can often be complex and
   involve multiple steps including climatic effects on interacting
   species, and on the context in which these interactions occur. The joint
   effects of climatic variation and indirect effects in terms of
   plant-animal interactions have sometimes been assessed at larger spatial
   scales. However, less is known about how microclimatic variation affects
   within-population variation in reproductive performance, in spite of
   that it is becoming increasingly clear that variation in climatic
   conditions can occur over very short distances. We studied the direct
   and indirect effects of microclimate on withinpopulation variation in
   reproductive performance of the plant Gentiana pneumonanthe in presence
   of the myrmecophagous and seed predator butterfly Phengaris alcon. We
   found that microclimatic effects on plant performance were mainly
   indirect, and that effects of temperature and moisture were interactive.
   The number of seeds per flower of G. pneumonanthe decreased in cold and
   moist microsites, and these effects were mediated by an increased
   oviposition by P. alcon in these microsites. The effects of soil
   temperature and moisture on the incidence of oviposition and plant
   performance were mediated by effects on plant phenology, density and
   phenology of neighbouring host plants, and host ant abundance. Plants
   that flowered earlier and where host ants were more abundant, and
   especially plants surrounded by fewer and later-flowering neighbours,
   produced fewer seeds per flower because of a higher incidence of
   oviposition. Our results demonstrate that effects of microclimatic
   variation on plant reproductive performance can be mostly indirect and
   largely mediated by species interactions. These findings highlight that
   among individual variation in small-scale environmental conditions
   within populations can cause variation in individual plant performance
   through multiple pathways. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A review of global trends in the study types used to investigate bee
   nesting biology},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nesting resources are key inputs for the survival and reproduction of
   bees. However, relatively little work has been done on threats bees face
   from a nesting-biology perspective, with most studies focusing on floral
   resources. Much of what is known about bee nesting is thought to come
   from opportunistic observations within descriptive, natural history
   studies, but the relative contribution of these and ecological or
   artificial experimental studies remains unquantified. Via a systematic
   literature search, we quantified the contribution of different study
   types to our current knowledge on bee nesting biology and how bees face
   threats related to their nesting habits. From 2000 screened articles, we
   found that all study types contributed to our total knowledge in
   complementary ways. Natural history studies constituted most studies
   (\~{} 60\%) and were the primary study type investigating specific nest
   site characteristics, nest architecture, and nesting behavior.
   Conversely, ecological studies (27\%) provided more information about
   threats bees face, while artificial experimental studies (13\%)
   predominantly tested mechanisms or highly-specific behaviors.
   Ground-nesting species were underrepresented in all study types (33\%),
   especially in ecological and artificial experimental studies. Overall,
   natural history studies form the foundation of our knowledge on bee
   nesting, and ecological and artificial experimental studies enable us to
   extend and test related hypotheses in rigorous frameworks. Future work
   will benefit greatly from efforts to synthesize and standardize
   measurements and methods both within and across these study types,
   enabling a more comprehensive assessment of threats bees face and more
   effective management and conservation. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {We investigated the effects of the areal proportion, spatial
   distribution and plant composition (quality) of flower strips in
   agricultural landscapes on the size of honeybee colonies using
   individual-based models (BEESCOUT, BEEHAVE). For this purpose, we
   developed 25 landscape scenarios for an intensively used landscape (3 x
   3 km) in Havelland (Brandenburg, Germany). In the scenarios, we varied
   areal proportion (0.22-1.04\%), distribution (clustered vs. even) and
   quality (high vs. low pollen and nectar supply) of flower strips. Then,
   we simulated the response of honeybee colony size to the landscape
   scenarios over twelve years with 100 repetitions per scenario. Colony
   size increased with increasing areal proportion and more even
   distribution of flower strips. However, this was only true for flower
   strips of high quality, whereas low-quality flower strips did not
   benefit the honeybee colonies. Our approach can help to pinpoint optimal
   quality, areal proportion and distribution of additional food sources
   for honeybees provided by flower strips in agricultural landscapes.(c)

Title = {Proximity to wildflower strips did not boost crop pollination on small,
   diversified farms harboring diverse wild bees},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The yield of many agricultural crops depends on pollination services
   provided by wild and managed bees, many of which are experiencing
   declines due to factors such as reductions in floral resources. Thus,
   improving pollinator habitat on farmlands using management strategies
   like planting wildflower strips is vital for wild bee conservation and
   sustainable crop pollination. Yet, few studies have examined whether and
   at what spatial scales wildflower strips enhance crop pollination and
   yields, and most research has been conducted in large-scale commercial
   agriculture. Therefore, we investigated the effects of wildflower strips
   on crop pollination on small, diversified farms (i.e., those growing a
   variety of crop species) where wild bee diversity and abundance is
   predicted to be comparatively high. Over three years, on four
   diversified farms in Montana USA, we tested the hypothesis that distance
   (20, 60, and 180 m) of crops from native perennial wildflower strips
   planted alongside crop fields affected wild bee visitation, pollination,
   and yields of squash and sunflower crop plants. We found that distance
   to wildflower strips did not affect bee visitation or pollination in
   crops. Squash yield was pollen-limited in the growing season prior to
   wildflower strip establishment, and in one of the two years after
   wildflower strip establishment, but proximity to wildflower strips did
   not influence the magnitude of pollen limitation. Sunflower seed
   production was not pollen-limited in any year. Our findings demonstrate
   that even on diverse farms with wildflower strips and a demonstrated
   high diversity of bees, some crops do not necessarily receive maximum
   pollination, regardless of distance from the wildflower strips. However,
   the value of wildflower strips for supporting wild bee diversity, and
   other ecological or economic benefits, needs consideration for a full
   understanding of this pollinator habitat management strategy. (C) 2022

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {33-43},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biological invasions are a growing threat to biodiversity. The control
   and eradication of exotic species established in earnest are of limited
   success despite high financial investments. Anticipating biological
   invasions based on species' suitabilities is a cost-effective strategy
   given it helps identifying areas where exotic species can prosper, which
   can then translate in improving management and conservation efforts.
   Based on information from 191 invasive angiosperm species worldwide, we
   used ecological niche models to identify areas at high risk of invasion
   (cumulative predicted distribution of invasive species) in Mexico.
   Further, we explored the importance of bioclimatic and human influence
   variables as drivers of the distribution of invasive species and
   analyzed the status of the currently recognized priority conservation
   sites in Mexico. We found that areas with intermediate human activity
   scores had a high risk of invasion. Additionally, we found that many of
   the current priority conservation sites in Mexico had a high risk of
   invasion. Our findings contribute to disentangling the factors that
   drive environment susceptibility to invasions and urge management
   strategies to minimize the impacts of biological invasions in priority
   conservation sites. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Land-use and climate change are considered the major drivers of recent
   insect loss. Orthoptera (hereinafter termed `grasshop-pers') are the
   main arthropod consumers in grasslands and, hence, are important
   elements for supporting ecosystem services. However, for
   intensively-used agricultural landscapes, it is largely unknown to what
   extent both factors have affected grasshopper assemblages in protected
   (nature reserves) and unprotected grasslands. Here, we analysed species
   richness of grasshopper assemblages in protected (n = 14) and
   unprotected grasslands (n = 49) by comparing two surveys-one in 1995 and
   one in 2012-of a landscape with intensive agriculture in the NW-German
   Lowland. The observed changes were associated with the Community
   Farmland Index (CFI) and the Community Temperature Index (CTI) in order
   to disentangle possible effects of land-use and climate change on
   assemblage shifts. Between the two surveys, environmental conditions
   substantially changed. Summer temperatures increased by ?, and
   grasslands suffered from a severe loss of patches. However, the latter
   only occurred in unprotected grasslands. Here, 35\% of the patches were
   converted to other biotope types, in particular maize fields as a result
   of the expansion of bioenergy-crop cultivation. In the grasslands still
   existing in 2012, irrespective of its protection status, species
   richness usually increased, except for species with low dispersal
   ability in unprotected grasslands. By contrast, the development of the
   CFI and CTI clearly varied between the two grassland types. In protected
   grasslands, neither the CFI nor the CTI changed. However, in unprotected
   grasslands, the CFI decreased but the CTI increased. Land-use change has
   led to a biotic homogenisation at the landscape level and within
   unprotected grassland patches. Additionally, our study highlights that
   the legal designation of grasslands as a nature reserve successfully
   prevents the conversion of grasslands. Overall, well-managed grasslands
   in nature reserves play a vital role for the conservation of grasshopper
   biodiversity.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Title = {Habitat quality and surrounding landscape structures influence wild bee
   occurrence in perennial wildflower strips},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {76-86},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Perennial wildflower strips (WFS) are known to have positive effects on
   wild bees in intensively used agricultural landscapes. Little knowledge
   exists, however, about the drivers of wild bee occurrence and if Red
   List species also profit from this agri-environmental scheme (AES).
   Therefore, we studied wild bees on transects along 20 four-to
   five-year-old WFS and in 10 cereal fields without AES (CONTROL sites) in
   differently structured landscapes across Saxony-Anhalt (Germany). In
   addition to local site parameters, we measured parameters of landscape
   structure in a 1 km radius of the WFS and CONTROL sites. The overall
   species richness of wild bees (125 species in total, 23 on average),
   including numerous specialist and Red List species, indicates a high
   attractiveness of perennial WFS sown with 30 native forbs. In CONTROL
   fields, 11 bee species (on average only one) were found. The species
   richness and abundance of wild bees were positively affected by local
   site conditions of the WFS and CONTROL sites, such as the overall number
   of sown and spontaneous forbs, the amount of flower rewards of sown
   forbs available to pollinators (Pollinator Feeding Index), and
   negatively by the cover of grasses. Therefore, seed mixtures of future
   AES should comprise a high diversity of wildflower species relevant as
   pollen sources for wild bees. The share of Red List wild bee species was
   strongly influenced by the landscape context and increased e.g. with
   Shannon landscape diversity and the availability of non-forest woody
   habitats and water bodies in the 1 km surroundings. These results
   suggest that besides the establishment of high-diversity WFS,
   semi-natural habitat structures have to be promoted to preserve rare
   wild bees especially in structurally simple agricultural landscapes. (c)

Title = {Threats to UK freshwaters under climate change: Commonly traded aquatic
   ornamental species and their potential pathogens and parasites},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {73-108},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {The aquatic ornamental industry, whilst providing socio-economic
   benefits, is a known introduction path-way for non-native species, which
   if invasive, can cause direct impacts to native species and ecosystems
   and also drive disease emergence by extending the geographic range of
   associated parasites and pathogens and by facilitating host-switching,
   spillover and spill-back. Although current UK temperatures are typically
   below those necessary for the survival and establishment of
   commonly-traded tropical, and some sub-tropical, non-native ornamental
   species, the higher water temperatures predicted under climate-change
   scenarios are likely to increase the probability of survival and
   establishment. Our study aimed primarily to identify which of the
   commonly-traded non-native ornamental aquatic species (fish and
   invertebrates), and their pathogens and parasites, are likely to benefit
   in terms of survival and establishment in UK waters under predicted
   future climate conditions. Out of 233 ornamental species identified as
   traded in the UK, 24 were screened, via literature search, for potential
   parasites and pathogens (PPPs) due to their increased risk of survival
   and establishment under climate change. We found a total of 155 PPPs,
   the majority of which were platyhelminths, viruses and bacteria. While
   many of the identified PPPs were already known to occur in UK waters,
   PPPs currently absent from UK waters and with zoonotic potential were
   also iden-tified. Results are discussed in the context of understanding
   potential impact, in addition to provision of evidence to inform risk
   assessment and mitigation approaches.},

Title = {Threats at home? Assessing the potential ecological impacts and risks of
   commonly traded pet fishes},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {109-136},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are major drivers of global biodiversity
   loss, and the poorly regulated international pet trade is a source of
   emerging and future invaders. Predictions of the likely ecological
   impacts and risks of such IAS have been significantly enhanced in recent
   years with new metrics, which require application to many more actual
   and potential IAS. Hence, this study assesses the potential ecological
   impacts and risks of two readily available pet trade species: goldfish,
   Carassius auratus, a species with nonnative populations worldwide; and
   white cloud mountain minnow, Tanichthys albonubes, a species with a
   limited invasion history to date. First, we compared the per capita
   feeding rates of these non-native species with two European trophically
   analogous natives - the stone loach, Barbatula barbatula, and the common
   minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus - using the Comparative Functional Response
   method. Second, we used foraging experiments in conspecific pairs to
   determine synergistic, neutral or antagonistic intraspecific
   interactions. Third, we performed novel object experiments using the two
   pet trade species to assess boldness, a known ``dispersal enhancing
   trait{''}. Goldfish had the highest maximum feeding rates of the four
   species, while white cloud mountain minnows had the lowest. Neutral
   interactions were observed for all four species in the paired foraging
   experiments, with goldfish having the highest consumption and white
   cloud mountain minnows having the lowest. Goldfish demonstrated greater
   boldness, being more active during the experimental trials and more
   likely to approach a novel object than white cloud mountain minnows.
   Further, combining maximum feeding rates, boldness and species
   availabilities from our survey of pet shops, we assessed the relative
   invasion risks (RIR) of the two non-natives. This highlighted goldfish
   as the higher risk and most worthy of management prioritisation,
   mirroring its more extensive invasion history. We propose that such
   metrics have potential to direct future IAS policy decisions and
   management towards the ever-increasing rates of biological invasions
   worldwide.},

Title = {Genetic and morphological evidence indicates the persistence of Japanese
   mitten crab mitochondrial DNA in Europe for over 20 years and its
   introgression into Chinese mitten crabs},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},

Abstract = {Cryptic biological invasions are largely unrecognised, leading to an
   underestimation of the number of invading taxa and their potential
   impacts. The Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, is a highly
   invasive species with serious economic and ecological impacts in Europe.
   Recently, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the Japanese mitten crab, E.
   japonica, has been discovered in populations from The Netherlands,
   Poland and Germany, but the taxonomic status and time of introduction of
   specimens carrying this mtDNA are uncertain. To this end, we
   investigated the morphology and variation of the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of mitten crabs collected in
   central-western Europe between 1998 and 2020. Mitten crabs from Belgium
   harboured a Japanese mitten crab COI haplotype in 33\% to 65\% of
   individuals, even in our earliest samples from 1998. All other studied
   populations carried only Chinese mitten crab COI haplotypes.
   Morphologically, many of the juvenile Belgian mitten crabs showed
   intermediate traitsbetween the two species, while all investigated adult
   mitten crabs, regardless of their mitochondrial haplo-type or country of
   origin, were morphologically assigned to E. sinensis. This intermediate
   morphology of the juveniles and genetic-morphological discrepancy of
   adults suggests that Japanese mitten crabs intro-gressed with Chinese
   mitten crabs, which could have happened both before and after the
   introduction of mitten crabs to Europe. A specific Chinese mitten crab
   COI haplotype, found in Belgium, was previously only known from
   Vladivostok (Russia), where Chinese and Japanese mitten crab hybrids
   naturally occur. This Far East region is, therefore, a plausible source
   for at least part of the mitten crab mitochondrial diversity in Belgium.},

Abstract = {Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora {[}MPR]) is an invasive, nonnative
   plant that has invaded many temperate forests across the eastern United
   States, often outcompeting native plants for sunlight and other
   resources. Herbicides can control MFR, but they can also reduce
   nontarget plant species and threaten aquatic ecosystems. In a black
   cherry-red maple forest in the Erie National Wildlife Refuge in
   Pennsylvania, the US Fish and Wildlife Service introduced prescribed
   goat-browsing as an exploratory control method. In four treatments,
   browsed, browsed/herbicide, cut/herbicide, and an unmanaged reference,
   we evaluated preliminary effects of these treatments on MFR and non-MFR
   herbaceous vegetation. For MFR, the browsed treatment had 56\% lower
   leaf/stem mass ratios and 35\% shorter stem lengths than the reference;
   the leaf/stem ratio in the cut/herbicide treatment was 55\% lower than
   the reference. Stem density was not reduced because goats did not kill
   the MFR plants in this first year of treatment. The herbicide treatment
   had fewer non-MFR plants than the reference treatment. Light levels at
   ground level did not differ among the treatments. Overall, 33\% of trees
   in the browsed treatment were affected by the goats, with 9\% being
   completely girdled; red maple and ironwood were the most commonly
   browsed species. Preliminary results suggest that goats can be an
   effective control for MFR, however long-term success will be best
   evaluated after consecutive treatment seasons. Goats may increase tree
   mortality and shift tree species composition in stands dominated by
   trees with high browsing rates, but effects on diverse stands may be
   less pronounced.},

Abstract = {Dinosaur embryos cause a lot of excitement in the scientific literature
   and are often widely reported because of the general public's interest
   in dinosaur biology. Well-preserved, articulated oviraptorosaur embryos
   in eggs are usually interpreted as representing a stage of development
   close to hatching because of their large size and good level of skeletal
   ossification. Based on this evidence, a recent report suggested that the
   position of the one embryo's head was reminiscent of an avian-like
   hatching position. Here we explore how the developmental stage of
   well-preserved oviraptorosaur embryos can be estimated, rather than
   assumed. This will help in our understanding of their developmental
   biology and its evolutionary consequences. Using quantitative methods
   and comparison with modern crocodilian embryos, we show that all
   articulated oviraptorosaur embryos are small relative to the egg and
   most likely at a stage of development equivalent to around 50\%-60\% of
   the developmental period, that is, not even close to hatching. This
   conclusion is supported by the fact that many elements of the
   crocodilian skeleton are well ossified many weeks before hatching and
   the position of oviraptorosaur embryos' heads was also comparable to a

Title = {A multi-site experiment to test biocontrol effects of wildflower strips
   in different French climate zones},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Sowing of wildflower strips has been integrated in agri-environment
   schemes of several European countries. Their beneficial effects on
   natural enemies of pest insects are well documented but (1) the desired
   spill-over into crop fields has not always been demonstrated, and (2)
   the need to adapt sown mixtures to regional climatic differences has
   been rarely addressed.
   We set up a multi-site experiment in different French climatic regions
   to compare effects of a wildflower strip with a grass mixture and
   spontaneous vegetation. The design included five regions, three to five
   fields per region and the three strip treatments being repeated in each
   field. We tested strip treatment effects on vegetation (plant species
   richness, plant and flower cover) and on natural enemies (hoverflies,
   ladybirds, aphid predation). In a subset, we further analysed the
   spill-over into winter wheat fields including natural enemies and pest
   insects (cereal aphids, leaf beetles).
   The wildflower strip mixture developed well in all regions and increased
   plant species richness and flower cover compared with grass strips and
   spontaneous vegetation. We found a corresponding higher hoverfly
   abundance and aphid predation in wildflower strips that were consistent
   in all regions, whereas ladybird abundance was not affected. A
   significantly higher hoverfly abundance, aphid predation and aphid
   parasitism in wheat fields close to wildflower strips indicated a
   spill-over. No corresponding margin treatment effects were observed for
   aphid and leaf beetle abundance in the field. A multivariate analysis
   comparing the influence of climate and vegetation parameters showed that
   floral cover better explained variation in natural enemy abundance and
   predation than climate. Our results demonstrated that similar mixtures
   of native plants can be used over large climatic gradients to improve
   biocontrol. Further research is needed to improve spill-over into crop
   fields and to obtain consistently strong effects in different climate
   zones. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Abstract = {Status of several large-river darter species is uncertain because of
   difficulties sampling deep-water habitats. We characterized the darter
   (Family: Percidae) community in main and side channel macrohabitats of
   the upper Mississippi River using a small-mesh benthic trawl at sites in
   five navigation pools and a portion of the lower St. Croix River
   encompassing nearly 200 river kilometers in 2016 and 2017. We captured
   six darter species in conjunction with a survey to assess crystal darter
   (Crystallaria asprella) (state endangered) status and estimated density
   (n/700 m(2)) and population size for selected species in navigation
   pools. No crystal darter were collected in 83 trawl tows, including tows
   made at historical crystal darter locations. However, a total of 154
   western sand darter (Atnmocrypta dam) (globally vulnerable) were
   captured with density estimates ranging among pools from 1.0 to 9.6 in
   main channel and 1.0 to 5.0 in side channel macrohabitats. The largest
   population estimate was 33,286 (95\% confidence limit: 17,974-52,725)
   for western sand darter in all side channels in Pool 7. A total of 71
   river darter (Percina shumardi) were captured with zero caught in some
   pools to a maximum mean density of 17.5/700 m(2) in Pool 3. Highest
   population size was 14,829 (8260-25,127) for river darter in the lower
   St. Croix River. A total of 43 logperch (Percina caprodes) and 143
   johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum) were captured but exhibited clumped
   spatial distributions that hindered population estimates. Only three mud
   darter (Etheostotna asprigene) and one slenderhead darter (Percina
   phoxocephala) were captured in deep-water habitats. Crystal darter
   absence supports continued state endangered classification. However, our
   density and population estimates for western sand darter and river
   darter represent the first such estimates for the upper Mississippi
   River and perhaps the world and should be used as baselines for future
   comparisons.},

Abstract = {Increasingly large high-severity wildfires in dry forests of the western
   United States have led to concern about how best to regenerate new
   forests after wildfires. Harvesting fire-killed trees, burning woody
   debris, and tree planting are commonly used reforestation strategies.
   This study evaluated the effects of a novel forest restoration approach
   that involved masticating un-merchantable dead trees and spreading the
   woody debris generated across the site to prevent erosion from the 2007
   Angora Fire in Lake Tahoe, California. Woody material covered 82\% of
   the site after treatment, with an average depth of 6.6 cm, and volume of
   190 tonnes per hectare. We found that this treatment reduced shrub
   regrowth, compared to an untreated area nearby, and that shrub regrowth
   was inversely related to fuel depth. Seven years after the fire, shrub
   cover averaged only 50\% on treated plots compared to 92\% on untreated
   plots. The tallest shrubs averaged 69 cm in height on the treated site
   compared to 114 cm on nearby untreated sites. Tree seedlings planted on
   the treated site averaged 141 cm in height, well above the height of the
   shrubs. Advantages of this approach include controlling erosion while
   reducing drought stress, reducing the potential for weed introduction,
   and reducing the need for herbicide to control shrub competition.
   Although leaving a layer of woody material where new trees have been
   planted does constitute a fire hazard, so too does a vigorous shrub
   layer. Managers should consider and weigh these factors when deciding on
   a postfire reforestation strategy.},

Title = {Threats and benefits of invasive alien plant species on pollinators},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {89-102},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invasive alien plant species are usually disliked due to their high
   pressure on native communities. However, their ecological effects on
   pollinators are complex: some species provide abundant floral resources,
   boosting the number of pollinators, while they often disrupt
   plant-pollinator interactions by outcompeting native plants. Our direct
   knowledge is mainly based on singlespecies studies, while understanding
   the mechanism of these complex ecological interactions needs
   multi-species field-based approaches. It is also imperative to clarify
   the pros and cons of invasive plants and drivers of invasion from the
   perspective of pollinators. We conducted a standard protocol-driven
   regional study in Central and Eastern Europe, comparing 6-7 invaded and
   non-invaded sites of 12 herbaceous invasive plant species. We sampled
   floral resources, bees, and hoverflies before and during the flowering
   of the invasive plants. We analysed the effects of plant invasion at the
   invasive plant species level and in combined analyses, and tested
   whether the life span (perennial vs. annual) and flowering time (early-,
   middle-, and late-flowering) of invasive plants affect the abundance,
   species richness, diversity and species composition of native plants and
   pollinators. The combined analyses showed lower abundance and species
   richness of flowering plants and pollinators before, and higher
   abundance of both during the flowering of invasive plants in invaded
   sites. However, invasive plants had significant speciesspecific effects.
   Perennial invasive plants had a stronger negative impact on floral
   resources and pollinators already before their flowering compared to
   annuals. Flowering time of invasive plants affected the pollinator
   guilds differently. We suggest that in certain critical time periods of
   the year, invasive plants might provide the dominant foraging resources
   for pollinators in an invaded ecosystem. But, they also often cause
   significant losses in native floral resources over the year. Instead of
   simple eradication, careful preparation and consideration might be
   needed during removal of invasive plants. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Abstract = {Genetic analyses have become increasingly powerful, more readily
   available to biologists, and have made ever more degraded DNA
   potentially useful. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are a
   relatively new ``class{''} of markers that show promise for use with
   degraded or archived samples. We sequenced a panel of 298 SNPs from
   Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tissue in three comparative
   studies to determine the effect of DNA quality at sampling, time in
   archive, and tissue type and preservation method on SNP genotyping
   success using logistic regression. The first study evaluated pristine
   DNA from live adults sampled at three hatcheries and archived up to 6
   years. The second study compared samples from carcasses with varying
   levels degradation (i.e., condition) and archived up to 15 years. The
   third study compared heart and fin samples preserved either in ethanol
   or on paper from carcasses with varying levels of degradation and
   processed within 6 months. Genotyping success for fresh tissue did not
   decline over the 6-year archive period at two of the three hatcheries,
   suggesting sample handling techniques may be more influential than time
   in archive. Genotyping success of archived carcass samples depended more
   on carcass condition than time in archive. Heart tissue genotyped
   consistently more often than fin samples from all but poor condition
   carcasses. Based on these results, we make tissuesampling
   recommendations for different intended purposes. We also provide simple,
   post-collection sample handling procedures that can increase genotyping
   success regardless of tissue or preservation method.},

Title = {Spiders in canopy and ground microhabitats are robust to changes in
   understory vegetation management practices in mature oil palm
   plantations (Riau, Indonesia)},

Abstract = {Conversion of natural habitats to oil palm agriculture has caused
   declines in biodiversity and changes in ecosystem functions. To preserve
   biodiversity we must protect natural habitats, but once oil palm
   plantations are established, developing more -environmentally friendly
   management strategies could support higher levels of within-plantation
   biodiversity and boost the delivery of ecosystem services, possibly
   increasing oil palm productivity. In this study, we use a before-after
   control-impact (BACI) experiment to test whether three understory
   vegetation management strategies affect spider abundance, species
   rich-ness, and species-level community composition in canopy and ground
   microhabitats in mature oil palm plantations. Our treatments encompassed
   the range of current management practices and included heavy
   applications of herbicides to eliminate all understory vegetation,
   maintaining some understory vegetation using business-as-usual herbicide
   applications, and enhancing understory vegetation by not applying any
   herbicides. We focussed on spiders, as they are both biologically and
   economically important in oil palm plantations, owing to their important
   pest control services. We identified more than 1000 spiders,
   representing 20 families and 83 morphospecies. The treatments did not
   affect any aspects of spider biodiversity, although the abundance and
   species richness of canopy-dwelling spiders changed between pre-and
   post-treatment sample periods, independent of treatment. Our findings
   indicate that differences in understory vegetation management practices
   do not affect spiders, or the pest management services that they
   provide, in mature oil palm plantations. As such, more extreme changes
   in management would probably be required to enhance spider biodiversity
   in oil palm plantations in the long-term. Further studies are needed to
   determine the practicalities of such approaches, to assess how changes
   in vegetation management practices affect spiders in additional
   microhabitats, and how the impacts of such approaches vary across the
   20-30 year oil palm commercial life cycle.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Carrion consumption by scavengers is a key component of both terrestrial
   and aquatic food webs. However, there are few direct comparisons of the
   structure and functioning of scavenging communities in different
   ecosystems. Here, we monitored the consumption of 23 fish (seabream
   Sparus aurata) and 34 bird (yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis)
   carcasses on a small Mediterranean island (Isla Grosa, southeastern
   Spain) and surrounding waters in summer to compare the structure of the
   scavenger assemblages and their carrion consumption efficiencies in
   terrestrial and shallow water habitats. Scavenging was highly efficient
   both in marine and terrestrial environments, especially in the presence
   of a highly abundant vertebrate scavenger species, the yellow-legged
   gull. The vertebrate scavenger community was richer in the marine
   environment, whereas the invertebrate community was richer on land. The
   scavenger network was usually well-structured (i.e., nested), with the
   exception of the community associated with fish terrestrial carcasses,
   which were almost monopolized by yellow-legged gulls. In contrast, gulls
   left conspecific carcasses untouched, thus allowing longer persistence
   of gull carcasses on land and their exploitation by a diverse insect
   community. Our study shows important differences in the scavenging
   process associated with environment and carcass type. Promising avenues
   for further eco-evolutionary and applied research arise from the
   comparison of scavenging processes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems,
   from small islands to continents. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Simple and farmer-friendly bumblebee conservation: Straw bales as nest
   sites in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {63},
Pages = {196-205},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many bumblebee species are declining due to a loss of semi-natural
   habitats in agricultural landscapes resulting in diminished forage and
   nest sites. Anecdotal experience indicates that bumblebees nest in straw
   bales, but scientific evidence is lacking. We spent 250 h screening for
   bumblebee nests in 1255 straw bales and ten straw stacks belonging to 58
   farms in two intensively farmed Swedish regions and recorded nests, nest
   traffic, and straw characteristics. We supplemented the straw screening
   with screening of control areas, without straw, that were selected in
   similar environments as the areas with straw. We observed 45 bumblebee
   nests (including potential nests where a single bumblebee flew in or out
   of the straw) of eight species/ species groups, including one
   red-listed, in or directly adjacent to the straw at 26 of the farms.
   Nests were mainly found in partly decayed straw and bales placed
   together. We found no nests in control areas. Based on our results, we
   suggest that straw can be used as an easy, cheap and efficient
   intervention to increase the availability of bumblebee nest sites in
   agricultural landscapes. Considering the costs and benefits of the
   alternatives, we conclude that straw addition has advantages over
   commercial bumblebee colonies for crop pollination purposes and over
   artificial nest boxes for conservation purposes. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Social predation by ants as a mortality source for an arboreal
   gregarious forest pest},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {82-91},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biocontrol of caterpillars by ants is highly variable, and we
   investigate how the strength of the trophic relationship between ants
   and an important outbreaking forest pest depends on phenological
   synchrony and on social foraging. We test the hypothesis that early
   spring foraging by ants, coupled with eusocial recruitment behavior,
   could undermine the caterpillar's strategies to achieve either
   enemy-free space or predator satiation.We use a series of field surveys
   and experiments in trembling aspen stands (Populus tremuloides) in the
   boreal forest of eastern Canada to assess the role of ants in
   early-instar mortality of the outbreaking, gregarious forest tent
   caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria). We also investigate individual-level
   mechanisms related to phenology and social behavior that underlie the
   effectiveness of ants as biocontrol on caterpillars. Our results show
   that ants climb trees early in the spring and harvest young forest tent
   caterpillars, suggesting that early phenology does not provide an
   entirely enemy-free space for caterpillars. Our findings further show
   that recruitment-based social foraging enables ants to deplete groups of
   gregarious prey, suggesting that these eusocial insects are particularly
   effective at generating predation pressure on gregarious herbivores
   since they do not satiate easily. Finally, a manipulative predator
   exclusion experiment confirms that ant predation is a significant
   mortality source for early-instar forest tent caterpillars. Taken
   together, these results suggest that phenology and sociality could
   modulate the role of ants as effective caterpillar predators and thus
   showcase the importance of considering natural history and behavioral
   traits when studying trophic interactions and their role in population
   dynamics. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels in the western US are under-studied compared to their
   eastern cousins, and no western species receive federal protection.
   Mussel distribution throughout Oregon's rivers and streams is poorly
   documented, and there are limited historical records to inform
   assessments of whether, and by how much, current populations may have
   declined. We launched a long-term project to characterize freshwater
   mussel populations throughout the Willamette River basin. Surveys were
   conducted in the mainstem Willamette River and a major tributary, the
   Middle Fork Willamette, during three years. A two-stage sampling process
   was used; transects were surveyed qualitatively, and then 0.25 m(2)
   quadrats were placed randomly in transects for quantitative surveys.
   Mussels visible at the substrate surface were counted using viewing
   scopes and snorkeling, and scuba diving in deeper water. To facilitate
   detection of juveniles (< 3.50 cm long) and calculation of the burial
   factor, some quadrats were double sampled; mussels visible at the
   surface were counted, then the substrate was excavated to a depth of 10
   to 20 cm, and all mussels (surface and buried) were counted and their
   shell length measured. Dense western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata)
   populations were found at all locations, but they differed greatly in
   length class structure, density, and presence of juveniles. Some sites
   also contained small numbers of floaters (Anodonta spp.), and notably, a
   single western ridgemussel (Gonidea angulata) was found in a highly
   urbanized reach. These surveys provide baseline data on the current
   status of several freshwater mussel populations in the Willamette River
   basin.},

Title = {Case Report of Traumatic Rib Fracture in Mammoth from Frenchman

Abstract = {A deformed rib from a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) was found
   among more than 100 mammoth bones excavated from an alfalfa field at the
   Tonnemaker Hill Farm in the Frenchman Hills north of Royal City, Grant
   County, Washington. The mammoth remains were deposited within
   -fine-grained Missoula flood sediments sometime after 16 ka. We
   performed a detailed examination of the rib, including computerized
   tomography imaging, and investigated the possible etiology of the
   deformity. The deformity consists of hypertrophic bone formation
   localized toward the distal (sternal) end of the rib. The circumference
   of the lesion is nearly twice that of the medial circumference of the
   rib diaphysis. This lesion is consistent with an incompletely healed
   fracture or a fracture nonunion with pseudarthrosis (false joint)
   formation. Gross examination and computerized tomography scan images of
   the proximal aspect of the rib, as well as cursory inspection of the
   other skeletal remains, have yet to reveal definitive evidence of other
   bony abnormalities. We surmise, therefore, that this fracture was the
   consequence of blunt force trauma in a healthy animal. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of a rib fracture with incomplete healing or
   false joint formation in a M. columbi individual in the Pacific
   Northwest. We suspect the incidence of rib fractures among M. columbi
   was greater than the Pacific Northwest literature suggests and encourage
   examination of existing collections for evidence of similar findings.
   The incidence and frequency of such injuries may provide insight into M.
   columbi behavior.},

Title = {The importance of foundation species identity: A field experiment with
   lichens and their associated micro-arthropod communities},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {45+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Foundation species provide habitat and modify the availability of
   resources to other species. In nature, multiple foundation species may
   occur in mixture, but little is known on how their interactions shape
   the community assembly of associated species. Lichens provide both
   structural habitat and resources to a variety of associated organisms
   and thereby serve as foundation species. In this study, we use
   mat-forming lichens and their associated micro-arthropods as a miniature
   ecosystem to study potential synergies between foundation species
   diversity and the abundance and functional diversity of higher trophic
   levels. We created lichen patches with monocultures and mixtures of up
   to four species, and extracted Collembola (identified to species level),
   Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Pseudoscorpiones, and Araneae with Tullgren
   apparatuses after 106 days of incubation within a natural lichen mat. We
   found that different lichen species supported different arthropod
   abundances. For 19 out of a total of 55 lichen mixtures and arthropod
   groups, we found non-additive, synergistic effects on arthropod
   abundance, although the specific lichen mixture causing synergistic
   effects differed with arthropod group. In addition, synergistic effects
   on arthropod abundance were more common for arthropod groups at lower
   trophic levels. The functional diversity of lichen mixtures explained
   patterns in Collembola abundance, but in the opposite direction than
   hypothesized because synergistic responses were more frequent in
   functionally similar lichen mixtures. Finally, we found few effects of
   lichen mixture identity or diversity on the functional diversity of
   Collembola communities. When applied to large-scale ecosystems, our
   results suggest that understanding interactions between coexisting
   foundation species and identifying those species that drive synergistic
   effects of foundation species on consumer biota, is likely to be of
   importance to biodiversity conservation and restoration efforts. (C)

Title = {Root allocation and foraging precision in heterogeneous soils},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {25-33},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Root growth patterns respond to small-scale resource heterogeneity and
   the presence of roots of neighboring plants, but how a plant integrates
   its responses to these cues is not well understood. In the presence of
   neighbors, plants may shift allocation to roots as a consequence of
   plant size and root:shoot allometry, as a response to resource depletion
   by neighbors, or through a direct response to neighbor presence. The
   same response pathways also have the potential to alter proliferation in
   resource-rich patches in soil. Four species of grassland plants were
   grown in the greenhouse as single plants, monocultures, and mixtures.
   Root length allocation as a function of shoot mass was examined for
   background soil and fertilized patches. Plants grown with same-species
   neighbors followed the same allometric trajectory as single plants for
   root length in background soil, so any change in root allocation was due
   only to reduced plant size. Root proliferation in patches declined with
   neighbors, consistent with a response to resource depletion. Mixtures
   overproduced roots in both background soil and in patches, relative to
   plants of the same size in monocultures. (c) 2022 The Author. Published

Title = {Comparison of pasture types in the tropical Andes: Species composition,
   distribution, nutritive value and responses to environmental change},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {139-150},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pastoralism is the main land use in the humid tropical Andes of South
   America. Wide areas of mountain rainforest have been cleared for gaining
   pastureland. Due to the lack of indigenous useful grasses in the
   pristine forests, mainly exotic grass species have been used for
   establishing the pastures. In the Ecuadorian Andes, Axonopus compressus,
   Melinis minutiflora, Pennisetum clandestinum and Holcus lanatus are
   common pasture grass species. Their preference for certain microsites
   resulted in a mosaic of different pasture types, which reflect the
   differing ecological conditions on the undulating terrain of the
   mountain slopes. During the last decades, however, another exotic grass
   species, Setaria sphacelata has widely been introduced which, because of
   its fast growth on some of the sites could successfully suppress the
   formerly dominant plant species. With respect to the changing
   microclimate and cattle stocking rates the present study explored,
   whether planting Setaria is the best option for the common low-input
   type of pasture farming in these tropical mountains. In a study over
   twenty years, the development of four main pasture types, dominated by
   the above-mentioned grass species was investigated in areas with and
   without Setaria, and their topographical occurrence on the sloping
   terrain was analyzed. On forty-eight plots a pairwise (with or without
   Setaria) comparison of species composition and diversity, biomass
   production, forage quality and soil properties was performed. Although
   Setaria grows faster than the other grass species, its productivity was
   only higher on flat terrain. The nutritive value of the Setaria plots
   was at best equivalent to that of the former pastures, while species
   richness was consistently lower. Our results suggest the maintenance of
   a terrain-adapted diversification of the pastures and in particular the
   use of Setaria only on flat terrain. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Humid grassland fallows promote spider diversity in a traditionally
   managed landscape},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification is an important driver of biodiversity
   decline. Regarding grassland ecosystems, traditionally managed hay
   meadows, as opposed to highly productive silage grassland, are often of
   high conservation value. Here, we compare spider assemblages among five
   grassland management regimes along an intensification gradient, ranging
   from long-term fallows (not farmed for >= 30 years) via traditionally
   managed hay meadows to high-intensity silage grassland. Humid long-term
   fallows harboured highest species richness and diversity, and their
   assemblages differed strongly from other management regimes. There was
   surprisingly little variation though among different types of hay
   meadows and silage grassland. We also included environmental parameters
   and land-cover types in the surroundings of study sites, indicating that
   spider assemblages were most strongly shaped by fallow-related
   parameters and the proportion of forests. The high spider diversity on
   fallows may result from their undisturbed vegetation structure, while
   management, regardless of frequency, may have detrimental effects. Our
   results demonstrate the high importance of unmanaged areas even in
   regions with an overall low land-use intensity, such as grassland
   ecosystems. We thus recommend the inclusion of temporal grassland
   fallows (unmanaged for 3-5 years) in agrienvironmental schemes to
   increase landscape heterogeneity and preserve spider diversity. (C) 2022

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {50-61},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Weed seed biocontrol by omnivorous mice and insects can limit weed
   seedbanks, but this ecosystem service can be difficult to predict given
   the broad diet breadth of seed predators and their potential for
   intraguild predation. Seed foraging behavior is further modified by
   fluctuating cues of predation risk from higher trophic levels and the
   availability of refuge habitat. Uncertainty about whether co-occurring
   insects and mice additively contribute to weed biocontrol or interfere
   with each other via intraguild predation limits our ability to recommend
   habitat management strategies that reliably promote seed destruction.
   Using seed removal assays, fluorescent powder tracking, and stable
   isotope analyses, we assessed effects of a predation risk cue
   (moonlight) on mouse foraging patterns in a patchwork of vegetated and
   exposed plots in a cultivated field. Mouse foraging activity decreased
   on exposed ground during the full moon, compared to dark nights, yet
   foraging movements were unaffected by moon cycle within refuge patches.
   Weed seed consumption was more than three times higher in cover than
   exposed soil, and 78\% of that difference was attributable to
   invertebrate granivores. Mice and invertebrate granivores both exhibited
   higher foraging activity in cover, indicating co-occurrence of
   intraguild predators and prey. However, stable isotope analyses of fecal
   samples revealed that mice captured in refuge habitats fed at slightly
   lower trophic levels than those in exposed habitats (suggesting minimal
   intraguild predation in refuge habitat), and mouse diet was unaffected
   by moonlight. Despite increased availability of invertebrate prey in
   cover patches, mice do not appear to preferentially exploit prey when
   avoiding their own predators or interfere with weed seed predation.
   Therefore, functional redundancy of mice and invertebrate seed predators
   in cover crops and other refuge habitats may strengthen and stabilize
   weed seed biocontrol. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Limited honeybee hive placement balances the trade-off between
   biodiversity conservation and crop yield of buckwheat cultivation},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {An increasing number of farmland initiatives aim to aid biodiversity
   conservation through alternative farming practices such as
   nature-inclusive farming. However, these approaches frequently lead to
   trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and crop yield. For
   example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a melliferous crop that
   flowers for a long period in the summer when nectar in agricultural
   areas is generally scarce, and buckwheat cultivation could therefore
   contribute to wild pollinator conservation. However, honeybees (Apis
   mellifera) are placed to ensure sufficient crop pollination, which
   potentially increases resource competition with wild pollinators in and
   around the crop. Here, we have studied this trade-off by surveying
   pollinators in and around 16 small-scale (>> 1 ha) flowering buckwheat
   fields and we determined the contribution of pollinator density to crop
   yield in a nature-inclusive farming project. We found that the buckwheat
   pollinator community was diverse, albeit domi-nated by honeybees. We
   found no clear indications of resource competition between honeybees and
   wild pollinators within the buckwheat fields. Honeybee density in the
   surroundings was generally low, and increased minimally during
   honeybee-hive placement. While densities of honeybees decreased
   non-linearly over the day in buckwheat fields, they did not
   (temporarily) move into the surroundings of the field, suggesting
   limited competition for resources with wild pollinators. Crop yield was
   largely dependent on crop pollinator density, notably of honeybees, and
   to a lesser extent crop biomass (as a proxy for agricul-tural
   management). Our results show that buckwheat cultivation fits well
   within nature-inclusive farming if some simple pre-cautionary measures
   are being taken, such as limiting the honeybee-hive densities and
   placing hives only during the main flowering period. The introduction of
   buckwheat cultivation into crop rotation could then contribute to fill
   an important nectar gap in the summer, which potentially boosts wild
   pollinator populations in the long term.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Title = {Climate change impact on Amazonian ant gardens},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Amazonia higher Atlantic sea surface temperatures, greenhouse gasses,
   deforestation and El Nifio events result in the greater frequency of
   severe droughts, although total rainfall has increased due to wetter
   rainy seasons, something confirmed in French Guiana from available
   climatic data (1980-2017). Aiming to study the impact of rainfall on ant
   gardens (i.e., arboreal ant-epiphyte mutualisms that depend on the
   atmosphere for water; AGs) initiated by the ponerine ant Neoponera
   goeldii, we conducted surveys around the Petit Saut and Regina areas
   (mean annual rainfall: approximate to 3,000 mm and approximate to 4,000
   mm, respectively). Each year, near the end of the dry season we recorded
   the number of these AGs in 10 x 5 m sections parallel to the roadsides.
   The Petit Saut survey (1993-2017) revealed that AG density along
   roadsides varied only slightly in ``wet zones{''} situated along
   ditches, whereas in ``dry zones{''} where the soil seasonally dries out
   it dropped sharply during the drastic 1997 dry season. Then, this
   density, low due to recurrent droughts, dropped again during the drastic
   successive 2015-2016 dry seasons. In the Regina survey (2006-2017), we
   had the opportunity to follow the establishment of AGs in a ``dry
   zone{''}. It was represented by a typical sigmoidal curve and then it
   stabilized with AG densities higher than at its peak in 1996 in dry
   zones of Petit Saut, showing the importance of rainfall. Here, too, the
   drastic 2016 dry season adversely affected the AGs. Finally, the
   epiphytic composition of the AGs was mainly represented by Aechmea
   mertensii (a tank bromeliad), Anthurium gracile (Araceae) and Codonanthe
   crassifolia (Gesneriaceae), but AGs with the tank bromeliad are more
   resistant to droughts. These AGs are at risk in dry zones if drastic
   successive dry seasons occur in the future as global warming intensifies
   while those developing in riparian areas might survive. (C) 2022

Title = {Ant taxonomic and functional beta-diversity respond differently to
   changes in forest cover and spatial distance},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {89-102},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Habitat change affects both taxonomic and functional biodiversity, and
   beta-diversity is often used as a metric to describe these changes.
   Furthermore, spatially closer communities tend to have more similar
   species compositions (lower beta-diversity). These changes in community
   composition can be revealed with taxonomic and functional aspects of
   diversity. We assessed the responses of ant taxonomic and functional
   beta-diversity to changes in forest cover and spatial distance. We
   expected that changes in taxonomic and functional beta-diversity along a
   forest cover gradient would be caused by the replacement of open-habitat
   ant species by forest-habitat ant species. We sampled ants within twelve
   landscapes with different forest cover percentages in the southwestern
   Amazon of Brazil. Both taxonomic and functional beta-diversity of
   pairwise samples (OBC) were partitioned into their turnover (OBal) and
   nestedness (OGra) components. Increasing forest cover correlated with
   increases in taxonomic and functional OBC, however, OBal had a greater
   contribution to taxonomic OBC and OGra to functional OBC. Taxonomic OBC
   and OBal and functional OBal increased with spatial distance.
   Forest-habitat species richness increased, and open-habitat species
   richness decreased with increasing forest cover, while the richness of
   habitat-use generalist species did not vary. The loss of environmental
   heterogeneity may be responsible for generalist species dominance and
   open-habitat species presence in less-forested landscapes. This leads to
   great taxonomic replacement, but a nestedness gradient of function.
   Better land use planning is needed to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem
   functions of forest habitats in human-modified landscapes. (c) 2022 The

Title = {Non-crop habitats concurrently drive crop colonization by the millet
   head miner and regulation by natural enemies},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {45-56},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Non-crop habitats, depending on their composition, can enhance the
   abundance and diversity of natural enemies of crop pests, but also at
   the same time provide resources to pests, thereby reducing the effect on
   pest incidence and resulting yield losses. The objective of the present
   study was to test (1) the effect of semi-natural habitats in the
   landscape on crop colonization by pests and natural regulation, and (2)
   the relationship between natural regulation and pest incidence. The
   pearl millet head miner (MHM) was selected as a case study because it is
   a key pest of millet cultivated in traditional pesticide-free tree-crop
   agroforestry systems in which its control mostly relies on the action of
   natural enemies.
   A set of 24 millet fields were selected in a 20x20 km area in Senegal,
   from the analysis of high-resolution satellite images (Pleiades), and
   hypotheses on the relative abundance of semi-natural habitats (here
   trees and rangelands) in the agricultural landscape. Millet fields were
   monitored for pest infestation of panicles and pest natural regulation.
   We used partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-PM) to
   evaluate the relationships between the abundance and diversity of
   semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale, crop colonization, natural
   pest regulation, and pest incidence.
   Panicle colonization by the MHM was generally high (14-92\%) and
   increased with the abundance of trees and to a lesser extent with the
   rangeland area at a 1000 m-radius around millet fields. However,
   regulation provided by natural enemies was amplified by the abundance of
   trees at a local scale (250 m-radius around millet fields). This was
   particularly true at early crop colonization of the MHM with parasitism
   and direct predation on eggs and young larvae. This multi-scale effect
   of semi-natural habitats on crop colonization and natural regulation
   could explain why no clear relationship between crop colonization and
   pest incidence, nor natural regulation and pest incidence, was observed.
   Future studies on the identification of complex species-specific
   interactions between trees and natural enemies should provide a better
   understanding of the ecological processes underlying the performance of
   natural regulation of MHM populations. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Response and effect traits help to understand how changes in ecological
   communities (e.g. in response to land use) relate to changes in
   ecosystem functioning. In grasslands, plants and insect herbivores are
   involved in many ecosystem processes such as herbivory and plant biomass
   production. Simultaneous changes in the trait composition of both plants
   and herbivores should affect herbivory rates, with consequences for
   plant growth and potentially biomass production. The mechanisms
   underlying these links are little understood for grasses and sucking
   insects, which build a major part of grassland communities. In a
   mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the composition of grasses and
   sucking herbivores (Hemiptera) to study the role of plant traits,
   herbivore traits and their interaction on herbivory and plant growth.
   Because sucking herbivory is generally difficult to quantify, we
   developed a novel experimental setting, in which we labelled plants with
   15N isotope. This allowed to quantify 15N uptake and thus sucking rates
   of individuals. We found that herbivory and simultaneous plant growth
   reduction are most strongly linked to herbivore species identity.
   Unexpectedly, herbivory did not increase with herbivore size, but was
   highest for small species and for thin-bodied Heteroptera. Additionally,
   herbivory and plant growth reduction depended on the interacting
   herbivore and plant species, indicating trait matching, which could,
   however, not be explained with commonly used traits. This indicates that
   mechanisms linking ecological communities and ecosystem processes are
   highly context-specific. To understand how global change affects
   ecosystem functioning, studies need to cover all functionally relevant
   groups, including plant sap suckers. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The English sole (Parophrys vetulus, family Pleuronectidae) is an
   abundant ground fish used as a sentinel of marine pollution in the
   inland marine waters of Washington and Oregon. We used 15 microsatellite
   loci to evaluate patterns of genetic variability within and among 17
   collections of sole from coastal sites and within the southern Salish
   Sea. Over 470 alleles were identified in 15 loci, and high levels of
   genetic richness, as estimated by expected heterozygosity (HE) and
   allele richness (AR), were detected. Fish sampled from coastal areas at
   the northern end of our study area had the lowest values of genetic
   richness, in contrast to collections at the southern end. The level of
   differentiation among all collections was low: mean FST value was
   0.0006. Nineteen comparisons had statistically significant FST values
   (mean FST of 0.0029) and involved comparisons involving three locations
   associated with urban areas (Port Gardner {[}Everett, WA], Sinclair
   Inlet {[}Bremerton, WA], and Commencement Bay {[}Tacoma, WA]). A
   statistically significant, but weak, isolation-by-distance pattern was
   seen in the five coastal collections over 1,100 km of coastline. In the
   Salish Sea collections, the pattern of differentiation was patchy and
   marked by several distinctive collections in close proximity to urban
   areas. The pattern of differentiation in the Salish Sea parallels
   differences seen in ecotoxicological characteristics of the English sole
   that inhabit separate urban embayments differing in pollution
   characteristics. Future work can focus on evaluating the stability and
   meaningfulness of this subtle variability in a time of local and global
   environmental changes.},

Abstract = {We examine temporal and spatial variation in morphology of the ammonoid
   cephalopod Discoscaphites iris using a large dataset from multiple
   localities in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of the U.S. Gulf and
   Atlantic Coastal Plains, spanning a distance of 2000 km along the
   paleoshoreline. Our results suggest that the fossil record of D. iris is
   consistent with no within-species net accumulation of phyletic
   evolutionary change across morphological traits or the lifetime of this
   species. Correlations between some traits and paleoenvironmental
   conditions as well as changes in the coefficient of variation may
   support limited population-scale ecophenotypic plasticity; however,
   where stratigraphic data are available, no directional changes in
   morphology occur before the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. This
   is consistent with models of ``dynamic{''} evolutionary stasis. Combined
   with knowledge of life-history traits and paleoecology of scaphitid
   ammonoids, specifically a short planktonic phase after hatching followed
   by transition to a nektobenthic adult stage, these data suggest that
   scaphitids had significant potential for rapid morphological change in
   conjunction with limited dispersal capacity. It is therefore likely that
   evolutionary mode in the Scaphitidae (and potentially across the broader
   ammonoid clade) follows a model of cladogenesis wherein a dynamic
   morphological stasis is periodically interrupted by more substantial
   evolutionary change at speciation events. Finally, the lack of temporal
   changes in our data suggest that global environmental changes had a
   limited effect on the morphology of ammonoid faunas during the latest
   Cretaceous.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of street light shapes and LED color temperatures on
   nocturnal insects and bats},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Street lights are important light sources that contribute to artificial
   light at night (ALAN). To date, ecological impacts of individual LED
   properties (color temperature, dimmability) have been studied, while
   interactions between light properties or aspects of luminaire design
   have not been addressed. However, the design of luminaires can influence
   ALAN impacts as the shape determines the spatial distribution of light
   and its visibility in the environment. This may cause amplifying or
   mitigating effects. We assessed the relative individual and interacting
   effects of two LED luminaire designs and three LED color temperatures
   (1750 K, 3000 K, 4000 K) on nocturnal insect abundance, bat foraging and
   feeding activity. We considered a standard LED luminaire shape with
   focused light emission and a luminaire shape with a diffusor to scatter
   the light spatially, leading to increased visibility of the light in the
   environment. During 104 nights, we trapped 51263 nocturnal insects of
   which 97\% were caught at lights and 3\% at dark sites. For bats, up to
   44.8\% fewer acoustic signals were recorded at dark sites. We caught
   31\% insects at LEDs with1750 K, 34\% and 35\% at 3000 K and 4000 K,
   respectively. Thus, color temperatures of 1750 K proved less detrimental
   than 3000/4000 K. Effects of luminaire shape led to an increase (16\%)
   of trapped insects for luminaires with diffusors compared to the
   standard shape. In addition, luminaires with diffusors amplified the
   effects of LED color (+12\% insects at 1750 K/3000 K; +25.6\% at 4000
   K). In contrast, bat foraging activity was independent of the light
   treatments while bat feeding activity was increased by 21.5\% at
   standard luminaire shapes. Likely, intense straylight at diffused lights
   negatively affects the target-focused echolocation by deterring the
   bats. We concluded that ecological impacts of luminaire shape are an
   important, yet underestimated variable in light-pollution impact
   research. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft

Title = {Plant functional traits under cattle grazing and fallow age scenarios in
   a tropical dry forest of Northwestern Mexico},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {30-44},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants
   respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability
   associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the
   primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter
   environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and
   nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and
   functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence
   functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood.
   Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant
   functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth
   tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most
   important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in
   both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the
   effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits,
   with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early
   succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation
   (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional
   they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher
   specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced
   successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help
   plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some
   functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry
   weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession
   advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3
   concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits
   responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that
   cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation
   strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and
   cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing
   species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental
   filters in abandoned cattle fields. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Species ecological strategy and soil phosphorus supply interactively
   affect plant biomass and phosphorus concentration},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Excess soil phosphorus often constrains ecological restoration of
   degraded semi-natural grasslands in Western-Europe. Slow -growing
   species, often target of restoration (measures), are at a disadvantage
   because they are outcompeted by fast-growing species. Gaining insight
   into the responses of plant species , communities to soil phosphorus
   availability will help under-standing restoration trajectories of
   grassland ecosystems. We set up two pot experiments using twenty
   grassland species with contrasting growth forms (i.e. grasses versus
   forbs) and nutrient use strategies (i.e. acquisitive versus conservative
   nutrient use). We quantified the nutrient use strategy of a species
   based on the stress-tolerance value of the CSR framework (StrateFy et
   al. 2017). We grew these species (1) as monocultures and (2) in mixtures
   along a soil phosphorus gradient and measured the aboveground biomass
   and plant phosphorus concentrations. Plant phosphorus concentration
   generally increased with soil phosphorus supply and biomass increased
   with soil phosphorus supply only in conservative communities. Forbs had
   higher plant phosphorus concentrations compared to grasses both in
   monocultures and mixtures. The species' nutrient use strategy had
   contrasting effects on plant tissue phosphorus concentrations, depending
   on soil phosphorus supply (interaction effect) and vegetation biomass
   (dilution effect). Our findings contribute to the knowledge required for
   successful ecological restoration of species-rich grasslands. Our
   results suggest that under specific conditions (i.e. nitrogen
   limitation, no dispersal limitation, no light limitation), slow-growing
   species can survive and even thrive under excess soil phosphorus
   availability. In the field, com-petition by fast-growing species may be
   reduced by increased mowing or grazing management. (C) 2022 The

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Cyclopes didactylus, the smallest of all anteaters, inhabits Amazonian
   and Atlantic forests with an apparently disjunct distribution. Yet,
   phylogeography reveals historical connections through the forests of the
   Northeast Region of Brazil. Its populations in this region are
   classified by the Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient and
   with a trend towards decline. However, Northeast Brazil has a large
   sampling gap, and the potential distribution of this species has yet to
   be evaluated. We investigated the potential distribution of C.
   didactylus to evaluate the hypothesis of a disjunct distribution between
   Amazonian and Atlantic forests and estimate the amount of protected area
   in its predicted distribution. We generated a Maxent distribution model
   using occurrence records, according to the new taxonomic revision of
   Cyclopes, and selected current bioclimatic variables to evaluate the
   continuity of the predicted distribution of the species in Northeast
   Brazil. We also performed past projections to assess historical
   connections and overlapped maps of protected areas onto their current
   distribution. Although its distribution is probably disjunct, at least
   one as-yet-unknown population may be present in the forests of Northeast
   Brazil, an area poorly protected. The results are useful for targeting
   field efforts in this under-sampled region.},

Abstract = {Root metrics and plant height for 256 excavated saplings and small trees

   biomass from proximal diameter data. The majority of the species studied
   are slow-growing and had a median height of <200 cm at the age of 16
   years. Root development advanced sequentially from taproot elongation to
   thickening to coarse lateral root development. Shrubs in shallow soil
   had short taproots with a lower wood density. Plant age explained <10\%
   of the variance in shoot height. Root variables explained the majority
   of the variance in shoot height. More research is needed to improve our

Title = {Landscape-scale connectivity and fragment size determine species

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {39-49},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat
   fragmentation since the mid-20th century, biological diver-sity has
   declined considerably throughout the world, particularly in Europe. We
   assessed how habitat and landscape-scale heterogeneity, such as
   variation in fragment size (small vs. large) and landscape configuration
   (measured as connectivity index), affect plant and arthropod diversity.
   We focused on arthropods with different feeding behaviour and mobility,
   spi-ders (predators, moderate dispersal), true bugs (mainly herbivores
   and omnivores with moderate dispersal), wild bees (pollinators with good
   dispersal abilities), and wasps (pollinators, omnivores with good
   dispersal abilities). We studied 60 dry grassland fragments in the same
   region (Hungarian Great Plain); 30 fragments were represented by the
   grassland com-ponent of forest-steppe stands, and 30 were situated on
   burial mounds (kurgans). Forest-steppes are mosaics of dry grass-lands
   with small forests in a matrix of plantation forests. Kurgans are
   ancient burial mounds with moderately disturbed grasslands surrounded by
   agricultural fields. The size of fragments ranged between 0.16-6.88 ha
   (small: 0.16-0.48 ha, large: 0.93-6.88 ha) for forest-steppes and
   0.01-0.44 ha (small: 0.01-0.10 ha and large: 0.20-0.44 ha) for kurgans.
   Fragments also represented an isolation gradient from almost cleared and
   homogenous landscapes, to landscapes with rel-atively high compositional
   heterogeneity. Fragment size, connectivity, and their interaction
   affected specialist and gener-alist species abundances of forest-steppes
   and kurgans. Large fragments had higher species richness of
   ground-dwelling spiders, and the effect of connectivity was more
   strongly positive for specialist arthropods and more strongly negative
   for generalists in large than in small fragments. However, we also found
   a strong positive impact of connectivity for generalist plants in small
   kurgans in contrast to larger ones. We conclude that besides the
   well-known effect of enhancing habitat quality, increasing connectivity
   between fragments by restoring natural and semi-natural habitat patches
   would help to maintain grassland biodiversity.},

Title = {Legume plant defenses and nutrients mediate indirect interactions
   between soil rhizobia and chewing herbivores},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil bacteria that associate with plant roots promote host vigor. Legume
   plants form mutualisms with rhizobial bacteria, and legumes grown with
   rhizobia have more nutrients and defenses than those grown without
   rhizobia. However, few studies have tested how stressors such as
   herbivores affect soil rhizobia, and the mechanisms mediating these
   interactions. Here we tested reciprocal interactions between a chewing
   herbivore, Sitona lineatus (pea leaf weevil), and Pisum sativum (pea)
   plants grown with or without rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar.
   viciae), and the plant-defense and nutritional mechanisms mediat-ing
   these interactions. We hypothesized that plants grown with rhizobia
   would have less feeding from S. lineatus due to greater expression of
   phytohormones or physical defenses. We also predicted that herbivory
   might impede the mutualism between P. sativum and rhizobia. Our
   experiments showed that leaf defoliation by S. lineatus was indeed
   lowest on plants with rhizobia. Plants grown with rhizobia had increased
   gene transcript expression associated with hormone-related defense
   (jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid) as well as physical and
   antioxidant-related defense, which may explain reduced feeding by S.
   lineatus. Conversely, S. lineatus feeding reduced the number of root
   nodules and nodule fresh weight, suggesting a disruption of the
   symbiosis between plants and rhizobia. Our study shows that aboveground
   herbivores can engage in mutually antagonistic interactions with soil
   microbes that are mediated through multiple plant-mediated pathways. (c)

Abstract = {Family farms can benefit from the presence of a diverse set of native
   pollinators and associated pollination services. In the present study we
   assessed the effect of flower visitor richness and visitation rate by
   honeybees and native insects on mandarin production ( Citrus reticulata
   `Criolla), in ten citrus family farms located in the Dry Chaco region of
   northwest Argentina. An exclusion experiment was conducted to explore
   how pollinators influence the fruit set and quality of `Criolla
   mandarin. The influence of features such as local richness and abundance
   of flowering plants, farm size, and surrounding natural/semi-natural
   habitats in the diversity of flower visitors was also evaluated. Fruit
   set in open pollination branches was three times higher than in bagged
   branches, where flower visitors were excluded. Moreover, the mandarin
   fruit set increased with a higher native visitation rate, and mandarin
   quality (fruit weight and size) decreased with a higher honeybee
   visitation rate. Flower visitor diversity was higher in farmlands with a
   greater proportion of surrounding natural and semi-natural habitats. Our
   results demonstrate the negative effects of excessive honeybee
   visitation on citrus fruit quality and highlight the importance of
   native pollinators and natural habitat conservation to increase the
   fruit set and quality of mandarin in family farms. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Positive effects of ants on host trees are critical in years of low
   reproduction and not influenced by liana presence},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {93-103},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tropical tree-climbing lianas form paths that benefit foraging of
   dominant ants which might protect the host tree against herbivores. In
   contrast, lianas are often associated with negative effects on growth
   and reproduction of host trees due to light obstruction, structural
   stress and other negative effects. It is unclear if dominant ants could
   mitigate the negative effects of lianas on host plants. We investigated
   how lianas and carton nest ants (Azteca chartifex) affected herbivory
   and reproductive structures of the host tree Byrsonima sericea.
   Considering 68 trees, almost half of them were naturally colonized by A.
   chartifex nests (32 trees). We removed lianas from half of the trees
   (34), establishing a factorial sampling design between A. chartifex and
   liana presence. We sampled ants and leaf herbivory before and after
   removing lianas, and measured plant fitness in two consecutive years
   after removing lianas. Liana removal had no effect on A. chartifex
   foraging, on leaf herbivory and flower-fruit conversion of host plants.
   However, A. chartifex decreased leaf herbivory and increased B. sericea
   flower-fruit conversion irrespective of lianas presence. A noticeable
   positive effect of ants was detected only in the second year of the
   experiment, consistently on all plants at each experimental level. The
   reproductive conditions of the first year resulted in most plants with
   more than 75\% flower-to-fruit conversion success, regardless of the
   presence of A. chartifex, a success sustained only on those
   ant-colonized plants in the second year. Our results contribute to
   understanding multi-trophic interactions in tropical forest canopies as
   we demonstrated i) that dominant arboreal ants can benefit plants even
   in a non-obligatory interaction and ii) that the influence of lianas on
   its host tree is context-dependent, presenting even neutral effects
   depending on habitat type and species involved.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

Title = {Traffic noise induces oxidative stress and phytohormone imbalance in two
   urban plant species},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Traffic noise pollution is one of the major environmental concerns in
   crowded cities worldwide. The objective of the present study was to
   investigate the effects of traffic noise on growth, hormonal balance,
   oxidative damage, and activity of antioxidant systems in two urban plant
   species, Tagetes patula and Salvia splendens. Each of the plant species
   were equally divided into 2 groups (control and traffic noise treatment)
   and each group was grown under identical controlled conditions in two
   separate growth chambers for two months. Traffic noise was recorded
   during peak traffic hours in a highly congested area of the city.
   Frequency analysis of traffic noise was conducted on the samples during
   the recording process. Plants in the traffic noise treatment group were
   exposed to 16 h of road traffic noise each day for a total of 15 days,
   while the control group was kept under complete silence. Traffic noise
   exposure led to significant decrease in growth indices of both plant
   species. The content of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly
   increased upon traffic noise treatment in both species, followed by an
   increase in DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) anti-oxidant activity
   and the activity of antioxidant enzymes including catalase, peroxidase,
   and ascorbate peroxidase. Road traffic noise significantly reduced the
   content of phytohormones including zeatin, salicylic acid,
   indole-3-acetic acid, and gibberellic acid. On the other hand, the
   content of stress-related hormones including abscisic acid and jasmonic
   acid significantly increased in response to road traffic noise in both
   species. Based on our results, daily traffic noise can negatively affect
   growth and physiology of plants by inducing of oxidative damage and
   interfering with hormonal balance. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by

   Woodpecker Nest Cavities in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Woodpeckers require trees and snags with decayed wood in order to
   excavate nest and roost cavities, and interior wood hardness is
   considered an important factor determining where a woodpecker can create
   a cavity. In most ecosystems, saprophytic fungi are responsible for the
   decay and softening of wood, and are thought to be important in
   providing soft wood for woodpecker cavity excavation. We conducted a
   study of cellulose-degrading enzymes in the wood surrounding woodpecker
   nest cavities. We measured wood hardness, percent wood density loss
   (PWDL), and activity of cellobiase (an extracellular fungal cellulase
   that degrades cellulose) within wood surrounding the nest cavities of
   the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), black-backed woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus),
   and hairy woodpecker (D. villosus) in Oregon and Washington. We found
   that mean wood hardness was significantly lower, and cellobiase and PWDL
   were significantly higher, at nest cavities than controls for each
   woodpecker species. Wood hardness was higher and cellobiase lower at
   nests of black-backed woodpecker than northern flicker, but did not
   differ among the other woodpecker species. Our results suggest that
   increased amounts of cellobiase result in softer wood due to the
   increased decay caused by higher fungal enzyme activity and that
   measuring cellobiase can be used to estimate wood decay without directly
   measuring wood hardness. All four woodpecker species selected nest
   substrates with softer wood and higher fungal enzyme activity than
   controls. This supports findings from previous studies of the importance
   of saprophytic fungi for woodpecker cavity excavation.},

Title = {The effect of pollination on the growth and reproduction of oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus)},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {164-174},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is an organism's ability to alter its development
   and life history in response to environmental conditions. In plants,
   biotic and abiotic factors drive the distribution of resources between
   growth and reproductive traits. One such biotic factor is pollination.
   Studies show that wind and insect pollination enhance oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus) yield. How-ever, the impact of pollination on resource
   allocation towards growth and reproduction is less understood. We
   conducted a con-trolled experiment to assess the effect of pollination
   on growth and functional reproductive traits. We compared two simulated
   supplementary pollen deposition methods (representing wind and insect
   pollination) alongside a non-supplementary control. Pollinated plants
   allocated resources towards growth and reproduction similarly,
   irrespective of deposition method. Plants receiving no supplementary
   pollination produced fewer seeds, allocating resources to growth, more
   prolific and persistent flowering, and heavier seeds. Pollinated plants
   had a reduced flowering period and were shorter, indicating resources
   were allocated to seed production rather than growth or the production
   of additional flowers. This allocation of resources from growth and
   flowering metrics can increase yield directly through increased seed
   production and indirectly through shorter plants and a reduced flowering
   period with seeds that mature earlier (agronomically beneficial traits).
   Wind and insect pollination can enhance and stabilise oilseed rape yield
   under various environmental conditions by acting in complementary ways.
   Since pollination limits yield in oilseed rape, it must be considered an
   input that can be actively managed. Successful management of pollination
   services requires growers to detect pollination deficits. Inadequately
   pollinated oilseed rape plants exhibit apparent morphological changes
   (e.g. taller plants that flower for longer), acting as an early warning
   to growers. Equipping growers with this knowledge provides them with a
   means of detecting deficits and thus enables them to take positive
   action to restore pollination services by introducing honeybees or
   enhancing wild pollinators. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Contrasting effects of grazing on the early stages of woody encroachment
   in a Neotropical savanna},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {13-24},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Woody encroachment in savannas represents an ecological process of
   current global interest given its negative impact on ecosystem
   functioning, particularly on forage production. Traditional savanna
   models propose competition and niche differentiation as the main
   mechanisms allowing tree-grass coexistence. Demographic models, instead,
   propose abiotic and biotic factors as bottlenecks controlling vital
   rates and transitions from seeds to adult trees. The role played by
   domestic grazing on woody encroachment is yet controversial. Here, using
   a multistage tree life approach, we combine both models and evaluate the
   role of grazing and herbaceous vegetation on woody recruitment in a
   Neotropical savanna dominated by Vachellia caven, a successful and
   widely spread encroacher tree species. We performed three experiments to
   evaluate seed predation, seedling emergence and survival of V. caven by
   manipulating cattle grazing (grazed and ungrazed areas) and herbaceous
   vegetation presence (vegetated and unvegetated). Finally, we combined
   the results of the three experiments to estimate the probability of
   plant recruitment across these experimental factors. Grazing decreased
   seed predation by half, did not modify seedling emergence and decreased
   seedling survival. Herbaceous vegetation did not affect seed predation
   nor seedling emergence rate, but increased seedling survival. Overall,
   the net effect of grazing on V. caven recruitment was neutral since the
   increase in seed availability due to the reduction in seed predation
   rate was compensated by the negative effect of grazing on seedling
   survival. Our analysis revealed that cattle grazing and herbaceous
   vegetation had contrasting effects on the seed and seedling life stages.
   We propose that in order to restrain the early stages of encroachment,
   cattle grazing pressure could be managed following the seasonality of
   demographic tree transitions. Through rotational grazing amongst
   paddocks, stocking rates could be relaxed during the primary dispersal
   stage to maximize granivory, and then increased to enhance the chance of
   seedling consumption and trampling. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Towards a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {105-138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rapid changes of the biosphere observed in recent years are caused by
   both small and large scale drivers, like shifts in temperature,
   transformations in land-use, or changes in the energy budget of systems.
   While the latter processes are easily quantifiable, documentation of the
   loss of biodiversity and community structure is more difficult. Changes
   in organismal abundance and diversity are barely documented. Censuses of
   species are usually fragmentary and inferred by often spatially,
   temporally and ecologically unsatisfactory simple species lists for
   individual study sites. Thus, detrimental global processes and their
   drivers often remain unrevealed. A major impediment to monitoring
   species diversity is the lack of human taxonomic expertise that is
   implicitly required for large-scale and fine-grained assessments.
   Another is the large amount of personnel and associated costs needed to
   cover large scales, or the inaccessibility of remote but nonetheless
   affected areas.
   To overcome these limitations we propose a network of Automated
   Multisensor stations for Monitoring of species Diversity (AMMODs) to
   pave the way for a new generation of biodiversity assessment centers.
   This network combines cutting-edge technologies with biodiversity
   informatics and expert systems that conserve expert knowledge. Each
   AMMOD station combines autonomous samplers for insects, pollen and
   spores, audio recorders for vocalizing animals, sensors for volatile
   organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) and camera traps for mammals
   and small invertebrates. AMMODs are largely self-containing and have the
   ability to pre-process data (e.g. for noise filtering) prior to
   transmission to receiver stations for storage, integration and analyses.
   Installation on sites that are difficult to access require a
   sophisticated and challenging system design with optimum balance between
   power requirements, bandwidth for data transmission, required service,
   and operation under all environmental conditions for years. An important
   prerequisite for automated species identification are databases of DNA
   barcodes, animal sounds, for pVOCs, and images used as training data for
   automated species identification. AMMOD stations thus become a key
   component to advance the field of biodiversity monitoring for research
   and policy by delivering biodiversity data at an unprecedented spatial
   and temporal resolution. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {While sustainable agriculture relies on natural pest control, we lack
   insights into the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down factors
   on pest levels, especially along broad environmental and management
   gradients. To this aim, we focused on bottom-up and top-down control of
   herbivore damage in sixty sites in the centre of origin of Arabica
   coffee in southwestern Ethiopia, where coffee grows along a management
   gradient ranging from little or no management in the natural forest to
   commercial plantations. More specifically, we examined how canopy cover,
   percentage of surrounding forest and management intensity affected
   caffeine and chlorogenic acid concentration (bottom-up process) and
   attack of dummy caterpillars by ants and birds (top-down process), and
   how these in turn affected pest levels. Caffeine and chlorogenic acid
   concentrations were negatively related to canopy cover, while ant attack
   rate was positively related to canopy cover. Both ant and bird attack
   rate increased with the percentage of surrounding forest. Yet, secondary
   chemistry and caterpillar attack rates were unrelated to herbivory, and
   herbivory was only directly and positively affected by management
   intensity. Our study highlights that canopy cover can have contrasting
   effects on plant defence and predation, and that changes in bottom-up
   and top-down factors do unlike often assumed - not necessarily translate
   into reduced pest levels. Instead, direct effects of management on pest
   levels may be more important than bottom-up or top-down mediated
   effects. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Pollen collection by honey bee hives in almond orchards indicate diverse
   diets},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Almond is one of the world's most economically valuable crops and many
   varieties require cross pollination for optimal fruit set. For this
   reason, western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives are often placed in
   almond orchards. However, little is known about the usage of almond and
   other pollen sources by individual hives during almond bloom. Here, we
   investigated the timing, identity and quantity of pollen collection
   associated with almond floral abundance and spatial location of
   individual hives by sampling 440 individual pollen tray samples and
   counting 45,072 pollen grains from 13,200 pollen pellets collected from
   80 individual hives across the flowering season in Victoria,
   south-eastern Australia. A large proportion of hives collected nonalmond
   pollen in addition to almond pollen (63/80 = 79\%). The weight of almond
   pollen collected by the hives at each sampling time was positively
   related to the number of concurrently open almond flowers. However,
   non-almond pollen richness and abundance was not related to the number
   of almond flowers but had a positive relationship with the weight of
   almond pollen collected. There was no relationship between the distance
   among hives and identity of pollen collected. Yet, three plant families
   in the study area were found to account for a high percentage of the
   non-almond pollen collected, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae.
   Understanding crop and non-crop pollen collection could inform honey bee
   diet needs and identify the plant species of importance to inform best
   practice bee management during almond flowering. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Initial floral visitor identity and foraging time strongly influence
   blueberry reproductive success},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {114-122},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Priority effects occur when the order of species arrival affects
   subsequent ecological processes. The order that pollinator species visit
   flowers may affect pollination through a priority effect, whereby the
   first visitor reduces or modifies the contribution of subsequent visits.
   We observed floral visitation to blueberry flowers from honeybees,
   stingless bees or a mixture of both species and investigated how (i)
   initial visits differed in duration to later visits; and (ii) how visit
   sequences from different pollinator taxa influenced fruit weight.
   Stingless bees visited blueberry flowers for significantly longer than
   honeybees and maintained their floral visit duration, irrespective of
   the number of preceding visits. In contrast, honeybee visit duration
   declined significantly with an increasing number of preceding visits.
   Fruit weight was positively associated with longer floral visit duration
   by honeybees but not from stingless bee or mixed species visitation.
   Fruit from mixed species visits were heavier overall than single species
   visits, because of a strong priority effect. An initial visit by a
   stingless bee fully pollinated the flower, limiting the pollination
   contribution of future visitors. However, after an initial honeybee
   visit, flowers were not fully pollinated and additional visitation had
   an additive effect upon fruit weight. Blueberries from flowers visited
   first by stingless bees were 60\% heavier than those visited first by
   honeybees when total floral visitation was short (similar to 1 min).
   However, when total visitation time was long (similar to 8 min),
   blueberry fruit were 24\% heavier when initial visits were from
   honeybees. Our findings highlight that the initial floral visit can have
   a disproportionate effect on pollination outcomes. Considering priority
   effects alongside traditional measures of pollinator effectiveness will
   provide a greater mechanistic understanding of how pollinator
   communities influence plant reproductive success. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Can novel seed mixes provide a more diverse, abundant, earlier, and

Abstract = {Several agri-environment schemes aim to improve pollinator diversity and
   abundance, including the sowing of wildflower areas. These seed mixes
   are often either low in floral diversity and target few pollinator
   species (mainly social bees), or high in floral diversity but with
   limited evidence of good establishment of the component species. In
   order to support a greater diversity of wild bees in farmland, we need
   more diverse seed mixes, containing species shown to support a wide
   diversity of insect pollinators, with good establishment and long
   flowering periods. Here we trialled two typical seed mixes, a
   low-diversity Fabaceae-heavy mix (FAB) and a more diverse wildflower mix
   (WF), against two novel wildflower mixes, one based on literature
   sources (LT), and one based on first-hand surveys of pollinator
   attraction to flowers growing on a wildflower farm (WB). Both new mixes
   were focussed on plants attractive to wild bee species. Replicated field
   plots were set up on two farms and monitored over three years. Our novel
   wildflower mixes had higher floral diversity and abundance than the FAB
   mix, and began flowering earlier, reaching their floral peak before the
   FAB mix, potentially providing forage for a broader range of pollinators
   or those with earlier flight seasons. The high floral abundance in LT
   and WB was driven by annuals in the first year, and then multiple
   perennials in the second and third year. We identified five perennials
   from four families (Daucus carota, Leucanthemum vulgare, Geranium
   pyrenaicum, Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium hybridum) that established
   well on both farms, are known to be attractive to a diversity of bee
   species, and thus could be considered as providing a more taxonomically
   diverse base for creating future mixes. However, the mixes provided few
   floral resources in April (needed by early-flying wild bees), and more

Title = {Genomic patterns and the evolutionary origin of an invasive fungal
   pathogen (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) in Europe},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {4-16},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the 1990s, a highly pathogenic and invasive lineage of the Asian
   ascomycete Hymenoscyphus fraxineus appeared in Europe. Spreading across
   the continent, the fungal lineage devastates common ash (Fraxinus
   excelsior) populations and is a threat to ash species worldwide.
   In contrast to highly diverse reference populations in Japan and East
   Russia, the expanding European population is characterized by the
   persistence of a mosaic of two ancestral haplotypes, and presumed
   constraints to recombination. Four hypotheses were proposed for the
   evolutionary origin of the European lineage. The first hypothesis H1
   states that two, and only two, pathogenic founder individuals were
   transferred from Asia to Europe and successfully established.
   Alternatively, in addition to the fungus arriving in Europe, a change in
   function might have occurred and only then the lineage became invasive.
   The cause of such a change might have been H2: one to two mutations
   during meiosis; H3: the lateral transfer of a European cytoplasmatic
   element modifying the behavior of H. fraxineus; or H4: a hybridization
   event with a closely related European ascomycete.
   Only the hybridization hypothesis seems to explain all of the
   genome-wide characteristics observed for the nuclear genome. Existing
   reconstructions of phylogenetic relationships at different taxonomic
   levels provide the evolutionary context of the lineages potentially
   involved. Vital information was gained from three configurations of
   nucleotide diversity and population differentiation associated with the
   genomic mosaic of monomorphic tracts and diversity islands.
   This synthesis points to the importance of identifying the taxonomic and
   geographic origins of the conserved two genomic ancestries within the
   European lineage of H. fraxineus and of reconstructing the mosaic of
   ancestral parental haplotypes (ancestry blocks) across the genome. Only
   with this information at hand will it be possible, to reliably interpret
   population-genomic data in the search for the functional elements
   underlying this unbalanced host-pathogen system. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft

Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-130},

Abstract = {A length-frequency sample (n = 295) from a fossil population of the
   Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni Hall, 1838, assembled and
   analyzed by J. L. Cisne in 1973 is here reexamined using methods of
   length-frequency analysis commonly used in fishery science and marine
   biology. Theoretical considerations and the empirical data at hand
   suggest that the growth of T. eatoni was not ``linear,{''} but
   asymptotic, as is the growth of most Recent marine invertebrates. The
   parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (L-infinity = 41 mm, K
   = 0.29 yr(-1)) suggest that T. eatoni, which apparently lived in a
   challenging environment, grew somewhat more slowly than the extant
   marine isopod Ceratoserolis trilobitoides (Eights, 1833), used here as
   Recent analogue to T. eatoni. This trilobite probably lived up to 10
   years, rather than the suggested 4 years, and its mortality rate was
   15\%-20\% per year rather than 30\%-40\% per year. These represent the
   first estimates of trilobite absolute growth characteristics using
   methods known to accurately model growth in extant water-breathing
   ectotherms. These provide a baseline for trilobite growth that can be
   used to make inferences about growth in other species. The approach used
   here may also be applied to other trilobites for which suitable
   length-frequency data exist.},

Title = {A test of Bergmann's rule in the Early Triassic: latitude, body size,

Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The ecogeographic rule known as Bergmann's rule suggests that there is a
   positive relationship between body size and latitude when comparing
   closely related taxa. The underlying mechanism or mechanisms to explain
   this pattern vary as widely as the taxa that seem to follow it, which
   has led to skepticism over whether Bergmann's rule should be considered
   a rule at all. Despite this, Bergmann's rule is widespread among modern
   birds, mammals, beetles, and some amphibians, but far fewer extinct taxa
   have been subjected to tests of Bergmann's rule. To examine whether
   Bergmann's rule is detected in extinct taxa, we compared body-size
   proxies in Lystrosaurus recovered from Early Triassic-aged strata in
   Antarctica, South Africa, India, and China. Our results reveal that
   average body size is largest at mid-northern paleolatitudes (similar to
   45 degrees N) instead of the highest southern paleolatitudes (similar to
   70 degrees S). Additionally, maximum body size is consistent across the
   Northern and Southern Hemispheres, indicating that Bergmann's rule did
   not apply for Lystrosaurus during the Early Triassic. To test potential
   sample size biases in our results, we used rarefaction and subsampling
   to show that only the Karoo Basin is well sampled and that large
   individuals are exceedingly rare, except in the Turpan-Junggar Basin of
   Xinjiang, China. Taken together, our results suggest that Lystrosaurus
   had the potential to reach large body sizes in each of the latitudinally
   widespread geologic basins studied here, but that local conditions may
   have allowed individuals at mid-northern paleolatitudes a greater chance
   of reaching a large size compared with southern congeners that suffered
   increased mortality when young or at a small size.},

Title = {Latitudinal influences on bryozoan calcification through the Paleozoic},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-283},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Bryozoans are active non-phototrophic biomineralizers that precipitate
   their calcareous skeletons in seawater. Carbonate saturation states
   varied temporally and spatially in Paleozoic oceans, and we used the
   Bryozoan Skeletal Index (BSI) to investigate whether bryozoan
   calcification was controlled by seawater chemistry in Paleozoic
   trepostome and cryptostome bryozoans. Our results show that cryptostome
   bryozoan genera were influenced by ocean chemistry throughout the
   Paleozoic and precipitated the most calcite at lower latitudes, where
   carbonate saturation states are generally higher, and less in
   midlatitudes, where carbonate will be relatively undersaturated.
   Trepostome bryozoan genera show a similar but weaker trend for the
   Ordovician to Devonian, suggesting that, like the cryptostomes, they
   were unable to metabolically overcome falling saturation states and
   simply precipitated less robust skeletons at higher latitudes.
   Carboniferous to Triassic trepostomes differ, however, and show a trend
   toward increased calcification at higher latitudes, indicating an
   ability to overcome unfavorable carbonate saturation states. Analysis of
   Permian trepostomes at the species level indicates this is most
   pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere, where calcification is matched by
   increased feeding capacity. It is proposed that this increased feeding
   capacity allowed trepostomes to metabolically overcome unfavorable
   carbonate saturation states. The differing responses of trepostome and
   cryptostome bryozoans to carbonate saturation states suggest that
   bryozoans should not be considered as a single group in marine
   extinctions linked to ocean chemistry changes. Likewise, it would
   suggest that modern stenolaemate and gymnolaemate bryozoans should be
   treated separately when considering their response to modern ocean
   chemistry changes.},

Title = {Dispersals from the West Tethys as the source of the Indo-West Pacific
   diversity hotspot in comatulid crinoids},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-52},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Conspicuous centers of biodiversity are frequently attributed to local
   conditions that promote speciation or resistance to extinction, but
   recent diversification studies indicate this mode of explanation might
   not be very general, so it may be fruitful to revisit the role of
   dispersal in concentrating biodiversity. Here we consider the processes
   underlying the marine diversity hotspot in the Indo-West Pacific among
   comatulid crinoids, suspension-feeding echinoderms conspicuous on modern
   tropical reefs. We used ancestral-range reconstruction on a phylogeny of
   extant crinoids, assembled a new occurrence database of fossil
   comatulids and interrogated it with probabilistic preservational models,
   and developed a morphological character matrix to estimate the
   relationships among living and fossil comatulids. Ancestral-range
   reconstruction on a phylogeny of extant comatulids recovers an origin
   outside the Indo-Pacific and elevated dispersal into it. A new
   occurrence database records the comatulid clade spreading out gradually
   from origin in the Early Jurassic of the West Tethys. Comatulids do not
   appear in their modern hotspot until the Oligocene, and taphonomic
   analyses show these results cannot be explained solely as a result of
   inadequate sampling in Asia and Oceania. Finally, phylogenetic analyses
   demonstrate that deeply nested crown-group comatulids had originated
   before the clade became well established in the East Tethys, implying
   many independent dispersals into the modern hotspot. These consilient
   results suggest a biodiversity hotspot that owes its existence to
   dispersals out of the ancient West Tethys rather than to elevated in
   situ diversification.},

Abstract = {The number of individuals of species varies, but estimating abundance,
   given incomplete and biased sampling in both contemporary and fossilized
   communities, is challenging. Here, we describe a new occupancy model in
   a hierarchical Bayesian framework with random effects, in which
   multispecies occupancy and detection are modeled as a means to estimate
   relative species abundance and relative population densities. The
   modeling framework is suited for temporal samples of fossil communities
   with repeated sampling including multiple species with similar
   preservation potential. We demonstrate our modeling framework using a
   fossil community of benthic organisms to estimate relative species

Title = {Decreasing nitrogen deposition rates: Good news for oligotrophic
   grassland species?},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {125-138},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Several studies have found that increased nitrogen (N) deposition leads
   to a decline in species richness in semi-natural grasslands, mainly due
   to the loss of species typical of nutrient-poor soils. However, after
   reaching a peak around 1990, N deposition has decreased in Europe over
   the last 30 years. In this study, we investigated the changes in species
   number and composition of semi-natural grasslands during this period of
   declining N deposition. To this end, we compared the data from the first
   survey (2001-2005) of 147 grassland sites in Switzerland with those from
   the third survey (2011-2015). We further analysed the vegetation
   development of a specific hay meadow from 1992 to 2013. In this
   grassland, total vegetation cover and the cover of graminoid species
   decreased, while the cover of oligotrophic species increased. At the 147
   grassland sites, total species number decreased at sites with still high
   levels of N deposition and it tended to increase at sites with low N
   deposition, i. e. below the critical load for N deposition. The number
   of oligotrophic grassland species increased at sites with a large
   decrease in N deposition and strong inclination. Thus, the results of
   this study indicate that the reduction of N emissions had a measurable
   positive effect on species diversity in these semi-natural grasslands.
   Most of the grasslands surveyed appear to be quite resilient against N
   deposition, i. e. they do not shift to an alternative low diversity
   state dominated by a few competitive species, and recovery of the
   species composition as a result of the decrease in N deposition seems
   possible, especially on steep slopes. Furthermore, the study underlines
   the importance of regular management of semi-natural, unfertilised,
   low-productivity grassland to maintain the diversity of oligotrophic
   grassland species. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Abstract = {The wild boar Sus scrofa is one of the most widely distributed large
   mammal species in the world, existing on all continents except
   Antarctica. In the late 20th Century, its geographical range expanded
   naturally and through intentional releases. Despite the environmental,
   social, and economic importance of the wild boar, its current
   distribution in northern Eurasia remains uncertain, and the factors that
   limit and promote expansion in northern ecosystems are unknown. We aimed
   to summarise the history of wild boar range expansion and current
   distribution in the countries of northern Eurasia. We also assess the
   relative importance of climate (both harshness and warming), habitat
   (both current diversity and possible change), predators, releases,
   supplementary feeding, and hunting in limiting or promoting the
   distribution and range expansion of the species. We review hunting
   management and other regulations that may affect further northward
   expansion. Information on wild boar expansion and distribution was
   collated from available scientific publications, official statistics,
   volunteer reports, and expert knowledge. The effects of natural factors
   (climate harshness, habitat variation, predators) and anthropogenic
   factors (climate warming, habitat change, releases, supplementary
   feeding, hunting) on wild boar distribution were assessed using
   estimates (scores) provided by experts from the target regions. The wild
   boar in Europe is distributed up to 64 degrees N. In Asia, the northern
   distributional limit is up to 61 degrees N. The species' northern
   distributional limit is further north in the west than in the east of
   the geographic range. Experts regarded climate harshness, habitat, and
   hunting as the most important factors limiting wild boar distribution.
   Important factors that promote the expansion of the wild boar's range
   include climate warming and supplementary feeding. Our analysis of the
   official approaches to wild boar management suggests that the northern
   Eurasian countries do not have a united approach to the challenge of
   wild boar expansion. Collaboration between managers, policymakers, and
   researchers is needed for monitoring the wild boar distribution and
   range expansion throughout northern Eurasia. This data collection is
   especially important now, as parts of Europe and Asia are facing the
   challenge of African swine fever as well as other human-wildlife
   conflicts related to increasing wild boar populations.},

Title = {Variation in red fox Vulpes vulpes diet in five continents},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-342},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Understanding variation in the diet of widely distributed species can
   help us to predict how they respond to future environmental and
   anthropogenic changes.
   2. We studied the diet of the red fox Vulpes vulpes, one of the world's
   most widely distributed carnivores. We compiled dietary data from 217
   studies at 276 locations in five continents to assess how fox diet
   composition varied according to geographic location, climate,
   anthropogenic impact, and sampling method.
   3. The diet of foxes showed substantial variation throughout the
   species' range, but with a general trend for small mammals and
   invertebrates to be the most frequently occurring dietary items.
   4. The incidence of small and large mammals and birds in fox diets was
   greater away from the equator. The incidence of invertebrates and fruits
   increased with mean elevation, while the occurrence of medium-sized
   mammals and birds decreased.
   5. Fox diet differed according to climatic and anthropogenic variables.
   Diet richness decreased with increasing temperature and precipitation.
   The incidence of small and large mammals decreased with increasing
   temperature. The incidence of birds and invertebrates decreased with
   increasing mean annual precipitation. Higher Human Footprint Index was
   associated with a lower incidence of large mammals and a higher
   incidence of birds and fruit in fox diet.
   6. Sampling method influenced fox diet estimation: estimated percentage
   of small and medium-sized mammals and fruit was lower in studies based
   on stomach contents, while large mammals were more likely to be recorded
   in studies of stomach contents than in studies of scats.
   7. Our study confirms the flexible and opportunistic dietary behaviour
   of foxes at the global scale. This behavioural trait allows them to
   thrive in a range of climatic conditions, and in areas with different
   degrees of human-induced habitat change. This knowledge can help us to
   place the results of local-scale fox diet studies into a broader context
   and to predict how foxes will respond to future environmental changes.},

Abstract = {The rise of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and extinction of nearly
   all jawless vertebrates (agnathans) is one of the most important
   transitions in vertebrate evolution, but the causes are poorly
   understood. Competition between agnathans and gnathostomes during the
   Devonian period is the most commonly hypothesized cause; however, no
   formal attempts to test this hypothesis have been made. Generally,
   competition between species increases as morphological similarity
   increases; therefore, this study uses the largest to date morphometric
   comparison of Silurian and Devonian agnathan and gnathostome groups to
   determine which groups were most and least likely to have competed. Five
   agnathan groups (Anaspida, Heterostraci, Osteostraci, Thelodonti, and
   Furcacaudiformes) were compared with five gnathostome groups
   (Acanthodii, Actinopterygii, Chondrichthyes, Placodermi, and
   Sarcopterygii) including taxa from most major orders. Morphological
   dissimilarity was measured by Gower's dissimilarity coefficient, and the
   differences between agnathan and gnathostome body forms across early
   vertebrate morphospace were compared using principal coordinate
   analysis. Our results indicate competition between some agnathans and
   gnathostomes is plausible, but not all agnathan groups were similar to
   gnathostomes. Furcacaudiformes (fork-tailed thelodonts) are distinct
   from other early vertebrate groups and the least likely to have competed
   with other groups.},

Title = {Single large AND several small habitat patches: A community perspective
   on their importance for biodiversity},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The debate whether single large or several small (SLOSS) patches benefit
   biodiversity has existed for decades, but recent literature provides
   increasing evidence for the importance of small habitats. Possible
   beneficial mechanisms include reduced presence of preda-tors and
   competitors in small habitat areas or specific functions such as
   stepping stones for dispersal. Given the increasing amount of studies
   highlighting individual behavioral differences that may influence these
   functions, we hypothesize that the advantage of small versus large
   habitat patches not only depends on patch functionality but also on the
   presence of animal personalities (i.e., risk-tolerant vs. risk-averse).
   Using an individual-based, spatially-explicit community model, we
   analyzed the diversity of mammal communities in landscapes consisting of
   a few large habitat islands interspersed with different amounts and
   sizes of small habitat patches. Within these heterogeneous environments,
   individuals compete for resources and form home-ranges, with only
   risk-tolerant individuals using habitat edges. Results show that when
   risk-tolerant individuals exist, small patches increase species
   diversity. A strong peak occurs at approximately 20\% habitat cover in
   small patches when those small habitats are only used for foraging but
   not for breeding and home-range core position. Additional usage as
   stepping stones for juvenile dispersal further increases species
   persistence. Over-all, our results reveal that a combination of a few
   large and several small habitat patches promotes biodiversity by
   enhancing land-scape heterogeneity. Here, heterogeneity is created by
   pronounced differences in habitat functionality, increasing edge
   density, and variability in habitat use by different behavioral types.
   The finding that a combination of single large AND several small (SLASS)
   patches is needed for effective biodiversity preservation has
   implications for advancing landscape conservation. Particularly in
   struc-turally poor agricultural areas, modern technology enables precise
   management with the opportunity to create small foraging habitats by
   excluding less profitable agricultural land from cultivation.(c) 2022

Title = {The importance of intraspecific variation in litter consumption rate of
   aquatic and terrestrial macro-detritivores},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Traits of organisms vary both at inter-and intraspecific levels. For
   macro-detritivores inhabiting lands and waters, there is only scattered
   information on the relative contribution of the intraspecific level for
   traits like litter consumption rates. This basic knowledge is
   nevertheless required to know how much the intraspecific level could
   matter to the study of macro-detritivore communities and ecosystem
   processes like leaf litter decomposition. We performed a laboratory
   experiment, where thirty individuals each of five abundant
   macro-detritivore species from a stream and a meadow ecosystem fed ash
   (Fraxinus excelsior) leaf litter in microcosms, twice at a 1-week
   interval. This nested and repeated design (individuals nested within
   species, species within ecosystems) was setup in controlled conditions
   and then analysed following a variance partitioning approach with linear
   mixed-effect models, to assess the variance attributable to different
   levels of biological organisation (i.e., inter-and intraspecific level).
   Then, we performed the same analysis, but separately on aquatic and
   terrestrial datasets. From the whole dataset, we demonstrated that half
   of the trait variation occurred at the interspecific level and a third
   at the intraspecific level. The variance found at the residual level,
   accounting for both measurement errors and for the variation of the same
   individuals between the two times (i.e., intra-individual variation),
   was significantly lower than what was observed at the other levels of
   biological organisation. Variance partitioning on separate aquatic and
   terrestrial datasets were consistent altogether, confirming the global
   pat-tern. With this study, we stress the relevance of the intraspecific
   level for future trait-based approaches applied to macro-detritivores.

Title = {What plant-pollinator network structure tells us about the mechanisms
   underlying the bidirectional biodiversity productivity relationship?},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Biodiversity - Ecosystem Functioning (B-EF) relationship remains a
   topic of ongoing debate with most studies focusing on primary
   productivity, and documenting that this relationship takes many forms.
   It remains unclear if biodiversity drives productivity or productivity
   shapes biodiversity or the relationship is bidirectional. B-EF studies
   explore almost exclusively the relationship between species richness and
   ecosystem functioning, while the role of biotic interactions, a key
   component of ecosystem functioning, has been neglected. Here, using data
   of 80 local plant-pollinator networks on 20 Aegean islands, and of gross
   primary productivity (GPP) from the MODIS satellite, we explored the
   bidirectional relationship between interaction network structure
   (nestedness and specialization), species richness (plants and
   pollinators) and mean and inter-annual variability of GPP. We found that
   nestedness and specialisation of plant-pollinator networks is driven by
   mean GPP. However, specialisation alone was a significant predictor of
   mean GPP, implying that networks tend to be more specialised in
   low-productivity areas. Pollinator species richness exerted a strong
   effect on mean GPP with the remaining factors playing a minor role,
   while the effect of mean GPP on pollinator species richness was weaker.
   Furthermore, the nestedness of plant-pollinator networks drives
   inter-annual variability of GPP with more nested networks displaying
   less variability, which is in accordance with the predictions of the
   insurance hypothesis. Plant and pollinator species richness were also
   associated with inter-annual variability of GPP. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Impacts of coastal realignment on biodiversity. A systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {48-62},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change and sea-level rise, several types of
   management are employed, including coastal realignment, which consists
   in reopening polders to marine intrusions. This intervention induces
   changes in biodiversity. A systematic review, including a meta-analysis,
   was carried out to assess the impact of coastal realignment on
   biodiversity. 4 476 references of published and gray literature were
   collected from two publication databases, Google Scholar and specialist
   websites. After a screening process, a database of 255 relevant articles
   corresponding to 866 studies (one taxon in one site) was constructed.
   Qualitative data were extracted in order to identify knowledge gaps and
   clusters. Focusing on the 190 studies with a Before
   After-Reference-Intervention experimental design, the risk of bias in
   studies was assessed. Excluding studies with a high level of bias or
   with non-extractable data, quantitative data related to abundance and
   species richness were analyzed from 19 and 24 studies respectively.
   Study sites are mostly in the USA and the UK, but also in Canada and
   other European countries. Plants are the main group of taxa studied
   while mammals, amphibians and reptiles are rarely considered. Similarly,
   studies focus mainly on species richness and abundance but much less on
   structural and functional parameters. The species richness of
   invertebrates and the abundance of fishes and shorebirds seem to
   increase after realignment, whereas the species richness of plants
   decreases. No changes in the species richness of birds, fishes and
   macrocrustaceans, and in the abundance of birds, invertebrates,
   macrocrustaceans and plants, were found. More research on lesser studied
   taxa and parameters is encouraged to obtain a broad view on the subject
   and help with decision-making in coastal-realignment operations by
   providing them with comprehensive ecological arguments. In order to
   enhance the reliability and reusability of research in other synthesis
   projects, it is important that data reporting be improved. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Distribution, Relative Abundance, and Length of Sculpins in the Elwha
   River Watershed Following the Removal of Two Hydroelectric Dams},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {292-306},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Dam removal often shows positive effects for many fish species,
   especially migratory species. In contrast, information regarding the
   effects on less migratory species is lacking. The Elwha River,
   Washington had two hydroelectric dams removed from 2011 to 2014, which
   resulted in the loss of two reservoirs. Because of glacial history, the
   Elwha River system has a depauperate freshwater fish fauna, including
   just two sculpin species (coastrange sculpin {[}Cottus aleuticus] and
   prickly sculpin {[}C. asper]). Both species exhibit a similar migratory
   life history strategy, which includes a planktonic larval stage that
   drifts downstream to a nursery area (e.g., lake, large river, or
   estuary), followed by an upriver movement pattern. Due to these
   characteristics, Elwha River dam removal and loss of the reservoirs may
   have had important effects on these two sculpin species. We sampled
   sculpins with longitudinal electrofishing surveys in 2018 and 2019 to
   evaluate their current distribution, relative abundance, and body size.
   These metrics were generally similar to other river systems in the
   Pacific Northwest, with fewer and larger migratory sculpins upstream.
   Additionally, we compared our findings to pre-dam surveys. After dam
   removal, sculpins in upstream reaches were less abundant and had a
   smaller range of sizes. This suggests the population characteristics of
   sculpins in the Elwha River has changed, but it is unclear how indirect
   effects, such as anadromous salmonid (Salmonidae) increases, may
   influence their overall abundance. This study also provides a baseline
   to monitor sculpin population changes in the future.},

Abstract = {The rapid and accurate taxonomic identification of fossils is of great
   significance in paleontology, biostratigraphy, and other fields.
   However, taxonomic identification is often labor-intensive and tedious,
   and the requisition of extensive prior knowledge about a taxonomic group
   also requires long-term training. Moreover, identification results are
   often inconsistent across researchers and communities. Accordingly, in
   this study, we used deep learning to support taxonomic identification.
   We used web crawlers to collect the Fossil Image Dataset (FID) via the
   Internet, obtaining 415,339 images belonging to 50 fossil clades. Then
   we trained three powerful convolutional neural networks on a
   high-performance workstation. The Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture
   achieved an average accuracy of 0.90 in the test dataset when transfer
   learning was applied. The clades of microfossils and vertebrate fossils
   exhibited the highest identification accuracies of 0.95 and 0.90,
   respectively. In contrast, clades of sponges, bryozoans, and trace
   fossils with various morphologies or with few samples in the dataset
   exhibited a performance below 0.80. Visual explanation methods further
   highlighted the discrepancies among different fossil clades and
   suggested similarities between the identifications made by machine
   classifiers and taxonomists. Collecting large paleontological datasets
   from various sources, such as the literature, digitization of dark data,
   citizen-science data, and public data from the Internet may further
   enhance deep learning methods and their adoption. Such developments will
   also possibly lead to image-based systematic taxonomy to be replaced by
   machine-aided classification in the future. Pioneering studies can
   include microfossils and some invertebrate fossils. To contribute to
   this development, we deployed our model on a server for public access at
   www.ai-fossil.com.},

Title = {Floral resource distribution and fitness consequences for two solitary
   bee species in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Floral resources are crucial for wild pollinators. Identifying the
   spatio-temporal floral resource use of wild pollinators and effects of
   resource distribution on their development might help to promote them
   and their pollination services to crops in agri-cultural landscapes.We
   established populations of Osmia cornuta and Osmia bicornis, two
   solitary wild bees, in 24 agricultural landscapes with varying floral
   resource availability. Based on their pollen use, we mapped the
   landscape-scale distribution of the visited plants, estimated pooled
   specific floral resource availabilities and measured its effects on
   reproductive output.Woody semi-natural habitats such as hedgerows
   provided the majority of pollen sources for both Osmia species. Pollen
   use differed strongly between the two species. The offspring of both
   Osmia increased with availability of pooled specific pollen resources.
   In accordance with their preferred pollen types, offspring of O. cornuta
   increased with increasing cover of trees and shrubs of the Rosaceae
   family, and that of O. bicornis with increasing cover of Papaver rhoeas,
   Ranunculus acris and Quercus spp. as well as with the proximity to
   oilseed rape. In spite of their specific responses to pollen resources,
   the offspring of both species decreased with the distance to forest. The
   floral resource availability did not significantly affect the proportion
   of adult females and the weight of the offspring. As forest does not
   appear to be a main foraging habitat for both species, the benefit of
   forest proximity indicates an additional role of forest in addition to
   food availability.Specific flowering plants and forests should thus be
   conserved and enhanced to maintain and support O. cornuta, O. bicornis
   and likely other wild bee populations in agricultural landscapes. The
   combined information of land cover and detailed floral resource
   availability gives a deeper understanding into population processes in
   agricultural landscapes.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {Tree diversity and shade rate in complex cocoa-based agroforests affect
   citrus foot rot disease},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {134-146},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The role of agroforest systems in pathogen regulation through structural
   characteristics such as shade and tree diversity is rec-ognized.
   However, few studies have examined the importance of these factors on
   the spread of diseases of associated fruit trees in agroforestry
   systems, especially cocoa-based agroforestry systems (CBAS). The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the effect of associated tree diversity and
   shade rate into CBAS on citrus Phytophthora foot rot disease (PFRD)
   intensity. The study was carried out in five citrus production basins of
   Cameroon, contrasted by ecology and rainfall regimes. A set of 33 CBAS
   plots was mapped and their species composition and vertical structure
   were determined. Field data were used to reconstruct CBAS in 3D with
   Shademotion 5.1.47 software. Using static simulations with shadow
   overlays, shade rate received by each citrus tree was calculated.
   Subsequently, citrus trees were grouped into three categories according
   to the shade rate they received: (i) full sun, with shade rate < 30\%;
   (ii) light shade with shade rate 30-70\% and, (iii) dense shade, with
   shade rate > 70\%. PFRD intensity was determined by measuring the canker
   extent relatively to the citrus crown circumference. A significant
   difference in PFRD intensity was observed between the different shade
   rates. Citrus trees receiving no shade were significantly more attacked
   by PFRD than those receiving little shade or dense shade. The
   antagonistic effect of shade was demonstrated. At the expense of factors
   related to the specific composition of the CBAS, shade, temperature,
   relative humidity and rainfall were found to be the main factors
   explaining PFRD intensity in CBAS. This study shows that microclimatic
   alterations due to the biodiversity in tropical agroforestry systems
   contribute to sustainable pest management.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Scale-dependent effectiveness of on-field vs. off-field
   agri-environmental measures for wild bees},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {62},
Pages = {55-60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on scheme type,
   taxon and landscape. Here, we show how spatial scale, i.e. studied
   transect, field or farm level, and controlling for yield loss, can
   drastically change the evaluation of biodiversity benefits of on-field
   (organic farming) vs. off-field (flower strips) schemes. We selected ten
   agricultural landscapes in Central Germany, each with a triplet of
   winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip,
   and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed the
   abundance of wild bees at field edges for two years. We found that
   comparing data at the transect level may lead to misleading conclusions,
   because flower strips, covering only 5\% of conventional fields, support
   fewer bees than large organic fields. However, a 50\% cereal yield loss
   of organic farming can be considered as equivalent to yield levels of 50
   ha conventional plus 50 ha flower strip. This would promote 3.5-times
   more bees than 100 ha organic farming. In conclusion, considering
   various scales in the evaluation of agri-environment scheme measures is
   necessary to reach a balanced understanding of their ecological and
   economic effects and their effectiveness. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Title = {Altering native community assembly history influences the performance of
   an annual invader},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {70-81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the determinants of early invasion resistance is a major
   challenge for designing plant communities that efficiently repel
   invaders. Recent evidence highlighted the significant role of priority
   effects in early community assembly as they affect species composition,
   structure and functional properties, but the consequences of native
   community assembly history on the success of subsequent invasions has
   not been elucidated yet. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated how
   (1) the identity of the first native colonizing species (one of two
   grasses: Dactylis glomerata and Lolium perenne, or two legumes:
   Onobrychis viciifolia and Trifolium repens), each introduced four weeks
   before the rest of the native community, and (2) timing of species
   establishment (synchronous vs. sequential sowing), influenced early
   establishment success of Ambrosia artemisiifolia, an annual noxious weed
   in Europe. First colonizer identity and establishment timing both
   affected early biomass production and composition of the community, and
   had implications for A. artemisiifolia early invasion success. Invasion
   success decreased when all native individuals were sown simultaneously,
   quickly generating a high biomass production, while it increased when
   the productive N-fixing legume T. repens was sown first. These findings
   support that native species assembly history matters to invasion
   resistance in the early growth stages, thus opening the way to more
   effective invasive species management strategies in restoration. (C)

Abstract = {Daily heterothermy is a strategy employed by endothermic birds and

   rate. We recorded nocturnal and diurnal rectal temperatures in three

Abstract = {Despite their key role in biodiversity conservation, forests in the
   Congo Basin are increasingly threatened by human activities, but it
   remains challenging to assess the impact of forest degradation under a
   more or less intact canopy. Likewise, forest recovery following
   agricultural abandonment remains poorly understood in the Congo Basin.
   Here, we surveyed 125 vegetation quadrats across 25 forest inventory
   plots in the Yangambi area. We aimed to find associations between both
   selective logging and forest recovery, and a range of forest community
   and tree community trait characteristics, as compared to reference
   undisturbed old-growth forest. We found that plots in undisturbed
   old-growth forest harboured both more tree individuals and tree species
   with a higher wood density as compared to plots in disturbed old-growth
   forest. In addition, their tree community composition was significantly
   different, whereas species diversity recovered since relatively recent
   agricultural abandonment (< 60 years), community composition and forest
   structure remained significantly different from the plots in undisturbed
   old-growth forest. Our study provides some insights into the rate of
   forest recovery in the Congo basin after agricultural abandonment and
   highlights the need of proper conservation of the remaining relatively
   undisturbed old-growth forests. Finally, we stress the need for more
   extensive vegetation surveys in the Congo Basin to further unravel the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbance.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of biocontrol potential and herbivore pressure in olive
   crops: Does integrated pest management make a difference?},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {115-124},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Agricultural policies in the European Union (EU) are increasingly
   promoting organic management and integrated pest management (IPM) as
   environmentally friendly alternatives to high-input conventional
   management. While there is consensus that organic management is largely
   beneficial for biodiversity, including the natural enemies of crop
   pests, IPM has been much less scrutinized. We conducted a meta-analysis
   based on 294 observations extracted from 18 studies to compare the
   effects of conventional, IPM and organic management on biocontrol
   potential and herbivore pressure in olive, an important cash crop in the
   EU. Information about the management practices used was also compiled to
   assess differences in intensity between the three management strategies.
   Results suggest that IPM is predominantly based on intensive practices,
   employing chemical control rather than preventive measures as a first
   resort. Biocontrol potential and herbivore pressure were similar in
   conventional management and IPM. Moreover, biocontrol potential was
   higher in organic crops than in crops under IPM, especially when
   considering canopy-dwelling natural enemies. Although organic management
   enhanced biocontrol potential, it also benefitted some olive pests, and
   in both cases effects were more pronounced at warmer temperatures. Our
   results suggest that, in its current form, IPM might not significantly
   affect biocontrol potential or herbivore pressure when compared with
   conventional olive crop management. A shift to a more comprehensive
   implementation of IPM practices is thus needed, involving the use of
   proactive measures to promote natural enemies and regulate olive pests
   before resorting to chemical control. Moreover, greater use of
   non-chemical inputs might be required for effective regulation of olive
   pests in organic olive crops. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Title = {Addition of fungal inoculum increases germination of orchid seeds in
   restored grasslands},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {71-82},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Grasslands restored on arable land often retain high residual nutrients,
   modified soil biota, and lower plant species diversity. Establishment of
   rare plant species with complex multitrophic interactions, typical of
   undisturbed nutrient-poor environments, may be hindered by the absence
   of interacting organisms. We hypothesised that the addition of a
   mycorrhizal symbiont improves the seed germination of orchids that
   crucially depend on fungi. We focused on grasslands restored on arable
   land 1-15 years ago featuring residual mineral nutrients and low organic
   matter contents compared to semi-natural grasslands and on four orchid
   species differing in the level of mycorrhizal specificity: high
   -Anacamptis pyramidalis and Orchis mascula -and low -Platanthera bifolia
   and Gymnadenia conopsea. Five fungal isolates obtained from non-green
   underground mycorrhizal orchid seedlings (protocorms) or adults' roots
   were tested for orchid-fungus compatibility under conditions in vitro.
   Orchid seeds inserted in retrievable seed packets were subsequently
   co-introduced with selected fungal isolates grown either on agar or
   sterilized hay into the soil of nine restored grasslands and incubated
   for twelve months. The identity of mycorrhizal fungi in retrieved
   protocorms was verified by molecular methods. The isolates that
   supported protocorm establishment in vitro enabled also protocorm
   formation in situ, but success rates differed among orchid species.
   While mycorrhizal specialists produced most protocorms after
   inoculation, the mycorrhizal generalists took advantage of naturally
   occurring fungi and produced some protocorms both in inoculated and
   uninoculated treatments. We showed that the addition of mycorrhizal
   fungi enhanced protocorm formation regardless of the modified soil
   environment, especially in mycorrhizal specialist orchids. This method
   may help to restore populations of native orchid species in their former
   distribution ranges, including farming-altered habitats. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Numbers and presence of guarding dogs affect wolf and leopard predation
   on livestock in northeastern Iran},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Livestock predation can pose socio-economic impacts on rural livelihoods
   and is the main cause of retaliatory killings of carni-vores in many
   countries. Therefore, appropriate interventions to reduce livestock
   predation, lower conflict and promote coexistence are needed. Livestock
   guarding dogs have been traditionally used to reduce predation, yet
   details regarding the use of dogs, espe-cially the number of dogs per
   herd effectively required, are rarely studied. In this study, we
   assessed how the number and presence of guarding dogs in a herd can
   reduce livestock losses to leopard and wolf in corrals at night and on
   grazing grounds in day-time. Using systematic interview surveys
   (2016-2019), we documented sheep/goat losses per attack (predation
   rates) from 139 shepherds across 32 villages around Golestan National
   Park, Iran. We analysed the effects of the number of dogs, presence of
   dogs, presence of shepherds, seasons, corral quality, livestock number,
   dog size, distance to villages and distance to reserve on predation
   rates using generalized linear models. For the leopard model, dog
   presence significantly decreased (beta = -1.80, 95\% confidence interval
   -2.61 to -0.81) predation rates during day-time to 1.41 individuals per
   attack. For wolf attacks in corrals at night, predation rates
   significantly decreased (beta = -0.29, -0.54 to -0.04) with increasing
   dog numbers. Also, shepherd presence (beta = -0.56, -1.10 to -0.10) and
   herd size (0 = -0.36, -0.60 to -0.12) significantly reduced predation
   rates. In the wolf day-time model, shepherd presence significantly
   decreased (beta = -0.93, -1.74 to -0.10) predation rates. Our study
   suggests that (1) using dogs can reduce, but not eliminate, predation by
   leopards during day-time; (2) with every additional dog, predation rates
   by wolves in corrals at night are likely to decrease on average by
   25.2\%; and (3) the presence of shepherds in corrals at night and during
   day-time can reduce predation rates.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Partitioning of arthropod species diversity in temperate meadows,
   wildflower areas and pastures},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {103-113},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {To counteract the rapidly ongoing species decline in modern
   agroecosystems, most European countries have developed and adopted
   agri-environment schemes. The efficiency of these schemes, however,
   ranges from successful to nearly ineffective. To estimate the efficiency
   of the Swiss agri-environment scheme in particular, we investigated the
   contribution of extensively managed pastures and meadows and wildflower
   areas to beetle, heteropteran bug and spider diversity. Extensively
   managed meadows were shown to contribute most to landscape-scale
   richness (highest species richness for beetles and bugs), followed by
   wildflower areas (bugs). Meadows harboured approximately twice as many
   beetle species unique to this habitat type than wildflower areas and
   pastures. Bug species unique to a specific habitat type were similar
   between meadows and wildflower areas, but much lower (approximately
   30\%) in pastures. To increase beetle species richness, extensively
   managed meadows should be represented more often in the landscape
   because meadows harboured the highest number of species and most
   uniquely found species. To increase species richness of true bugs, both
   meadows and wildflower areas should be represented more often in the
   landscape because they harboured more species and more uniquely found
   species compared to pastures. Across arthropod taxa and habitat types,
   beta diversity was more important for gamma diversity than a diversity,
   indicating that distinctiveness, rather than within-site diversity, was
   key in determining the contribution of sites to gamma (landscape)
   diversity. This substantiates the argument that increasing the number of
   sites is efficient to increase landscape species richness. The turnover
   component of beta diversity was far more important than the nestedness
   component for all arthropod taxa and habitat types and accounted for
   79.0\% to 95.4\% of total 0 diversity. In conclusion, extensively
   managed meadows and wildflower areas should be particularly promoted by
   the Swiss agri-environment scheme, as they contributed more to landscape
   species richness and species uniqueness than pastures. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Dynamic trait-niche relationships shape niche partitioning across
   habitat transformation gradients},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {59-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Multidimensional approaches examining complex trait-niche relationships
   are crucial to understand community assembly. This is particularly
   important across habitat transformation gradients because specialists
   are progressively substituted by generalists and, despite increasing
   functional homogenization, in both specialist and generalist communities
   niche partitioning is apparent. Here, in line with the continuum
   hypothesis, we expected that divergent trait-niche relationships would
   arise in passerine assemblages across the natural-to-urban
   transformation gradient. More specifically, we expected that traits
   linking form to function would be more important in less transformed
   habitats, while population density and traits linked to dispersal and
   dominance would predominate in more transformed habitats. Accordingly,
   we found that beak length and its interaction with tarsus length
   correlated significantly with isotopic niches in natural and rural
   habitats, where specialists predominate. Conversely, body size and
   aggressiveness only showed significant relationships with isotopic
   niches with increasing habitat transformation, where generalists
   prevail. Interestingly, we recorded a mix of these processes in rural
   habitats, which acted as a frontier between these two domains. Our study
   is thus important in showing that a complex combination of morphological
   and behavioral traits determine niche characteristics, and that these
   relationships are dynamic across habitat transformation gradients. (C)

Title = {A comprehensive review of mammalian carnivore translocations},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {554-572},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Carnivore conservation translocations are assumed to provide numerous
   ecological benefits, including conservation of the translocated
   carnivores, regulation of prey species and restoration of ecosystems.
   Reviews of mammalian carnivore conservation translocations and resultant
   ecosystem effects have focussed on large carnivores. We reviewed global
   terrestrial carnivore conservation translocations across all taxa,
   including taxonomic bias, problems influencing their population
   establishment and their ecosystem effects. We obtained data from 536
   conservation translocations of 54 species of terrestrial mammalian
   carnivore (order Carnivora and family Dasyuridae, 30 g-196 kg),
   comprising mostly Mustelidae, Canidae, and Felidae species. A third of
   all projects translocated carnivores into South Africa and a third into
   fenced reserves. Significant bias occurred relative to threat status,
   with over-representation of Mustelidae and Canidae conservation
   translocations relative to the number of threatened species in each
   family. Additionally, conservation translocations of small carnivores
   were generally under-represented compared to those of large carnivores.
   Seventeen percent of small carnivore conservation translocations failed,
   compared with 25\% of large carnivore conservation translocations;
   failure was primarily due to reported anthropogenic mortality. Effects
   on resident prey species or ecosystems of carnivore conservation
   translocations were rarely investigated. We found no significant
   relationship between the carnivore family or size and effects on prey or
   ecosystems; however, prey impacts were frequently attributed to Felidae,
   and ecosystem effects were frequently attributed to Canidae and Felidae.
   Challenges to translocations of mammalian carnivores include threats to
   resident threatened prey species and difficulties in monitoring the
   ecological effects of carnivore conservation translocations. Poor
   postrelease monitoring and a lack of empirical studies remain persistent
   problems, contributing to the poor understanding of ecosystem effects
   following carnivore conservation translocations.},

Abstract = {The loss of large frugivores leads to seed dispersal loss and
   regeneration failure of numerous large-seeded trees near mother trees.
   Although Janzen-Connell effects are considered as the primary underlying
   cause, other factors remain understudied. Here, we used a field
   experiment to test the impact of flesh persistence on the recruitment of
   two large-seeded Sapotaceae species that lost their dispersers. In the
   rainforest of Mare Longue (Reunion), we sowed 3840 seeds in a
   four-factor design: seed treatment (seed cleaning; flesh persistence),
   canopy closure (understory; gap), year of sowing (01/2018; 11/2019) and
   species (Labourdonnaisia calophylloides, Mimusops balata). We also used
   camera traps to evaluate the impact of extant vertebrates. Seed
   treatment was by far the most influential factor: flesh persistence led
   to seedling recruitment divided by 3,2 on average, mainly due to failure
   of germination or seedling emergence. There were also significant
   variations in recruitment between species, years and canopy closure
   levels, notably due to the behaviour of the invasive fauna, especially
   giant snails that could unexpectedly restore recruitment by feeding on
   fruit flesh. Together, our results demonstrate strongly depleted
   recruitment due to flesh persistence and the importance of field
   experiments to understand the processes at work in complex ecosystems
   with novel plant-animal interactions.},

Abstract = {Understanding the biogeography of species in space and time is essential
   for the development of evidence-based conservation and management plans.
   In this paper we propose a biogeographical spatial modelling approach
   based on the favourability function, and developed under a fuzzy logic
   framework, to unravel the historical biogeography of the two European
   wild rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus (Oca) and
   Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus (Occ), in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We
   first reviewed published and unpublished information (PhD theses,
   scientific papers, technical reports, etc.) on the occurrence of each
   rabbit subspecies throughout the IP. We compiled data from 201 Iberian
   rabbit populations and from genetic information of 4348 rabbits that was
   used to identify subspecies. Only populations in which all rabbits
   surveyed belonged to one subspecies were considered in the modelling
   procedure. We modelled rabbit subspecies' distribution separately for
   populations in which nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences were
   available. We employed a trend surface analysis developed by logistic
   regressions, which applied the favourability function and fuzzy logic
   operations. Using our approach we indentify the expansion cores from
   which both rabbit subspecies would have expanded after isolation during
   the last glaciations. Furthermore, we reveal the possible existence of a
   competitive exclusion zone between both rabbit subspecies that may have
   prevented their further expansion. Finally, our study shows that the Oca
   subspecies is distributed in north-western areas previously attributed
   to Occ. This assessment of the actual and historical distribution of
   each rabbit subspecies may allow more specific conservation
   interventions, as the two subspecies are not just genetically distinct
   but also ecologically and behaviourally different. Our methodological
   approach could be useful in unravelling the historical biogeography of
   other lesser-known species.},

Title = {Directional asymmetry and direction-giving factors: Lessons from flowers

Abstract = {Directional asymmetry is a systematic difference between the left and
   right sides for structures with bilateral symmetry or a systematic
   differentiation among repeated parts for complex symmetry. This study
   explores factors that produce directional asymmetry in the flower of
   Iris pumila, a structure with complex symmetry that makes it possible to
   investigate multiple such factors simultaneously. The shapes and sizes
   of three types of floral organs, the falls, standards, and style
   branches, were quantified using the methods of geometric morphometrics.
   For each flower, this study recorded the compass orientations of floral
   organs as well as their anatomical orientations relative to the two
   spathes subtending each flower. To characterize directional asymmetry at
   the whole-flower level, differences in the average sizes and shapes
   according to compass orientation and relative orientation were computed,
   and the left-right asymmetry was also evaluated for each individual
   organ. No size or shape differences within flowers were found in
   relation to anatomical position; this may relate to the terminal
   position of flowers in Iris pumila, suggesting that there may be no
   adaxial-abaxial polarity, which is very prominent in many other taxa.
   There was clear directional asymmetry of shape in relation to compass
   orientation, presumably driven by a consistent environmental gradient
   such as solar irradiance. There was also clear directional asymmetry
   between left and right halves of every floral organ, most likely related
   to the arrangement of organs in the bud. These findings indicate that
   different factors are acting to produce directional asymmetry at
   different levels. In conventional analyses not recording flower
   orientations, these effects would be impossible to disentangle from each
   other and would probably be included as part of fluctuating asymmetry.},

Title = {Testing the niche variation hypothesis in pinnipedsPalabras clave},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {497-506},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Individual trophic specialisation (ITS) has many important consequences
   for ecological and evolutionary processes. An old hypothesis
   highlighting the relevance of ITS is the niche variation hypothesis
   (NVH), which proposes that populations composed of trophically
   specialised individuals have a wider population niche than populations
   composed of more generalist individuals. Pinnipeds are a good model to
   test the NVH because they are mostly generalist species, living in dense
   colonies, and exhibiting variation in trophic niche width among
   populations. We tested the NVH in pinnipeds using longitudinal isotopic
   data: published delta C-13 and delta N-15 data obtained from sequential
   sections of whiskers (vibrissae) from individuals belonging to 14
   populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   evaluating the NVH by using longitudinal isotopic data. We compiled
   studies that published raw data on delta C-13 and delta N-15 for
   pinniped whisker segments to estimate the within-individual and the
   between-individuals components of variance, the total niche width (TNW),
   and ITS. One-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 or delta N-15) and
   multi-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses were used.
   Also, we tested whether an evolutionary component would affect the
   degree of ITS among pinniped species with different levels of shared
   ancestry. Our results indicate that, in line with the NVH, pinniped
   populations composed of more specialised individuals tend to show wider
   trophic niches. When analysing each sex separately, the hypothesis is
   supported for females but not for males. We believe that physiological
   and behavioural differences between sexes may explain this result. In
   females, high TNW is mainly related to greater differentiation among
   individuals, while in males, it is mainly related to high diversity of
   resources consumed by all individuals.},

Title = {Effective hawkmoth pollination in the primarily bee-pollinated Salvia

Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Many plants exhibit floral traits that are directed to specific
   pollinator groups. Nevertheless, they can also attract less-adapted
   pollinators and gain benefits under certain conditions, resulting in
   adapted generalization. This may be the case in Salvia daiguii
   (Lamiaceae), an endangered, bee-pollinated species native to the
   Tianmenshan National Forest Park, China. The flower appears
   phenotypically specialized to bees but is also visited by Macroglossum
   bombylans. In the present study, we test whether the moth is an
   effective pollinator of S. daiguii. We quantified and compared the
   frequency of flower visits by bees and moths and the number of pollen
   grains deposited on the stigma after a single visit. We also recorded
   the movements of pistils and stamens of S. daiguii and the behavior of
   the hawkmoth at the flowers. We found that Apis cerana was the
   predominant pollinator, depositing an average of 4.74 pollen grains on
   the stigma after a single visit. However, as the style bends downward
   during anthesis and reaches the same level as the anthers, Macroglossum
   individuals hovering around the flowers were also able to effectively
   transfer pollen to the stigma. On average, 1.38 pollen grains were
   deposited on the stigma during a single visit. We demonstrate for the
   first time that the hawkmoth is an effective secondary pollinator in the
   primarily bee-pollinated S. daiguii. Style bending allows a nectar thief
   to become a secondary pollinator. The extent of pollinator
   generalization is thus increased without affecting the fundamental
   phenotype adapted to bees as the main pollinators.},

Abstract = {Termites are essential components of tropical ecosystems, in which they
   provide fundamental ecosystem services, such as decomposition of dead
   plant material, fostering of soil mineralization and provisioning of new
   microhabitats. We investigated the termite communities of four habitats
   in two protected areas in West Africa, which differ in management
   effectiveness: the strictly protected Lamto Reserve (LR) and the
   Marahoue National Park (MNP), which suffers from anthropogenic
   disturbance despite its protection status. We tested the effect of
   disturbance on species composition, richness and abundance as well as on
   functional (feeding type) composition. The effect of disturbance was
   clearly visible in the termite communities. Compared to the LR, the MNP
   had less termite species overall and in all habitats except the shrub
   savannah. Also the abundance of termites was generally reduced and a
   decrease of soil feeders recorded. The latter is well-known to be
   sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance in forests. Comparing our results
   with other studies, we were able to identify suitable bioindicators of
   ecosystem health for West-African savannahs. Furthermore, we discuss the
   potential consequences of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem
   services provided by termites.},

Abstract = {Elephants are attracted to nutrient hotspots created through short
   duration overnight cattle corralling (hereafter kraaling) in natural
   rangelands at Debshan, a mixed cattle-wildlife private ranch in central
   Zimbabwe, causing severe tree damage. We determined the effect of age of
   nutrient hotspot (i.e., time after kraal use) on elephant use and the
   extent of tree damage. Elephant use and tree damage were assessed in
   nutrient hotspots of varying ages (6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after
   kraal use) and in surrounding landscape. We also compared Acacia karroo
   bark nutrient and soil nutrient concentration between nutrient hotspots
   (24 months after kraal use) and the surrounding landscape. Elephant use
   of nutrient hotspots was highest at 12 and 24 months after kraaling. The
   most severely damaged trees were in the 12-, 24- and 36-month-old
   nutrient hotspots. Acacia karroo bark nutrient concentrations (nitrogen,
   potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron) were higher in nutrient hotspots
   than surrounding vegetation, while soil nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus,
   calcium and potassium) were higher in nutrient hotspots than surrounding
   landscape. We concluded that elephants mostly used nutrient hotspots 12
   and 24 months after kraaling, while severe tree damage occurred 12, 24
   and 36 months after kraal use.},

   sand cover, vegetation cover, visibility, and height of nearest
   vegetation. The peninsular shape of the maritime forest supported
   greater edge habitat compared to the interior forest, encouraging
   greater avian diversity. This study provides baseline information for

Abstract = {Litter production plays an important role in the functioning of the
   ecosystem, providing several ecosystem services, such as nutrients
   cycling and carbon storage. We studied litter production patterns and
   its relationship with forest structure over a chronosequence of
   secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. In the study area, 15 pairs
   of mature and secondary forest were used, in a chronological sequence,
   being 10, 25 and 40-year-old secondary forests and mature forests. Plots
   were created for the collection of aboveground biomass data, and within
   these plots, litter collectors were installed and monitored for 1 year.
   The results showed that litter production was lower in 10-year-old
   secondary forests when compared with older forests. On the other hand,
   in the 10-year-old forests, annual litter production represents 47.8\%
   of the stored biomass, while in mature forests annual litter production
   represents only 4\%. We found that structural variables (basal area,
   number of stems and canopy opening) influence significantly litter
   production, as well as litter as percentage of forest biomass. The study
   emphasizes the importance of biomass production through litterfall in
   regenerating tropical forests, and its importance for carbon storage and
   for the maintenance of ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Animals which migrate by flying should be subject to selection for
   optimal wing characteristics that maximize energy efficiency during
   migration. We investigated wing shape and wing area variation in the
   Globe Skimmer Dragonfly Pantala flavescens, which has the longest known
   migration of any insect. Wing shape and wing area differences between
   individuals in southern Peninsular India, and migrating individuals at a
   stop-over site on the Maldives, were compared. Results suggest that
   individuals which successfully reached the Maldives, on their way from
   India to Africa, had a broader wing base and an overall more slender
   wing shape than individuals in southern India. Contrary to our
   expectations, wing area did not differ significantly in most of our
   comparisons between southern India and the Maldives, suggesting that
   wing shape is more important than wing area for successful migration in
   P. flavescens. The results provide indirect evidence of natural
   selection on wing shape in a migrating dragonfly.},

Title = {Grassland plant and invertebrate species richness increases from mowing
   are mediated by impacts on soil chemistry},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Pasture and improved grasslands are commonly managed by a combination of
   artificial fertilisation and biomass removal, but a deeper understanding
   of how management options interact over the long-term are required to
   improve sustainability. Studies of multi-trophic responses to these
   options can provide important insights for biodiversity and soil
   management, particularly when they cover long time periods. In this
   study, we provide a novel perspective on long-term experimental field
   studies of grassland management by examining the direct and indirect
   effects of N fertilisation and mowing (with biomass retention and
   removal) on above-ground biodiversity, below-ground soil chemistry and
   their interactions. Our experimental treatments were applied annually
   from 1994 in medium to high soil fertility conditions on a non-native
   pastoral farm in New Zealand, and analysis of data to 2013 show that in
   general, plants and soil properties did not respond to N fertiliser
   treatments. In response to mowing regimes, soil properties exhibited
   subtle, but annually varying changes mostly related to biomass retention
   or removal, and plant richness was consistently higher under all mowing
   treatments. The management regime with the greatest gains in diversity
   also depended on year of study. We further analysed the indirect effects
   of mowing treatments on plant and arthropod richness via soil properties
   using structural equation modelling, and found that the impact of mowing
   is likely to be mediated by soil chemistry changes. In particular, the
   direct positive impact of mowing on plant richness may be offset by
   changes to soil properties, depending on whether biomass is retained or
   removed. We suggest that management regime effects on soil chemistry may
   limit plant composition changes to those species able to take advantage
   of altered conditions. These findings suggest that management to improve
   grassland diversity and soil conditions should consider the abiotic
   history and conditions of the site. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {The repeated return of tetrapods to aquatic life provides some of the
   best-known examples of convergent evolution. One comparison that has
   received relatively little focus is that of mosasaurids (a group of Late
   Cretaceous squamates) and archaic cetaceans (the ancestors of modern
   whales and dolphins), both of which show high levels of craniodental
   disparity, similar initial trends in locomotory evolution, and global
   distributions. Here we investigate convergence in skull ecomorphology
   during the initial aquatic radiations of these groups. A series of
   functionally informative ratios were calculated from 38 species, with
   ordination techniques used to reconstruct patterns of functional
   ecomorphospace occupation. The earliest fully aquatic members of each
   clade occupied different regions of ecomorphospace, with basilosaurids
   and early russellosaurines exhibiting marked differences in cranial
   functional morphology. Subsequent ecomorphological trajectories notably
   diverge: mosasaurids radiated across ecomorphospace with no clear
   pattern and numerous reversals, whereas cetaceans notably evolved toward
   shallower, more elongated snouts, perhaps as an adaptation for capturing
   smaller prey. Incomplete convergence between the two groups is present
   among megapredatory and longirostrine forms, suggesting stronger
   selection on cranial function in these two ecomorphologies. Our study
   highlights both the similarities and divergences in craniodental
   evolutionary trajectories between archaic cetaceans and mosasaurids,
   with convergences transcending their deeply divergent phylogenetic
   affinities.},

Abstract = {Covariation among discrete phenotypes can arise due to selection for
   shared functions, and/or shared genetic and developmental underpinnings.
   The consequences of such phenotypic integration are far-reaching and can
   act to either facilitate or limit morphological variation. The
   vertebrate brain is known to act as an ``organizer{''} of craniofacial
   development, secreting morphogens that can affect the shape of the
   growing neurocranium, consistent with roles for pleiotropy in
   brain-neurocranium covariation. Here, we test this hypothesis in cichlid
   fishes by first examining the degree of shape integration between the
   brain and the neurocranium using three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics in an F-5 hybrid population, and then genetically mapping
   trait covariation using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We
   observe shape associations between the brain and the neurocranium, a
   pattern that holds even when we assess associations between the brain
   and constituent parts of the neurocranium: the rostrum and braincase. We
   also recover robust genetic signals for both hard- and soft-tissue
   traits and identify a genomic region where QTL for the brain and
   braincase overlap, implicating a role for pleiotropy in patterning trait
   covariation. Fine mapping of the overlapping genomic region identifies a
   candidate gene, notch1a, which is known to be involved in patterning
   skeletal and neural tissues during development. Taken together, these
   data offer a genetic hypothesis for brain-neurocranium covariation, as
   well as a potential mechanism by which behavioral shifts may
   simultaneously drive rapid change in neuroanatomy and craniofacial
   morphology.},

Title = {Evolution of the therian face through complete loss of the premaxilla},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {103-118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The anatomical framework of the jawbones is highly conserved among most
   of the Osteichthyes, including the tetrapods. However, our recent study
   suggested that the premaxilla, the rostralmost upper jaw bone, was
   rearranged during the evolution of therian mammals, being replaced by
   the septomaxilla at least in the lateral part. In the present study, to
   understand more about the process of evolution from the ancestral upper
   jaw to the therian face, we re-examined the development of the therian
   premaxilla (incisive bone). By comparing mouse, bat, goat, and cattle
   fetuses, we confirmed that the therian premaxilla has dual developmental
   origins, the lateral body and the palatine process. This dual
   development is widely conserved among the therian mammals.
   Cell-lineage-tracing experiments using Dlx1-CreER(T2) mice revealed that
   the palatine process arises in the ventral part of the premandibular
   domain, where the nasopalatine nerve distributes, whereas the lateral
   body develops from the maxillary prominence in the domain of the
   maxillary nerve. Through comparative analysis using various tetrapods,
   we concluded that the palatine process should not be considered part of
   the ancestral premaxilla. It rather corresponds to the anterior region
   of the vomerine bone of nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, the present
   findings indicate that the true premaxilla was completely lost during
   the evolution of the therian mammals, resulting in the establishment of
   the unique therian face as an evolutionary novelty. Reconsideration of
   the homological framework of the cranial skeleton based on the
   topographical relationships of the ossification center during embryonic
   development is warranted.},

Title = {Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican
   cavefish},

Abstract = {Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with
   various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most
   organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship
   between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in
   our understanding of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus,
   consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at
   least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that
   inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application
   of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping
   have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of
   complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with
   surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye
   degeneration, insomnia, albinism, and enhanced mechanosensory function.
   The interfertility of different populations from the same species
   provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between
   evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and
   morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships
   between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to
   test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed
   differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex
   between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship
   between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for
   locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex, and
   morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body
   length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between
   increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were
   few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and
   morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie
   the evolution of the measured behavioral and morphological traits. Taken
   together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genetic
   underpinnings of naturally occurring variation in morphological and
   behavioral traits.},

Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {327-331},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Laportea bulbifera (Ulticaceae) is a monoecious plant that has a unique
   sexual expression: female flowers form on the upper part and male
   flowers on the lower part on an individual shoot. Therefore, for the
   seed reproduction, pollen needs to be transferred from the lower (male)
   to the upper (female) flowers. Our observations of male flowers
   confirmed that pollen was dispersed upward by ``explosive wind
   pollination.{''} A male flower has five stamens, and when the petals are
   open, the stamens are caught in a pistillode. With the growth of the
   stamens, they are released from the pistillode and then straightened
   with a spring-like movement of the filament. At the same time, the
   anthers dehisce, and the pollen is dispersed. The explosive release of
   pollen from the anthers and light wind in the habitat (forest edge or
   gap) contributes to wind pollination in L. bulbifera.},

Title = {Floral and pollination biology of the critically endangered insular
   orchid Calanthe amamiana: Implications for in situ conservation},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {294-303},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Calanthe amamiana is a terrestrial orchid that thrives on the shady
   forest floors of broad-leaved forests on Amami Island, central Ryukyus,
   Japan. Here, I report on the floral and pollination biology of this
   critically endangered orchid based on a 7-year study conducted in the
   species' natural habitats. As the nectarless flowers are probably
   self-compatible but are unable to autonomously self-pollinate, they need
   to attract pollen vectors by deceit for pollination. To advertise
   themselves, the flowering inflorescences, which comprise a few to dozens
   of flowers, use whitish floral colors that are comparatively conspicuous
   against the shaded background. The exclusive pollinator was the
   long-horned bee Eucera okinawae, which nests in soils of the forest
   floor, although bee abundance varied considerably among study years.
   Natural fruit-set ratios were generally low but showed interannual
   variation. The annual fruit-set ratios were positively correlated with
   annual bee abundance, thereby suggesting that under natural conditions,
   the orchid is pollinator-limited. Given that C. amamiana is dependent
   exclusively on E. okinawae for pollination and is also probably
   pollinator-limited, conservation plans for this orchid should take into
   consideration the welfare of long-horned bees. In particular, as
   nectariferous flowers were unavailable within broad-leaved forests, to
   satisfy the foraging requirements of long-horned bees, conservation
   managers should be cognizant of conservation values of flowering plants
   distributed in sun-lit sites near orchid habitats, and manage those in
   an appropriate manner.},

Title = {Serotiny as a reproductive strategy in the specially protected species
   Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {361-368},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plant species with aerial seed banks are commonly referred to as
   ``serotinous,{''} an adaptation in which seed release happens in
   response to an environmental trigger. Individuals of Ariocarpus
   kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae), a specially protected species, store some
   seeds on the plant over 1 year. We examined the seed retention time, the
   release mechanism, and the germination behavior of this species in
   Central Mexico. Flowers produced in a population of A. kotschoubeyanus
   were monitored, and the number of fruits retained or expelled was
   determined to calculate the serotiny degree (the number of seeds
   retained in the tubercules of the plant divided by the total number of
   seeds produced per plant). The seed retention in previous years was
   estimated for 30 individuals. The dynamics of retained seeds in the
   mother plant (seed age in ``rings{''}) were determined from the annual
   average production of tubercules per individual, using observations for
   5 years. A germination test employing the seeds collected from recently
   formed fruits and those obtained from different rings was conducted. We
   observed that 86.6\% of the plants showed seed retention (aerial seed
   bank) in some ring of the aerial stems. The serotiny degree was 37.3,
   having 32.68 seeds per plant. Seeds retained in the ``rings{''} from 1-
   to 24-year-old plants had a higher germination proportion (between 0.40
   and 0.73) than fresh seeds (0.13). Seeds increase their germination
   proportion with age; thus, seed retention by tubercules (serotiny)
   represents a reproductive strategy to conserve germplasm until favorable
   conditions to germinate are present.},

Abstract = {Many studies of rodents rely on the use of live trapping. Comparative
   studies of trap type provide researchers with information that can
   inform their trapping design, yet relatively few comparative studies
   include economical mesh traps, such as Fitch traps. I compared the
   effectivess of Sherman box traps and Fitch mesh traps for rodent
   sampling in a grassland ecosystem. Between 2016 and 2017, I set 120 trap
   stations with both Fitch and Sherman traps for a total of 6000 trap
   nights at a single tallgrass prairie-restoration site in northern
   Illinois. I compared trap effectivess overall and for each species
   captured. Fitch traps were significantly better at capturing ground
   squirrels than Sherman traps and comparable to Sherman traps at
   capturing voles and jumping mice. These results demonstrate Fitch traps
   provide a viable alternative to Sherman traps for sampling at this
   location and indicate they should be considered in future comparative
   studies to further assess their effectiveness, especially in grasslands.},

Abstract = {Peromyscus leucopus (White-Footed Deermouse) and Peromyscus maniculatus
   ( North American Deermouse) are 2 widespread rodent species in North
   America, with North American Deermice more ecologically diverse and
   widely distributed than White-footed Deermice. Commonly, White-Footed
   Deermice are ecological generalists, and North American Deermice are
   ecological specialists. In the Inner Bluegrass Region of Kentucky, these
   2 species are sympatric in agroecosystems habitats, including the
   University of Kentucky North Farm. This farm was the most trapped
   location in central Kentucky from 1950 to 1968, with results indicating
   the White-Footed Deermoouse was the more common of these species.
   Trapping from 1995 to 2015 found that North American Deermice were
   caught rarely. Our study examined agroecosystems habitats at the UK
   North Farm, including all perennial and annual habitats, to determine
   the relative abundance and habitat use by both these species. In our
   study, North American Deermice was the most commonly captured species;
   it was trapped rarely in perennial habitats but much more frequently in
   annual crops. Perennial clover fields and Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) were
   the 2 exceptions; however, these are short crops with exposed soil
   between rows. Essentially, North American Deermice were observed in the
   agricultural equivalent of early successional habitat. In contrast,
   White-Footed Deermice were captured in both perennial and annual
   habitats, but more commonly in perennial habitats, the exception being
   annual Salvia hispanica (Chia) fields where dense, green plants produced
   a thick canopy. Overall, the best predictor of habitat for North
   American Deermice was bare, exposed soil, whereas the best predictor for
   White-Footed Deermice was dense growth and overhead cover.},

Title = {Dragonfly Biodiversity at Abandoned Work Sites: Dredge-spoil Ponds of

Abstract = {There are few undisturbed, freshwater habitats remaining in the
   populated areas of the United States. Aquatic organisms, such as
   dragonflies (Odonata), have therefore either had to adapt to disturbed
   and modified secondary habitats, such as farms, golf courses,
   storm-water remediation basins, and community-park ponds, or risk
   extirpation. The species that readily adapt to these habitats are
   usually widespread common species. However, other aquatic habitats
   inadvertently created at abandoned work sites often evolve distinctive
   characteristics over time that provide refuge for species rarely or
   never found at deliberately created pond habitats. For 17 years, we have
   monitored the diverse Odonata fauna at several floristically distinct
   ponds formed in depressions left from the dredging of the Chesapeake and
   Delaware Canal in the 1960s. Among the species found are ones not known
   elsewhere locally or ones found in unusual abundance at 1 or more of the
   ponds, though infrequently encountered regionally. These dredge-spoil
   ponds are important for conserving regional Odonata biodiversity by
   providing unique habitats in an increasingly urbanized environment.},

Title = {Coyote diet in North America: geographic and ecological patterns during
   range expansion},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Coyotes Canis latrans have expanded their geographic range by 40\% in
   the last 120 years, raising questions about their ecological impacts in
   the newly colonised areas. Despite a wealth of local knowledge on coyote
   diet in North America, we have little information about how and why diet
   might vary throughout the species' range. We conducted the first
   rangewide meta-analysis of coyote diet by investigating how ecoregion,
   coyote mass, environmental conditions, presence of top predators and
   alternative food items are related to coyote dietary diversity, as well
   as consumption of small mammals, lagomorphs, vegetation and ungulates.
   Using data from 93 studies, we used generalised linear mixed models to
   determine which variables best explained coyote dietary patterns.
   Coyotes were generally more carnivorous in temperate forests than in
   other ecoregions, primarily due to greater ungulate consumption. Dietary
   diversity was most influenced via a negative effect of mammal
   consumption; coyote diet was more diverse in the spring and where human
   footprint was greater. There was minor variation in small mammal
   consumption, but lagomorph consumption was greater in spring and winter
   and when coyotes were larger. Vegetation consumption was greatest in
   summer and autumn. Ungulate consumption was positively related to coyote
   mass, snow cover and the presence of grey wolves Canis lupus. Both
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors were related to coyote diet. Larger
   coyotes ate larger foods, which parallels the relationship between mass
   and prey size across the carnivore guild. Wolves and humans have
   opposing effects on coyote diet. Coyotes seem to prioritise eating wild
   mammals, though more work is needed to quantify scavenging.
   Collectively, our findings emphasise the need for continued local or
   regional studies to understand the highly variable ecological effects of
   coyotes within the diverse ecosystems they currently inhabit and are
   poised to inhabit.},

Abstract = {Ediacaran embryo-like spherical fossils exhibit diverse cell adhesion
   patterns resembling partial cleavage-stage embryos of living animals.
   Two three-celled specimens characterized by a pair of small cells
   overlying a large cell have been recovered from the Ediacaran Zhenba
   microfossil assemblage. Their cell adhesion pattern is highly comparable
   to a phenomenon reported from the Weng'an biota that was interpreted as
   fossil embryos undergoing discoidal cleavage. However, our specimens
   contain fewer cells and thus probably represent developmental precursors
   of the Weng'an counterparts. Additionally, new material shows several
   anatomical features that are inconsistent with an embryo interpretation,
   including (1) an unusually large volume of ``blastomeres,{''} (2) a
   putative nucleus preserved within the large ``yolk cell,{''} and (3)
   completely separated cells. Collectively, the Zhenba embryo-like
   specimens permit a reconstruction of the consecutive developmental
   sequence from single-celled individuals to the three-celled individuals,
   leading us to interpret the newly found specimens as products of
   abnormal development of Ediacaran embryo-like organisms whose affinity
   remains unresolved.},

Title = {Breaking constraints: The development and evolution of extreme fin

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {109-124},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The developmental process establishes the foundation upon which natural
   selection may act. In that same sense, it is inundated with numerous
   constraints that work to limit the directions in which a phenotype may
   respond to selective pressures. Extreme phenotypes have been used in the
   past to identify tradeoffs and constraints and may aid in recognizing
   how alterations to the Bauplane can influence the trajectories of
   lineages. The Bramidae, a family of Scombriformes consisting of 20
   extant species, are unique in that five species greatly deviate from the
   stout, ovaloid bodies that typify the bramids. The Ptericlinae, or
   fanfishes, are instead characterized by relatively elongated body plans
   and extreme modifications to their medial fins. Here, we explore the
   development of Bramidae morphologies and examine them through a
   phylogenetic lens to investigate the concepts of developmental and
   evolutionary constraints. Contrary to our predictions that the fanfishes
   had been constrained by inherited properties of an ancestral state, we
   find that the fanfishes exhibit both increased rates of trait evolution
   and differ substantially from the other bramids in their developmental
   trajectories. Conversely, the remaining bramid genera differ little,
   both among one another and in comparison, to the sister family
   Caristiidae. In all, our data suggest that the fanfishes have broken
   constraints, thereby allowing them to mitigate trade-offs on distinctive
   aspects of morphology.},

Abstract = {The unavoidable impact of roads on arboreal fauna in protected areas has
   received little attention. We investigated this impact on two gibbon
   species in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand: two groups had home ranges
   traversed by roads (roadside groups) and another two lived nearby roads
   (interior groups). Roads partially delineated the edges of home ranges
   of roadside groups, and gibbons crossed them only at a few locations.
   Gibbons' space use decreased near roads for roadside groups and showed
   road reluctance as their crossing rates were smaller than those produced
   by a null movement model. Generalised linear models (GLMs) indicated
   that a long canopy gap reduced gibbons' crossing probability, whereas
   forest cover had a positive effect. A large part of the road network had
   a low probability of being crossed by gibbons according to GLMs,
   especially at areas around park headquarters. Roads were still
   relatively permeable to gibbon movement with a mean 35\% crossing
   probability. The relatively short and narrow road network in the park
   constitutes a positive assessment of the standards of how roads should
   be built in protected areas. Nonetheless, this assessment might be the
   consequence of the park being set in a mountainous region with
   difficulties of road development.},

Abstract = {Florivory in Chamaecrista varies in occurrence, intensity, and the
   floral structures affected. As flowers are multifunctional units, the
   type of damage can impact reproductive success in different ways.
   Oil-resin-secreting trichomes, present in the sepals of Chamaecrista
   species, section Absus, are suggested to inhibit florivory. We recorded
   florivory in Chamaecrista cathartica and Chamaecrista catharticoides in
   order to determine the frequency of damage, floral whorls most damaged,
   impact on reproduction, and effectiveness of secretory trichomes in
   inhibiting florivory. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual do
   Ibitipoca, Brazil. Twenty individuals of each species were monitored
   monthly over two bloom periods to record the flowering intensity, rates
   of florivory, and fruit set and to determine the effectiveness of
   trichomes in inhibiting florivory. The two species had different
   flowering patterns, annual for C. cathartica and continuous for C.
   catharticoides, both more intense during summer. Florivory occurred
   mainly in the winter and affected floral structures unevenly, resulting
   in loss of different floral functions. Florivory reduced the fruit set
   of both species, but C. catharticoides was considerably more impacted.
   The diversity of damaged structures in C. catharticoides resulted in
   direct (reduced female and male fitness due to loss of ovules and pollen
   grains) and indirect (loss of floral resources and reduced floral
   attractiveness) impacts. Damage to the tubular petal could further
   result in loss of specialized pollination mechanisms mediated by this
   structure. Secretory trichomes on the abaxial surface of sepals
   inhibited florivory of buds and herbivory of early-developing fruits.},

Title = {Habitat use by mixed-species bird flocks in tropical forests of the
   Western Ghats, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 30},
Abstract = {While mixed-species flocks of birds (hereafter `flocks') have been
   widely studied, few studies have looked at the effect of habitat
   structure on flock presence and flocking propensity within a site. Here,
   we employ a use-availability approach in locations with flocks and
   random locations to ask whether habitat characteristics influence the
   presence of flocks, and whether structurally similar microhabitats
   support compositionally similar flocks. We also examine the effect of
   habitat on flock size and species richness, and the effect of
   intraspecifically gregarious flock participants on habitat selection. We
   find that flocks use a narrow subset of available tree density and
   canopy cover variation and prefer relatively less-dense areas with large
   trees and a complex foliage structure. Similar microhabitats do not
   result in compositionally similar flocks, and while foliage complexity
   was associated with flock size, no habitat characteristics influenced
   species richness. Flocks led by the intraspecifically gregarious western
   crowned warbler (Phylloscopus occipitalis), a potential nuclear species,
   showed preference for high foliage complexity and tree density. Thus,
   habitat preferences of intraspecifically gregarious species, which are
   followed by other species, could play a strong role in habitat selection
   in flocks. This suggests that degraded forests that cannot provide a
   suitable range of tree density, canopy cover, and/or complex vegetation
   structure may not support some core flock species around which flocks
   form, which may lead to decreased flocking in those patches.},

Abstract = {Land use intensification imposes selective pressures that systematically
   change the frequency of wild population phenotypes. Growing evidence is
   biased towards the comparison of populations from discrete categories of
   land uses, ignoring the role of landscape emerging properties on the
   phenotype selection of wild fauna. Across the largest urban-rural
   gradient of the Colombian Orinoquia, we measured ecomorphological traits
   of 216 individuals of the flat-faced fruit-eating bat Artibeus
   planirostris. We did this to evaluate the scale of effect at which
   landscape transformation better predicts changes in phenotype and
   abundance of an urban-tolerant species. Forest percentage at 1.25 km was
   the main predictor affecting negatively bat abundance and positively its
   wing aspect ratio and body mass. Landscape variables affected forearm
   length at all spatial scales, this effect appeared to be sex-dependent,
   and the most important predictor, forest percentage at 0.5 km, had a
   negative effect on this trait. Our results indicate that landscape
   elements and spatial scale interact to shape ecomorphological traits and
   the abundance of A. planirostris. Interestingly, the scale of effect
   coincided at 1.25 km among all biological responses, suggesting that
   species' abundance can be linked to the variation on phenotype under
   different environmental filters across landscape scenarios.},

Abstract = {Cerberiopsis candelabra Vieill. is a long-lived, monocarpic (=
   semelparous) and mass-flowering rain-forest tree, endemic to New
   Caledonia. Population size structures suggest establishment has been
   episodic, followed by a recruitment gap that might signal population
   decline. Here, we use age structures based on tree rings to better
   assess population dynamics and persistence, and investigate influences
   of tree size, age and growth rate on flowering. Age structures of
   populations surveyed in 2007-2008 were unimodal, with establishment over
   c. 15-81 y, followed by a recruitment gap of c. 23-79 y. Seedling
   mortality was generally high. High densities of flowering trees or
   large-scale exogenous disturbances may be necessary for in-situ
   regeneration. There was no evidence of a simple flowering threshold:
   flowering in 2017 occurred across a wide range of tree size, age and
   growth rate. Instead, evidence suggested that size and age at flowering
   may vary among plants depending on their growth trajectory.
   Environmental triggers of flowering were not identified by dating tree
   establishment, but the last three mass-flowering events occurred in
   years of tropical cyclones. Regeneration and persistence might be
   facilitated if largescale disturbances trigger flowering, improving
   reproductive efficiency by synchronising flowering and linking
   reproduction with environmental conditions that enhance seedling
   recruitment.},

Abstract = {It is well concluded that microbial composition and diversity of coral
   species can be affected under temperature alterations. However, the
   interaction of environmental accumulation of corals and temperature
   stress on symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities are rarely
   studied. In this study, two groups of soft coral Sarcophyton
   trocheliophorum were cultured under constant (26 degrees C) and
   inconstant (22 degrees C to 26 degrees C) temperature conditions for 30
   days as control treatments. After that, water was cooled rapidly to
   decrease to 20 degrees C in 24 h. The results of diversity analysis
   showed that symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities had a
   significant difference between the two accumulated groups. The principal
   coordinate analyses confirmed that symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and
   bacterial communities of both control treatments were clustered into two
   groups. Our results evidenced that rapid cooling stress could not change
   symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities' composition. On the
   other hand, cooling stress could alter only bacterial communities in
   constant group. In conclusion, our study represents a clear relationship
   between environmental accumulation and the impact of short-term cooling
   stress in which microbial composition structure can be affected by early
   adaptation conditions.},

Abstract = {Deciphering the genetic basis of vertebrate craniofacial variation is a
   longstanding biological problem with broad implications in evolution,
   development, and human pathology. One of the most stunning examples of
   craniofacial diversification is the adaptive radiation of birds, in
   which the beak serves essential roles in virtually every aspect of their
   life histories. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) provides an
   exceptional opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings of
   craniofacial variation because of its unique balance of experimental
   accessibility and extraordinary phenotypic diversity within a single
   species. We used traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify
   craniofacial variation in an F-2 laboratory cross derived from the
   straight-beaked Pomeranian Pouter and curved-beak Scandaroon pigeon
   breeds. Using a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus
   scans and multi-locus modeling, we identified a set of genetic loci
   associated with complex shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton,
   including beak shape, braincase shape, and mandible shape. Some of these
   loci control coordinated changes between different structures, while
   others explain variation in the size and shape of specific skull and jaw
   regions. We find that in domestic pigeons, a complex blend of both
   independent and coupled genetic effects underlie three-dimensional
   craniofacial morphology.},

Abstract = {We assessed Alosa pseudoharengus (Alewife) upstream passage during
   2016-2019 spawning runs using radio frequency identification (RFID)
   tracking through a periodically submerged and a constantly submerged
   top-hinged tide gate in the LaPlanche and Missaquash rivers,
   respectively, on the Chignecto Isthmus, Canada. First detection of
   individuals tagged in previous years (i.e., returnees) revealed
   synchronous upstream run timing in both rivers during 2015 and 2018.
   Greater delays of migrants attempting passage through the periodically
   submerged tide gate prompted temporary removal of 1 flapper door during
   2016-2019 runs. During a 7-day period following door removal, the number
   of individuals passing per day increased 4- to 6-fold during 2016-2017
   and less than 2-fold during 2018-2019. More than 80\% of returnees
   passed the periodically submerged gate following door removal,
   decreasing mean delay to less than that of migrants attempting passage
   of the constantly submerged gate. Most individuals passed the
   periodically submerged gate during mid-flood daily tide phases and none
   passed during low-tide outflow due to high water velocities. Passage of
   the constantly submerged gate occurred during all tide phases, with 77\%
   passing during ebb and low tides. The constantly submerged tide gate
   provided greater windows of opportunity, resulting in relatively shorter
   delays compared to the periodically submerged tide gate. Long-term
   monitoring in this study highlighted the effectiveness of temporary
   and/or adaptive mitigation when addressing issues in river connectivity
   and fish passage.},

   a pervasive view, we suggest that, among Carnivora, small carnivores are
   more appropriate sentinels than large carnivores. This reasoning is
   built around six key points: that, compared to large carnivores, small
   carnivores 1) are more species-rich and diverse, providing more
   potential sentinels in many systems; 2) occupy a wider range of
   ecological niches, exhibiting a greater variety of sensitivities to
   change; 3) hold an intermediate trophic position that is more directly
   affected by changes at the producer, primary consumer, and tertiary
   consumer levels; 4) have shorter life spans and higher reproductive
   rates, exhibiting more rapid responses to change; 5) have smaller home
   ranges and are more abundant, making it easier to investigate fine-scale
   management interventions; 6) are easier to monitor, manage, and
   manipulate. Therefore, we advocate for incorporating a middle-out
   approach, in addition to the established top-down and bottom-up
   approaches, to assessing the responses of ecosystems to global change.},

Abstract = {Functional traits play a key role in driving plant community effects on
   ecosystem function. We examined nine functional traits in various palm
   (Arecaceae) species and their relationships with moisture, tree-fall
   gaps, slope, and forest type at 29 transects (500x5 m) in the
   northeastern region of the Colombian Amazon. Redundancy analysis of mean
   trait values of species within a plot weighted by their abundance and
   Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between
   traits and environmental factors. The community trait composition was
   correlated with local environmental factors, which explained 23\% of the
   trait variance. We detected functional dominance of the tallest palms in
   soils with high moisture and in floodplain forests (p <= 0.05). Palms
   with relatively long leaves were dominant in the flooded forests.
   Acaulescent and small palms were dominant on high slopes, and in terra
   firme forests, long-petioled palms were dominant in forest gaps. The
   number of seeds per fruit was not correlated with any environmental
   variable. Thus, hydrology is one of the main drivers of the functional
   composition of neotropical palm communities at the local scale,
   segregating tall palms with competitive and evasive strategies from
   small understory palms, which are mainly stress tolerant.},

Abstract = {For decades, tropical ecologists distinguished primary (PH) and
   secondary hemiepiphytes (SH) as two structurally dependent life forms
   with an epiphytic phase at, respectively, the beginning or the end of
   their ontogeny. However, the use of these terms has been criticized
   repeatedly because the term ``hemiepiphyte{''} suggests an
   unsubstantiated biological similarity in ontogeny, and worse, because it
   is often used without a qualifier, which makes unambiguous
   interpretation of the life history of such species impossible. In this
   paper, we go one step further and ask the question whether an
   ontogenetic trajectory as described by the term ``secondary
   hemiepiphyte{''} does exist at all. We show that until now all evidence
   available for the three families that were traditionally listed as taxa
   with SHs (Araceae, Cyclanthaceae, Marcgraviaceae) falsifies such claims,
   but critically discuss reports of possible SHs in other families. In all
   these cases unambiguous conclusions about the existence of any SH are
   difficult, but our detailed discussion of potential candidates is meant
   to provide the basis for focused field studies. Irrespective of the
   outcome of these studies, we urge researchers to abandon the use of the
   term SH for the time being: Terminological issues can be discussed once
   there are data.},

Title = {Creating morphological diversity in reptilian temporal skull region: A

Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {15-31},

Abstract = {Reptilian skull morphology is highly diverse and broadly categorized
   into three categories based on the number and position of the temporal
   fenestrations: anapsid, synapsid, and diapsid. According to recent
   phylogenetic analysis, temporal fenestrations evolved twice
   independently in amniotes, once in Synapsida and once in Diapsida.
   Although functional aspects underlying the evolution of tetrapod
   temporal fenestrations have been well investigated, few studies have
   investigated the developmental mechanisms responsible for differences in
   the pattern of temporal skull region. To determine what these mechanisms
   might be, we first examined how the five temporal bones develop by
   comparing embryonic cranial osteogenesis between representative extant
   reptilian species. The pattern of temporal skull region may depend on
   differences in temporal bone growth rate and growth direction during
   ontogeny. Next, we compared the histogenesis patterns and the expression
   of two key osteogenic genes, Runx2 and Msx2, in the temporal region of
   the representative reptilian embryos. Our comparative analyses suggest
   that the embryonic histological condition of the domain where temporal
   fenestrations would form predicts temporal skull morphology in adults
   and regulatory modifications of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in osteogenic
   mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating
   morphological diversity in the temporal skull region of reptiles.},

Pages = {158-170},

Abstract = {Stripe patterns are a striking example for a repeatedly evolved color
   pattern. In the African adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes, stripes
   evolved several times independently. Previously, it has been suggested
   that regulatory evolution of a single gene, agouti-related-peptide 2
   (agrp2), explains the evolutionary lability of this trait. Here, using a
   comparative transcriptomic approach, we performed comparisons between
   (adult) striped and nonstriped cichlid fishes of representatives of Lake
   Victoria and the two major clades of Lake Malawi (mbuna and non-mbuna
   lineage). We identify agrp2 to be differentially expressed across all
   pairwise comparisons, reaffirming its association with stripe pattern
   divergence. We therefore also provide evidence that agrp2 is associated
   with the loss of the nonstereotypic oblique stripe of Mylochromis mola.
   Complementary ontogenetic data give insights into the development of
   stripe patterns as well as vertical bar patterns that both develop
   postembryonically. Lastly, using the Lake Victoria species pair
   Haplochromis sauvagei and Pundamilia nyererei, we investigated the
   differences between melanic and non-melanic regions to identify
   additional genes that contribute to the formation of stripes. Expression
   differences-that most importantly also do not include agrp2-are
   surprisingly small. This suggests, at least in this species pair, that
   the stripe phenotype might be caused by a combination of more subtle
   transcriptomic differences or cellular changes without transcriptional
   correlates. In summary, our comprehensive analysis highlights the
   ontogenetic and adult transcriptomic differences between cichlids with
   different color patterns and serves as a basis for further investigation
   of the mechanistic underpinnings of their diversification.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary events may impact the geological carbon cycle via transient
   imbalances in silicate weathering, and such events have been implicated
   as causes of glaciations, mass extinctions, and oceanic anoxia. However,
   suggested evolutionary causes often substantially predate the
   environmental effects to which they are linked-problematic when carbon
   cycle perturbations must be resolved in less than a million years to
   maintain Earth's habitability. What is more, the geochemical signatures
   of such perturbations are recorded as they occur in widely distributed
   marine sedimentary rocks that have been densely sampled for important
   intervals in Earth history, whereas the fossil record-particularly on
   land-is governed by the availability of sedimentary basins that are
   patchy in both space and time, necessitating lags between the
   origination of an evolutionary lineage and its earliest occurrence in
   the fossil record. Here, we present a simple model of the impact of
   preservational filtering on sampling to show that an evolutionary event
   that causes an environmental perturbation via weathering imbalance
   should not appear earlier in the rock record than the perturbation
   itself and, if anything, should appear later rather than simultaneously.
   The Devonian Hangenberg glaciation provides an example of how
   evolutionary events might be more fruitfully considered as potential
   causes of environmental perturbations. Just as the last samplings of
   species lost in mass extinction are expected to come before the true
   environmental event, first appearance should be expected to postdate the
   geological expression of a lineage's environmental impact with important
   implications for our reading of Earth history.},

Title = {The role of heterotopy and heterochrony during morphological
   diversification of otocephalan epibranchial organs},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Epibranchial organs (EBOs), found in at least five of the eight
   otomorphan families, are used to aggregate small prey inside the
   buccopharyngeal cavity and range in morphological complexity from a
   singular, small slit on the pharyngeal roof to several, elongated soft
   tissue tubes. Despite broad phylogenetic representation, little is known
   about the origin, development, or evolution of EBOs. We hypothesize that
   both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of
   EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a
   foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy,
   a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can
   have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received
   relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental
   mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan
   fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa
   mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus
   (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys
   molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described.
   Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we
   illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are
   responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan
   EBOs. Importantly, we also identify conserved developmental patterns
   that further our understanding of how EBOs may have first originated and
   evolved across actinopterygian fishes.},

Title = {Importance of flood irrigation for foraging colonial waterbirds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {For a colonial-nesting bird, like the white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi),
   the landscape surrounding the breeding colony can be important.
   White-faced ibis must rely on areas outside their breeding colony for
   foraging, but this part of their life history has received little
   attention, and the management of this landscape even less so. To address
   this knowledge gap, we conducted road-based driving surveys and a
   randomly selected, spatially balanced sample survey of agricultural
   fields within a 22-km radius of the 2 largest white-faced ibis breeding
   colonies in Idaho, USA: Market Lake Wildlife Management Area and Mud
   Lake Wildlife Management Area. Our study took place in 2012 and the
   primary objective was to quantify patterns of foraging habitat use of
   this marsh-nesting species, particularly associations with specific
   irrigation practices and crop types. We documented the majority of
   foraging birds in flood-irrigated and wheel-line sprinkler-irrigated
   agricultural fields (76\%) and natural wetlands (13\%), which were
   limited in our study area (3\% of land cover). Even though 70\% of the
   agricultural landscape included center pivot sprinkler irrigation, only
   11\% of foraging observations came from this irrigation type. Most
   agricultural fields (>85\%) used by foraging ibis were flood-irrigated
   and all had standing water or recent moisture at the time of use. Though
   ibis used many crop types when foraging in flooded agricultural fields,
   ibis use of alfalfa (58\%) was greater than availability (38\%). We also
   observed distinct distribution patterns around the 2 breeding colonies.
   Whereas birds foraged in all directions around Mud Lake (similar to
   80\%) within a 12-km radius from the colony, we observed over half of
   birds around Market Lake foraging within 12-22 km, and almost
   exclusively to the south and southeast of the colony, reflecting the
   distribution of flood-irrigated agriculture in the area. The most common
   foraging distance (12-22 km) around Market Lake is greater than found in
   existing literature, suggesting that the foraging habitat is limited
   within 12 km of the colony and that the birds may need to travel farther
   to find adequate foraging habitat. Flood-irrigated agriculture and
   natural wetlands provide foraging habitats for white-faced ibis in
   eastern Idaho and should be considered in future management and
   conservation of wetland birds.},

Title = {Robustness of fecal DNA spatial capture-recapture to clustered space-use
   by tule elk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) approaches using noninvasive
   fecal DNA (fDNA) are applied increasingly to obtain statistically robust
   abundance estimates for various wildlife species. But SCR has not been
   widely used for more gregarious species, such as elk (Cervus
   canadensis). Because of their heterogeneous use of the landscape and
   grouping behavior, elk present novel challenges to sampling efficiency
   and statistical assumptions. We employed fDNA SCR and a stratified
   random sampling approach to estimate abundance in 3 northern California
   tule elk (C. c. nannodes) populations concurrent with global positioning
   system (GPS)-telemetry monitoring of 66 elk (32 male, 34 female) in
   Colusa and Lake counties, California, USA, during June-August 2017-2019.
   We collected 1,616 fecal pellet groups from the 3 populations, resulting
   in 1,002 fDNA genotypes (>= 19 microsatellite loci, 1 sex marker) of 425
   unique individuals. Based on SCR estimates from a model incorporating
   both sexes, elk density ranged from 0.31 (95\% CI = 0.17-0.55) elk/km(2)
   to 1.7 (95\% CI = 1.3-2.2) elk/km(2), translating approximately to 650
   individuals (evenly split between sexes) among the 3 populations.
   Independent telemetry data from concurrently tracked individuals
   indicated that activity centers of females, but not males, were
   clustered on the landscape. This finding was corroborated using fDNA to
   infer activity centers. Comparison of SCR estimates to non-spatial
   estimates using physically captured individuals suggested that
   combined-sex SCR models were robust to spatial clustering of females in
   all 3 populations. Additionally, single-sex models were robust to female
   clustering in the 2 populations with multiple female groups, but not in
   Lake Pillsbury, where all females effectively shared a single activity
   center. In that case, the estimate of female abundance was deemed an
   overestimate. Thus, results indicate that SCR was robust to
   gregariousness in elk in all but the most extreme cases of clustering
   (single-sex female estimation when all individuals share a single
   activity center), and that the inclusion of both sexes was sufficient to
   offset biases stemming from aggregation of females in all cases.
   Altogether, our findings suggest that SCR methods can be gainfully
   applied to socially gregarious ungulates such as elk.},

Title = {Roosting ecology of Gould's wild turkeys in southeastern Arizona},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Availability of suitable roosting sites influences distribution of wild
   turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) across the landscape. In semi-arid
   environments, roosts are limited to riparian corridors capable of
   supporting trees large enough to provide suitable roost sites. Gould's
   wild turkeys (M. g. mexicana) are spatially restricted to mountainous
   semi-arid areas of southwestern United States and Mexico, and
   information on their distribution and habitat use is limited. We
   evaluated roost site selection and fidelity of Gould's wild turkeys
   relative to environmental gradients and forested land cover during
   2016-2017 in southeastern Arizona, USA. We monitored 51 global
   positioning system (GPS)-tagged individuals and collected 7,954 night
   roost locations. We quantified specific roost site characteristics at
   274 unique roost locations. Gould's wild turkeys roosted in forested
   communities dominated by mature pine (Pinus spp.) and oak (Quercus
   spp.), and exhibited substantive roost site fidelity. Roost sites were
   selected at moderate elevations (range = 1,254-2,894 m), and were
   predominately on north-facing slopes with slight incline (<11 degrees),
   suggesting little plasticity in selection of roost sites. Conserving
   habitat with topography and vegetative structure similar to those
   described in our study is likely to improve ongoing restoration and
   management of Gould's wild turkeys.},

Title = {Rivers as a potential dispersing agent of the invasive tree Acacia
   dealbata},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Background The silver wattle Acacia dealbata is a fast-growing tree from
   Australia that has become naturalised in different regions of the world,
   attaining invasive status in most of them. In Chile, A. dealbata reaches
   large abundances along banks and floodplains of invaded fluvial systems,
   suggesting that rivers may act as a vector for seed dispersal. As
   hydrochory has not been documented previously in this species, the aim
   of this study is to evaluate the potential for water dispersal of seeds
   of this invasive tree along rivers. Methods Seed samples from rivers
   were collected at three sites along two A. dealbata-invaded rivers
   within the Cachapoal basin, central Chile. Number of seeds collected was
   contrasted versus hydraulic and local conditions with RDA. Seed buoyancy
   and sedimentation velocity were determined and compared between sites
   with an ANCOVA. Finally, the probability of seed germination after long
   periods of immersion in water was assessed, simulating transport
   conditions in the flow. Germination results were tested with a GLM.
   Results Results indicate that increasing abundance of A. dealbata seeds
   in the flow is related to the level of turbulence of the flow. Seeds
   display high floatability but their sedimentation velocity is high when
   they do sink. Finally, silver wattle seeds can germinate after long
   periods (many weeks) of immersion in water; however, their probability
   of germination depends to a large extent on whether seeds are scarified
   or not. Conclusions Based on the evidence collected, we suggest that the
   seeds of A. dealbata have the necessary traits to be dispersed by
   rivers, this being the first research testing this hypothesis. The
   success of hydrochory of A. dealbata would depend on river flow
   turbulence, and whether there are natural mechanisms for scarifying the
   seeds either before or during transport. The proposed methodology can be
   used to assess river hydrochory for any tree species.},

Abstract = {Lachesillidae is one of the largest families of bark lice and includes
   more than 420 described species, in 26 genera and three subfamilies.
   This family belongs in the suborder Psocomorpha, infraorder
   Homilopsocidea. The classification of Lachesillidae is based on male and
   female genital morphologies, but questions remain regarding the
   monophyly of the family and some of its genera. Here, we used whole
   genome and transcriptome data to generate a 2060 orthologous gene data
   matrix of 2,438,763 aligned bp and used these data to reconstruct the
   phylogenetic relationships of species of Lachesillidae and relatives.
   Taxon sampling included 24 species from Lachesillidae and 23 additional
   species belonging to related families from the infraorders
   Homilopsocidea and Caeciliusetae. Phylogenetic relationships
   reconstructed with maximum likelihood and coalescent-based analyses
   indicated paraphyly of Lachesillidae, and monophyly of the tribe
   Graphocaeciliini and the genus Lachesilla were also never recovered.
   Instability was observed in the position of Eolachesilla chilensis,
   which was recovered either as sister to Elipsocidae or to Mesopsocidae
   species, so we cannot conclusively determine the position of this genus
   within the Homilopsocidea. Given our results, a reclassification is
   necessary, but more taxon sampling of other species in Mesopsocidae and
   Peripsocidae would be useful to add to a tree in future before proposing
   a new classification.},

Abstract = {Rare or endangered species largely contributing to global biodiversity
   are essential components of ecosystems. Because genetic diversity
   depends not only on apparent population size but also demographic
   processes, the conservation priority of endangered species based on
   population genetics needs to be assessed by comparison with common
   congeners and demographic events. In this study, we performed population
   genetic analysis for Gentiana yakushimensis Makino, a rare and
   endangered plant species with an isolated distribution on Yakushima
   Island, Japan. We performed comparison of genetic diversity with the
   congener (Gentiana triflora Pall. var. japonica {[}Kusn.] H.Hara),
   demographic inference, and bottleneck test based on genome-wide single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. The result was that G. yakushimensis had an
   extremely low genetic diversity level and a high inbreeding coefficient
   level compared with those of the congener. The population of G.
   yakushimensis was estimated to experience an expansion during the Last
   Glacial Maximum and a recent bottleneck by the demographic inference and
   the bottleneck test. Therefore, the low level of genetic diversity of
   this species might have resulted from the impact of the recent
   bottleneck and the long-term maintenance of a small population size. Due
   to the long lifespan of the genus Gentiana, the current level of genetic
   diversity probably does not reflect a large part of recent demographic
   events, which requires long-term monitoring of changes in genetic
   diversity to identify the time lag between the reduction in apparent
   population size and genetic diversity as a future outlook.},

Abstract = {Pollinators play an important role in the reproduction of zoophilous
   plants. A shift in pollinators has often been observed for oceanic
   island plants, probably because of the differences in fauna. In this
   study, we obtained data on pollinator shifts from insects to birds in
   Orobanche boninsimae (Orobanchaceae), a holoparasitic plant species
   endemic to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, oceanic islands in the
   Pacific. We observed pollination and measured seed viability in O.
   boninsimae and its continental sister species O. coerulescens. We found
   that two passerine birds, the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus)
   and bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis squameiceps), visited the flowers and
   sucked the nectar of O. boninsimae, while only insects visited those of
   O. coerulescens. Viable seeds were produced under pollinator-excluded
   treatments in the two Orobanche species, indicating that the seeds were
   produced by automatic self-pollination and/or apomixis. These results
   suggest that O. boninsimae may be pollinated by birds and can produce
   seeds by automatic self-pollination/apomixis. This is the first record
   of visitation of the genus Orobanche by birds. Studies of pollination
   systems in native plants on the Bonin Islands are few compared to those
   on other oceanic islands, and O. boninsimae may provide a valuable
   example of pollinator shifts in the Bonin Islands.},

Title = {Effects of the egg incubation environment on turtle carapace development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-169},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developing organisms are often exposed to fluctuating environments that
   destabilize tissue-scale processes and induce abnormal phenotypes. This
   might be common in species that lay eggs in the external environment and
   with little parental care, such as many reptiles. In turtles,
   morphological development has provided striking examples of abnormal
   phenotypic patterns, though the influence of the environment remains
   unclear. To this end, we compared fluctuating asymmetry, as a proxy for
   developmental instability, in turtle hatchlings incubated in controlled
   laboratory and unstable natural conditions. Wild and laboratory
   hatchlings featured similar proportions of supernumerary scales (scutes)
   on the dorsal shell (carapace). Such abnormal scutes likely elevated
   shape asymmetry, which was highest in natural nests. Moreover, we tested
   the hypothesis that hot and dry environments cause abnormal scute
   formation by subjecting eggs to a range of hydric and thermal laboratory
   incubation regimes. Shape asymmetry was similar in hatchlings incubated
   at five constant temperatures (26-30 degrees C). A hot (30 degrees C)
   and severely Dry substrate yielded smaller hatchlings but scutes were
   not overtly affected. Our study suggests that changing nest environments
   contribute to fluctuating asymmetry in egg-laying reptiles, while
   clarifying the conditions at which turtle shell development remains
   buffered from the external environment.},

Title = {The effects of inbreeding depression and pollinator visitation on the

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The evolutionary transition from outcrossing in heterostylous morphs to
   selfing in homostylous morphs has occurred in many plant lineages.
   Homostylous variants with a low degree of herkogamy may increase the
   reproductive advantage of autonomous self-pollination when there is
   little inbreeding depression and/or low pollinator visitation. Oxalis
   corniculata, a self-compatible perennial herb derived from a tristylous
   ancestor, is reported to have two floral morphs. Homostyled plants are
   broadly distributed in Japan, whereas long-styled plants are reported to
   occur only in coastal areas. We examined the hypothesis that a
   reproductive advantage in avoiding inbreeding depression and/or frequent
   pollinator visits enables long-styled plants to live in some areas.
   Studies on floral variation revealed that the degree of herkogamy varied
   widely and continuously within and among populations. Homostyled and
   long-styled morphs were functionally defined based on the ability of
   autonomous self-pollination. Homostyled plants were widely distributed,
   whereas long-styled plants were found in and around the two coastal
   populations and relatively inland populations. Pollination experiments
   provided no evidence of inbreeding depression in either homostyled or
   long-styled plants. Pollinator visitation frequency was higher in the
   two coastal populations than in the other populations. Thus,
   reproductive disadvantage in long-styled plants lacking autonomous
   self-pollination has reduced in the two coastal populations, and
   long-styled plants may be maintained due to a competitive advantage of
   large seed size. In contrast, we recorded no comparable frequencies of
   pollinator visitation in other populations containing long-styled
   plants, indicating that there are other factors contributing to the
   maintenance of long-styled plants in these areas.},

Title = {Floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of Justicia
   betonica L. (Acanthaceae): An assessment of its low reproductive success

Abstract = {Besides its importance as an ornamental plant, Justicia betonica L. is
   also used as a medicinal plant for the treatment of several human
   disorders. However, the population size and abundance of the plant
   species are very low in Indian states, including West Bengal. The
   breeding system and pollination ecology of J. betonica are still
   unclear. Therefore, some reproductive aspects were investigated in order
   to provide important information for the sustainability of the species.
   The flowering duration spanned from December to May, with its peak in
   February-March. Flower opening time was much earlier (5.00-8.00 a.m.) on
   a hot day (in April-May) than on a cold day (10.00 a.m.-12.00 p.m. in
   December-January). The time of anther dehiscence coincided with the
   flower opening time; however, the stigma became receptive later. The
   plant species is self-compatible but dependent on pollinators for fruit
   and seed sets. Members of different insect groups like ants, bees,
   butterflies, flies, moths and wasps visit the flowers. Among them,
   Allorhynchium metallicum and Halictus acrocephalus are the primary
   pollinators (based on the ``relative pollinator service{''}). The plant
   species showed a significant pollination deficit (coefficient of
   pollination deficit {[}D] = 0.32) in the open condition. Larvae of the
   florivorous moth Gatesclarkeana erotias significantly reduced
   reproductive success by eating their floral parts, ovules and immature
   seeds. In conclusion, combining the pollination deficit and the feeding
   activity of phytophagous insects (moth larvae) may reduce the
   reproductive fitness of J. betonica in the study regions.},

Abstract = {Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle) is a species that congregates in
   communal roosting sites during the non-breeding periods of its life
   cycle. Wildlife agencies are directed to protect roosts, but their
   nocturnal usage and remote locations make them challenging to identify
   and monitor. We remotely identified and ground-truthed roost sites using
   satellite telemetry data. We delineated 13 confirmed roosts and another
   34 suspected roosts. Volunteers observed 12 roosts with ground surveys
   and confirmed 92\% were in use by eagles during their first observation.
   These results suggest use of eagle-tracking data to remotely identify
   communal roosts is a promising tool for finding and protecting eagle
   roosting habitat. This method can be complemented with volunteer surveys
   to confirm ongoing roost use.},

Title = {The impact of protected areas on poverty: evidence from Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the causal relationship between protected
   areas and poverty in Chile from 1982 to 2002. Chile is part of the
   coalition of countries committed to protecting 30\% of the planet by
   2030; a decision that implies increasing the number of protected areas
   in the country. As a result of this decision, grows the national debate
   about the potential impacts of protected areas on the economy and
   society. By estimating the causal effect of protected areas on poverty,
   we aim to contribute to this debate in Chile. We use panel data and a
   quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect. We find that
   establishing a protected area covering at least 17\% of a unit's
   terrestrial area causes a reduction of 0.216 standard deviations in the
   poverty index. This result is not sensitive to arbitrary implementation
   choices. Additionally, we show that the effect is driven by the
   Patagonia region, the part of Chile with the largest amount of new
   protected areas during the time frame of this study. Besides showing the
   benefits of protected areas to society, we hope the findings presented
   here might also be used to attract new investments and financial support
   to protected areas currently underfunded in Chile.},

Title = {Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a

   geomorphological constriction},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},

Abstract = {Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food
   production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms
   through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly
   understood. A better understanding of the relationship between
   zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in
   Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability
   of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the
   Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of
   two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a
   geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture
   farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12
   h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background
   of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial
   dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities
   and in water column variables were identified between the two sections
   of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we
   found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species
   richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between
   sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward
   asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified
   in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time
   periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition
   were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time
   scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the
   asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier
   favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic
   variables between the two sections of the channel.},

Abstract = {Although snake populations are suffering numerous local declines,
   determining the scale of these declines is problematic due to the
   elusive nature of snakes. Determining the factors associated with
   species detection is therefore essential for quantifying disturbance
   effects on populations. From 2017 to 2019, we assessed the detectability
   associations of five river-associated snake species and all snake
   detections in general within two logging concessions in Sabah, Malaysian
   Borneo. Data collected from both stream transects and visual encounter
   surveys at 47 stream sites were incorporated into an occupancy-modelling
   framework to determine the climatological, temporal and survey distance
   associations with species detection probability. Detection probability
   of riparian snake species was significantly associated with humidity,
   month (2 spp. each), survey distance and total rainfall over 60 days (1
   spp. each). Pooled snake species detectability was significantly
   positively associated with transect distance and the 2019 El-Nino year,
   whilst yearly pooled snake species detections in stream transects spiked
   during El-Nino (2017 = 2.05, 2018 = 2.47, 2019 = 4.5 snakes per km).
   This study provides new insights into the detectability of riparian
   rainforest snakes and suggests that future studies should account for
   short-term (climatological and temporal) and long-term (El-Nino) factors
   associated with detection probability when surveying and assessing snake
   populations.},

Abstract = {Populations of freshwater gastropods are decreasing globally. To
   investigate one aspect of decline, we exposed the benthic dwelling
   hermaphroditic snail Planorbella (= Helisoma) trivolvis (Say) (Marsh
   Rams-horn) to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Marsh Rams-horn is a
   simultaneous hermaphrodite, suggesting that disruption of reproductive
   success is independent of snail interaction and more dependent on
   internal controls. We examined the impact of exposure to PCBs on
   mortality, reproductive success, and tissue hormone concentrations.
   Exposure to Aroclor (R) 1254 in concentrations found in natural habitats
   caused higher mortality and reduced reproductive success. Additionally,
   tissue estrogens were significantly elevated while testosterone remined
   unchanged in PCB-exposed snails. Given the importance of hermaphroditic
   freshwater gastropods in ecosystems, worldwide population decline, and
   ubiquity of PCBs, identifying the impact of exposure informs our ability
   to combat population loss.},

Title = {Reproductive aspects and pollination biology in endoparasitic Pilostyles
   thurberi (Apodanthaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {40-53},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biotic pollination is typically a mutualism between plants and their
   pollinators, where each partner receives a benefit. However, plants can
   resort to various reproductive strategies to attract pollinators. Within
   angiosperms, a group of plants known as endoparasites is comprised of
   only flowers or inflorescences. These plants exhibit various
   reproductive strategies, such as different sexual systems and
   attractants, and most are dependent on animals for pollination. In the
   endoparasitic plants of the family Apodanthaceae, unisexual flowers are
   predominant, resulting in dependence on pollinators. Pilostyles thurberi
   is characterized by small flowers, but limited information exists about
   its reproductive strategies. This study investigated various
   reproductive aspects of P. thurberi. We described and compared its
   hosts, sexual flower arrangement, floral concentration, rewards, and
   reproductive success in different populations. Furthermore, we
   determined whether the floral display operates as an attractant by
   monitoring pollinators for two years. Our results revealed that P.
   thurberi has unisexual flowers with male, female, and mixed sex
   arrangements. Bees and wasps are the effective pollinators and are
   attracted by the floral display independently of flower sex. This study
   was the first to record the production of small amounts of crystallized
   nectar by the nectary disk of both floral sexes. Moreover, the findings
   were compared with those of other endoparasitic plants, such as
   Cytinaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Rafflesiaceae, and other Apodanthaceae. It
   is necessary to continue studying the plant-pollinator interactions and
   reproductive strategies of parasitic plants such as Apodanthaceae, since
   not much evidence on how they reproduce and survive in the wild exists.},

Abstract = {Question: This study represents the first contribution to the

   Sardinia (Italy), and aimed: 1) to describe Sardinian fringe communities
   from a floristic vegetational point ; 2) to provide a syntaxonomic
   scheme, confirming or not the applicability of the most recent
   framework, proposed at the European scale, also in a Mediterranean
   insular context (Sardinia); 3) to verify if there is a correspondence
   among fringe communities and potential natural vegetation in the study
   area. Study area: Sardinia, the second largest island of the
   Mediterranean basin (Italy). Methods: 65 phytosociological plots
   realized using the Braun-Blanquet approach; for each of them,
   bioclimatic indices were derived from the available Bioclimatic map of
   Sardinia; Raunki??r life-forms were considered as species functional
   traits. Furthermore, by using Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) we
   calculated for each relev?? an abundance-weighted mean indicator value.
   Main vegetation types were identified through a Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis (HCA) and NMDS ordination. A permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance was used to test the overall significance in EIVs
   distribution differences among the clusters obtained from HCA. Results:
   we found a total amount of 139 vascular plant species. Hierarchical
   clustering detected the presence of seven interpretable clusters, well
   differentiated in terms of floristic composition, geographic
   distribution, bioclimatic characters and EIVs, and in terms of their
   inclusion in different vegetation series. Conclusions: we describe 5 new
   associations, four of them included in the new alliance Digitalido
   purpureae-Pteridion aquilini (Melampyro-Holcetalia mollis order,
   Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class), clearly differentiated with
   respect to other alliances described from both the eastern and the
   western side of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another new association was referred
   to the Epilobietea angustifolii class (Galio-Alliarietalia order).},

Title = {Hemi-marsh concept prevails? Kaminski and Prince (1981) revisited},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The hemi-marsh concept has prevailed in avian habitat selection and
   wetland ecology and management since the 1970s. Hemi-marsh is a stage of
   wetland succession when approximately equal proportions of emergent
   vegetation and open water occur. In 1981, researchers reported on a
   field experiment in Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada, where they
   artificially created interspersion levels of emergent vegetation and
   open water (30\%:70\%, 50:50 {[}hemi-marsh], and 70:30) by mowing or
   rototilling to test for hypothesized differences in indicated breeding
   pair indices (IBPs/ha; pairs + lone males) of dabbling ducks and species
   diversity among treatment combinations. Greatest dabbler densities and
   species diversity were in 50:50 hemi-marsh plots. This research has been
   widely cited; however, the experiment was pseudo-replicated because of
   non-independence of IBP counts within and among weeks and years of
   surveys. We reanalyzed data from the study to support or refute original
   results. More robust and generalized analyses revealed vegetation:water
   interspersion characteristics influenced IBP densities of blue-winged
   teal (Spatula discors), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), gadwall (Mareca
   strepera), northern shoveler (S. clypeata), and species diversity. We
   estimated greatest IBP densities and species diversity in 50:50
   hemi-marsh plots, agreeing with the previous study. Including nested
   random effects to account for temporal pseudo-replication improved model
   fits by 2-30\%. Despite accounting for temporal variation in dabbler
   density and species diversity, 61-93\% of variation remained
   unexplained, indicating unresolved complexities of breeding dabbler
   habitat use. Nonetheless, our reanalysis generalized and strengthened
   the original finding that dabbling duck densities and species diversity
   were greatest in hemi-marsh plots. Managers may strive to reproduce
   hemi-marsh conditions for dabbling ducks and evaluate other waterbird
   responses. Our reanalysis also emphasized the need for researchers to
   account for or prevent temporal and spatial pseudo-replication, examine
   model fit, and provide reproducible documentation of data and code,
   especially now that analytical tools and databases are freely available.},

Abstract = {Culling large herbivores can reduce browsing damage. Our objective was
   to verify the effect of culling by considering spatial changes in
   browsing damage to test the hypothesis that the benefits of spatially
   biased culling extend to the spatial scale of culling. Culling sika deer
   (Cervus nippon) in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, increased from 2009-2017,
   but browsing damage remained stable across the prefecture; regional
   damage trends differed among grid meshes (i.e., 5 km x 5 km). Meshes
   with browsing damage reduction received higher culling pressure and a
   decline in the deer population. Browsing damage reduction from culling
   was not uniform across regions and was biased by spatial bias in
   culling. This study highlights the importance of spatial scale in large
   herbivore management and evaluation of its effect.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pulsatilla cernua is an endangered species in Japan and its seeds are
   often stored for long periods. However, the shelf life of these seeds is
   unclear. We conducted germination tests using P. cernua seeds that had
   been stored in a refrigerator at approximately 6 degrees C for up to 31
   years. Germination tests were conducted at 25 degrees C under dark
   conditions. We assessed seed weight, number of germinated seeds,
   seedling development, and time to germination over a 30-day period for
   each collection year. The highest germination rate was from seeds
   collected in the current year (2019; 82.7\%). Germination rates remained
   high in seeds that had been stored for up to 7 years (>46\%). However,
   there was a marked decline in germinability after the eighth year of
   storage and germination was not observed in seeds that had been stored
   for longer than 15 years. Approximately 20\% of current-year seeds and
   seeds that had been stored for up to 6 years developed into seedlings,
   but no seedlings developed from seeds that had been stored for 7 years
   or longer. The germination rate and the time to germination decreased
   and increased, respectively, with storage time. These results show that
   the shelf life of P. cernua seeds in cold storage at 6 degrees C is
   approximately 6 years. To facilitate the ex situ conservation of this
   species, the germinability of stored seeds at lower temperatures and
   under other germination test conditions should be explored in future
   studies.},

Title = {The social system of the lava lizard, Microlophus atacamensis: the
   interplay between social structure and social organization},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background Animal social systems can be described through four main
   components: social structure, social organization, mating system, and
   care system. Social structure describes the relationships between
   individuals in a population, while social organization describes the
   group composition, size, and spatiotemporal variation of a population.
   We use the frameworks of social structure and social organization to
   study the social system of Microlophus atacamensis, a lizard found in
   the rocky intertidal zone along the Chilean coast. The area M.
   atacamensis inhabits poses specific challenges stemming from their use
   of two distinct habitat types in the intertidal zone: they forage in the
   cool areas near the water's edge and use large rocks in more inland
   areas for basking and refuge. Methods Our assessment of their social
   system focused on two separate populations: one to characterize social
   structure by means of focal observations and social network analysis,
   and a second to assess social organization via home range and core area
   analyses. Further, we examined the social system in two habitat types
   that comprise the intertidal zone: cobble fields and interspersed large
   rocks. Results Social network analysis revealed an interconnected
   network with a few highly central individuals. Body size influenced the
   outcomes of aggressive interactions, with interactions being more common
   in cobble fields where males had more associates and more repeated
   interactions than females. Spatial analyses revealed that the social
   organization of M. atacamensis is characterized by (1) high home range
   overlap, specifically in the cobble fields and (2) relatively exclusive
   core areas dispersed across both habitat types. Conclusion A social
   system is composed of both cooperative and competitive behaviors. While
   our study focused on competitive interactions, the extent and influence
   of cooperative behaviors is still unclear and merits future research. We
   suggest that M. atacamensis has a variable social system in which
   territoriality on large rocks affects access to stationary resources in
   that habitat (e.g., basking sites and refuges), while competition in the
   cobble fields could lay the foundation for a system of dominance
   relationships controlling access to variable food resources in cobble
   field areas of the intertidal zone.},

Title = {Tree height effects on vascular anatomy of upper-canopy twigs across a
   wide range of tropical rainforest species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 27},
Abstract = {Vessel diameter variation along the hydraulic pathway determines how
   much water can be moved against the force of gravity from roots to
   leaves. While it is well-documented that tree size scales with vessel
   diameter variation at the stem base due to the effect of basipetal
   vessel widening, much less is known whether this likewise applies to
   terminal sun-exposed twigs. To analyze the effect of tree height on twig
   xylem anatomy, we compiled data for 279 tropical rainforest tree species
   belonging to 56 families in the lowlands of Jambi Province, Indonesia.
   Terminal upper-canopy twigs of fully grown individuals were collected
   and used for wood anatomical analysis. We show that hydraulically
   weighted vessel diameter (D (h)) and potential hydraulic conductivity (K
   (p)) of upper canopy twigs increase with tree height across species
   although the relationship was weak. When averaged across given tree
   height classes irrespectively of species identity, however, a strong
   dependency of tree height on D (h) and K (p) was observed, but not on
   the lumen-to-sapwood area ratio (A (l):A (x)) or vessel density (VD).
   According to the comparison between actual tree height and the maximum
   tree height reported for a given species in the stand, we show that the
   vascular xylem anatomy of their terminal twigs reflects their canopy
   position and thus ecological niche (understory versus overstory) at
   maturity. We conclude that the capacity to move large quantities of
   water during the diurnal peak in evaporative demand is a prerequisite
   for growing tall in a humid tropical environment.},

Abstract = {The diversity of species and their interactions have been positively
   related with environmental complexity. Therefore, highly anthropized
   environments have their integrity under serious threat. These effects
   may last for years compromising the dynamics of natural communities,
   such as antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, including
   host-natural enemy interactions. To investigate these effects, trap nest
   methodology was used to assess the diversity of solitary bees, wasps and
   their natural enemies in three fragmented environments with different
   degree of anthropic perturbation, composed of a Eucalyptus plantation
   (considered here as higher perturbation), a Cerrado area (medium
   perturbation) and a Riparian forest (lesser perturbation). Then,
   host-natural enemies associations were analysed to verify the size,
   specialization degree and modularity of interaction network. The
   gradient from highest to lowest degree of anthropic perturbation was
   evidenced in the species diversity index, the size of the interaction
   network and the specialization indexes of the host-natural enemy
   network. The environment with Eucalyptus plantation showed higher values
   of diversity of natural enemies, greater number of species in the
   interaction network, lesser degree of specialization in the interaction
   and lesser modularity, than Cerrado and Riparian forest environments,
   respectively. The low degree of nestedness and lack of significance of
   this index to all sampled areas are indicative of a specialized pattern
   of networks. The results corroborate the notion that human impact may
   affect interaction networks, this being an important tool for checking
   the degree of anthropic alteration.},

Title = {Intraspecific differentiation of Allium canadense var. canadense
   (Amaryllidaceae) across the North American Coastal Plain},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Polyploidy increases genetic variation in plants, leading to adaptations
   allowing expansion into novel habitats and increased genetic
   differentiation among populations isolated by barriers to dispersal.
   Allium canadense var. canadense is a polyploid taxon distributed within
   the North American Coastal Plain (NACP) biodiversity hotspot. It is the
   only one of six varieties in a species complex of wild onions native to
   North America that exhibits bulbils responsible for vegetative
   reproduction, which may lead to low levels of genetic variation within
   populations. Despite its threatened/endangered status in the northeast
   United States and noxious weed listing in Arkansas, USA, little is known
   about intraspecific differentiation among populations which may be
   impacted by riverine barriers or seasonal latitudinal gradients. We used
   sequences of one nuclear (ITS) and two chloroplast (trnL-F and
   rpl32-trnL) DNA regions generated from eight populations in the NACP and
   one population in Kansas, USA to examine genetic diversity and
   population structure of A. canadense var. canadense. A total of 12 ITS
   ribosomal and 10 chloroplast DNA haplotypes were identified.
   Phylogenetic analyses indicated two major lineages which corresponded to
   the genealogical relationships identified in the population structure
   analyses. Significant genetic subdivision among populations was detected
   across all populations by analysis of molecular variance. Overall,
   geographic structuring is apparent among populations of A. canadense
   var. canadense and populations showed moderate levels of gene diversity.
   These findings are indicative of the complex nature of polyploids and
   their contribution to genetic diversity among populations with mating
   systems that might otherwise have no phylogeographic structure.},

Abstract = {The associated species to Senecio glaucus in the newly reclaimed desert
   near to Wadi El-Assiuty of the Eastern Desert at Assiut Governorate,
   Egypt were investigated over two years (2018 and 2019). The allelopathic
   potential of S. glaucus against two crop plants (Triticum aestivum and
   Eruca sativa) was also evaluated. Floristically, 65 species within 59
   genera and 22 families were recorded (21 perennials and 44 annuals).
   Four families Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae captured
   about 54\% of this flora. Therophytes are the predominant life form
   followed by phanerophytes. Chorological analysis revealed that
   cosmopolitan and Saharo-Arabian elements constitute the main bulk of the
   total flora of the studied area. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct
   groups. Stands of group A characterized by the absence of S. glaucus and
   highest species diversity. Stands of group B, C and D included the
   associated species of S. glaucus and characterized by the dominance of
   cosmopolitans, grasses and salt tolerant species. The ordination
   techniques revealed the significant difference between group A and the
   others and showed the strong correlation between its flora with organic
   matter. The other three groups were highly correlated with coarse soil
   texture and total salts. Thirteen species were absent from stands of
   groups B, C and D in which S. glaucus was dominant. Phytochemical
   analysis of S. glaucus showed the prevalence of total phenolics and
   flavonoids in its shoots, while terpenoids were the highest in its
   flowers. All fractions of the plant components completely prevented
   germination of E. sativa seeds but exerted different magnitude of
   inhibition on germination of T. aestivum caryopses (especially with
   MeOH, capitula and shoot extracts). Estimation of phytotoxicity revealed
   that aqueous, ethyl acetate and capitula extracts significantly
   inhibited the germination of wheat caryopses and reduced the elongation
   rates of hypocotyl and epicotyl, and hence the whole length of
   seedlings.},

Title = {Vegetation diversity in East African wetlands: Cocktail algorithms
   supported by a vegetation-plot database},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-219},
Abstract = {Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems for biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem service provisioning, yet threatened by
   degradation and conversion into croplands. Conservation and land use
   management require data on vegetation structure and dynamics. The
   presented work is a response to a lacking consistent classification of
   East African wetland vegetation. Location: Namulonge valley in Uganda
   and Kilombero floodplain in Tanzania. Methods: We sampled 431 4
   m(2)-plots along land use intensity and flooding duration gradients. A
   floristic classification using the cocktail method was performed in a
   two-step approach. We developed definitions for vegetation units, using
   plot observations from the study sites in a first step and revised them
   in a second step by adding data from a vegetation-plot database and
   complied the definitions to an expert system for classification.
   Resulting vegetation units were analyzed regarding their life form
   composition, for which we implemented a classification based on life
   span and growth form. Following a literature review, the identified
   vegetation units were assigned either to existing phytosociological
   associations or proposals. Results: We recognize eight units of marsh
   and reed vegetation (class Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea) and five units of
   weed and pioneer vegetation under semi-aquatic conditions (class
   Oryzetea sativae). Five of these associations were previously described
   in the bibliographic references. The remaining eight are newly described
   in this work. The associations contrast in their life form composition
   with the five Oryzetea sativae associations dominated by obligate
   annuals and the Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea associations dominated by
   either reed plants or lacking a dominating life form. Conclusions: The
   developed expert system enables a comparison of wetland vegetation in
   the East African region and will support vegetation science and informed
   decision making about land use management and conservation. The two-step
   approach of revising a classification developed for single wetlands with
   a database is promising for data-scarce regions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most severe threats for ecosystems
   worldwide. Lakes can be studied as indicators of climate change. The
   prokaryotic compartment of lakes is affected by climate change, and the
   metabolic processes of prokaryotes could both attenuate or exacerbate
   the negative impacts of climate change on the ecosystem. However, in
   contrast to studies on the impact of global warming on eukaryotes,
   prokaryotes have been rarely studied in the context of climate change.
   In our study, we tested the impact of short-term temperature increases
   on taxonomic and physiological bacterial diversity and their
   relationships. We conducted an experiment with different temperature
   treatments using mesocosms filled with lake water from the same water
   reservoir. We monitored physicochemical parameters for 2 wk and examined
   taxonomic diversity using Illumina next-generation sequencing and
   metabolic diversity using 31 carbon sources by the Biolog EcoPlate (R)
   method. We showed that a continuous increase in water temperature for 14
   d significantly affected the taxonomic structure of bacteria that
   inhabit lake water. Even when the water temperature was within the
   temperate zone of 26 to 29 degrees C, a slight increase in biodiversity
   in the first few days was observed, and after 14 d, the change in
   temperature drastically decreased biodiversity. In the case of
   physiological diversity, the differences were relatively small.
   Similarly, we did not find a statistically significant correlation
   between the taxonomic and physiological diversity of lake bacteria in
   the context of climate change. This may indicate redundancy of aquatic
   bacteria communities.},

Abstract = {Didynamous stamens are separated into two pairs of different length, and
   the implication of this arrangement has not been well understood. The
   functional advantages of didynamous stamens were investigated in
   Brandisia hancei. Change of stamens during floral aging was recorded;
   the quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains were
   tested; the anther arrangement was manipulated into four types based on
   stamen category and number, and fruit set and number of seeds per fruit
   were measured. Didynamous stamens exhibited staggered anther
   arrangement, and pollen sacs dehisced gradually. There was no difference
   for quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains between the
   two pairs of anthers. Seed production after the removal of one long and
   one short stamen was higher than that of two long or two short stamens.
   Through prolonging pollen presentation and promoting delayed
   self-pollination, staggered arrangement and sequential dehiscence of
   anthers in didynamous stamens facilitate reproductive fitness of B.

Title = {Plant community assemblages and environmental drivers in the mountainous
   grassland ecosystem of South Africa},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {263-274},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is
   influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate,
   topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire
   and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant
   communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and
   determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial
   distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was
   firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and
   refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE
   programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the
   most important environmental variables influencing the spatial
   distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data
   were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid
   databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the
   remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020
   was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in
   nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis
   showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be
   significant at a 95\% confidence level and positively correlated with
   the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but
   negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710,
   p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly
   positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r <
   0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well
   as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance
   in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies
   for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and
   also to monitor vegetation change over time.},

Title = {Nitrate availability modulates induced defenses in Phaeocystis globosa
   against protozoan grazers},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Colony formation by Phaecoystis has been widely considered an induced
   defense mechanism against various grazers and contributes to the
   occurrence of algal blooms in nitrate-enriched waters. However, the
   effects of nitrate availability on these induced defenses against
   protozoan grazers remain unclear. Four P. globosa strains isolated from
   4 off-coast areas of the South China Sea were exposed to grazing cues
   associated with the ciliate Euplotes vannus and the heterotrophic
   dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina under nitrate-sufficient and
   nitrate-deficient conditions to evaluate whether nitrate availability
   modulates the expression and costs of induced defenses. Except for one
   strain exposed to ciliate cues under nitrate-deficient conditions, all
   strains expressed defensive responses to grazing cues. Colony numbers
   consistently increased in the presence of grazing cues regardless of
   nitrate availability, although the amplitude of the increase was greater
   under nitrate-deficient conditions. Negative linear relationships were
   observed between colony numbers and population growth rates for 2
   strains under nitrate-deficient conditions, suggesting increased
   energetic costs of defenses. The other 2 strains that did not exhibit
   negative relationships between colony numbers and growth nevertheless
   exhibited decreased cellular particulate organic carbon, particulate
   organic nitrogen, and chlorophyll a content in addition to smaller
   cellular diameters, suggesting that P. globosa can save energetic costs
   by adjusting physiological processes and cell sizes. These results
   suggest that nitrate availability strongly modulates the expression of
   induced grazing defenses and substantially influences the partitioning
   of cells into colonial or solitary forms in Phaeocystis, thereby also
   modulating their ecological roles in local food webs.},

Title = {Syntaxonomy and ecology of mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan
   (Middle Asia)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Aims: In this paper we propose the first syntaxonomic classification for
   the mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan with some remarks on
   their environmental variability. Methods: Altogether 120 relev??s were
   sam-pled using the standard, seven-degree cover-abundance scale of
   Braun-Blanquet, in 2015???2021. They were clas-sified by the modified
   TWINSPAN method using the four step interval scale with cutoff levels of
   0\%, 2\%, 5\% and 10\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster
   heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi
   coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) was used to determine the rela-tionship between the sampled plots,
   vegetation units and major gradients in species composition. Results:
   Plant communities known so far as ??hiblyak and including xeric and
   mesophilic shrublands seral or marginal to broad-leaved forests in the
   nemoral zone of the Irano-Turanian region are described herein.
   Numerical analyses of vegetation data allowed distinguishing five
   associations representing the Ranunculo tenuilobi-Cotoneasteri-on
   hissarici alliance. The new associations include: Eremuro
   comosi-Rhuidetum coriariae, Calophacetum gran-diflorae, Fraxinetum
   raibocarpae, Pruno sogdianae-Crataegetum turkestanicae, Aflatunio
   ulmifoliae-Caraga-netum turkestanicae. For the latter association, two
   habitat variants (with Ferula clematidifolia and Malus sieversii) are
   proposed. The main factors determining the species composition of the
   studied vegetation include: elevation, mean annual temperature and sum
   of annual precipitation. Conclusions: The research results herein
   presented fill the gap in knowledge about the shrubland vegetation of
   Tajikistan. Studies in neighbouring coun-tries and a focus on subalpine
   scrubs in dry habitats are needed to complete the classification of
   shrubland vegetation of Middle Asia.},

Title = {Nest survival and productivity of translocated and resident burrowing
   owls in Arizona},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Development activities associated with urbanization can directly
   displace animals, causing high mortality and dispersal rates. Wildlife
   managers have attempted to mitigate the impacts of development on
   burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), a species susceptible to
   ground-disturbing activities, by translocating them away from areas
   slated for development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of
   translocation on burrowing owl reproduction by comparing nest survival
   and productivity of owls involved in an ongoing translocation program in
   Arizona, USA, with that of resident owls. We used nest survival models
   to evaluate differences in nest survival and generalized linear models
   with Poisson error to assess differences in productivity. In 2017,
   cumulative nest survival (CNS) was lower among current-year translocated
   owls (i.e., owls translocated within the last year; CNS = 0.34, 95\% CI
   = 0.18, 0.51) compared to non-translocated resident owls (0.83, 95\% CI
   = 0.71, 0.94), but CNS was similar between previously translocated owls
   (i.e., those translocated >1 yr ago, CNS = 0.81, 95\% CI = 0.64, 0.98)
   and residents. Likewise, in 2018, CNS was lower for current-year
   translocated owls (CNS = 0.12, 95\% CI = 0.00, 0.24) compared to
   residents (CNS = 0.68, 95\% CI = 0.50, 0.87) and previously translocated
   owls (CNS = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.40, 0.90). Productivity was significantly
   lower for current-year translocated owls ( x <overline> = 0.5
   fledglings/nest) compared to residents ( x <overline> = 2.4
   fledglings/nest) and previously translocated owls ( x <overline> = 1.5
   fledglings/nest) across sites and years. With the current methods of
   translocation, owls had poor reproductive success in the first year
   after release, but if they survived 2 years after release, they had
   similar nest survival and productivity compared to residents. Our
   results demonstrate that the current practice of releasing translocated
   burrowing owls in the Phoenix, Arizona area during the breeding season
   depresses reproduction and should be substantially changed. Nest
   survival was low and this was mainly attributed to nest establishment of
   translocated owls within release tents (acclimation structures used in
   translocations that involve soft release) where 85\% of nests failed
   following tent removal. Translocation approaches that reflect a closer
   fit to the timing and behavior of the species should be tested to
   determine whether they result in better success. In particular, future
   studies should examine the translocation results of releasing owls as
   male-female pairs or single birds during the nonbreeding period.},

Title = {Estimating roe deer density using motion-sensitive cameras in
   Switzerland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wildlife conservation and management need accurate methods for
   population survey and monitoring. Absolute counts of roe deer
   populations (Capreolus capreolus) are not possible, but the rapid
   advancement of motion-sensitive camera technologies and new analytical
   approaches might potentially lead to more precise estimates at lower
   costs compared to traditional survey methods. We applied spatially
   explicit photographic capture-recapture models (SCR) in the Lake Geneva
   basin, Switzerland, from 25 April to 20 September 2018 to estimate roe
   deer densities in a pilot survey. We investigated the effect of survey
   duration and camera density on male roe deer density estimates to select
   the sampling design that produced density estimates with sufficient
   accuracy and precision at lower costs (i.e., material, fieldwork, data
   processing, and analyses). Males could be identified based on their
   antlers, which allowed us to apply SCR to estimate their density.
   Because females could not be identified individually, we inferred the
   overall roe deer density (adult and sub-adult roe deer) based on the sex
   ratio estimated from motion-sensitive camera photos. According to the
   results of sub-sampling simulations and by taking into account the
   financial costs associated with fieldwork and analyses, we conclude that
   20 motion-sensitive cameras set over 20 nights (i.e., the 20/20 method)
   is a good compromise to provide reliable estimates of male roe deer
   density. Furthermore, studies estimating overall roe deer density using
   SCR and sex ratio estimates should be conducted from mid-August to the
   end of October just after rutting season and the peak of yearling
   dispersal, when the movement rates of males and females, and hence their
   detection probabilities, are similar and when males are still carrying
   their antlers. This approach was successfully applied in 4 selected
   study areas with contrasting roe deer management regimes, resulting in
   overall roe deer density estimates ranging from 3.9 +/- 1.3 (SE)
   deer/km(2) forest to 22.5 +/- 6.1 deer/km(2) forest. Our study provides

Title = {Striped hyaena den site selection in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {The den is a multi-purpose critical space of carnivores and provides a
   growth conducive refuge which ensures both substances and protection
   from interspecific predation and harsh climate. Selection of optimal den
   sites determined by various site-specific factors potentially reduces
   aversive interspecific interactions and provides cost-effective access
   to food sources. In this study, we have assessed the factors determining
   the den site selection by a small population of striped hyaena, Hyaena
   hyaena in a shared landscape dominated by large carnivores. We assessed
   den site selection as a function of vegetation patch characteristics,
   site-specific anthropogenic threats/activities and topographical
   variables using Bayesian algorithm through field collected binomial data
   on den use by the species. Our model suggested that hyaenas select rocky
   refugia surrounded by trees and tall grasses, situated on mountain
   slopes proximate to a water body. Our study consolidated the importance
   of undulating terrain in the species ecology and postulated the slope as
   an `energy-expensive' terrain that refrains frequent movement of other
   carnivores, in turn providing more affordable denning space for the
   striped hyaena. This study provides critical information on denning
   ecology of last remaining major breeding population striped hyaena of
   southern India.},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {In this work, we focused on the functional characterization of
   unicellular eukaryotic assemblages that had previously been
   taxonomically characterized by 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a
   eutrophic coastal site with marked plankton blooms. Biological traits of
   different functional groups were assigned to the retrieved operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). The traits included size, trophic strategy, the
   presence of spines, mucilage production, colony formation, motility,
   spore formation, and potential harmfulness. Functional diversity indices
   were calculated and compared to analogous taxonomic diversity indices,
   indicating a strong positive coupling of richness and dominance and a
   negative coupling of evenness, even at a low taxonomic resolution (at
   the family/genus/species level). Biological trait trade-offs and
   co-occurrences of specific traits were evident during the succession of
   plankton blooms. The trophic strategy dominating in the assemblages
   frequently alternated between autotrophy, mixotrophy, and a few recorded
   cases of parasitism. Given that there was no indication of nutrient
   limitation, we suggest that biotic pressures force marine eukaryotes to
   exploit narrow niches by adopting specific strategies/traits that favour
   their survival. These traits act by increasing resource acquisition
   potential and via predator avoidance. This leads to a unique succession
   of blooms in the system, characterized by adaptations of the bloom taxa
   that are a direct response to the preceding assemblage.},

Title = {Substrate diversity affects carbon utilization rate and threshold
   concentration for uptake by natural bacterioplankton communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {95-108},
Abstract = {Y Persistence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environments
   may in part be explained by high diversity and low concentrations of
   carbon substrates. However, changes in dissolved substrate quality can
   modify aquatic bacterial community composition and rate of carbon
   uptake. The aim of this study was to test if the presence of multiple
   simple substrates affects the turnover of organic carbon. Natural
   bacterial communities were grown in continuous cultures supplied with
   either individual carbon substrates-salicylic acid (SA), tryptophan
   (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr)-or a combination of the 3 substrates.
   Concentrations were tracked using fluorescence spectroscopy, and
   steady-state concentrations of a few nanomolar were reached. Bacterial
   growth efficiency was dependent on which carbon sources were present and
   reached an intermediate level in the combined treatment. The bacterial
   community maintained steady-state concentrations of Trp that were lower
   in the combined treatment than in the individual substrate treatment. In
   addition, steady-state concentrations were reached faster during growth
   on combined carbon substrates, although the maximum utilization rate of
   each individual compound was lower. However, the steady-state
   concentration of total carbon (sum of carbon content of SA, Trp and Tyr)
   was higher in the combined culture than in the individual substrate
   treatments, and seemed to be determined by the carbon substate for which
   the bacteria had the lowest affinity. The results from this study
   indicate that persistence of dissolved organic carbon can in part be
   explained by vast substrate diversity, which raises the threshold
   concentration for utilization by natural bacterial communities.},

Title = {Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in visual obstruction in
   line-transect distance sampling of gopher tortoises},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Line-transect distance sampling (LTDS) surveys are commonly used to
   estimate abundance of animals or objects. In terrestrial LTDS surveys of
   gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrows, the presence of
   ground-level vegetation substantially decreases detection of burrows of
   all sizes, but no field or analytical methods exist to control for
   spatially heterogeneous vegetation obstruction as a source of variation
   in detection. We propose the addition of a simple measurement of
   ground-level vegetation that serves as a covariate for the detection
   function. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model in which covariates
   burrow width and nearby vegetation height help to account for detection
   bias and improve precision of estimated density. We investigate the
   performance of this covariate by simulation and by using real LTDS data
   collected before and after application of prescribed fire. We collected
   data in 2018 at the Jones Center at Ichauway in Newton, Georgia, USA.
   Across all simulations, our model including both covariates produced the
   most accurate density point estimates of any of the models tested. For
   our case study, our Bayesian model with vegetation covariates tended to
   produce similar estimates of density before and after burns. Our study
   indicates that any level of spatial variation in vegetation obstruction
   decreases detection of burrows and may lead to underestimation in
   population size (<= 68\%) and proportion of individuals with small
   burrow sizes (<= 32\%) when not considered during analysis. Our work is
   extensible to other terrestrial sampling efforts where systematic
   measurement of a spatially distributed obstructing feature is feasible
   during the LTDS survey.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Use of band recovery data combined with estimates of hunter harvests
   provides a foundation for estimation of abundance and population
   trajectory for a variety of wildlife species. We banded 3,141 Rio Grande
   wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) during 2015-2021 and used
   band-recovery data to assess annual survival and harvest, and to
   generate population estimates for male Rio Grande wild turkeys in Texas,
   USA. Our results indicated male recovery rate was age-specific (adult =
   0.095 +/- 0.010 {[}SE]; juvenile = 0.036 +/- 0.009) and adult and
   juvenile male annual survival was 0.49 +/- 0.04 and 0.96 +/- 0.14,
   respectively. Annual survival for adult females (0.68 +/- 0.02) was
   lower than for juvenile females (0.98 +/- 0.01). Female recovery rates
   were not different between fall and spring (0.017 +/- 0.004; 0.013 +/-
   0.003, respectively) and combined harvest rate was 0.009 +/- 0.006. Male
   population estimates, based on hunter harvest estimates, exhibited
   considerable temporal variation, ranging from 328,185 +/- 66,313 in 2016
   to 136,700 +/- 27,621 in 2020. Using harvest average over the 7-year
   study period, we estimated average male abundance was 228,709 +/-
   46,213. Female population estimates ranged from 895,556 +/- 635,146 in
   2016 to 409,889 +/- 290,702 in 2020. We estimated an average female
   population of 561,578 +/- 396,507. Researchers and managers should
   continue banding Rio Grande wild turkeys to assess long-term trends and
   conduct additional work to confirm the accuracy of harvest estimates in
   Texas.},

Title = {Historical account and current ecological knowledge of the southernmost
   lizard in the world, Liolaemus magellanicus (Squamata: Liolaemidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Background The systematics of Liolaemus magellanicus has been relatively
   well researched, but despite its recognition as the southernmost lizard
   in the world, scant attention has been paid to the discovery,
   distribution, biogeography, and ecology of this lizard at the southern
   tip of South America. I hereby research such aspects and collate the
   most relevant information reported in the primary literature. Methods
   and Results I conducted a selective review of the history of discovery,
   distributional records, biogeography, and ecological features of L.
   magellanicus, as recorded in mainstream journals and landmark monographs
   and books. I specifically omitted the work on the systematics of the
   species and genus because its complexity warrants separate treatment. I
   found scattered references to this lizard starting with the chronicles
   of several overseas expeditions (British, French, and Swedish), with
   Darwin, Jacquinot and Guichenot, and Anderson and Ohlin acting as
   informers; and culminating with Skottsberg, a traveler, and Bridges, an
   early settler in Tierra del Fuego Island. Modern treatment of this
   species started with Hellmich in the 1930s and Donoso-Barros in the
   1960s in Chile, and with Cei in Argentina in the 1960s and has continued
   chiefly in the latter country until today. Discussion I propose this
   species as a model ectothermic vertebrate that may serve to test
   hypotheses about: (a) Resource allocation strategies to deal with a
   harsh environment that affords limited opportunities for foraging and
   reproductive activities of a lizard. (b) Behavioral strategies for
   dealing with thermoregulation, food, and mate acquisition, and care -if
   any-of offspring. (c) Its place within the rather impoverished food web
   of which this species forms part of. This relatively new species, which
   persisted in glacial refuges before being cut off into two
   subpopulations-one mainlander, another islander-also offers fertile
   ground for testing population genetic, evolutionary, and phylogeographic
   hypotheses. I think that biogeographers, systematists, evolutionists,
   physiologists, and ecologists should take advantage of this uniquely
   positioned species in the southernmost margin of the world.},

Title = {Microalgal characterization during a mucilaginous bloom on deep
   gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo MPA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {161-165},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in frequency, but despite an
   extreme increase in research on this topic, general knowledge on HABs is
   still scarce. Mucilaginous algal blooms, in particular, are ever more
   present and can heavily affect marine ecosystems. Gorgonians appear
   significantly affected, as their branches are easily entangled (pelagic
   aggregates) and overgrown (benthic aggregates) by mucilage. Moreover,
   their proximity to the bottom makes them susceptible to benthic anoxia.
   In the present study, we investigated the mucilaginous bloom that
   affected the gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo Marine
   Protected Area (MPA) (NE coast of Sardinia) in summer 2020. We focused
   mainly on the characterization of dominant benthic microalgae,
   identifying those responsible for the bloom. Sampling was performed
   considering the colonies of Paramuricea clavata present on hard
   substrata along 2 transects near the Secca del Papa, in the B Zone of
   the MPA. The characterization of the microalgal community and the count
   of the most abundant species (>10 cells ml-1) were carried out using the
   Utermohl sedimentation method. The community was mainly composed of
   diatoms (Bacillariophyta) belonging to the genera Pseudo-nitzschia,
   Nitzschia and Cylindrotheca. C. closterium appeared to be the most
   abundant species. These results confirm the importance of diatoms during
   Tyrrhenian mucilaginous blooms, which could be particularly harmful to
   gorgonians.},

Title = {Managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers is more complicated under climate
   change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Open pine (Pinus spp.) savannas are home to the federally endangered
   red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis). Frequent fires are
   essential for maintaining the open canopy and wiregrass (Aristida
   stricta) groundcover preferred by these woodpeckers, which face ongoing
   threats from climate change, hurricanes, and land use change. Our
   objective was to project future changes in habitat for red-cockaded
   woodpeckers at the Fort Bragg military installation in North Carolina,
   USA, under different scenarios of climate and disturbances from 2000 to
   2050. We used a spatially explicit, forest simulation model (LANDIS-II)
   to simulate climate change, hurricanes, and forest management
   (prescribed fire, thinning, harvesting). We examined the relative risks
   of climate change and hurricanes to red-cockaded woodpecker habitat and
   quantified the capacity of management practices to promote their
   habitat, given hurricanes and projected changes in climate. Climate
   change had little direct effect on red-cockaded woodpecker habitat, but
   it reduced the capacity of managers to use prescribed fire, as currently
   practiced. This effect became more pronounced in the scenario with low
   prescribed fire frequency, which caused a 10\% decline in habitat under
   climate change. Hurricanes had a more substantial impact on red-cockaded
   woodpecker habitat than climate change or management, causing an average
   decline in extent by 41\% compared to scenarios without hurricanes. Our
   work suggests that hurricanes pose a greater threat to red-cockaded
   woodpecker habitat than climate change, but despite these threats,
   overall habitat will likely still increase until 2050, which bodes well
   for this endangered species. Deployment of prescribed burning became
   more challenging under climate warming, and if this trend continues, it
   may threaten red-cockaded woodpecker conservation efforts over the next
   century.},

Title = {Movement of white-tailed deer in contrasting landscapes influences
   management of chronic wasting disease},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) continues to expand in distribution and
   prevalence across North America. Upon detection, either for the first
   time in a novel area or in a region with an existing outbreak, wildlife
   management agencies are tasked with responding to mitigate the disease.
   This response often entails creation or modification of a management
   zone with modified rules and regulations that support an agency's
   disease management plan. To guide the process of creating an
   appropriately sized CWD management zone, assuming that wild deer
   movements are a major risk factor for disease spread, we used data from
   global positioning system (GPS)-collared white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) in southeastern Minnesota and southcentral Pennsylvania,
   USA, between 2018 and 2021 to estimate long-distance movements
   associated with dispersal and migratory behaviors. These contrasting
   study areas with active CWD outbreaks permitted an evaluation of deer
   movement dynamics in different parts of their range. We quantified the
   proportion, distribution, timing, and orientation of dispersing and
   migratory deer. We observed 21\% of female and 58\% of male yearlings
   disperse from their apparent natal home range in Minnesota, while in
   Pennsylvania 4\% of female and 68\% of male yearlings dispersed. We also
   documented 20\% of females and 6\% of males migrated between seasonal
   home ranges in Minnesota, while in Pennsylvania no females and 5\% of
   males migrated. The average distance deer dispersed or migrated in
   Minnesota was 20 km and 11 km, respectively, while in Pennsylvania male
   deer dispersed only about 4 km. Both sexes in Minnesota tended to
   disperse in a consistent, westerly direction; however, there was no
   directional preference observed for migratory deer or for dispersing
   deer in Pennsylvania. We found differences between natal and adult home
   range size for both sexes in Minnesota but not for males in
   Pennsylvania. Our results identify the considerable variability in
   dispersal and migration dynamics of white-tailed deer in disparate
   landscapes, which is important to agencies managing CWD. We summarize
   the distribution of these movements and suggest agencies use this
   information to help make decisions about optimal management zone size.
   We suggest the development of formalized assessments of the tradeoffs
   associated with optimizing decisions about creation of CWD management
   zones across white-tailed deer populations that exhibit variation in
   dispersal behavior and suggest careful evaluation to avoid using an
   arbitrary size or shape to create disease management zones.},

Title = {Factors affecting age at primiparity in black bears},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Effective wildlife management requires an understanding of the factors
   affecting population vital rates. Age at primiparity can be an important
   determinant of population growth rates. Thus, understanding the factors
   influencing age at primiparity in wild populations is important for
   their management and conservation. American black bears (Ursus
   americanus) are widely distributed in North America and show
   considerable variation in age at primiparity across their range. We
   tested hypotheses regarding top-down and bottom-up drivers of age at
   primiparity in black bears across the province of Ontario, Canada. We
   obtained estimates of age at primiparity using cementum patterns in
   1,033 bear teeth collected as part of regulated harvest in 2018 and
   2019. We compared mean ages at primiparity between 2 distinct forest
   regions in Ontario using a Wilcoxon test. To quantify the effects of
   multiple putative drivers of variation in primiparity (e.g., harvest
   density, food availability, land use, climate), we paired yearly
   probability of primiparity data with environmental covariates in a mixed
   effects logistic regression model. Age at primiparity was significantly
   lower in the more productive forest region, likely reflecting
   broad-scale patterns of food availability. Further, there was a
   significant positive effect of growing degree days (annual sum of daily
   mean degrees >5 degrees C) on probability of primiparity, likely related
   to its influence on ecosystem productivity. Harvest density was
   negatively related to the probability of primiparity, possibly because
   harvest is positively correlated with bear density at this broad scale,
   and competition for food resources increases with bear density. Overall,
   temporal variation in food availability had a positive effect on
   probability of primiparity in a model fit to data for which we had the
   highest confidence in age estimates from cementum. Mean age at
   primiparity was older (5.57 yr) than in other more southernly
   populations, and most harvested bears (53\%) were harvested prior to
   reproducing. Our analysis suggests that black bear age at primiparity is
   primarily driven by bottom-up forces related to climate and vegetation
   differences that lead to greater food availability in the south. The
   relatively old age at primiparity and high apparent mortality rate of
   young animals in this population suggests that harvest can limit
   recruitment substantially, which needs to be considered when making
   management decisions.},

   species composition. Study area: Western Ukraine and Romania. Methods:
   We assembled a dataset of 711 relev??s of thermophilous herb-rich
   vegetation (Trifolio-Geranietea) from the study area and adjacent
   regions of Eastern Poland and Slovakia using own field research,
   literature survey and large databases. Using intersection of three
   different classification algorithms (beta-flexible, modified TWINSPAN
   and K-means clustering) we identified a consensus delimitation of the
   vegetation type. NMDS ordination, analysis of diagnostic, constant and
   dominant species, and Didukh indicator values were used to characterize
   its species composition and habitat conditions. Results: Altogether 58
   relev??s from Western Ukraine and Romania were classified to a tall herb
   -dominated vegetation type that we identified with the association
   Trollio-Clematidetum recti T??uber et Weber 1976 described from Romania.
   We assigned it to the alliance Geranion sanguinei. It differs from other
   communities of this alliance in its preference for shady slopes, greater
   stand height and considerable representation of mesophilous and montane
   species. It is confined to calcareous bedrock with high soil pH and high
   mineral richness. Conclusions: We suggest that the studied tall
   herb-dominated vegetation is a specific steppe type, confined to
   relatively moist and nutrient rich sites in the peri-Carpathian area.
   Analogous vegetation occurs in the Alps, Balkans, hemiboreal Europe,
   South Urals and Western Siberia. Its species composition and
   biogeographical relationships provide further support for the hypothesis
   that steppe meadows of Central Europe, including tall herb-dominated
   stands, are linked to the Pleistocene and early-Holocene forest-steppe
   of temperate Eurasia.},

Title = {Community Structure of Terrestrial Vertebrates in a Restored Meadow
   Habitat in Pennsylvania: Assessing the Potential Prey Base for Eastern
   Massasauga Rattlesnakes},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We sampled the vertebrate community of a 20-ha conservation easement in
   Venango County, PA, from April through August 2021. The restoration and
   management efforts on this easement were designed to improve the meadow
   habitat for one of the few remaining populations of Sistrurus catenatus
   (Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake) in Pennsylvania, and our sampling
   efforts were focused on evaluating the potential prey base available to
   the rattlesnakes at this site. We identified 9 amphibian species, 10
   reptile species, and 11 small mammal species. For amphibians, Anaxyrus
   americanus (American Toad) was the most abundant species, accounting for
   32.6\% of the total, followed by Notophthalmus viridescens (Red-Spotted
   Newt) with 30.6\% of total abundance. Thamnophis brachystoma
   (Short-Headed Gartersnake) comprised more than half (53.7\%) of all
   reptiles sampled, followed by Thamnophis sirtalis (Eastern Gartersnake;
   22.7\%). Peromyscus leucopus (White- Footed Mouse) was the most abundant
   mammal species, accounting for 37.4\% of all mammals surveyed, followed
   by Microtus pennsylvanicus (Eastern Meadow Vole; 24.8\%). Mammals had
   the greatest species richness (S = 11), while reptiles had the greatest
   total abundance (TA = 361), and amphibians had the greatest species
   evenness (E = 0.799). Species accounts for Venango County indicate that
   we sampled 40.9\% (9/22), 37.0\% (10/27), and 21.2\% (11/52) of the
   known amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian species, respectively, within
   this restored meadow habitat. Our results suggest that the restoration
   efforts on this easement study site have been extremely effective in
   creating meadow habitat that supports a diversity of prey species for
   the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake.},

Title = {Pinanga palms revisited 20 years on: what can changes in Pinanga species
   populations tell us about rainforest understory palm persistence?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 15},
Abstract = {Borneo is the centre of diversity of the palm genus Pinanga. At least 13
   understory species have been recorded in the Ulu Temburong National Park
   in Brunei, but little is known of their persistence. Changes in
   populations of Pinanga understory palms may be indicative of more
   widespread changes due to climate change, such as changes in rainfall,
   which may be important for the palm diversity in the protected area.
   However, we know little about the population dynamics of these palms,
   how persistent their populations are or if they behave similarly over
   long time frames. In 1998, populations of five co-occurring species of
   Pinanga at several locations in the Ulu Temburong National Park were
   documented. This project aimed to undertake a comprehensive resurvey of
   the original five Pinanga palm species populations in order to assess if
   they showed similar population changes across sites and species after
   two decades. Overall, most species maintained their population size in
   the surveyed region but not consistently among sites, and one species
   significantly declined in abundance. There was considerable variation in
   population growth rate (R) within and among species and sites that was
   significantly correlated with density and the percentage of
   multi-stemmed plants. There was evidence of pulsed recruitment in some
   species and or sites rather than steady or exponential patterns of
   population growth.},

Title = {Herb-subshrub diversity in open savanna sites with distinct fire regimes
   in the Jalapao region, Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 23},
Abstract = {The fire regime is essential in creating a mosaic of plant structure and
   diversity in South American open savannas, especially favouring herbs.
   However, studies investigating diversity patterns in Neotropical
   savannas rarely focus on the herb-subshrub layer. This study
   investigated the variation of the herb-subshrub layer under contrasting
   fire regimes in the most conserved site within the Cerrado Domain, the
   Jalapao region, Brazil. We selected four sites of open savanna
   physiognomy with similar topographic, climatic and edaphic features:
   three burned every 2 years, while the fourth site has remained unburned
   for at least the last 10 years. We randomly distributed 15 plots of 4
   m(2) in each site and identified all herbs and subshrubs in each plot to
   estimate density, richness, alpha diversity and species composition. The
   unburned site had lower herb-subshrub density, richness and diversity
   than the frequently burned sites. Species composition varied between
   frequently burned and unburned sites, partially explained by the fire
   frequency across sites. Although other ecological factors may explain
   the patterns detected, we cannot rule out the importance of fire in
   structuring plant communities in the Jalapao region. As in other
   savannas, our study in the Cerrado Domain reinforces the essential role
   of the fire regimes in modifying and maintaining the diversity of
   herbaceous plants at the landscape scale.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {One of the many ecosystem services provided by dung beetles is that of
   secondary seed dispersal. This paper experimentally evaluates the
   effectiveness of this service using the chimpanzee-dung beetle seed
   dispersal system in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. The study focussed
   on the germination rate and success of four species of seeds contained
   in the faeces of Pan troglodytes verus: Dacryodes klaineana (Pierre)
   H.J. Lam, Diospyros mannii Hiern, Pycnanthus angolensis (Welw.) Warb.,
   and Uapaca guineensis Muell. Arg. For each species, 600 seeds, half from
   chimpanzee faeces and half from mother trees, were sown in nurseries at
   depths of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 cm (i.e. 120 seeds per depth; 60 from
   chimp and 60 from mother trees). After germination, only the seeds of
   Uapaca guineensis and Diospyros mannii sown at 2 and 5 cm had a >14\%
   rate (between 14.2 and 30.8\%) of germination and seedling
   establishment, regardless of seed origin. An increase in the depth of
   seed burial appears to negatively affect the probability of seedling
   emergence and establishment. This study shows that dung beetles have
   positive impacts on seed fate. However, for these plant species, the
   chimpanzee's role is limited to that of primary seed dispersal.},

Title = {Documenting Emerging Insects, Environmental DNA, and Metal

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Accurately documenting aquatic insects is of the utmost importance given
   recent proposals for a paradigm shift in conservation to protect
   less-charismatic species that are necessary for ecosystem functioning.
   We used both field techniques and molecular methods to assess
   biodiversity in a stream in southwest Virginia. We used emergence traps
   to collect organisms that emerged from the stream as reproducing adults
   over a 4-week period and collected environmental samples (e.g., water,
   sediment) to sequence the DNA found in the samples. Emerging aquatic
   insect abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time. More
   family richness was detected using environmental DNA (eDNA) than
   traditional field sampling; however, many families detected using field
   techniques were not recovered using eDNA, furthering support that both
   protocols are necessary for fully documenting biodiversity. We did not
   have much success in identifying eDNA sequences to species with high
   sequence similarity, suggesting that invertebrate biodiversity of
   southwest Virginia is not well-documented in open-source DNA sequence
   databases. In addition to documenting insect biodiversity, we measured

   On homeotic transformations in lorises and pottos},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {196-210},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mammals almost always have seven cervical vertebrae. The strong
   evolutionary constraint on changes in this number has been broken in
   sloths and manatees. We have proposed that the extremely low activity
   and metabolic rates of these species relax the stabilizing selection
   against changes in the cervical count. Our hypothesis is that strong
   stabilizing selection in other mammals is largely indirect and due to
   associated pleiotropic effects, including juvenile cancers. Additional
   direct selection can occur due to biomechanical problems (thoracic
   outlet syndrome). Low metabolic and activity rates are thought to
   diminish these direct and indirect effects. To test this hypothesis
   within the primates, we have compared the number of cervical vertebrae
   of three lorisid species with particularly low activity and metabolic
   rates with those of more active primate species, including with their
   phylogenetically closest active relatives, the galagids (bushbabies). In
   support of our hypothesis, we found that 37.6\% of the lorisid specimens
   had an abnormal cervical count, which is a higher percentage than in the
   other nine primate families, in which the incidence varied from zero to
   2.2\%. We conclude that our data support the importance of internal
   selection in constraining evolvability and of a relaxed stabilizing
   selection for increasing evolvability. Additionally, we discuss that
   there is no support for a role of the muscularized diaphragm in the
   evolutionary constraint.},

Title = {Burrowing constrains patterns of skull shape evolution in wrasses},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {73-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolution of behavioral and ecological specialization can have
   marked effects on the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Head-first
   burrowing has been shown to exert powerful selective pressures on the
   head and body shapes of many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. In
   wrasses, burrowing behaviors have evolved multiple times independently,
   and are commonly used in foraging and predator avoidance behaviors.
   While recent studies have examined the kinematics and body shape
   morphology associated with this behavior, no study to-date has examined
   the macroevolutionary implications of burrowing on patterns of
   phenotypic diversification in this clade. Here, we use three-dimensional
   geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to study
   the evolution of skull shape in fossorial wrasses and their relatives.
   We test for skull shape differences between burrowing and non burrowing
   wrasses and evaluate hypotheses of shape convergence among the burrowing
   wrasses. We also quantify rates of skull shape evolution between
   burrowing and non burrowing wrasses to test for whether burrowing
   constrains or accelerates rates of skull shape evolution in this clade.
   We find that while burrowing and non burrowing wrasses exhibit similar
   degrees of morphological disparity, for burrowing wrasses, it took
   nearly twice as long to amass this disparity. Furthermore, while the
   disparities between groups are evenly matched, we find that most
   burrowing species are confined to a particular region of shape space
   with most species exhibiting narrower heads than many non-burrowing
   species. These results suggest head-first burrowing constrains patterns
   of skull shape diversification in wrasses by potentially restricting the
   range of phenotypes that can perform this behavior.},

Title = {A detailed redescription of the mesoderm/neural crest cell boundary in

Abstract = {The morphology of the mammalian chondrocranium appears to differ
   significantly from those of other amniotes, since the former possesses
   uniquely developed brain and cranial sensory organs. In particular, a
   question has long remained unanswered as to the developmental and
   evolutionary origins of a cartilaginous nodule called the ala
   hypochiasmatica. In this study, we investigated the embryonic origin of
   skeletal elements in the murine orbitotemporal region by combining
   genetic cell lineage analysis with detailed morphological observation.
   Our results showed that the mesodermal embryonic environment including
   the ala hypochiasmatica, which appeared as an isolated mesodermal
   distribution in the neural crest-derived prechordal region, is formed as
   a part of the mesoderm that continued from the chordal region during
   early chondrocranial development. The mesoderm/neural crest cell
   boundary in the head mesenchyme is modified through development,
   resulting in the secondary mesodermal expansion to invade into the
   prechordal region. We thus revealed that the ala hypochiasmatica
   develops as the frontier of the mesodermal sheet stretched along the
   cephalic flexure. These results suggest that the mammalian ala
   hypochiasmatica has evolved from a part of the mesodermal primary
   cranial wall in ancestral amniotes. In addition, the endoskeletal
   elements in the orbitotemporal region, such as the orbital cartilage,
   suprapterygoid articulation of the palatoquadrate, and trabecula, some
   of which were once believed to represent primitive traits of amniotes
   and to be lost in the mammalian lineage, have been confirmed to exist in
   the mammalian cranium. Consequently, the mammalian chondrocranium can
   now be explained in relation to the pan-amniote cranial configuration.},

Title = {Bird carcass detection from integrated trials at multiple wind farms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is often necessary to estimate the number of wind turbine collision
   fatalities to assess impacts to birds following construction of wind
   farms. Detection of bird carcasses at wind turbines in the field is
   affected by carcass persistence and searcher detection rate. Integrated
   detection trials, which integrate carcass persistence and searcher
   detection trials into the periodic fatality search, have been proposed
   as an effective method for estimating these parameters. The purpose of
   our study was to test whether and how environmental factors affect
   integrated detection trial outcomes at multiple wind farms. We conducted
   this study at 10 wind farms in various environments of Japan. Binary
   data on trial outcomes in open versus forested areas served as our
   response variable in a generalized additive mixed model informed by days
   into trial, carcass body mass, season, whether snow covered the ground,
   and precipitation. For both ground cover types, days into trial and body
   mass were included in all the top models, suggesting that these factors
   most influenced bird carcass detection probability in integrated trials.
   The best model in open areas included days into trial, body mass, snow,
   and precipitation, and the best model in forested areas included days
   into trial, body mass, snow, precipitation, and season. Values of area
   under the curve indicated high accuracy of the best model for both
   ground cover types. The survey design needs to be appropriate to the
   size of the target species and to the environment in which the impacts
   will occur, such as the site's seasonality, its ground cover, and
   whether snow will cover the ground. Frequency of post-construction
   fatality monitoring should also be set cautiously, especially at wind
   farms located on small-bird migration routes, at wind farms in open
   areas, in areas with snow-covered ground in winter, or in forested areas
   during spring and summer because detection probabilities decline fastest
   under such conditions.},

Title = {Extinction and replacement events shaped the historical biogeography of
   Arctic mammals in Europe: new models of species response},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The historical biogeography of the terrestrial mammals in Europe has
   been widely studied on the basis of fossil records and molecular makers.
   However, to date, only one model of species' responses to
   glacial-interglacial cycles during the glacial episodes of the
   Quaternary, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum, has been
   proposed: the `expansion-contraction model'. The `expansion-contraction
   model' is more appropriate for thermophilous and temperate species than
   for Arctic species. We hypothesise that the responses of cold-adapted
   species to the temperature fluctuations during glacial cycles cannot be
   explained by this model. In this review, we synthesise and describe, for
   the first time, the historical biogeography of various cold-adapted
   terrestrial mammalian taxa (small mammals, herbivores, and carnivores)
   in Eurasia during the last glaciation (especially during the Last
   Glacial Maximum), and identify mechanisms underlying their response to
   glacier pulsation and severe climate fluctuations. We formulate the
   paradigm for the biogeography of cold-adapted mammalian taxa in Europe,
   and identified three response models to glacial-interglacial cycles: 1)
   `extinction and genetic diminution' for Lasiopodomys gregalis,
   Dicrostonyx spp. and Lemmus lemmus, 2) `extinction and replacement' for
   Alopex lagopus, Gulo gulo and Rangifer tarandus, and 3) `contraction and
   gene transfer' for Lepus timidus and Martes zibellina. Knowledge of past
   biogeography is essential for understanding how cold-adapted taxa are
   responding to anthropogenic climate warming, and for on-going
   biodiversity and habitat conservation in the Anthropocene. There is no
   doubt that cold-adapted, Arctic species are suffering the most from
   global warming.},

Title = {Favourable climatic niche in low elevations outside the flood zone
   characterises the distribution pattern of venomous snakes in Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 22},
Abstract = {Snakes are sensitive to both environmental and climate gradients. To
   design conservation plans, a scientific understanding of snake habitats
   in light of environmental and climatic variables is an essential
   prerequisite. For venomous snakes, denoting favourable habitats should
   also be relevant for snakebite management. We have considered 18 spatial
   variables to portray the range of terrestrial venomous snake
   distribution in Bangladesh. Our results indicate that the distribution
   of 29 studied venomous snakes in this country is primarily driven by
   climatic and environmental variables. We found that especially low
   elevation and flood risk constrain the distribution of those terrestrial
   snakes, i.e. regular floods in central Bangladesh push venomous snakes
   towards the edges of the country. Moreover, none of these species
   occupies the whole of its anticipated climatically favourable area.
   Projections into the future indicated that 11 studied species, Amphiesma
   platyceps, Boiga siamensis, Chrysopelea ornata, Pseudoxenodon macrops,
   Rhabdophis himalayanus, Rhabdophis subminiatus, Bungarus lividus,
   Ophiophagus hannah, Daboia russelii, Ovophis monticola and Trimeresurus
   popeiorum will lose their entire climatically suitable area within the
   country. Therefore, we suggest establishing more protected areas in the
   hilly ecosystems in the eastern part and in the mangrove forests in the
   south-western corner of Bangladesh to mitigate future extinction risks,
   such as climate change, sea-level rise and increase in flood severity.
   Conserving village forests and croplands, which are subject to rapid
   change, will also need to be addressed equally, as these are inhabited
   by almost one-third of the studied species. The occurrence of the cobras
   and kraits in village forests and cropland dominant habitats demands
   more attention to minimise snakebite related mortality and morbidity.},

Title = {Habitat selection and space use overlap between feral horses, pronghorn,
   and greater sage-grouse in cold arid steppe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Populations of feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) in the western United
   States have increased during the past decade, consequently affecting
   co-occurring wildlife habitat. Feral horses may influence 2 native
   wildlife species, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus;
   sage-grouse) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) through mechanisms of
   habitat alteration and competition. Wyoming, USA, contains the largest
   populations of pronghorn and sage-grouse of any state and also has the
   highest degree of range overlap between feral horses and these species.
   Consequently, the effects that horses may have on pronghorn and
   sage-grouse populations in Wyoming have implications at local, state,
   and population-wide levels. Managers need information concerning habitat
   selection and space use overlap among these species to develop
   appropriate management strategies; yet this information is absent for
   most feral horse management areas. To address this knowledge need, we
   attached global positioning system (GPS) transmitters to horses,
   pronghorn, and sage-grouse within the greater Bureau of Land
   Management-Adobe Town Herd Management Area in southern Wyoming and
   northern Colorado, USA, between 2017 and 2021 to evaluate habitat
   selection and space use of all species during 3 biologically relevant
   seasons: spring (Apr-Jun; sage-grouse breeding, nesting, and early-brood
   rearing; pronghorn late gestation and early parturition), summer
   (Jul-Oct; sage-grouse summer and late-brood rearing; pronghorn late
   parturition and breeding), and winter (Nov-Mar; non-breeding season).
   Feral horses selected flatter slopes and shorter mean shrub height
   across all seasons and were closer to water in spring and summer.
   Pronghorn habitat selection was similar to horses, but they also avoided
   oil and gas well pads year-round. During spring, sage-grouse selected
   greater herbaceous cover, flatter slopes, and areas farther from well
   pads. In summer, sage-grouse selected greater mean shrub height, flatter
   slopes, and were closer to water. In winter, sage-grouse selected
   flatter slopes and areas with greater vegetation production during the
   preceding summer. Our results indicate strong year-round overlap in
   space use between horses and pronghorn, whereas overlap between horses
   and sage-grouse is greatest during the summer in this region.
   Consequently, managers should recognize the potential for horses to
   influence habitat quality of pronghorn and sage-grouse in the region.},

Title = {Non-resident college student hunting license regulations in the United
   States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A decades-long decline in hunting participation jeopardizes state
   wildlife agency funding amid growing conservation and management
   challenges. College students are being recognized by states and
   non-governmental organizations as an important population for hunter
   recruitment and retention, fueling a proliferation of learn-to-hunt
   programs on college campuses. Nearly 3,000,000 students attend college
   in a state where they are not a resident and may face constraints to
   hunting. We analyzed hunting license residency statutes in each state to
   determine whether non-resident college students were addressed in
   statutes or policies, catalog statutory provisions that may exclude
   populations of students from hunting, and document how students'
   residency status affects the price of a deer and small game license.
   Nationwide, 29 states have statutes allowing non-resident college
   students to hunt at a resident rate. Among these states, we identified a
   patchwork of statutory requirements for non-resident students to be
   eligible for resident-rate licenses, including waiting periods, age
   restrictions, credit restrictions, and unclear or onerous purchasing
   procedures. Non-resident college students fell into a gray area of
   licensing policy in the 21 states without statutes addressing this
   group. In these states, students often needed to pay non-resident
   hunting license rates. Hunting licenses were substantially more
   expensive for non-resident college students in states without statutes
   addressing students, and license sales data from Montana, USA, indicated
   that high license prices are a constraint for student hunters. With
   college students becoming a focal point for hunter recruitment efforts,
   we identify statutory constraints to recruiting and retaining hunters on
   college campuses and help improve the effectiveness of learn-to-hunt
   programs on college campuses.},

Title = {Survival and fidelity of translocated and resident burrowing owls in
   Arizona},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Given the rapid pace of urbanization, mitigation translocations are
   increasingly being used to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, especially
   to move animals out of the path of land development. Burrowing owls
   (Athene cunicularia) are commonly subjected to translocations because of
   their association with flat, open lands that are attractive to
   development. But outcomes of burrowing owl translocations and the
   effects they have on their demographic parameters are seldom documented.
   From 2017-2019, we tracked the fates of 42 resident (non-translocated)
   burrowing owls and 43 translocated owls using very high frequency
   radio-telemetry across 4 release sites in southcentral Arizona, USA.
   Translocations were conducted by Wild At Heart (WAH), a non-profit
   raptor rehabilitation program, and owls were moved from areas with
   planned development activities to release sites that contained
   artificial burrows. Each year, WAH held translocated owls in groups of
   6-10 owls with varying male to female ratios in aviaries prior to taking
   the owls to release sites where the owls stayed in soft-release tents
   for an acclimation period of 30 days before release. Resident owls were
   located at or near the 4 release sites. We used the joint live encounter
   and dead recovery model to evaluate differences in survival and fidelity
   probabilities between resident (non-translocated) and translocated
   burrowing owls and to assess factors that influenced these probabilities
   including sex, year, site, captivity duration, and the number of males
   in release cohorts for translocated owls. Annual survival was
   consistently lower for translocated owls (0.35, 95\% CI = 0.10, 0.61 and
   0.01, 95\% CI = 0.00, 0.03 for 2017 and 2018, respectively) compared to
   resident owls (0.68, 95\% CI = 0.45, 0.92 and 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.47, 0.90
   for 2017 and 2018, respectively). Annual fidelity was lower for
   translocated owls (0.05, 95\% CI = 0.00, 0.15) compared to resident owls
   (0.79, 95\% CI = 0.57, 1.00) in 2018, but fidelity did not differ
   significantly between translocated (0.54, 95\% CI = 0.19, 0.89) and
   resident owls (0.62, 95\% CI = 0.37, 0.87) in 2017. For translocated
   owls, the number of males in release cohorts negatively affected
   survival (beta <SIC>
   \$\textbackslash{}hat\{\{\textbackslash{}rm\{\textbackslash{}beta
   \}\}\}\$ = -0.74, 95\% CI = -1.07, -0.40) and fidelity (beta <SIC>
   \$\textbackslash{}hat\{\{\textbackslash{}rm\{\textbackslash{}beta
   \}\}\}\$ = -0.73, 95\% CI = -1.17, -0.29). Our results indicate the need
   for substantial changes to the current translocation methodology for
   burrowing owls in Arizona. Breeding season releases that included owl
   groups and multiple males within cohorts resulted in agonistic
   interactions, high mortality, and low fidelity. Translocations of this
   territorial species should be restricted to male-female pairs or single
   individuals. Earlier releases may allow owls time to become established
   on release sites prior to the breeding season, which could promote
   fidelity. We recommend these changes be implemented and evaluated along
   with an examination of other release methods.},

Title = {Regional walrus abundance estimate in the United States Chukchi Sea in
   autumn},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human activities (e.g., shipping, tourism, oil, gas development) have
   increased in the Chukchi Sea because of declining sea ice. The declining
   sea ice itself and these activities may affect Pacific walrus (Odobenus
   rosmarus divergens) abundance; however, previous walrus abundance
   estimates have been notably imprecise. When sea ice is absent from the
   eastern Chukchi Sea, walruses in waters of the United States usually
   rest together onshore at a single Alaska coastal haulout, where they can
   be surveyed more easily than when they rest on dispersed offshore ice
   floes. We estimated the number of walruses on land (herd size) at this
   haulout from 13 unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) surveys flown within a
   10-day period in each of 2018 and 2019. We estimated population size of
   walruses using the haulout over the course of the surveys by combining
   herd size data with data from satellite-linked transmitters that
   indicated whether tagged walruses were in or out of water during each
   survey. Our estimates of the population size of walruses using the
   haulout during each year's survey period were similar to each other and
   more precise than historical walrus abundance estimates: posterior means
   (95\% credibility intervals) were 166,000 (133,000-201,000) for 2018 and
   189,000 (135,000-251,000) for 2019. Auxiliary observations support using
   these estimates to represent the size of the population using the
   eastern Chukchi Sea in autumn during the surveyed years. Our study site
   was the only substantial Chukchi Sea coastal haulout in the United
   States during the survey periods and study-specific tracking data
   (consistent with known distribution and movement patterns) indicated
   tagged walruses remained in eastern Chukchi waters during the survey
   periods. In addition, the imagery, telemetry, and analytical methods

Abstract = {We compared embryogenesis of five species of domesticated even-toed and
   one odd-toed ungulate and used a phylogenetic framework to contextualize
   such comparison. Organ systems that occur relatively earlier in
   embryogenesis generally have more time to develop and therefore are
   found to be more mature at birth when compared to structures that appear
   later in development. We hypothesized that the less mature the animals'
   organs are at birth, the more they are susceptible to artificial
   selection. The horse had the most mature organs at birth, followed by
   cattle, reindeer, sheep/goat, and pig. This pattern of maturity could be
   observed almost during the entire development. Heterochronic shifts
   among species were observed only after fur starts to develop. Changes in
   the fur coloration are one of the first observable signs of
   domestication and the heterochrony of this trait may be related to the
   effects on neural crest-derived pigment cells by artificial selection.
   The six ungulate species also differ in the relative duration of their
   weaning period and the potential extent of its artificial shortening. We
   put all these traits in the context of their inherited evolutionary
   characteristics and artificial domestication process. Related to their
   altriciality, carnivoran domesticates, which also belong to Scrotifera,
   are less mature at birth than all domesticated ungulates. Although we
   detected clear character correlations to life history traits, it is
   impossible based on the present data, to trace specific exaptations to
   the domestication process. We hypothesize a deep time developmental
   penetration of adult characters into embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {For centuries, it has been understood that the final size of adult
   holometabolous insects is determined by the end of the larval stage, and
   that once they transform to adults, holometabolous insects do not grow.
   Despite this, no previous study has directly tested these ``old
   truths{''} across holometabolous insects. Here, we demonstrate that
   final adult size is set at the end of the last larval stage in species
   representing each of the four orders of holometabolous insects: the
   fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera), the tobacco hornworm
   Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera), the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus
   (Coleoptera), and the Florida carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus
   (Hymenoptera). Furthermore, in both D. melanogaster and C. floridanus,
   we show that the size of adult individuals fluctuates but does not
   significantly change. Therefore, our study finally confirms these two
   basic assumptions in the biology of insects, which have for centuries
   served as the foundation for studies of insect growth, size, and
   allometry.},

Title = {Influence of resource selection on nonbreeding season mortality of
   mallards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Relationships between individual resource selection strategies and
   fitness are difficult to quantify at large spatial scales. These links
   are important for understanding the potential effects of management on
   population-level processes. We modeled the degree to which selection of
   specific landscape features altered mortality risk of female mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos) during the non-breeding season. We used individual
   resource selection estimates from adult female mallards equipped with
   Global Positioning System (GPS) backpack transmitters (n = 56) in the
   Lake St. Clair region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, in August of 2014
   and 2015. We determined the fate of individuals between August and
   January and used time-to-event analyses to model survival over 158 days.
   Furthermore, we investigated how diurnal and nocturnal resource
   selection and year were related to mortality risk. The survival rate for
   the adult female mallards was 0.57 (95\% CI = 0.42-0.77). Resource types
   were combinations of land class types (e.g., water, marsh, flooded
   agriculture, supplemental feeding areas, and dry agriculture) important
   to mallards and varying levels of risk from anthropogenic disturbance
   ranging from inviolate refuges to publicly accessed areas where we
   predicted mortality risk to be greatest. Our results suggest that water
   that the public can access (i.e., public water) influenced mortality
   risk during multiple seasons. Specifically, selection of public water by
   female mallards reduced mortality risk diurnally during the non-hunting
   period (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95\% CI = 0.48-0.96) but increased
   mortality risk during the first half of the hunting period (hazard ratio
   = 1.54, 95\% CI = 1.08-2.20). Our research highlights that individual
   selection strategies by ducks within this landscape can influence
   mortality risk.},

Title = {Columbian sharp-tailed grouse brood success and chick survival in a
   wind-energy landscape},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus)
   have experienced range-wide population declines, primarily as a result
   of habitat loss or degradation, and currently occupy <10\% of their
   historical range. Expansion of wind-energy development across the
   current, occupied Columbian sharp-tailed grouse range is a potential
   threat to the subspecies. To assess the potential effects of wind-energy
   development on vital rates of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse offspring,
   we monitored 68 broods of radio-marked females captured at 11 leks in
   restored grasslands within 14 km of a 215-turbine wind-energy
   development complex in eastern Idaho, USA from 2014-2015. We assessed
   the influence of wind turbine density, habitat characteristics,
   brood-rearing female age, hatch date, and weather on brood success and
   chick survival using an information-theoretic model selection approach.
   Wind turbine density did not influence early (14-day) brood success, but
   there was weak evidence for a negative effect of wind turbine density on
   late (42-day) brood success. There was strong evidence that increasing
   turbine density within the late brood-rearing home range negatively
   affected chick survival to 42 days after hatch. The probability of an
   individual chick surviving to 42 days decreased by 50\% when there were
   >= 10 wind turbines within 2,100 m of the nest. Late brood success and
   chick survival increased with earlier hatch dates. There was weak
   evidence for positive effects of post-hatch precipitation on early brood
   success and chick survival and weak evidence that adult females had
   higher early brood success than yearlings. Habitat characteristics such
   as vegetation composition in restored grasslands were poor predictors of
   offspring survival. Multiple variables, including wind-energy
   development, are important to Columbian sharp-tailed grouse brood
   success and chick survival. Wildlife managers should consider the
   potential for negative impacts of wind-energy development on Columbian
   sharp-tailed grouse recruitment when addressing wind-energy siting and
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {In modern vertebrates, the craniofacial skeleton is complex, comprising
   cartilage and bone of the neurocranium, dermatocranium and
   splanchnocranium (and their derivatives), housing a range of sensory
   structures such as eyes, nasal and vestibulo-acoustic capsules, with the
   splanchnocranium including branchial arches, used in respiration and
   feeding. It is well understood that the skeleton derives from neural
   crest and mesoderm, while the sensory elements derive from ectodermal
   thickenings known as placodes. Recent research demonstrates that neural
   crest and placodes have an evolutionary history outside of vertebrates,
   while the vertebrate fossil record allows the sequence of the evolution
   of these various features to be understood. Stem-group vertebrates such
   as Metaspriggina walcotti (Burgess Shale, Middle Cambrian) possess eyes,
   paired nasal capsules and well-developed branchial arches, the latter
   derived from cranial neural crest in extant vertebrates, indicating that
   placodes and neural crest evolved over 500 million years ago. Since that
   time the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton has evolved, including
   different types of bone, of potential neural crest or mesodermal origin.
   One problematic part of the craniofacial skeleton concerns the evolution
   of the nasal organs, with evidence for both paired and unpaired nasal
   sacs being the primitive state for vertebrates.},

Abstract = {The cross-border mobility of malaria cases poses an obstacle to malaria
   elimination programmes in many countries, including Nepal. Here, we
   develop a novel mathematical model to study how the imported malaria
   cases through the Nepal-India open-border affect the Nepal government's
   goal of eliminating malaria by 2026. Mathematical analyses and numerical
   simulations of our model, validated by malaria case data from Nepal,
   indicate that eliminating malaria from Nepal is possible if strategies
   promoting the absence of cross-border mobility, complete protection of
   transmission abroad, or strict border screening and isolation are
   implemented. For each strategy, we establish the conditions for the
   elimination of malaria. We further use our model to identify the control
   strategies that can help maintain a low endemic level. Our results show
   that the ideal control strategies should be designed according to the
   average mosquito biting rates that may depend on the location and
   season.},

   classification},

Pages = {233-244},
Abstract = {The absence of nationally accepted typology to classify and describe
   habitats has been an obstacle to the development of coordinated research
   in this field and to the implementation of conservation actions;
   therefore, a classification of the natural and semi-natural terrestrial
   habitat types existing in Lebanon is presented and adapted to the
   hierarchical structure of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS)
   habitat classification. The harmonisation with an international
   classification system is essential to facilitate communication and
   research throughout the Mediterranean Basin. A total of 1597 sites
   surveyed throughout Lebanon between 2013 and 2020 were classified and
   described based on the analysis of the physiognomic parameters and
   specific composition of their vegetation. The analysis yielded 190
   habitat types for Lebanon, including 12 coastal habitats (category N),
   35 related to inland surface waters (C), 6 wetland habitats (Q), 20
   grasslands (R), 54 scrublands and heaths habitats (S), 27 types of
   woodlands (T), 17 inland unvegetated habitats (U), and 19 vegetated
   man-made habitats (V). Sixty-one habitats characteristic of Lebanon, not
   previously included in the EUNIS classification, were described and
   proposed in this typology. Those habitats include shrublands (23),
   woodlands (18), coastal habitats (6), wetlands (1), grasslands (9),
   sparsely vegetated habitats (2) and man-made vegetation (2).},

Title = {Phylogeny of Membracoidea (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha) based on
   transcriptome data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The suborder Auchenorrhyncha ({''}true hoppers{''}) comprises nearly
   half of known Hemiptera, with >43,000 known species of sap-sucking
   herbivores distributed worldwide, including many important agricultural
   pests and vectors of plant disease. More than half of the known
   Auchenorrhyncha belong to superfamily Membracoidea (leaf- and
   treehoppers), which has been a source of phylogenetic contention for
   many years. To construct an improved backbone phylogeny of this
   superfamily, we obtained transcriptome data for multiple representatives
   of all 5 previously established extant families and nearly all
   subfamilies to test their monophyly and relationships. 138 taxa (132
   Membracoidea and 6 outgroups) were sampled with an emphasis on families
   Cicadellidae and Membracidae, which were paraphyletic as previously
   defined by most authors, several problematic subfamilies (Aphrodinae,
   Eurymelinae, Ledrinae, Nicomiinae, Stegaspidinae and Tartessinae). We
   analysed different combinations of data sets (amino acid, complete
   nucleotide and degeneracy-coded nucleotide) using different modelling
   schemes. The resultant trees based on different analyses are congruent
   in most nodes. Discordant nodes mainly pertain to relationships among
   cicadellid subfamilies and tribal relationships within Aphrodinae and
   Eurymelinae. Analyses of gene- and site concordance factors and quartet
   scores indicate that this instability is largely attributable to an
   overall lack of informative characters across genes and sites rather
   than strongly supported conflict among genes. According to the congruent
   nodes, we make the following revisions: combine Stegaspidinae and
   Centrotinae into a single subfamily, Centrotinae sensu lato; restore
   Stenocotini from Tartessinae to its original position in the Ledrinae;
   and transform Holdgatiella Evans from Nicomiinae to Melizoderinae. In
   addition, to solve the paraphyly of both Cicadellidae and Membracidae, a
   preferred option would be to combine all five previously recognized
   families into a single family, Membracidae sensu lato; the other option
   could be to render Cicadellidae monophyletic by excluding
   Megophthalminae and Ulopinae from Cicadellidae and elevating them to
   status as separate families.},

   EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Since ctenostomes are traditionally regarded as an ancestral clade to
   some other bryozoan groups, the study of additional species may help to
   clarify questions on bryozoan evolution and phylogeny. One of these
   questions is the bryozoan lophophore evolution: whether it occurred
   through simplification or complication. The morphology and innervation
   of the ctenostome Flustrellidra hispida (Fabricius, 1780) lophophore
   have been studied with electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry with
   confocal laser scanning microscopy. Lophophore nervous system of F.
   hispida consists of several main nerve elements: cerebral ganglion,
   circumoral nerve ring, and the outer nerve ring. Serotonin-like
   immunoreactive perikarya, which connect with the circumoral nerve ring,
   bear the cilium that directs to the abfrontal side of the lophophore and
   extends between tentacle bases. The circumoral nerve ring gives rise to
   the intertentacular and frontal tentacle nerves. The outer nerve ring
   gives rise to the abfrontal neurites, which connect to the outer groups
   of perikarya and contribute to the formation of the abfrontal tentacle
   nerve. The outer nerve ring has been described before in other
   bryozoans, but it never contributes to the innervation of tentacles. The
   presence of the outer nerve ring participating in the innervation of
   tentacles makes the F. hispida lophophore nervous system particularly
   similar to the lophophore nervous system of phoronids. This similarity
   allows to suggest that organization of the F. hispida lophophore nervous
   system may reflect the ancestral state for all bryozoans. The possible
   scenario of evolutionary transformation of the lophophore nervous system
   within bryozoans is suggested.},

Title = {Seasonal space use and habitat selection in magpie geese: implications
   for reducing human-wildlife conflicts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Negative interactions between waterbirds and people are increasing.
   Waterbirds feeding on agricultural crops cause significant losses to
   farmers worldwide, but so far most research to address these conflicts
   has been conducted on migratory species in the temperate northern
   hemisphere. We investigated the space use and habitat selection of the
   magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), a taxonomically distinct waterbird
   endemic to Australia and southern Papua New Guinea. In tropical northern
   Australia, magpie geese are protected but are increasingly persecuted by
   farmers to protect crops during the late dry-early wet season (similar
   to Sep-Jan), a bottleneck of natural resources for waterbirds in the
   monsoonal tropics. Using satellite telemetry of 38 geese spread across 3
   seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019), we evaluated daily and
   seasonal space use, individual site fidelity, and habitat selection to
   determine the extent of use of agricultural fields by geese, and the
   spatiotemporal scales at which management should be undertaken. Geese
   used relatively small daily areas ((x) over bar = 8.2 km(2))
   consistently throughout the late dry-early wet season, and repeatedly
   used agricultural fields, forested bushlands, and local wetlands. Geese
   used comparatively large seasonal areas ((x) over bar = 219.5 km(2))
   encompassing several agricultural areas, and had a low mean overlap
   between successive weekly core activity areas, indicating that site
   fidelity rapidly weakened over time. These results suggest that
   farm-scale (<30 ha) management of geese is unlikely to be effective
   because hazed individuals are likely to be replaced soon afterwards.
   Instead, our findings suggest that goose management should be
   coordinated strategically at the local (similar to 1,000 ha), or
   regional (similar to 100,000 ha) scale. Farm-level management would
   likely be more effective if implemented in conjunction with the creation
   of regional sanctuaries where geese could rest and potentially feed
   undisturbed away from farms. Our findings can be used by wildlife
   managers for optimizing the location of such sanctuaries and highlight
   the necessity for management to be adaptive given the opportunistic
   nature of the species.},

Title = {Postbreeding movements and molting ecology of female gadwalls and
   mallards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The wing molt is an important annual life-history event that occurs in
   waterfowl and molt site selection can play an important role in
   determining survival. We tracked postbreeding movements of gadwall
   (Mareca strepera) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) females that bred in
   the Suisun Marsh (Suisun) of California, USA, to determine molt site
   selection and wing molt chronology. We attached backpack transmitters
   with global positioning system and global system for mobile
   communications (GPS-GSM) technology to female gadwalls and mallards
   within Suisun and tracked the birds following the breeding season during
   2015-2018. We determined molt locations for 52 female gadwalls and 112
   female mallards. Thirty of the marked gadwall females selected 2 regions
   within southern Oregon-northeastern California (SONEC) to undergo molt;
   16 molted in the Upper Klamath Basin (southern OR) and 14 in the Lower
   Klamath Basin (northeastern CA). A large portion of female mallards
   molted in Suisun (n = 34) and the Sacramento Valley in California (n =
   31) but also used the Upper Klamath Basin (n = 13), Lower Klamath Basin
   (n = 12), and the Yolo-Delta region in California (n = 12). On average,
   gadwalls departed Suisun on 30 July (+/- 17.82 days {[}SD]), and
   mallards departed on 24 July (+/- 22.69 days). Mean start date of molt
   for each species was similar: 27 August (+/- 16.09 days) for gadwalls
   and 26 August (+/- 21.03 days) for mallards. Molt end date was analogous
   for each species as well. Molt ended on average 1 October (+/- 15.52
   days) for gadwalls and on 5 October (+/- 18.34 days) for mallards.
   Gadwalls and mallards showed intraspecific differences in average molt
   start and end date within the 3 main geographical zones: Suisun, Central
   Valley of California (Central Valley), and SONEC. Mean duration of wing
   molt for gadwalls was 34.72 +/- 8.62 days and 41.09 +/- 12.54 days for
   mallards. Both species primarily selected permanent marsh to undergo
   wing molt (gadwalls = 90.4\%, mallards = 63.4\%). Conservation and
   active management of these high-use molting areas used by California's
   primary breeding waterfowl species could enhance postbreeding survival,
   leading to increased breeding waterfowl populations.},

Title = {Factors influencing pregnancy, litter size, and reproductive parameters
   of invasive wild pigs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Reproduction is the most energetically expensive life stage with the
   demands of productivity representing a balance between physiological
   requirements and environmental conditions. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa)
   throughout most of North America are genetic hybrids of feral domestic
   pigs and wild boar and have the highest reproductive potential of any
   wild ungulate. The phenology of reproduction, extent of multiple
   reproductive events per year, how individual and extrinsic factors
   contribute to variability in productivity, and impact of genetic lineage
   on these parameters is not well understood in wild pigs. We quantified
   reproductive parameters in wild pigs relative to a suite of individual
   and environmental attributes across seasons and multiple years in South
   Carolina, USA, from March 2017 and May 2020. We hypothesized that
   individual attributes (mass, age class, number of teats, rump fat,
   relative genetic association to wild boar vs. domestic pigs) and
   extrinsic factors (mast availability) would influence probability of
   pregnancy and fetal litter size. Wild pigs produced offspring throughout
   all months with peaks in conception corresponding to a seasonal pulse in
   food availability. The likelihood of pregnancy was influenced by female
   mass and nutritional condition and was greatest during years with
   abundant resources. Similarly, litter size increased with female mass
   and age, implying larger and older females represent the most important
   group for population recruitment. In evaluating the relationship between
   reproductive output and ancestral associations to domestic pigs versus
   wild boar, the proportion of wild boar ancestry was not an important
   influence on productivity in our population. We determined juveniles
   reach a physiological threshold of sexual maturity at approximately 30
   kg. Average litter size was comparable to other populations, and wild
   pigs maintain an average fetal litter size of 5.43 offspring despite
   13.6\% embryonic mortality. A thorough understanding of biotic and
   extrinsic factors influencing reproduction are important for realistic
   population models, which are necessary for identifying areas to focus
   management needs and implementation.},

Title = {Noninvasive genetic sampling with a spatial capture-recapture analysis
   to estimate abundance of Roosevelt elk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Precise abundance estimates of large mammals are important for effective
   conservation, harvest, and conflict management. Determining abundance of
   wide-ranging, herding ungulate species has presented a unique challenge
   to wildlife managers because of factors such as dense forest, elusive
   behavior, and heterogeneity in density across the landscape. Roosevelt
   elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) populations in Northern California,
   USA, are no exception to these challenges, and as the elk population has
   grown, so has human-wildlife conflict, necessitating the need for
   efficient and repeatable methods to determine population abundance for
   management decisions. We explored non-invasive genetic sampling combined
   with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) as an alternative for monitoring
   populations that are difficult to observe directly. We combined an SCR
   model with a binomial point process and an unstructured single survey
   search method to estimate elk abundance in Northern California via
   Bayesian inference. We searched open grassy hillsides for female-calf
   groups and used a detection dog team to search forested areas to
   increase the number of detections of males and other solitary
   individuals. For the SCR analysis, we used sex and survey effort as
   detection covariates, and used a trap-level random effect to account for
   overdispersion in the count data from the herding behavior of elk. Our
   population estimate (N +/- SD) for the study area was 618 +/- 36.34
   individuals (95\% Bayesian credible interval = 551-693) with a mean
   density of 1.09 +/- 0.06 elk/km(2). Our work demonstrates a potential
   method to estimate population size of ungulates in an area that is not
   conducive to traditional monitoring methods.},

Title = {Demographic response of brown treesnakes to extended population
   suppression},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {From a management perspective, reptiles are relatively novel invasive
   taxa. Few methods for reptile control have been developed and very
   little is known about their effectiveness for reducing reptile
   populations, particularly when the goal is eradication. Many reptiles,
   and especially snakes, are cryptic, secretive, and undergo extended
   periods of inactivity, traits that decrease detection probabilities and
   create challenges in estimating population size or evaluating management
   effects. The brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is a notorious invasive
   species that continues to cause major ecological and economic harm
   following their introduction to the island of Guam after World War II.
   They have been the subject of intensive research on the effectiveness of
   various techniques to control snakes, including the first ever aerial
   system for the distribution of toxic acetaminophen baits for reptile
   control. We provide a cohort-based life table for a cryptic and invasive
   reptile undergoing extended population control using toxic baits from
   March 2017-2020. We also evaluated the effects of single (toxic bait)
   versus multi-tool (toxic bait and live trapping) management efforts on
   population trajectories, and estimated which population vital rates are
   most important for influencing population growth or decline in a treated
   landscape. Treatment of the population with acetaminophen-laced baits
   resulted in an immediate reduction followed by a gradual population
   decline that suggested that eradication was the probable outcome given
   sufficient treatment time but that the period of treatment was decades
   in magnitude. Inclusion of live trapping reduced the predicted time
   required to achieve eradication by more than half. Preventing the
   transition of 1,000-mm snout-vent length (SVL) females to larger sizes
   was predicted to have the greatest effect on population reduction based
   on integral projection modeling. Our results suggest that toxic baits
   are capable of eradicating brown treesnakes in an enclosure, although
   inclusion of trapping reduced overall treatment time required. Tools
   that effectively target females >1,000 mm SVL may have the greatest
   effect on reducing overall treatment timelines.},

Abstract = {Microbes are the main drivers of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and
   other elements in marine sediments. The distribution of microorganisms,
   particularly at the centimeter scale, demonstrates the critical role of
   the local biogeochemical environment. The Atlantic Ocean has enormous
   hydrocarbon reserves, yet microbial diversity in hydrocarbon reservoir
   areas, a unique habitat for microorganisms, remains poorly studied. We
   investigated microbial diversity of sediments from the Gulf of Guinea
   and the Namibia Slope, 2 oil and gas reservoir areas of the eastern
   Atlantic Ocean. Microbial diversity was paired with geochemical analyses
   and provided valuable information in understanding and interpreting the
   bacterial and archaeal community structure. Environmental factors,
   especially dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and SO42-, drove the
   microbial community structure in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Methane
   oxidation may be coupled with the reduction of sulfate on the
   continental slope of the Gulf of Guinea, or with nitrate reduction on
   the Namibia Slope. The sediments there provide a suitable habitat for
   microbes. However, the composition of microbial communities varied among
   sites. The microbial diversity and richness in the Gulf of Guinea was
   high, which may correspond to the high concentration of metal ions. The
   metabolism of Gammaproteobacteria may respond to the concentration of
   SO42- and DIC. Asgardarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota could play an
   important role in carbon reactions, and the abundance and metabolism of
   Lokiarchaeota may be related to the concentration of metal ions. These
   findings revealed the microbial diversity and represented a baseline of
   the microbial communities and constriction in this critical area.},

Abstract = {Among the germination affecting factors, germination ecology (GME) and
   seed cleaning stage (SCS) are not well investigated. Hence, this study
   was initiated to evaluate the GME and SCS effect on the seed germination
   performance of two indigenous bamboo species. Pure and impure seed
   samples were taken from the cold room which is adjusted to 5 ??C. Then
   they were sown on prepared media under different conditions. Then the
   GP, MGT, and PV data were computed and then subjected to ANOVA. The
   ANOVA showed that the interaction effect of genotype, GME treatments,
   and SCS was very high (P ??? 0.0001) significant for all studied
   parameters. The germination pattern differences were also observed in
   SCS and GME treatments for both species. Signifi-cantly higher GP (59\%)
   and PV (8.4) were recorded in pure seeds sowed on paper at ambient
   temperature (T1) for O. abyssinica. On the same GME, Y. alpina gave the
   maximum GP (38\%) and PV (2.3) using pure seed. However, significantly
   higher MGT (9) was recorded on GME T1 and T2 using impure seed. Hence,
   pure seed sowed on paper at ambient temperature is advisable for in
   vitro germination test. However, GME having sand media at optimum
   temperature is recommended due to cost-effectiveness and is applicable
   at the community level for seedling production.},

Title = {Diversification in Caucasian Epeorus (Caucasiron) mayflies

Abstract = {The evolution and distribution of mountain biota are closely linked with
   mountain formation and topographic complexity. Here we explore the
   diversification of cold-tolerant mayflies of the subgenus Epeorus
   (Caucasiron) in the south-eastern Greater Caucasus, an area of dynamic
   changes in topography since the Miocene, driven by the convergence of
   the Greater and Lesser Caucasus. We hypothesized that orogenic processes
   promoted the diversification of E. (Caucasiron) and that the resultant
   diversification pattern followed the timing and progress of mountain
   formation along the range. A new evolutionary lineage of E. (Caucasiron)
   distributed in the central-eastern Greater Caucasus was found and
   described as Epeorus (Caucasiron) tripertitus sp.n. It consists of three
   clades clearly differentiated based on mitochondrial sequence data, but
   indistinguishable by morphological traits. Based on a time-calibrated
   phylogeny using mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (EF, wg, 28S)
   markers, we found that a gradual allopatric diversification of the
   ancestral population of E. (C.) tripertitus sp.n. dated to a period
   lasting from the late Miocene to the Pleistocene spread eastward along
   the range. This pattern corresponded with the process of topographic
   deformation which started in the central part of the range in the
   Miocene and progressed to the east during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. The
   results implied the dominant role of mountain building on the biotic
   diversification of this region and continuing recent speciation in the
   south-eastern part of the mountains.},

Abstract = {The structure of ecological communities is thought to be mainly driven
   by competition processes between species. One special case of resource
   shaping community dynamics is the acoustic space. However, the acoustic
   communities have been rarely described for tropical birds. Here, we
   aimed at estimating acoustic competition between the iconic species
   Pharomachrus mocinno and the other bird species occupying the same
   habitat. An acoustic survey was conducted in a cloud forest in Guatemala
   for 17 days in six simultaneous recording sites. All species occurring
   in the same frequency bandwidth were identified, and the acoustic
   overlapping between P. mocinno and these species was estimated. Eighteen
   species were identified as acoustic competitors. Ecological traits and
   phylogenetic distance were defined for all species. The rate of acoustic
   competition between P. mocinno and other species was related to
   different ecological traits and competition for resources. The acoustic
   overlap was high with species competing for similar food resources and
   phylogenetically close species and low with predator species and
   phylogenetically distant species. These unique observations provide new
   behavioural and ecological information that might be useful for the
   knowledge of this species and the cloud forest.},

Abstract = {I observed mobbing of Glaucomys volans (Southern Flying Squirrel), upon

   surveys for the squirrels in southeast Ohio. I observed instances of
   mobbing by 1-3 species of primary and/or secondary cavity-nesting
   songbirds and woodpeckers. Mobbing behavior included flights within 1-2
   m of a flying squirrel briefly positioned on a tree trunk as well as
   vocalizations. Mobbing episodes lasted 5-180 seconds, which largely
   depended on the amount of time a flying squirrel remained visible before
   retreating into a natural cavity. In light of the mobbing response
   reported here, perhaps more consideration should be given to the
   potential impacts that Southern Flying Squirrels may have on bird
   communities.},

Abstract = {In June 2020, we monitored a nest in Southampton, MA, that contained 2
   Dumetella carolinensis (Gray Catbird) and 3 Turdus migratorius (American
   Robin) eggs. Females of both species alternately incubated the mixed
   clutch, and 2 catbird and 2 robin young successfully hatched and fledged
   from the nest. Adults of both species provided both intra- and
   interspecific parental care (e.g., nestling provisioning, brooding, and
   nest sanitation). The catbirds, in particular, often did not
   preferentially provision their own young. In fact, following earlier
   fledging of the catbird young, an adult catbird continued to visit the
   nest to care for the robin nestlings, including fecal sac removal on at
   least 2 occasions. After the 2 robin young fledged, we did not observe
   any crossover post-fledging care. Our study represents the most detailed
   and protracted account among the very few documented cases of nest
   sharing between these species.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mass capture of flightless geese during the summer is a common trapping
   technique to obtain large numbers of individuals for research and
   marking, but few studies have assessed the impacts of this method on the
   survival of after-hatch-year geese. We evaluated the effects of holding
   time and captured flock size on the survival of >26,000 subadult (second
   yr) and adult (>= third yr) greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons
   frontalis) banded in Alaska, USA, 1999-2017. We constructed models with
   and without capture effects to analyze our band-recovery data and used
   Akaike's Information Criterion to rank our model set. Models that
   included both capture-related variables ranked highest. Longer
   individual holding times negatively affected survival during the first
   year after banding, and effects were greatest during the earliest years
   of our study when holding times were generally longer and protocols to
   minimize negative capture effects were less refined. There was a
   positive relationship between survival and captured flock size. We
   suggest practitioners reduce holding times of geese during mass captures
   to the extent practicable and continually evaluate and refine their
   methods to minimize negative capture effects.},

Title = {Modeling habitat use and potential distribution of kit fox in the
   Trans-Pecos, Texas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Management of a species requires knowledge of their distribution and the
   environmental factors that influence their use of an area. The kit fox
   (Vulpes macrotis) is a small fox species endemic to the threatened
   desert grasslands of the western United States and northern Mexico.
   Little information exists on the status and distribution of kit fox in
   Texas, USA; however, researchers have documented population declines in
   the closely related swift fox (Vuples velox) in the Texas Panhandle.
   Therefore, our objectives were to survey areas of potential kit fox
   habitat using remote trail cameras to determine use and detection rates
   for kit fox, evaluate and quantify environmental effects on habitat use,
   and map potential distribution of kit fox habitat throughout the
   Trans-Pecos using results from the preceding occupancy analysis. We
   conducted camera surveys at 732 baited sites from March 2018 to March
   2020, with each survey lasting 14 days on average (similar to 10,248
   camera-days). We detected kit fox at 99 of 732 camera survey sites. We
   divided surveys into 3-day sampling occasions and fit single-season
   occupancy models to test for an effect of sampling occasion and season
   on detection and for effects of slope, elevation, shrub height, shrub
   canopy cover, percent litter, percent herbaceous cover, and bare ground
   on habitat use. Overall detection was 0.31 +/- 0.001 (SE) and was
   influenced by sampling occasion and season, with detection being highest
   during November to February and earlier in the survey. Mean probability
   of use for sites was 0.17 +/- 0.01 (range = 0.00-0.85) and was
   influenced by 4 environmental covariates, with the greatest probability
   of use in areas with gentler slopes, lower elevations, shorter shrubs,
   and a greater percentage bare ground. We used the most supported model
   to make a map of predicted habitat use across the Trans-Pecos region and
   showed evidence of model fit. Our work provides detailed baseline
   information on the distribution and environmental relationships of kit
   fox in the region and can be used to assist with future research and
   monitoring efforts.},

Abstract = {Nest predators use visual, acoustic and chemical cues to locate nests.
   In the Neotropics, predation is high being the main cause of nest
   failure. Despite that, it is still not completely clear what kind of
   information predators are using to find nests or whether predators
   respond differently according to habitat characteristics. Here, we
   executed an experimental manipulation to investigate how different
   ecological factors influence nest predation probability. We hypothesised
   that egg conspicuousness, nest clustering and a more open vegetation
   structure would increase nest predation probability, and that nest
   predation would be higher during the breeding season of most avian
   species in the region. We used artificial nests baited with plasticine
   and quail eggs (Coturnix coturnix), manipulated egg coloration and nest
   density. Artificial nests were distributed over forest and savanna-like
   vegetations. Overall predation rate was 40.9\%. We found that nests
   baited with conspicuous eggs, located in open habitats, at higher
   densities and during the dry period were more predated. Results suggest
   that main predators must be visually orientated, and that egg crypsis is
   an important trait for open-nest species in the area. Moreover, a higher
   nest density may affect predator behaviour, favouring an increase in
   nest searching, which may be facilitated in open habitats.},

Title = {Evaluation of the mycobiome of ballast water and implications for fungal
   pathogen distribution},

Abstract = {Marine transport has the potential to alter the geographic range of
   microorganisms through ballast water movement. Recent
   culture-independent studies investigated the bacteriome of ballast
   water, but no prior studies have examined the mycobiome. Here were
   examined 60 ballast and harbor samples from 4 major ports and 5 ocean
   samples using culture-independent techniques to determine (1) the
   composition of harbor and ballast water mycobiomes; (2) if ballast
   contained human and environmentally relevant fungal pathogens; and (3)
   the potential risk of introduction to coastal ecosystems. Results
   indicate that ballast water and harbor water contain a diverse mycobiome
   and that ballast water may contain fungal taxa that are relevant human
   and marine fish pathogens. Fungal genera were identified that contain
   known coral and coastal plant pathogen species; however, species-level
   identification of these potential pathogens could not be conclusively
   resolved. Ballast and harbor mycobiomes contained similar taxa,
   suggesting that environmental filtering may not inhibit the spread of
   fungal taxa between these ecosystems. This study highlights the
   potential risks of ballast movement and suggests further research of the
   ballast mycobiome is needed.},

Title = {Phenology-specific space use by Rio Grande wild turkeys},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Conservation of wildlife populations necessitates identifying patterns
   in space use because fitness requirements influence resource selection;
   however, details on how phenology affects space use are often only
   cursorily addressed during development of space- and resource-use
   estimates. Moreover, space-use assessments often aggregate distinct,
   phenology-specific behaviors into generalized realizations of biological
   processes, such as reproduction. Therefore, to improve the relevance and
   accuracy of biological inferences for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
   space use at the population level, we defined 12 distinct
   phenology-specific periods to compare and contrast variations in
   space-use estimates. We calculated 1,568 individual space-use estimates
   using dynamic Brownian Bridge movement models for Rio Grande wild
   turkeys (M. g. intermedia; n = 255 females) across Texas, USA, during
   2012-2018. Females in each pre-laying state used larger areas than
   during all other phenological states, suggestive of exploratory
   movements related to reproductive activities and resource acquisition.
   Incubation core areas were consistently <1.5 ha and incubation range
   sizes ranged from 10 ha to 48 ha. Core area and range sizes during the
   brooding period doubled from 15 days after hatch (3.1 ha and 42 ha) to
   30 days after hatch (6.5 ha and 89 ha). Post-breeding and wintering
   period ranges were >30\% smaller than reproductive period ranges. Mean
   daily distance traveled was similar across phenological states except
   during incubation and brooding periods. Our results indicate that
   examining wild turkey space use at identifiable, phenology-specific
   temporal scales will help mitigate against biases in estimates of
   resource selection based on arbitrary phenology definitions that
   aggregate data across multiple, distinct, phenological states.},

Title = {Mammal use of riparian corridors in semi-arid Sonora, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildlife populations in semi-arid regions are increasingly challenged by
   human activities and dependent on the connectivity of riparian corridors
   for access to surface water. The Madrean Archipelago is a biodiversity
   hotspot along the arid United States-Mexico borderlands that support
   both Neotropical and Nearctic wildlife. Infrastructure development
   (e.g., the border wall and the expansion of Mexican Federal Highway 2)
   in this region inhibits wildlife movement along the transnational
   mountain archipelago by disconnecting habitat. To explore the
   relationship between habitat variables and mammal use of riparian
   corridors in northern Sonora, Mexico, we collected data from 19
   motion-sensitive cameras between October 2018 and April 2019 and used
   single-season occupancy models and Royle-Nichols abundance estimation
   models to analyze our data. We recorded 21 species of mammals, including
   the first sighting of jaguar (Panthera onca) in this region in 25 years.
   River characteristics (distance from river, riparian corridor width,
   water availability), remoteness (distance from highway, productivity,
   elevation), and topographic variety (vertical elevation difference)
   influenced patterns of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of
   mammals >1 kg, but the strength and direction of these relationships
   varied by species. Additionally, intermittently wet desert washes were
   comparable in species richness to the perennial system. These results
   highlight the importance of examining physical and biological aspects of
   habitat. This is especially true when identifying corridors where
   mitigation structures should be placed to improve wildlife connectivity
   in biodiversity hotspots like the Madrean Archipelago and semi-arid
   ecosystems worldwide.},

Abstract = {In this study, a model for the spread of cyst echinococcosis with
   interventions is formulated. The disease-free and endemic equilibrium
   points of the model are calculated. The control reproduction number R-c
   for the model is derived, and the global dynamics are established by the
   values of R-c. The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically
   stable if and only if R-c < 1. For R-c > 1, using Volterra-Lyapunov
   stable matrices, it is proven that the endemic equilibrium is globally
   asymptotically stable. Sensitivity analysis to identify the most
   influential parameters in the dynamics of CE is carried out. To
   establish the long-term behaviour of the disease, numerical simulations
   are performed. The impact of control strategies is investigated. It is
   shown that, whenever vaccination of sheep is carried out solely or in
   combination with cleaning or disinfecting of the environment, cyst
   echinococcosis can be wiped out.},

Abstract = {We fit an SARS-CoV-2 model to US data of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We
   conclude that the model is not structurally identifiable. We make the
   model identifiable by prefixing some of the parameters from external
   information. Practical identifiability of the model through Monte Carlo
   simulations reveals that two of the parameters may not be practically
   identifiable. With thus identified parameters, we set up an optimal
   control problem with social distancing and isolation as control
   variables. We investigate two scenarios: the controls are applied for
   the entire duration and the controls are applied only for the period of
   time. Our results show that if the controls are applied early in the
   epidemic, the reduction in the infected classes is at least an order of
   magnitude higher compared to when controls are applied with 2-week
   delay. Further, removing the controls before the pandemic ends leads to
   rebound of the infected classes.},

Title = {Density surface and excursion sets modeling as an approach to estimating
   population densities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Effective species management and conservation require knowledge of
   species distribution and status. We used point-transect distance
   sampling surveys of the endangered palila (Loxioides bailleui), a
   honeycreeper currently found only on the Island of Hawai'i, USA, to
   generate robust estimates of total abundance and simultaneously model
   the distribution, abundance, and spatial correlation of the species as a
   density surface model (DSM). Point-transect distance sampling is a
   widely applied method to estimate bird densities accounting for
   imperfect detection probability. For the DSM we used a generalized
   additive model framework and soap film smoothers to control the effects
   of boundary features. This modeling approach allowed us to account for
   imperfect detection and propagate detection probability uncertainty. We
   compared the uncertainty in palila abundance estimates using standard
   point-transect distance sampling to estimates from the DSM. The DSM,
   accounting for both distance-sampling-derived detection probability
   variance and the generalized additive model density estimate variance,
   did not improve population estimator precision; however, it provided
   insight into the species' distribution, density, and uncertainty. We
   also applied excursion sets analysis to objectively identify areas where
   the species occurs in high densities. The 2017 global population of
   <2,000 individuals was limited to an excursion area of 1,500 ha. Our
   findings can help management and regulatory agencies by simultaneously
   mapping a species' distribution and density, improving survey protocols,
   and providing information important to species conservation.},

Title = {Habitat management to reduce competitive interactions: case study of
   native and invading cottontails},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Habitat management recommendations are often based on best available
   science determined through retroductive and inductive hypotheses. Such
   recommendations are not frequently tested, potentially resulting in the
   implementation of unreliable practices for management of imperiled
   species. The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) is an
   imperiled shrubland-obligate species whose recovery efforts include
   habitat management and restoration. Researchers suggest former best
   management practices for the species may result in ecological traps and
   new recommendations have been developed. We evaluated these newly
   revised best management practices designed to retain higher tree canopy
   closure to promote New England cottontails without encouraging eastern
   cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus). We compared New England and eastern
   cottontail density between management plots (tree canopy thinned with
   all downed trees left on the ground, with or without invasive shrub
   treatment) and control plots (unmanaged) and examined the influence of
   management on resource selection and survival. Management strategies
   retaining higher canopy closure promoted stronger selection by New
   England cottontails than by eastern cottontails. Catch per unit effort
   of New England cottontails was greater than for eastern cottontails in
   management plots (P = 0.002). For both species, the proportion of the
   95\% home range overlapping managed areas was greater than the
   proportion of managed area in the habitat patch; however, for the 50\%
   core area of the home range, this was only true for New England
   cottontails. When post-treatment canopy cover was >75\%, New England
   cottontails selected canopy-thinning treatments without invasive shrub
   removal over unmanaged areas, but selection by eastern cottontails was
   unaffected by management treatment or canopy cover. Survival probability
   of both species was high and uncorrelated with time spent in management
   areas. Survival probability decreased as the average distance a rabbit
   moved in a 7-day period increased. Our results illustrate the need to
   revise management strategies that emphasize eliminating canopy cover
   when improving New England cottontail habitat is an objective,
   particularly where they are sympatric with eastern cottontails.},

Title = {Density, harvest rates, and growth of a reintroduced American black bear
   population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Less than 30\% of all species reintroductions have been successful and
   it is important that factors associated with success or failure be
   identified. Officials experimentally translocated 14 adult female
   American black bears (Ursus americanus) from Great Smoky Mountains
   National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee, USA, to Big South Fork
   National River and Recreation Area in the Cumberland Plateau of Kentucky
   and Tennessee, USA, in 1996-1997. Since that time, the reintroduced bear
   population has continued to expand in size and range so our study
   objective was to use spatially explicit capture-recapture methods across
   a wide spatial extent to estimate bear population abundance and growth.
   We constructed 440 (223 in KY, 217 in TN) hair traps in our primary
   sampling area in 2019 arranged in clusters of 4-9 traps/cluster, which
   we augmented with data from 138 hair traps in a secondary sampling area
   in Tennessee collected in 2018. We extracted and genotyped DNA from hair
   samples to construct spatially explicit capture histories, using spatial
   covariates to model inhomogeneous densities. Population abundance
   estimates across our 36,035-km(2) study area were 411 males and 406
   females excluding cubs. Based on an initial standing population of 18
   adult and subadult bears, the mean annual growth rate (lambda) from 1998
   to 2019 was 1.199. The mean annual harvest rate in Kentucky from 2013 to
   2019 was 5.1\% and in Tennessee from 2014 to 2019 was 13.2\%. Based on
   simulations, the hunting seasons reduced mean lambda from 1.217 to
   1.199, but growth was rapid despite harvest. Genetic diversity was
   retained, with similar expected heterozygosity as in the source
   population. The lack of conspecifics, highly productive habitat, and an
   initial age and sex distribution that was skewed toward the most fecund
   members of the population likely contributed to the rapid growth and
   high levels of gene retention in this bear population.},

Title = {Bacteria associated with leaf-cutter ants drive natural antibiotic
   resistance in soil bacteria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 18},
Abstract = {Actinobacteria that live mutualistically with leaf-cutter ants secrete
   antibiotics that may induce antibiotic resistance in nearby soil
   bacteria. We tested for the first time whether soil bacteria near and
   inside Atta cephalotes nests in Costa Rica show higher levels of
   antibiotic resistance than bacteria collected farther away. We collected
   soil samples 0 m to 50 m away from ant nests and grew bacteria from them
   on agar with paper discs treated with antibiotics of common veterinary
   use. As a proxy for antibiotic resistance, we measured the distance from
   the edge of each disc to the closest bacterial colonies. In general,
   resistance to oxytetracycline increased with proximity to leaf-cutter
   ant nests. Antibiotic resistance to oxytetracycline was also higher in
   samples collected inside the nest than in samples from the nest mound;
   not all antibiotics demonstrated the same trend. A preliminary
   exploratory morphological analysis suggests bacterial communities
   between 0 m and 50 m from ant nests were similar in diversity and
   abundance, indicating the pattern of antibiotic resistance described
   above may not be caused by differences in community composition. We
   conclude that actinobacteria living mutualistically with A. cephalotes
   drive natural antibiotic resistance to tetracycline in proximal
   bacterial communities.},

Title = {Scaling of indirect defences in Central American swollen-thorn acacias},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 13},
Abstract = {Myrmecophytes may adjust the investment on ant rewards, depending on
   tree size and ant defence level. In swollen-thorn acacias (Vachellia
   collinsii), we tested whether the level of protection provided by the
   resident ants (defending vs. non-defending) influenced the relation
   between tree size and ant rewards, or between types of ant rewards
   (housing and food). We quantified ant rewards in trees occupied by
   defending and by non-defending ants. We predicted: (1) a positive
   relation between plant diameter and ant reward investment, with a
   steeper slope for defending than for non-defending ant species; and (2)
   that if there is any tradeoff between ant rewards, it should be
   aggravated (steeper slope) when inhabited by non-defending ants. We
   found that most structures for ants grew according to plant diameter,
   but contrary to our first prediction it was independent of the level of
   ant defence. Most ant rewards did not show a tradeoff between them,
   besides a weak negative relation between spine length and number of
   pinnules, which contrary to the prediction occurred when occupied by
   defending ants. The evidence shows that the interacting ants had a
   weaker influence on the scaling of defence structures in myrmecophytes
   than the habitat (location).},

   relationships and future perspectives},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-298},
Abstract = {Aims: We aimed to detect the environmental drivers conditioning plant
   diversity and to predict how modifications in habitat conditions and
   ongoing global warming could lead to vegetation changes or biodiversity
   losses in a region especially rich in peatlands despite its relatively
   low latitude. Study area: The study area was located in the Northern
   Apennines, Northern Italy (about 44 degrees 45' N; 10 degrees 20' E).
   The vegetation study was carried out at 12 peatland sites where 206
   plots were set up. Species composition in the 206 plots were recorded in
   the field and classified with cluster analysis. Data on hydrology, water
   chemistry and peat chemistry were collected at a subset of 127 plots and
   statistically analysed by a multivariate ordination method. Species
   richness and evenness were calculated for all plots. Relationships
   between species composition and environmental variables were analysed by
   stepwise multiple regression. Results: The cluster analysis defined 17
   vegetation units. Water table depth represented the major environmental
   factors accounting for vegetation patterns, with the vegetation units
   being grouped in four main blocks based on vegetation physiognomy and
   species composition: Sphagnum hummocks, Sphagnum lawns, fens and pools.
   Water chemistry and peat chemistry both presented moderate variations
   among the vegetation units with mean water pH ranging from 4.9 to 6.3.
   Concentrations of major cations in the pore water showed that all of the
   habitats investigated were influenced by telluric water, with no
   evidence of ombrotrophic conditions. Species richness and evenness both
   presented poor relations with the environment while responses of
   individual species to environmental factors were more informative on
   vegetation changes triggered by climate change. Conclusions: Prolonged
   drought events associated with high temperature in summer months are
   expected to exert a strong impact on peatland vegetation. The main
   effect of climate change on the vegetation of the peatlands investigated
   consists in the spreading of vascular plants at the expense of Sphagnum
   mosses.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we are concerned with an epidemic model with quarantine
   and distributed time delay. We define the basic reproduction number R-0
   and show that if R-0 <= 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally
   asymptotically stable, whereas if R-0 > 1, then it is unstable and there
   exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We obtain sufficient conditions for
   a Hopf bifurcation that induces a nontrivial periodic solution which
   represents recurrent epidemic waves. By numerical simulations, we
   illustrate stability and instability parameter regions. Our results
   suggest that the quarantine and time delay play important roles in the
   occurrence of recurrent epidemic waves.},

   analyses assumed identical waning rates from R to W and from W to S.
   This implicitly assumes equal length for the period of full immunity and
   of waned immunity. We relax this restriction, and allow an asymmetric
   partitioning of the total immune period. Stability switches of the
   endemic equilibrium are investigated with a combination of analytic and
   numerical tools. Then, continuation methods are applied to track
   bifurcations along the equilibrium branch. We find rich dynamics: Hopf
   bifurcations, endemic double bubbles, and regions of bistability. Our
   results highlight that the length of the period in which waning immunity
   can be boosted is a crucial parameter significantly influencing long
   term epidemiological dynamics.},

Title = {Urban coyotes select cryptic den sites near human development where
   conflict rates increase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The establishment of coyote (Canis latrans) populations in urban areas
   across North America has been accompanied by increased rates of
   human-coyote conflict. One factor thought to promote physical conflict
   between coyotes and people or pets is the presence of coyote pups near
   natal dens; however, this idea has not been tested, and no multivariate
   study of den selection within cities has occurred. Our objectives were
   to conduct a multivariate analysis of third- (i.e., home range) and
   fourth-order (i.e., den sites) habitat selection at dens and determine
   whether proximity to dens is associated with reports of physical
   conflict with coyotes. We found 120 dens by following coyote trails
   using snow tracking within urban green spaces that comprise presumed
   high-quality habitat for coyotes in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We used
   resource selection functions to assess habitat selection for dens,
   testing variables related to land cover and anthropogenic features at
   the third order, and testing microsite habitat features via paired sites
   at the fourth order. We defined conflict encounters from comments in a
   community reporting database and used general linear models to assess
   their spatial proximity to the nearest den and prevalence during the
   pup-rearing period compared to the rest of the year. Habitat selection
   was strongest at the fourth order, wherein coyotes selected for abundant
   hiding cover, steep slopes, and eastern exposure. The prevalence of
   physical conflict with coyotes increased during the pup-rearing period.
   Conflict also increased near known dens as an overall effect and when
   reports occurred outside of naturalized urban areas. These results
   suggest that coyotes in Edmonton den in green spaces near human
   development in microsites that minimize detection by people via steep
   slopes and dense vegetation. We suggest urban wildlife managers increase
   public safety education about recognition of coyote denning habitat and
   coyote defensive behaviors, especially outside of naturalized urban
   areas, because of the observed increase in physical conflict near dens.},

Title = {Columbian sharp-tailed grouse female and nest survival in northwestern
   Colorado},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildlife management and conservation can be challenging when the
   demography of a focal species is unknown or limited given that fecundity
   and adult survival influence population growth. The Columbian
   sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) have been
   reduced to <= 10\% of their former range since the early 1900s. We
   conducted a 3-year study (2015-2017) across 4 study sites in
   northwestern Colorado, USA, to evaluate female hazard and nest survival.
   We trapped and marked 270 female sharp-tailed grouse and identified 275
   nests for our hazard and survival analyses. Females during the breeding
   stage of the reproductive season experienced more hazard compared to the
   nesting and the early and late post-nesting stages for females without
   broods. Females experienced a higher degree of hazard during the
   breeding stage and mortality risk was >3 times higher than the nesting
   stage, >7 times higher than early post-nesting (EPN)-no brood stage, and
   >5 times higher than the late post-nesting (LPN)-unsuccessful stage. Two
   reproductive season stages (LPN-successful and EPN-brood) provided
   marginal inference. Nest incubation initiation date and nest age best
   described nest daily survival. Females that initiated incubation of
   initial nests earlier in the season experienced lower nest daily
   survival than later in the incubation season. Because female Columbian
   sharp-tailed grouse hazard varied among different reproductive season
   stages, we recommend that wildlife managers develop management actions
   that reduce hazard during the specific reproductive season stages (i.e.,
   the breeding season). For Columbian sharp-tailed grouse in Colorado, we
   recommend that Colorado Parks and Wildlife collaborate with federal farm
   program agencies to implement a no-tillage restriction from 1 May
   through 30 June for active agricultural fields within 2 km of active
   Columbian sharp-tailed grouse leks to enhance nest survival.},

Title = {Local differences in maximum temperature determine water use among
   desert bighorn sheep populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The availability of surface water is assumed by many wildlife managers
   to be important to desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Yet
   scientific evidence suggests bighorn sheep populations can sometimes
   fulfill their water requirements from forage alone. To investigate how
   water use changes with environmental conditions, we analyzed the surface
   water use and movement patterns of 4 desert bighorn populations across a
   range of meteorological conditions in the Mojave Desert in California,
   USA. We compared ground-based weather data to the daily use of surface
   water sources for 65 known individuals, and examined the movement
   patterns of 18 of these individuals with global positioning system
   collars in relation to visitation to surface water sources. Maximum
   daily temperature most closely predicted the percent of bighorn visiting
   water daily, with visitation increasing approximately 30\% between 30
   degrees C and 40 degrees C. Individual animals switched from a tortuous
   foraging movement to directed movement when accessing surface water. Day
   length, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, solar
   radiation, and the interaction between day length and minimum
   temperature explained the distance desert bighorn were located from the
   nearest water source. Our results indicate that local meteorological
   conditions are important determinants of desert bighorn surface water
   use, and that managers should monitor water sources when the maximum
   daily temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Individual animals meet their
   water requirements with surface water under hot and dry conditions,
   likely because it is temporally or energetically efficient given their
   other resource needs.},

Title = {Developing an adaptive management approach to cowbird control on the
   Santa Clara River, California},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) has caused
   population declines for conservation-reliant songbird species such as
   the federally and state endangered subspecies least Bell's vireo (Vireo
   bellii pusillus). Although cowbird trapping has increased vireo
   populations, it is costly, and may prevent the development of
   parasitism-avoidance behaviors and result in high rates of non-target
   species captures. Therefore, wildlife managers have a compelling
   interest in evaluating multiple means of cowbird control. We conducted a
   study between 2016 and 2018 on the Santa Clara River (SCR) in Ventura
   County, California, USA, to test how the removal of cowbird traps would
   affect cowbird parasitism of the vireo. At our control site, cowbird
   trapping occurred in spring using modified Australian crow (Corvus spp.)
   traps. At our treatment site, we stopped this method of trapping and
   instead used target-netting of individual cowbirds and a very short
   duration trap to capture specific individual cowbirds (i.e., contingency
   trapping). We also tested the impact of shortening the cowbird trapping
   period on nest parasitism rates, and used point counts to compare
   cowbird densities between sites. Additionally, we compared the costs of
   these techniques. A shorter trapping period still resulted in a large
   number of cowbird captures on the control site (n = 452 captures) with
   no observed brood parasitism (n = 67 nests). On the treatment site,
   cowbird parasitism rates varied from 0\% to 14\% (n = 75 broods). The
   target-netting method was not effective for capturing female cowbirds,
   probably because of their low densities. The short-term contingency
   trapping method effectively removed female cowbirds in the vicinity of
   vulnerable vireo nests. Cowbird traps captured >300 individuals of 9
   different non-target species each year on the control site, whereas
   target-netting and contingency trapping resulted in only 8 captures of 4
   different non-target species. Costs of continuous trapping for 2 months
   versus point counts, nest monitoring, and contingency trapping were
   \$21,100.00 versus \$16,996.00, respectively. Based on these findings,
   we recommend that an adaptive cowbird management program to benefit
   songbird populations should consider using regular point counts and nest
   monitoring to provide data on cowbird impacts, in lieu of continued
   intensive trapping without monitoring. Thresholds for the density of
   cowbird females and the allowable level of parasitism for host species
   should also be established to guide an adaptive cowbird management
   program. Short-term contingency trapping based on the thresholds should
   be considered, but restoration of native vegetation, especially in
   southwestern riparian areas, is also crucial and effective at limiting
   parasitism, and so should strongly be considered. Lastly, large numbers
   of non-target species captures in cowbird traps are probably having
   consequential impacts to these species, and need to be monitored and
   minimized.},

Abstract = {We monitored the reproduction, dispersal, and regeneration of a wild
   population of Castanea dentata (American Chestnut), established from 4
   seed-bearing trees planted in a western Maine forest in 1982. The
   40-year-old parent trees, sourced from wild stock of a relict population
   in northern Michigan, show no obvious signs of blight and have been
   producing viable seeds now for >20 years. Over the course of 2 surveys
   conducted in 2019 and 2020, we mapped and measured 1348 offspring,
   varying in size from seedlings to nearly mature trees. As of October
   2020, the natural spread of this population had expanded to at least 370
   m from the parent trees, with an average dispersal distance of 124 m.
   While previous publications have focused on the scatter-hoarding
   behavior that gave rise to this expanding wild population, we report on
   possible factors affecting their spread, their fate, and prognosis for
   the future. Given the absence of other reproductive populations of
   American Chestnut in the immediate vicinity, our data provide rare
   insights into natural seed dispersal from a known point of origin while
   documenting the return of a functionally extinct species to a northern
   hardwood forest ecosystem.},

Title = {Midge Larvae Metriocnemus knabi Can Emigrate to New Pitchers Within
   Sarracenia purpurea After Pitcher Drainage},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},

Volume = {29},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many experimental aquatic ecologists are familiar with the commonly used
   model system Sarracenia purpurea (Purple Pitcher Plant), as this plant
   contains an entire aquatic ecosystem with obligate invertebrates in its
   pitcher-shaped leaves. An obligate herbivore of the Purple Pitcher
   Plant, Exyra fax (Pitcher Mining Moth), consumes plant tissue and chews
   a hole at the base of the pitcher, draining the pitcher of fluid and
   thereby creating unsuitable habitat for obligate aquatic invertebrates.
   Historically, it has been noted that the obligate aquatic invertebrate
   larvae within the Purple Pitcher Plant are incapable of leaving the
   pitcher they were initially deposited in as eggs. The objective of this
   experiment was to determine if larvae of the obligate invertebrate
   Metriocnemus knabi (Pitcher Plant Midge) is capable of emigrating to new
   pitchers when faced with pitcher drainage as a result of damage from the
   Pitcher Mining Moth. We placed midge larvae of varying abundances in
   experimental pitchers that were drained in a way similar to the work of
   Pitcher Mining Moth larvae. After drainage, larval midges were allowed 2
   weeks to emigrate. At the end of 2 weeks, as much as 38.2\% of the
   initial abundance of M. knabi larvae had emigrated out of drained
   pitchers to new, viable, fluid-filled pitchers and survived. We present
   here the first evidence that the obligate Pitcher Plant Midge larvae are
   capable of emigration when faced with unsuitable habitat.},

Title = {A genome-wide phylogeny and the diversification of genus Liriomyza
   (Diptera: Agromyzidae) inferred from anchored phylogenomics},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The genus Liriomyza Mik (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a diverse and globally
   distributed group of acalyptrate flies. Phylogenetic relationships among
   Liriomyza species have remained incompletely investigated and have never
   been fully addressed using molecular data. Here, we reconstruct the
   phylogeny of the genus Liriomyza using various phylogenetic methods
   (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and gene tree coalescence) on
   target-capture-based phylogenomic datasets (nucleotides and amino acids)
   obtained from anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE). We have recovered tree
   topologies that are nearly congruent across all data types and methods,
   and individual clade support is strong across all phylogenetic analyses.
   Moreover, defined morphological species groups and clades are
   well-supported in our best estimates of the molecular phylogeny.
   Liriomyza violivora (Spencer) is a sister group to all remaining sampled
   Liriomyza species, and the well-known polyphagous vegetable pests {[}L.
   huidobrensis (Blanchard), L. langei Frick, L. bryoniae. (Kaltenbach), L.
   trifolii (Burgess), L. sativae Blanchard, and L. brassicae (Riley)].
   belong to multiple clades that are not particularly closely related on
   the trees. Often, closely related Liriomyza species feed on distantly
   related host plants. We reject the hypothesis that cophylogenetic
   processes between Liriomyza species and their host plants drive
   diversification in this genus. Instead, Liriomyza exhibits a widespread
   pattern of major host shifts across plant taxa. Our new phylogenetic
   estimate for Liriomyza species provides considerable new information on
   the evolution of host-use patterns in this genus. In addition, it
   provides a framework for further study of the morphology, ecology, and
   diversification of these important flies.},

Title = {Systematic revision, molecular phylogeny and biogeography of the antlion

Abstract = {The tribe Acanthoplectrini (Myrmeleontidae: Dendroleontinae) includes a
   group of antlion genera widely distributed across the Australasian and
   Oriental regions. The intergeneric and interspecific relationships
   between or within the Australian and Oriental lineages of this tribe as
   well as their historical biogeography remain largely unexplored. Here,
   we present a molecular phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of
   Acanthoplectrini to infer the diversification history of this tribe,
   with emphasis on the Oriental lineage. Both the Oriental and Australian
   lineages are monophyletic and recovered as sister groups. Ancestral area
   reconstruction suggests that the ancestor of Acanthoplectrini might have
   been once widely distributed from Indochina to Australia and then split
   into the Oriental and Australian lineages during the early-Miocene. Our
   analyses recovered northeastern Indochina and south China as the
   ancestral range of the Oriental Acanthoplectrini. During the mid-Miocene
   to the mid-Pliocene, orographic events such as the rising of mountain
   ranges (including the Himalayas) and the formation of major islands in
   southeastern Asia triggered several dispersal and vicariance events in
   the Oriental Acanthoplectrini, driving their speciation. We revise the
   classification of the Oriental Acanthoplectrini, establishing the new
   genus Paralayahima gen. n., which is recovered sister to Layahima Navas.
   Moreover, we describe four new species of Layahima, Layahima aspoeckorum
   sp. n., Layahima monba sp. n., Layahima lhoba sp. n. and Layahima
   xinliae sp. n., and we reinstate two previously synonymized species,
   Layahima melanocoris (Yang) stat. rev. and comb. n. and Layahima
   nebulosa Navas stat. rev.},

Abstract = {In this work, we consider a chaotic system that plays a vital role in
   the treatment of cancer by injection of a virus externally. Due to the

   Therefore, we have designed control inputs using adaptive and passive
   control techniques for virotherapy. Both controllers are designed to
   bring global stability to the cancer system with the aid of a quadratic
   Lyapunov function. Furthermore, we use simulations to verify our
   controllers. Moreover, we show that our adaptive control technique gives
   better results in comparison.},

Abstract = {A new genus of Neotropical Satyrinae butterflies, Viloriodes Pyrcz \&
   Espeland gen. n. is described in the Pedaliodes Butler complex
   comprising 11-13 genera and more than 400 species. Support for the new
   genus is provided by a phylogenetic analysis based on target enrichment
   (TE) data including 618 nuclear loci with a total of 248,940
   nucleotides, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
   (COI). Five species, whose DNA sequences were obtained by TE during this
   study, form a strongly supported clade sister to the large clade
   comprising Pedaliodes and four other genera. Complementary COI analysis
   confirms the monophyly of Viloriodes gen. n., with the above five plus
   eight other species clustering in highly supported clades in both
   Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses, and a TE + COI
   concatenated tree. Based on molecular and morphological data, 30 species
   are assigned to Viloriodes gen. n. The new genus can be recognized by a
   set of subtle morphological characteristics of colour patterns and male
   and female genitalia. An analysis of divergence times indicates that
   Viloriodes gen. n. and Steromapedaliodes Forster separated around 5.9
   Mya. Viloriodes gen. n. has a wider geographic distribution than any
   other genus of the Pedaliodes complex, being found from central Mexico
   to northern Argentina and to the Guyana Shield, typically occurring at
   lower elevations than Pedaliodes.},

Title = {A tale of two populations: vital rates of fishers in British Columbia,

Abstract = {Fishers (Pekania pennanti) are a forest-dependent carnivore of
   conservation concern in British Columbia, Canada. Ecological, spatial,
   and genetic evidence suggests that there are 2 distinct populations
   (Boreal and Columbian) that occur in forests at low to moderate
   elevations in the boreal and central interior regions of the province.
   In British Columbia, fishers occur at low densities relative to other
   parts of their range in North America, are trapped for their fur, and
   are sensitive to habitat change. Despite these factors, little
   demographic information exists to assist with management decisions for
   these populations. We collated and analyzed survival and reproductive
   data from 100 radio-tagged fishers from 5 independent studies conducted
   between 1990 and 2012 in British Columbia: 2 in the Boreal population,
   and 3 in the Columbian population. We also collated litter size data
   from 1 den box study and a translocation project of fishers from the
   Columbian population. Annual survival rates were not significantly
   different between the populations or between males and females; however,
   adult survival rates were higher than subadults (0.79 and 0.63,
   respectively). Subadult females had significantly lower survival rates
   than other sex or age classes. Reproductive rates were significantly
   different between the 2 populations (denning rate = 0.54 {[}Columbian],
   0.82 {[}Boreal]; x over bar \$\textbackslash{}bar\{x\}\$ litter size =
   1.7 {[}Columbian], 2.6 {[}Boreal]). These differences resulted in net
   reproductive rates in the Columbian population that were less than half
   of those in the Boreal population (0.92 kits/reproductive season
   compared to 2.13, respectively). Population growth rates suggest that
   the Columbian population may have been declining during the studies,
   whereas the Boreal population may have been increasing (0.96 compared to
   1.20). Consequently, we suggest that focused and intensive habitat and
   population management for fishers are needed in British Columbia to
   ensure population sustainability, particularly for the Columbian
   population.},

Title = {Demographic uncertainty and disease risk influence climate-informed
   management of an alpine species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect species
   occupying ecosystems with relatively hard boundaries, such as alpine
   ecosystems. Wildlife managers must identify actions to conserve and
   manage alpine species into the future, while considering other issues
   and uncertainties. Climate change and respiratory pathogens associated
   with widespread pneumonia epidemics in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis)
   may negatively affect mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations.
   Mountain goat demographic and population data are challenging to collect
   and sparsely available, making population management decisions
   difficult. We developed predictive models incorporating these
   uncertainties and analyzed results within a structured decision making
   framework to make management recommendations and identify priority
   information needs in Montana, USA. We built resource selection models to
   forecast occupied mountain goat habitat and account for uncertainty in
   effects of climate change, and a Leslie matrix projection model to
   predict population trends while accounting for uncertainty in population
   demographics and dynamics. We predicted disease risks while accounting
   for uncertainty about presence of pneumonia pathogens and risk tolerance
   for mixing populations during translocations. Our analysis predicted
   that new introductions would produce more area occupied by mountain
   goats at mid-century, regardless of the effects of climate change.
   Population augmentations, carnivore management, and harvest management
   may improve population trends, although this was associated with
   considerable uncertainty. Tolerance for risk of disease transmission
   affected optimal management choices because translocations are expected
   to increase disease risks for mountain goats and sympatric bighorn
   sheep. Expected value of information analyses revealed that reducing
   uncertainty related to population dynamics would affect the optimal
   choice among management strategies to improve mountain goat trends.
   Reducing uncertainty related to the presence of pneumonia-associated
   pathogens and consequences of mixing microbial communities should reduce
   disease risks if translocations are included in future management
   strategies. We recommend managers determine tolerance for disease risks
   associated with translocations that they and constituents are willing to
   accept. From this, an adaptive management program can be constructed
   wherein a portfolio of management actions are chosen based on risk
   tolerance in each population range, combined with the amount that
   uncertainty is reduced when paired with monitoring, to ultimately
   improve achievement of fundamental objectives.},

Title = {Summer elk calf survival in a partially migratory population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Decomposing variation in juvenile recruitment is a key component of
   understanding population dynamics for partially migratory ungulates. We
   investigated reproductive parameters of adult female elk (Cervus
   canadensis) with calves at heel, and survivorship, cause-specific
   mortality, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting risk of
   mortality for calves in a partially migratory elk population from
   2013-2016 in Alberta, Canada. Elk calves born to resident mothers had
   45\% lower survivorship on average compared to migrant calves (0.24 vs.
   0.69) and nearly twice the mortality rate (0.37 vs. 0.19) from bears
   (Ursus spp.), the dominant source of mortality. Contrary to our
   predictions, we found that increasing levels of maternal ingesta-free
   body fat were associated with increasing risk of calf mortality,
   indicating predation may have overwhelmed nutritional effects. We found
   no evidence that timing of calf birth or birth weight differed between
   migratory tactics or influenced mortality risk. We found that as
   percentage of cut forest increased, risk of calf mortality marginally
   decreased, which benefited migrant elk that were exposed to more
   clear-cuts compared to residents. Exposure to bear predation risk was
   unimportant during the hiding phase (<= 10 days after birth) for either
   migratory tactic, presumably because neonatal hiding behavior reduced
   vulnerability. In contrast, bear predation risk was important for
   mortality risk after 10 days in age, especially for resident elk calves,
   which were exposed to higher bear predation risk compared to migrants.
   We conclude that relative differences in bear predation between
   migratory tactics are contributing to the dynamics of partial migration
   in this population through additive effects on calf mortality. Thus,
   wildlife managers should anticipate that recovering grizzly bear (U.
   arctos) populations may substantially lower elk recruitment through
   effects on summer calf survival, especially in areas with diverse
   carnivore assemblages.},

   Canada and the United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The sensitivity of amphibian species to shifts in environmental
   conditions has been exhibited through long-term population studies and
   the projection of ecological niche models under expected conditions.
   Species in biodiversity hotspots have been the focus of ample predictive
   modeling studies, while, despite their significant ecological value,
   wide-ranging and common taxa have received less attention. We focused on
   predicting range restriction of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma
   maculatum), blue-spotted salamander (A. laterale), four-toed salamander
   (Hemidactylium scutatum), and red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus)
   under future climate scenarios. Using bias-corrected future climate data
   and biodiversity database records, we developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
   models under current conditions and for climate change projections in
   2050 and 2070. We calculated positivity rates of species localities to
   represent proportions of habitat expected to remain climatically
   suitable with continued climate change. Models projected under future
   conditions predicted average positivity rates of 91\% (89-93\%) for the
   blue-spotted salamander, 23\% (2-41\%) for the spotted salamander, 4\%
   (0.7-9\%) for the four-toed salamander, and 61\% (42-76\%) for the
   red-backed salamander. Range restriction increased with time and
   greenhouse gas concentration for the spotted salamander, four-toed
   salamander, and red-backed salamander. Common, widespread taxa that
   often receive less conservation resources than other species are at risk
   of experiencing significant losses to their climatic ranges as climate
   change continues. Efforts to maintain populations of species should be
   focused on regions expected to experience fewer climatic shifts such as
   the interior and northern zones of species' distributions.},

Title = {Association of antler asymmetry with hoof disease in elk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD) is an emergent disease of elk
   (Cervus canadensis) in the Pacific West of the United States. Although
   lesions are usually restricted to the feet, anecdotal reports suggested
   increased prevalence of abnormal antlers in affected elk. We used hunter
   harvest reports for 1,688 adult male elk harvested in southwestern
   Washington, USA, during 2016-2018, to evaluate anecdotal reports. We
   used Akaike's Information Criterion to compare 18 logistic regression
   models describing the prevalence of asymmetrical antlers, indicated by
   unequal antler point counts. Our leading model (84\% of model weight)
   described additive effects of TAHD (odds ratio = 1.91; 95\% CI =
   {[}1.49, 2.44]) and maximum number of antler points. Confidence
   intervals overlapped zero for all other parameters, which described
   ecotypic, geographic, and age-related effects. Effects of physical
   injury on antler development have been described elsewhere; however,
   injuries leading to instances of antler deformity do not have
   population-level management implications. In contrast, we describe
   effects of a transmissible disease that was reported by hunters in >35\%
   of adult male elk and was associated with an increase of >= 16
   percentage points in the prevalence of gross asymmetry. Unequal point
   counts are quite common in elk with otherwise typical antlers and seem
   unlikely to attract public notice or be attributed to hoof lesions;
   thus, we suspect our results and anecdotal reports reflect more
   prominent deformities that are important to stakeholders who enjoy
   hunting and wildlife viewing.},

Title = {Predator avoidance influences selection of neonatal lambing habitat by
   Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To improve lifetime reproductive success, maternal ungulates should
   pursue behavioral strategies that reduce risk of offspring mortality.
   Predation is a leading cause of neonatal mortality; thus, maternal
   ungulates should select habitat that reduces risk of predation on
   vulnerable neonates. We examined selection of habitat across
   subpopulations of federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis
   canadensis sierrae) within Sierra Nevada, California, USA, 2008-2018.
   Our objectives were to understand how maternal Sierra Nevada bighorn
   minimize risk of predation through selection of habitat and to quantify
   current and future potential neonatal habitat across the Sierra Nevada.
   Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are the predominant predators of adult
   Sierra Nevada bighorn; thus, we hypothesized females would select
   habitat that minimized risk of predation from mountain lions. We
   developed a used-available resource selection function to quantify
   patterns of habitat selection and produced predictive maps identifying
   highly selected lambing habitat across the Sierra Nevada. Our top model
   demonstrated females selected habitat where the relative probability of
   encountering mountain lions was low and near escape terrain. Selection
   for vegetation type was dependent on risk of encounter with mountain
   lions; when risk of encounter was low, females selected shrub cover.
   This suggests that when risk of encountering mountain lions was low,
   females may have selected areas with dense shrubs to reduce risk of
   being detected by other predators such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and
   golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). As risk of encountering mountain
   lions increased, females avoided all vegetation types other than barren,
   suggesting that despite increased risk of encounter, females may have
   been able to mitigate overall mortality risk by selecting habitat where
   approaching mountain lions could be detected and avoided. Our predictive
   models and resulting maps demonstrate differences in prevalence and
   connectivity of highly selected lambing habitat across subpopulations,
   which may explain differences in lamb recruitment and adequacy of
   lambing habitat observed among subpopulations. Recolonization into
   historical ranges and increasing connectivity between Sierra Nevada
   bighorn subpopulations is an important conservation need for species
   recovery and long-term viability of fragmented subpopulations.},

Title = {Survival rates of two nesting aggregations of diamondback terrapins at
   neighboring sites in New York City},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is a charismatic and
   long-lived species of the United States eastern coast, and the only
   North American turtle that exclusively inhabits coastal brackish waters.
   Many terrapin populations are declining, and these declines have been
   largely linked to human activities; however, few studies have documented
   human and natural factors affecting terrapin population demography.
   Jamaica Bay, an urban estuary located in southern New York City, USA, is
   home to 2 nesting aggregations of terrapins, located at Ruler's Bar
   Hassock (RBH) and John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK). We analyzed
   mark-recapture data for RBH from 2003-2018 and JFK from 2011-2018 to
   estimate annual survivorship of female diamondback terrapins and test
   the effects of 3 factors (a hurricane, water quality represented by
   nitrogen concentration, and injuries) on survival. The initial estimated
   annual survival was high (0.93) at RBH but declined to 0.89, while
   survival remained constant at JFK (0.92). Models examining the effect of
   Hurricane Sandy (2012) indicated a significant decline in survival in
   the 2 years following the hurricane in the RBH nesting aggregation but
   no change at JFK. Water quality did not influence trends in either
   aggregation, but the presence of major injuries (caused by boat
   collisions, predators, and the hurricane) significantly reduced annual
   survival at RBH. We propose increasing terrapin survivorship through
   mitigation of boat traffic, reducing populations of northern raccoons
   (Procyon lotor) to reduce injury to female terrapins and decrease egg
   and hatchling mortality, and increased law enforcement to reduce
   on-going poaching and capture as illegal by-catch.},

Abstract = {In this paper we assess the effectiveness of different
   non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 utilizing a
   compartmental model. The local asymptotic stability of equilibria
   (disease-free and endemic) in terms of the basic reproduction number
   have been determined. We find that the system undergoes a backward
   bifurcation in the case of imperfect quarantine. The parameters of the
   model have been estimated from the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
   India. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number has been
   performed. The findings also suggest that effectiveness of face masks
   plays a significant role in reducing the COVID-19 prevalence in India.
   Optimal control problem with several control strategies has been
   investigated. We find that the intervention strategies including
   implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and awareness only, has
   the highest cost-effectiveness in controlling the infection. This
   combined strategy also has the least value of average cost-effectiveness

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Diseases spread and persist according to complex interactions among
   hosts, pathogens, and their shared environments. In actively managed
   wildlife diseases, unanticipated disease spread and persistence can
   challenge mitigation efforts, necessitating modeling approaches that
   elucidate and integrate multiple mechanisms. Dynamic occupancy models
   (DOMs) can predict and forecast species occurrence patterns; however,
   they have not been extended to explain the complex spread and
   persistence patterns of chronic wasting disease (CWD). We used a DOM to
   predict and forecast the persistence, and localized and long-distance
   spread of CWD in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) according to
   distinct ecological relationships that we hypothesized were important.
   We estimated large differences between the probabilities of disease
   persistence and localized and long-distance CWD spread in Wisconsin,
   USA. Chronic wasting disease was more likely to persist in areas with
   low clay content in soils, to spread locally as the amount of localized
   disease increased, and to occur in areas far removed from prior
   positives in places with a higher proportion of agriculture. Across all
   landscape compositions, the probability of occurrence decayed by
   distance from prior positives in a manner consistent with transient
   movement distances of white-tailed deer. Finally, a multi-mechanism DOM
   was able to produce spatially accurate predictions and forecasts of
   disease occurrence using only data collected during the first 2 days of
   the firearm harvest season. Thus, our multi-mechanism DOM offers
   advantages over simple linear models that can improve our understanding
   of the complex ecology driving CWD dynamics and lead to better
   surveillance and management strategies moving forward.},

Title = {Influence of landscape attributes on Virginia opossum density},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), North America's only
   marsupial, has a range extending from southern Ontario, Canada, to the
   Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, and from the Atlantic seaboard to the
   Pacific. Despite the Virginia opossum's taxonomic uniqueness in relation
   to other mammals in North America and rapidly expanding distribution,
   its ecology remains relatively understudied. Our poor understanding of
   the ecology of this important mesopredator is especially pronounced in
   the rural southeastern United States. Our goal was to estimate effects
   of habitat on opossum density within an extensive multi-year spatial
   capture-recapture study. Additionally, we compared the results of this
   spatial capture-recapture analysis with a simple relative abundance
   index. Opossum densities in the relatively underdeveloped regions of the
   southeastern United States were lower compared to the more
   human-dominated landscapes of the Northeast and Midwest. In the
   southeastern United States, Virginia opossums occurred at a higher
   density in bottomland swamp and riparian hardwood forest compared to
   upland pine (Pinus spp.) plantations and isolated wetlands. These
   results reinforce the notion that the Virginia opossum is commonly
   associated with land cover types adjacent to permanent water (bottomland
   swamps, riparian hardwood). The relatively low density of opossums at
   isolated wetland sites suggests that the large spatial scale of
   selection demonstrated by opossums gives the species access to
   preferable cover types within the same landscape.},

Abstract = {This paper mainly explores the complex impacts of spatial heterogeneity,
   vector-bias effect, multiple strains, temperature-dependent extrinsic
   incubation period (EIP) and seasonality on malaria transmission. We
   propose a multi-strain malaria transmission model with diffusion and
   periodic delays and define the reproduction numbers R-i and (R) over cap
   (i = 1, 2). Quantitative analysis indicates that the disease-free
   omega-periodic solution is globally attractive when R (i) < 1 , while if
   R (i) > 1 > R j ( i not equal j , i , j = 1 , 2 ), then strain i
   persists and strain j dies out. More interestingly, when R-1 and R-2 are
   greater than 1, the competitive exclusion of the two strains also
   occurs. Additionally, in a heterogeneous environment, the coexistence
   conditions of the two strains are (R) over cap (1) > 1 and (R) over cap
   (2) > 1 . Numerical simulations verify the analytical results and reveal
   that ignoring vector-bias effect or seasonality when studying malaria
   transmission will underestimate the risk of disease transmission.},

Title = {Piping plover chick ecology following landscape-level disturbance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Population declines of disturbance-dependent species due to suppression
   of natural disturbances are realized across ecosystems. The piping
   plover (Charadrius melodus; plover), a disturbance-dependent and
   conservation-reliant shorebird that nests on sandy beaches and barrier
   islands on the Atlantic Coast, was listed under the United States
   Endangered Species Act in 1986. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy landed on Fire
   and Westhampton islands, barrier island nesting sites for plovers in New
   York, USA. Hurricane Sandy was a natural disturbance in this system,
   creating abundant nesting habitat. The number of chicks produced by a
   pair, or a population, is a direct measure of reproductive output, and
   gaining a better understanding of productivity and chick behavior
   following large-scale habitat creation may improve plover habitat
   management and potentially species persistence. We evaluated the effects
   of landscape features on habitat selection, behavior, and survival of
   plover broods using logistic regression, generalized linear mixed
   effects models, and survival models. Plover broods selected flatter
   sites with less dense vegetation than available at random. Chick
   foraging rates were highest in moist substrates and were lower in areas
   of higher nesting plover density. Chick survival was greater for broods
   that hatched earlier in the breeding season and increased as chicks
   aged. Generally, providing access to sites with flatter, moist
   substrates will likely result in higher quality brood rearing habitat on
   the landscape. Ultimately, vegetation removal and habitat management may
   be needed to reduce plover nesting density and ensure sufficient
   habitat, which may in turn improve plover chick survival. Moreover,
   sustaining natural landscape disturbances such as those resulting from
   storms, and not taking actions to prevent hurricane-created overwash,
   will allow these landscape features to persist.},

Title = {Banding records of nestling barn owls reveal optimal timing for nest box
   maintenance in California},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {American barn owls (Tyto furcata) often rely on nest box networks for
   breeding, especially within agricultural landscapes. Nest boxes are
   commonly installed for pest management purposes and require regular
   maintenance, such as removal of pellet debris and repairs, to remain
   functional and safe for breeding owls. Ideally, nest box maintenance
   should be conducted before the breeding season begins to minimize nest
   disturbance. The timing of the barn owl breeding season is especially
   important to understand in California, USA, which has a high diversity
   of ecoregions and expansive latitudinal range. Our objective was to
   describe the barn owl breeding season throughout California using
   nestling records to assist with data-driven management recommendations.
   We queried 96 years of barn owl nestling banding records (n = 22,670)
   from the United States Geological Survey Bird Banding Lab to estimate
   egg laying dates across California and summarized 39 years of intake
   records (n = 1,741) from the California Raptor Center in the Central
   Valley. Our results suggest that barn owls typically begin to lay eggs
   in California in winter months; the median egg laying date for the state
   was 20 February. Based on these reports, planning for barn owl nest box
   maintenance to begin in fall (Sep-Nov) would align with the season that
   breeding activity and nest disturbance may be lowest, especially in the
   Central Valley and Southern Coast ecoregions.},

Title = {Larger trees may support larger Indiana bat maternity colonies in a
   dynamic landscape},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis), federally listed as endangered, are of
   management concern in eastern North America. While researchers
   quantified the habitat affinities of the species throughout the range,
   few studies have occurred in regions where populations are at high risk
   for wind energy development and changing climes. Central Illinois, USA,
   is a dynamic landscape where forest area has been increasing in recent
   decades (on public and private land) because of changing farming
   practices and increased habitat protections. The increasing availability
   of large diameter trees, increasing forest biomass, and changing forest
   compositions have the potential to influence Indiana bat roost habitat
   preferences. We assessed Indiana bat maternity roost selection at the
   tree and forest plot scale to characterize patterns of use in this
   region from 2017-2018. We predicted that large trees on the landscape
   would support large colonies of Indiana bats. We located bats in
   multiple species of trees including elm (Ulmus spp.), cottonwood
   (Populus deltoides), and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata). We documented
   larger maternity colonies sharing roosts than in previous studies from
   the 1980s in the same region. We suggest managers and regulatory
   agencies monitor Indiana bats in dynamic landscapes such as those with
   changing forest composition and biomass.},

Title = {Within-individual leaf allometry and the evolution of leaf morphology: A
   multilevel analysis of leaf allometry in temperate Viburnum (Adoxaceae)
   species},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {145-157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A critical issue in evolutionary biology is understanding the
   relationship between macroevolutionary patterns of diversity and the
   origin of variation at the organismal level. Among-individual allometry,
   the relationship between the size and shape of a structure among
   organisms at a fixed developmental stage, is often similar to
   evolutionary allometry, the relationship between the size and shape of a
   structure among populations or species, and the genetic and
   developmental process that underlie allometric relationships at both
   levels are thought to influence evolutionary diversification. Metameric
   organisms present an additional level of allometry: the relationship
   between the size and shape of structures within individuals. We propose
   that within-individual allometry is also related to evolutionary
   diversification among metameric organisms. We explore this idea in
   temperate deciduous Viburnum (Adoxaceae) species that bear two types of
   leaves, that is, preformed and neoformed leaves, with contrasting
   patterns of development. Examination of within-individual,
   among-individual, among-population, and among-species allometry of leaf
   shape in both leaf types showed that the slopes of all allometric
   relationships were significantly different from isometry, and their sign
   was consistent across allometric hierarchies. Although the allometric
   slope of preformed leaves was constant across allometry levels, the
   allometric slope of neoformed leaves became increasingly steeper. We
   suggest that allometric variation underlying evolutionary
   diversification in metameric organisms may manifest among individuals
   and also among their repeated structures. Moreover, structures with
   contrasting patterns of development within metameric organisms can
   experience different degrees of developmental constraint, and this can
   in turn affect morphological diversification.},

Title = {Fishes of Northern New York and the Adirondacks},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1-46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the fishes of northern New York can help with conservation
   planning and landscape interpretations. This report draws from fish
   surveys from the 1930s to 2018 to summarize and interpret the
   distribution of fishes in the region surrounding and including the
   Adirondacks. The study area, with its broad elevational gradient,
   includes lowland and upland ecoregions, for which we compare fish
   assemblages. Lowlands are the waters downstream of historic barriers to
   migration into the uplands (elevations of 62-215 m, depending on
   landscape slope). Uplands are the waters at higher elevations than the
   lowlands (above 168 m) that include the transitional and Adirondacks'
   elevations (above 305 m). In total, 114 fish species and 2 hybrids have
   been documented in northern New York; for the sake of convenience, the
   hybrids are tabulated as species here. Of the 116 taxa, 111 are in
   lowlands. Eighty percent are native to New York State, although patterns
   of nativity differ between the lowlands and the uplands. Specifically,
   natives make up 80\% of the lowland group and 51\% of upland group. Many
   of the species that are native to the lowlands do not occur naturally in
   the uplands, becoming widespread there only after transferal or
   stocking. The continued expansion of non-native species has caused
   changes in fish communities and losses of native species. In the
   uplands, 3 native species have been lost and 3 others dramatically
   reduced. In the lowlands, there has been relatively little change in
   species status over time. Brief annotations are provided for each of the
   116 taxa, including summaries of recent studies, changes in their status
   before and after December 1989, and proposed conservation
   classifications.},

Abstract = {In North America, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) has
   experienced precipitous declines from white-nose syndrome. As these bats
   become rare and difficult to capture, additional day-roost assessments
   to inform management may fill gaps in our understanding, particularly in
   habitats and regions where such roosts have never been surveyed. Over 2
   summers, we radio-tracked 16 individuals from a maternity colony on Long
   Island, NY, in a small forested patch surrounded by development and
   ocean. These bats disproportionately selected small, suppressed Robinia
   pseudoacacia (Black Locust) trees or snags for roosting. Generally,
   roosts occurred within the interior or edges of this forest patch,
   rather than surrounding suburbia, reinforcing the hypothesis that
   Northern Long-eared Bats are forest adapted. Our study shows even small
   tracts of forest in coastal, urban areas may have conservation value in
   providing day-roost and foraging habitat.},

Abstract = {In Kentucky, at the periphery of the species' range, Siren intermedia
   (Lesser Siren) is a species of greatest conservation need. We monitored
   Lesser Sirens in a western Kentucky wetland complex from July 2018 to
   May 2019. Using funnel traps, we captured 60 Lesser Sirens and
   recaptured 2 individuals. Activity was greatest in July, and lowest
   October-January. Three Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry
   surveys detected 7 PIT-tagged individuals: 1 Lesser Siren moved 36.9 m
   over 8 months. Capture success increased with warmer minimum water
   temperature. Body size upon first capture was unrelated to the
   microenvironment of the trap location. We recommend monitoring programs
   in western Kentucky concentrate funnel trapping in warm weather and use
   PIT telemetry to study movements.},

Title = {Modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-based polar bear
   denning in Alaska},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the Southern Beaufort Sea
   (SBS) subpopulation have commonly created maternal dens on sea ice in
   the past, maternal dens on land have become increasingly prevalent as
   sea ice declines. This trend creates conditions for increased human-bear
   interactions associated with local communities and industrial activity.
   Maternal denning is a vulnerable period in the polar bear life cycle,
   and den disturbance could lead to den abandonment, cub mortality, and
   negative population impacts. We used published long-term data to
   parameterize a Bayesian hierarchical model of annual land den abundance
   during 2000-2015, in 4 regions of northern Alaska, USA, with current or
   potential future oil and gas activity. We also estimated long-term
   (1982-2015) shifts in the spatial distribution of land dens within and
   among regions using kernel density estimation and assessed the influence
   of local and regional sea ice and snow conditions on den site selection
   using a random forest resource selection function. Our objectives were
   to quantify current den distribution and abundance, test for
   distributional shifts over time, and investigate if those shifts could
   be attributed to environmental variables related to den habitat. We
   estimated that between 2000 and 2015, the SBS contained a median 123
   dens in a typical year, of which 68 occurred on land. The region between
   the Colville and Canning rivers, where most current oil and gas activity
   occurred, also contained the largest fraction of land dens. Overall,
   land dens were disproportionately concentrated on barrier islands and on
   land within 30 km of the coast. The probability of dens occurring on
   land varied from 1982-1999 to 2000-2015 in all regions, and the overall
   distribution of land dens shifted west between those periods. This
   regional-scale change in den distribution was predictable based on
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity in snow and sea ice conditions within
   50 km of individual den locations. Land denning is likely to become
   increasingly common with continued sea ice loss, and our results and
   modeling framework could be used to design additional mitigation
   strategies for reducing the risk of incidental take due to den
   disturbance.},

Title = {Evaluating the efficacy of capture as aversive conditioning for American
   alligators in human-dominated landscapes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems increase, novel solutions are
   needed to mitigate increasing human-wildlife conflict. Aversive
   conditioning is one strategy that can reduce the risks of humans living
   alongside wildlife by modifying the behavior of animals through their
   experiences with humans. Although considered rare, American alligator
   (Alligator mississippiensis) attacks on humans most often occur in
   human-dominated landscapes and can be fatal. Our goal was to determine
   if capture and release protocols might serve as a form of aversive
   conditioning to reduce alligator tolerance of humans. Specifically, we
   compared the behavioral response of alligators to an approaching human
   for animals with 3 different levels of capture experience: alligators
   from a reference site where no captures occurred, alligators from a site
   where captures occurred that directly experienced capture and release,
   and alligators from the site where captures occurred that indirectly
   experienced capture and release (never captured but likely observed
   capture of others). We used a hurdle model and information-theoretic
   approach to evaluate support for 8 hypotheses regarding factors that
   influence alligator probability of flight in response to an approaching
   human and the flight initiation distance (FID) of alligators that did
   flee. Our hypotheses considered the effects of capture experience,
   exposure to non-capture (visual) surveys, alligator size, ambient
   temperature, and season. The best-supported models provided strong
   evidence that capture experience increased the probability of flight
   and, to a lesser extent, increased FID of alligators that did flee, but
   that the strength of the effect varied with alligator size or some
   correlate. Furthermore, the effect of capture may extend beyond animals
   with direct experience. Capture and release protocols can result in an
   aversive conditioning response in alligators, effectively reducing
   habituation to humans. Given the geographic limitations of our study,
   more work is necessary to determine whether the utility of aversive
   conditioning may be site-dependent, or similarly effective across a
   wider selection of developed landscapes.},

Abstract = {HIV is a virus that weakens a person's immune system. HIV has three
   stages, and AIDS is the most severe stage of HIV (Stage 3). People with
   HIV should take medicine (called ART) recommended by WHO as soon as
   possible to reduce the amount of virus in the body. In this paper, we
   formulate a mathematical model for HIV/AIDS with a new approach by
   focusing on two groups of infectious individuals, HIV and AIDS. We also
   introduce a controlled class (treated patients and being monitored), and
   people in this class can spread the disease. We further investigate the
   essential dynamics of the model through an equilibrium analysis. Optimal
   control theory is applied to explore effective treatment strategies by
   combining two control measures: standard antiretroviral therapy and AIDS
   treatments. Numerical simulation results show the effects of the two
   time-dependent controls, and they can be used as guidelines for public

Abstract = {With extensive and ongoing human development in coastal areas, effective
   shoreline-protection strategies against erosion and rising sea level
   that also provide natural ecosystem services will become increasingly
   important. Constructed living shoreline marshes can serve as successful
   management solutions when implemented correctly, but studies comparing
   these created estuarine habitats to their natural marsh counterparts are
   needed to assess their ecological functionality. We compared adult
   Palaemonetes pugio (Daggerblade Grass Shrimp) population demographics
   and diets from 13 pairs of living shoreline and natural marsh sites in
   the southwestern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. No significant
   differences were observed in demographics including abundance, weight,
   length, number of gravid females, and egg abundance and quality.
   Gut-content analysis detected significantly more terrestrial debris in
   shrimp from living shorelines, but the omnivorous dietary needs appeared
   met in all marsh sites. Overall, shrimp populations differed more among
   site pairs from different shorescape settings than between created and
   natural marshes from the same settings, suggesting that living
   shorelines are approaching ecosystem functionality similar to natural
   marsh habitats. However, the observed negative effect of agricultural
   land use on shrimp abundance and the discovery of microplastics in gut
   contents from all sites sampled indicate the need for further
   consideration of human impacts in both constructed and natural coastal
   habitats.},

   Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an
   adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD,
   located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This
   finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal

Title = {Comparison of Brook Trout Abundance and Distribution in Vermont's

Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {189-201},
Abstract = {Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) (Brook Trout) abundance and
   distribution have declined in much of their native range in the eastern
   United States, with most intact habitats concentrated in the northern
   states. We used stream electrofishing data from the 1950s (1952 to 1960)
   and the 2000s (2005 to 2016) to quantify changes in the abundance and
   distribution of Brook Trout in Vermont over the last half century. We
   also investigated whether Brook Trout's co-occurrence with Salmo trutta
   (Brown Trout) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout) in the 1950s
   influenced their abundance in the 2000s and, further, whether or not the
   distribution or abundance of non-native trout has changed appreciably
   since the 1950s. Overall, Brook Trout abundance was higher in the 2000s
   than in the 1950s. Increased abundance was driven by increases in young

Title = {Hard to predict! No clear effects of home-field advantage on leaf litter
   decomposition in tropical heath vegetation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {The home-field advantage (HFA) hypothesis establishes that plant litter
   decomposes faster at `home' sites than in `away' sites due to more
   specialized decomposers acting at home sites. This hypothesis has
   predominantly been tested through `yes or no' transplanting experiments,
   where the litter decomposition of a focal species is quantified near and
   away from their conspecifics. Herein, we evaluated the occurrence and
   magnitude of home-field effects on the leaf litter decomposition of
   Myrcia ramuliflora (O.Berg) N. Silveira (Myrtaceae) along a natural
   gradient of conspecific litterfall input and also if home-field effects
   are affected by litter and soil traits. Litter decomposition of M.
   ramuliflora was assessed through litterbags placed in 39 plots in a
   tropical heath vegetation over a period of 12 months. We also
   characterized abiotic factors, litter layer traits, and litter
   diversity. Our results indicated the occurrence of positive (i.e.
   Home-field advantage) and negative (i.e. Home-field disadvantage)
   effects in more than half of the plots. Positive and negative effects
   occurred in a similar frequency and magnitude. Among all predictors
   tested, only the community weighted mean C/N ratio of the litterfall
   input was associated with home-field effects. Our results reinforce the
   lack of generality for home-field effects found in the literature and
   thus challenge the understanding of litter-decomposer interaction in
   tropical ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has become a global public
   health issue, and it has been a cause for morbidity and mortality of
   more people throughout the world. In this paper, we investigated the
   impacts of vaccination, other protection measures, home quarantine with
   treatment, and hospital quarantine with treatment strategies
   simultaneously using a deterministic mathematical modelling approach. No
   one has considered these intervention strategies simultaneously in
   his/her modelling approach. We examined all the qualitative properties
   of the model such as the positivity and boundedness of the model
   solutions, the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, the
   effective reproduction number using next-generation matrix method, local
   stabilities of equilibrium points using the Routh-Hurwitz method. Using
   the Centre Manifold criteria, we have shown the existence of backward
   bifurcation whenever the COVID-19 effective reproduction number is less
   than unity. Moreover, we have analysed both sensitivity and numerical
   simulation using parameter values taken from published literature. The
   numerical results show that the transmission rate is the most sensitive
   parameter we have to control. Also vaccination, other protection
   measures, home quarantine with treatment, and hospital quarantine with
   treatment have great effects to minimize the COVID-19 transmission in
   the community.},

Title = {Black-tailed deer seasonal habitat selection: accounting for missing
   global positioning system fixes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quantitative models of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus
   columbianus) habitat selection do not exist for Pacific Northwest
   landscapes but are needed to make predictions of how deer respond to
   timber harvest. We developed models to estimate habitat selection by
   black-tailed deer within seasonal home ranges in the west-central
   Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA, from 2008-2019. Even with moderately
   high global positioning system (GPS) fix success within summer and
   winter (both averages >= 0.87), we were concerned about landscape or
   vegetation characteristics causing fix success failure that would bias
   estimates of habitat selection. Year of GPS-collar production, deer
   activity, and diel period (night, day, crepuscular) were associated with
   fix success. The odds of acquiring a fix were 2.53 times greater when
   the deer were inactive compared to active, and this difference was
   greater for those deer with higher average percent canopy cover within
   their home range. These relationships only explained a portion of the
   variation in the data and did not negate concerns about the effects of
   missing locations when estimating habitat selection, so we estimated
   deer habitat selection within summer and winter using an integrated step
   selection function (iSSF) and a probability of detection integrated step
   selection function (PDiSSF). The iSSF ignored missing fixes; the PDiSSF
   accounted for GPS fix failure due to the landscape and vegetation
   conditions. Covariates in the final summer PDiSSF included step length,
   an index of forage biomass, distance to cover-forage edge, and distance
   to road. The winter model was similar but did not include forage
   biomass. We modeled the probability of detection in the PDiSSF as a
   function of canopy cover in both seasonal models. The standard iSSF
   resulted in estimates of stronger selection for areas with higher
   biomass, presumably because fix success was higher in these more open
   areas. Predictions of habitat selection from the final PDiSSF summer
   model evaluated well with independent data from a nearby study area.
   Evaluation of the final winter model was less promising. Ignoring
   missing GPS locations, even with an average fix success as high as 87\%,
   would have led to different predictions of habitat selection by
   black-tailed deer. We recommend that researchers consider the effect of
   habitat-induced bias in fix success on the accuracy of estimates of
   habitat selection and consider using the PDiSSF to remove bias related
   to missing fixes.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Overwintering is a key demographic stage for migratory birds but remains
   poorly understood, especially among multiple declining grassland bird
   species. The non-breeding ranges all 4 species of longspur (i.e.,
   chestnut-collared {[}Calcarius ornatus], Smith's {[}C. pictus], Lapland
   {[}C. lapponicus], thick-billed {[}Rhynchophanes mccownii]) overlap in
   Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, USA, making this region ideal to study
   their wintering ecology. We evaluated the relationship between wintering
   longspur occurrence and fine-scale habitat characteristics using a
   combination of standardized bird surveys and vegetation plot sampling.
   Our study encompassed large, representative tracts of 3 prairie
   ecosystems (i.e., shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairies) that
   intersect within the Southern Great Plains, during winters of 2018-2019
   and 2019-2020. Using randomization tests and classification trees, we
   characterized longspur habitats and compared these associations across
   the 3 prairie ecosystems. Fine-scale winter habitats (horizontal
   structure, vertical structure, and species compositions) varied among
   all 4 longspur species, varied at very fine scales, and differed between
   grassland types. Our findings can be applied to the management of
   grasslands such as decreasing vegetation height in mixed-grass prairies
   for chestnut-collared longspurs or removing woody vegetation in
   shortgrass prairies for thick-billed longspurs to help develop full-life
   cycle conservation for longspurs, which have experienced population
   declines.},

Title = {Evaluating risks associated with capture and handling of mule deer for
   individual-based, long-term research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Capture and handling techniques for individual-based, long-term research
   that tracks the life history of animals by recapturing the same
   individuals for several years has vastly improved study inferences and
   our understanding of animal ecology. Yet there are corresponding risks
   to study animals associated with physical trauma or capture myopathy
   that can occur during or following capture events. Rarely has empirical
   evidence existed to guide decisions associated with understanding the
   magnitude of capture-related risks, how to reduce these risks when
   possible, and implications for mortality censoring and survival
   estimates. We used data collected from 2,399 capture events of mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) via helicopter net-gunning to compare daily
   survival probabilities within a 10-week period centered on a capture
   event and evaluated how animal age, nutritional condition (body fat),
   and various handling methods influenced survival before, during, and
   following a capture event. Direct mortality resulting from capture
   efforts was 1.59\%. Mean daily survival was 0.9993 +/- 0.0001 (SE)
   during the 5-week pre-capture window, was depressed the day of capture
   at 0.9841 +/- 0.0004, and rebounded to 0.9990 +/- 0.0008 during the
   5-week post-capture window. Neither capture nor handling had a
   detectable effect on post-capture survival, including handling time (x
   over bar \$\textbackslash{}bar\{x\}\$ = 13.30 +/- 1.87 min), capture
   time of year (i.e., Dec or Mar), tooth extraction, and the number of
   times an animal had been recaptured (2-17 times). Although mortality
   rate was slightly elevated during capture (resulting from physical
   trauma associated with capture), age and nutritional condition did not
   influence the probability of mortality during a capture event. Following
   a capture event, nutritional condition influenced survival; however,
   that relationship was consistent with expected effects of nutritional
   condition on winter survival and independent of capture and handling.
   Overall survival rates 5 weeks before capture and 5 weeks after capture
   were not different. A specified window of time with depressed survival
   following capture and handling was not evident, which contradicts the
   implementation of a predetermined window often used by researchers and
   managers for censoring mortalities that occur after capture. Previous
   notions that censorship of all mortality data in the 2 weeks following
   capture is unwarranted and risks removal of meaningful data. With
   previous evidence guiding our protocols for capture (e.g., reduced chase
   time) and handling (e.g., temperature mitigation), low direct mortality
   and almost undetectable indirect mortality post capture reinforces the
   efficacy of helicopter net-gunning for capture and recapture of mule
   deer in long-term, individual-based studies.},

Title = {Growth of the invasive Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus) under

Abstract = {Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus), a perennial monocot plant native to
   tropical Africa, is a major weed in pasture and cropping areas in the
   wet tropical regions of Australia and South Pacific countries. In
   grazing pasture lands, rapid growth and reproduction of unpalatable
   Navua sedge leads to displacement of co-occurring pasture species and
   depletion of livestock carrying capacity and production. Understanding
   the interspecific competitive ability of Navua sedge with co-occurring
   desirable grasses and in response to varying ecological scenarios (e.g.,
   grazing and plant density) is critical for the management of the weed in
   pasture situations. In a glasshouse setting, two co-occurring pasture
   species-humidicola (Urochloa humidicola) and Rhodes grass (Chloris
   gayana) were grown with Navua sedge, in pots using a replacement series
   model. For each Navua sedge weed-pasture species pair, the experimental
   setup comprised of four ratios in two densities under simulated grazing
   and nongrazing conditions of the pasture grasses. Navua sedge growth and
   reproduction was highest when it grew as a monoculture or when
   co-occurring pastures were exposed to simulated grazing as this action,
   reduced the competitiveness of the pasture grasses. Overall and using
   biomass gained, tiller production and relative yield as indices of
   growth dynamics, Rhodes grass was more competitive against Navua sedge
   than humidicola in both grazed and nongrazed conditions especially under
   high plant density. These results suggest the potential to include
   competitive pastures in integrated management strategies for Navua
   sedge, but species selection and grazing practices may influence the
   effectiveness of this approach.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation in growth-related traits-from leaf to

   grown in a common garden},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {To elucidate the physiological and morphological factors underlying
   intraspecific variation in growth rate, we examined the variation in
   leaf and whole-tree traits for three geographical variations of ca.
   45-year-old Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) with
   contrasting heights and radial growth in a common garden. Traits that
   reflect leaf-level photosynthesis, water relations, and whole-tree level
   crown structure in relation to light use and hydraulic architecture were
   measured. Overall, intraspecific variation in growth characteristics in
   field-grown adult trees was regulated by whole-tree properties rather
   than leaf properties. Most leaf traits were similar among provenances.
   Nevertheless, the leaf traits exhibited highest maximum net
   photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate, and light compensation point
   in provenances whose native habitats are most similar to the common
   garden in the present study. Together with previous reports that this
   provenance has higher root nutrient acquisition capacity than the other
   two provenances, it can be said that organ-level resource use strategies
   are coupled in a tandem manner. At the whole-tree level, hydraulic
   architecture-as explained by axial variation in the hydraulically
   weighted tracheid diameter-can be linked to leaf distribution with
   respect to light use strategies as well as water transport capacity,
   leading to differences in growth characteristics among provenances. The
   study of intraspecific variation in growth characteristics in trees with
   a wide range of native habitats is expected to be a useful indicator for
   predicting changes in growth potential and forest dynamics in response
   to climate change in each habitat.},

Title = {Concordant genetic structures of sika deer and Japanese land leeches
   suggest that the current range expansion of Haemadipsa japonica is
   dependent on sika deer migration: A case study from Tochigi Prefecture,
   Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Haemadipsa japonica is a Japanese land leech that feeds on the blood of
   host animals, mainly the sika deer (Cervus nippon). The distribution of
   H. japonica has expanded since the 1990s, possibly due to sika deer
   population increases. Haemadipsa japonica populations were found in the
   northern and southern regions of Tochigi Prefecture, central Japan.
   Previous investigations reported that these populations are genetically
   differentiated between the north and south, although the sika deer
   distribution extends throughout the northern and southern regions. We
   hypothesized that the migration of sika deer might be limited, thus
   maintaining the two H. japonica genetic groups and restricting its range
   expansion. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the genetic
   structure of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellites
   (nSSR) of sika deer samples collected from Tochigi Prefecture and from
   H. japonica bloodmeal samples (invertebrate-derived DNA; iDNA). The sika
   deer mtDNA presented two haplotypes (G- and A-haplotypes) without a
   clear genetic structure. Conversely, the sika deer nSSR analysis
   indicated clear genetic differentiation between deer in the northern and
   southern regions, corresponding to the two H. japonica genetic groups.
   This indicates that sika deer movement is restricted to narrow regions
   in Tochigi Prefecture. Therefore, we conclude that the current H.
   japonica expansion in the prefecture likely depends on the migration of
   sika deer, only occurring within the northern and southern regions, even
   though this is driven by sika deer migration.},

Abstract = {Vegetation disturbance during infrastructure construction can cause
   serious ecological problems, especially in fragile environments. The
   Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau is an oil industry base in China with a
   fragile ecosystem. Vegetation restoration on the disturbance area can
   effectively control soil erosion and ensure the safety of oil pipelines.
   In the linear disturbance area, surrounding vegetation traits and
   topography may play an important role in vegetation restoration by
   influencing propagules and recruitment microsites. This study aimed to
   reveal the influence of vegetation type and topography on vegetation
   restoration in the disturbance area along the oil pipeline. The results
   showed that 89 species were recorded, and they belonged to 30 families
   and 74 genera. These species were mainly native herbaceous plants,
   especially perennial herbs. The species number and species diversity
   index in the disturbance area had a positive relationship with the
   undisturbed area. The lateral undisturbed vegetation type and species
   reproductive strategies influenced the vegetation restoration in the
   disturbance area. The species that produce a large number of seeds or
   regenerate by rhizome recolonized quickly in the disturbance area.
   However, the shrubs and arbor species that need seeds for recruitment
   will take a long time for restoration. The topographic factor had an
   obvious influence on the vegetation restoration and species diversity in
   the disturbance areas. On the sunny and steep slopes, vegetation
   restoration was difficult and slow, and artificial measures were needed
   to control soil erosion and maintain soil moisture to help seedling
   recruitment and survival.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the effects of local- and landscape-scale environmental
   factors is indispensable for the conservation of wetland biodiversity.
   We surveyed the distribution and abundance of two spring-dependent
   invertebrates, the Japanese freshwater crab Geothelphusa dehaani and
   larvae of dragonfly Anotogaster sieboldii, at 37 spring-fed wetlands in
   the Lake Inba watershed, Japan. The relationships among local factors
   (water temperature, channel-water velocity, substrate type, and
   abundance of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii), a
   landscape-scale factor (the percentage of permeable surface in
   catchment; PPSC), and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of each species were
   analyzed using path analyses. PPSC indirectly affected the CPUE of both
   G. dehaani and A. sieboldii via different processes. For G. dehaani,
   PPSC affected the CPUE via a positive effect on channel-water velocity
   and substrate composition in the wetland. On the other hand, PPSC
   positively affected the CPUE of A. sieboldii by decreasing the summer
   water temperature. Red swamp crayfish had no significant direct effects
   on either species, although we found a significant negative effect of
   channel-water velocity on the distribution of red swamp crayfish. For
   conservation of these spring-dependent species, we suggest preserving
   the area of permeable surface in the watershed in order to maintain flow
   velocity and low water temperature in wetlands.},

   31\% of coots moving among wetlands, and very high levels of daily

   different groups of wetlands supported different birds. There was also
   strong evidence for patterns in daily and seasonal movement patterns of
   stilts. Our work indicates the importance of each wetland to the
   waterbirds they support, as each individual had strong fidelity to a
   single wetland. In addition, for Hawaiian coots and stilts, which were
   documented moving among multiple wetlands, a network of wetlands may be
   key for long-term persistence of these endangered species, and
   coordinated regional management of waterbirds as a shared resource could
   provide greater benefits to waterbirds than independent management of
   each wetland.},

Title = {Dispersal limitations increase vulnerability under climate change for
   reptiles and amphibians in the southwestern United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Species conservation plans frequently rely on information that spans
   political and administrative boundaries, especially when predictions are
   needed of future habitat under climate change; however, most species
   conservation plans and their requisite predictions of future habitat are
   often limited in geographical scope. Moreover, dispersal constraints for
   species of concern are not often incorporated into distribution models,
   which can result in overly optimistic predictions of future habitat. We
   used a standard modeling approach across a suite of 23 taxa of
   amphibians and reptiles in the North American deserts (560,024 km(2)
   across 13 ecoregions) to assess impacts of climate change on habitat and
   combined landscape population dispersal simulations with species
   distribution modeling to reduce the risk of predicting future habitat in
   areas that are not available to species given their dispersal abilities.
   We used 3 general circulation models and 2 representative concentration
   pathways (RCPs) to represent multiple scenarios of future habitat
   potential and assess which study species may be most vulnerable to
   changes forecasted under each climate scenario. Amphibians were the most
   vulnerable taxa, but the most vulnerable species tended to be those with
   the lowest dispersal ability rather than those with the most specialized
   niches. Under the most optimistic climate scenario considered (RCP 2.6;
   a stringent scenario requiring declining emissions from 2020 to near
   zero emissions by 2100), 76\% of the study area may experience a loss of
   >20\% of the species examined, while up to 87\% of the species currently
   present may be lost in some areas under the most pessimistic climate
   scenario (RCP 8.5; a scenario wherein greenhouse gases continue to
   increase through 2100 based on trajectories from the mid-century). Most
   areas with high losses were concentrated in the Arizona and New Mexico
   Plateau ecoregion, the Edwards Plateau in Texas, and the Southwestern
   Tablelands in New Mexico and Texas, USA. Under the most pessimistic
   climate scenario, all species are predicted to lose some existing
   habitat, with an average of 34\% loss of extant habitat across all
   species. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we detected an average
   loss of 24\% of extant habitat across all species, suggesting that
   changing climates may influence the ranges of reptiles and amphibians in
   the Southwest.},

Title = {Climate, habitat interactions, and mule deer resource selection on
   winter landscapes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a valued game species across their
   range in North America. At higher latitudes mule deer inhabit the
   Northern Forests ecoregion, where the winter season poses challenging
   conditions. We studied resource selection during winter by mule deer in
   northwest Montana, USA, focused on the effects of snow and canopy cover
   on deer behavior. Specifically, we assessed the effects of land cover
   type, terrain characteristics, snow accumulation, percent canopy cover,
   solar radiation, and forage biomass on resource selection by 126 mule
   deer captured during 2017-2019 in 3 partially migratory subpopulations.
   We collected pellet samples and conducted diet analyses to assess forage
   species by individual and study area. Deer displayed a shift from
   nitrogen-rich forbs and shrubs in summer to nutrient-poor evergreens
   like conifers in winter. Deer avoided areas with deeper snow and sought
   more closed canopy forests for their snow-intercept advantages. Weather
   and vegetative variation among and within study areas resulted in
   disparities in selection for attributes such as land cover. Similarly,
   mule deer diets varied spatiotemporally as a function of snow, with some
   deer favoring coniferous species in deep snow, whereas others less
   constrained by snow had more diverse diets with more shrub species.
   Additional analyses revealed annual individual survival correlated with
   changes in snow depth, suggesting fitness consequences as snow
   accumulated. These differences suggest locally adapted behaviors as mule
   deer reflect energetic constraints of winter landscapes.},

Title = {Short-term responses of riparian salamander populations to wildfire in
   the Southern Appalachians},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wildfire is a natural disturbance within many forest ecosystems and is
   rapidly becoming more frequent and severe because of the combination of
   historical fire suppression and climate change. In Southern Appalachian
   hardwood forests, there is a limited understanding of how salamander
   populations respond to wildfire, despite their high diversity and
   abundance in forest ecosystems. We expected populations of lungless,
   plethodontid salamanders to respond negatively to wildfire and the drier
   microhabitat conditions in burned habitat. We evaluated the effect of
   fire on 3 plethodontid salamander species (Blue Ridge two-lined
   salamander {[}Eurycea wilderae], Ocoee salamander {[}Desmognathus
   ocoee], red-legged salamander {[}Plethodon shermani]) with different
   life histories from 2017-2019 following a wildfire in a Southern
   Appalachian riparian forest in North Carolina, USA. We estimated
   differences in abundance, frequency of adults in the population, and
   terrestrial distribution in relation to streams between burned and
   reference riparian forest sites. Wildfire had negative effects on the
   abundance of semi-aquatic species, but temporal patterns differed by
   species. Abundance of the Blue Ridge two-lined salamander was lower in
   burn sites than reference sites immediately after fire, followed by a
   gradual convergence towards reference-site densities. Conversely, Ocoee
   salamanders had a time-lagged response, where we observed significantly
   lower densities in burn sites relative to reference sites for only 2
   years after fire. We did not observe strong responses of red-legged
   salamander abundance to fire. There were no consistent patterns in how
   the percentage of adults in reference or burn sites differed over time,
   suggesting that population responses to burn vary by species. Finally,
   we observed adults of all species and juveniles of semi-aquatic species
   farther from streams in burn sites. Our findings suggest plethodontid
   salamander communities may tolerate riparian wildfires, although
   longer-term studies are required to understand how long it takes for
   patterns of population size structure and habitat use to converge with
   those in unburned reference sites.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Understanding temporal variation in mechanisms and factors shaping
   metacommunity is an important issue of community ecology. The relative
   importance of different assembly mechanisms, such as dispersal and
   environmental filtering, can vary through time in dynamic systems,
   whereas it is still unclear how different dispersal modes affect
   temporal patterns of the variation. We investigated metacommunity
   structures of fish and aquatic insects with flying adults in spring,
   summer, and autumn in drainage ditches of paddy fields in the Kita River
   basin, Japan, where agricultural water management and flood events cause
   seasonal flow changes. Using redundancy analysis and variation
   partitioning, we examined how the variation of these metacommunity
   structures was explained by local environmental factors and two types of
   spatial factors (overland based and watercourse based). Fish
   metacommunities were mainly influenced by local environmental factors
   (e.g., water depth) in summer, and by watercourse-based spatial factors
   (e.g., distance to downstream rivers) in spring and autumn. As fishes
   are obligate aquatic dispersers, increased hydrological connectivity
   among habitats in summer weakens the dispersal limitation from
   downstream rivers and enables species to track environmentally preferred
   habitats. In contrast, only overland-based spatial factors (e.g.,
   spatial patterns based on overland distance) significantly affected
   aquatic insect metacommunities in summer and autumn. These results
   suggest that regional and landscape variables can influence their
   metacommunity patterns more than the local environment. We conclude that
   the dynamic nature of the environment and dispersal modes can
   interactively influence metacommunity structures in temporally
   connecting habitats.},

Abstract = {Sphaeriusidae (Coleoptera: Myxophaga) is a group of shiny, blackish and
   hemispherical riparian beetles, known for their miniaturized bodies.
   They are worldwide in distribution, but very limited information is
   available about taxonomic and morphological diversity, and natural and
   evolutionary history. The aim of this study is to help fill in these
   gaps. We examined the external morphology of modern representatives
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reconstructed the
   phylogeny of the family using five DNA markers (cytochrome oxidase I,
   18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, CAD and wingless). Our results suggest a larger
   morphological diversity than previously expected, corresponding to the
   deep genetic divergences of principal lineages. We also examined two
   inclusions in 99-million-year-old Burmese amber. The integration of all
   evidence allows us to recognize three genera: the extinct genus \&
   DAG;Burmasporum Kirejtshuk, the newly defined genus Bezesporum gen.nov.
   preserved in Burmese amber (B. burmiticum sp.nov.) and present in the
   modern fauna of Southeast Asia, and the genus Sphaerius Waltl with a
   world-wide distribution. Sphaerius species are morphologically highly
   uniform, with the exception of species from Australia and South Africa,
   which share some characteristics with Bezesporum gen.nov. despite being
   resolved as deeply nested lineages of Sphaerius by DNA data. The
   presence of Bezesporum gen.nov. in Burmese amber and in recent fauna
   indicates that Sphaeriusidae largely maintained their specific
   morphology and specialized riparian lifestyle for at least 100 million
   years. Therefore, they can be considered an exceptionally conserved
   group, with a minimum of evolutionary changes over a long period. Our
   study also demonstrates that the species numbers and fine-scale
   morphological diversity of Sphaeriusidae are larger than expected in
   both the past and present-day faunas. Both were apparently
   underestimated due to the minute body size and cryptic habits of these
   beetles.},

Abstract = {Moth lacewings (Ithonidae) are a rare group of Neuroptera with an
   unusual subterranean larval life-style. We examined external and
   internal head structures of an older-instar larva of Ithone Newman with
   a broad spectrum of techniques. Larval autapomorphies, likely correlated
   with the subterranean habits, are the compact and shovel-shaped head,
   unusually massive mandibular-maxillary stylets, and a C-shaped
   postcephalic body. Other cephalic autapomorphies are the massive
   X-shaped tentorium, incurved antennae, and a strongly developed M.
   verticopharyngalis. The visual organs are distinctly simplified but a
   single functional stemma on each side of head is retained despite of the
   subterranean habits. In contrast to previous studies, a well-developed
   gular sclerite is present in Ithonidae, possibly a secondary
   acquisition. A cephalic gland complex and poison channel are present,
   with an unexpected additional lateral accessory gland and an additional
   lateral channel. The poison glands and dual channels very clearly
   indicate that the larvae are predators, contradicting the phytophagous
   habits formerly postulated. Compared with soil-inhabiting scarabaeoid
   beetle larvae, striking differences of head structures are due to
   different feeding habits and phylogenetic constraints. Morphological
   similarities like a C-shaped postcephalic body and strongly developed
   legs suitable for burrowing in soil are evolutionary parallels
   associated with the subterranean life-style in the two non-related
   groups. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out with an updated
   morphological matrix. The results were compared with a phylogeny based
   on anchored hybrid enrichment data. The evolutionary transformations of
   selected characters were evaluated using phylogenies estimated from both
   datasets.},

Abstract = {Paleotropical clades with largely disjunct distributions are ideal
   models for biogeographic reconstructions. The dung beetle genera
   Grebennikovius Mlambo, Scholtz \& Deschodt, Epactoides Olsouffief and
   Ochicanthon Vaz-de-Mello are distributed in Tanzania, Madagascar and
   Reunion, and the Oriental region, respectively. We combine morphology
   and molecular dataset to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships
   between these taxa. Our analyses corroborate previous hypotheses of
   monophyly of the group, which is here described as new tribe Epactoidini
   trib. nov. Grebennikovius is recovered as sister to Epactoides, while
   Ochicanthon emerges as sister to them both. The disjunct distribution of
   our focal clade is unusual within the subfamily Scarabaeinae. Bayesian
   divergence time estimates and ancestral range reconstructions indicate
   an African origin of the crown group of the tribe Epactoidini trib. nov.
   in the early mid Eocene, ca. 46 Ma. The divergence between Epactoides
   and its sister is dated to 32.3 Ma, while the crown age for the genus
   Ochicanthon is dated to 27 Ma. We investigate the factors that may have
   shaped the current distribution of the tribe Epactoidini trib. nov. The
   formation of the Gomphotherium landbridge, along with favourable
   environmental conditions would have allowed dry-intolerant organisms,
   such as Ochicanthon, to disperse out of Africa. Remarkable climatic
   stability of the Eastern Arc Mountains was critical for the retention of
   the monotypic genus Grebennikovius. We suggest two subsequent overwater
   dispersal events: the migration of the most recent common ancestor
   (MRCA) of Epactoides from Africa to Madagascar (32.3-29.5 Ma); the
   lately dispersal of the MRCA of the today's extinct Epactoides giganteus
   Rossini, Vaz-de-Mello \& Montreuil to Reunion island from Madagascar
   (3.4 Ma). We suggest that the high potential of dispersal of Epactoidini
   trib. nov. dung beetles and the strict association to forest habitat
   might have triggered two major radiations, one in Madagascar and one in
   the Oriental Region.},

Title = {Management and landscape of shelterbelts contribute to butterfly and

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {A considerably large number of shelterbelts were established in Japan to
   increase crop yields in agricultural landscapes. Shelterbelt landscapes
   have multiple functions; they not only help to control wind damage but
   also to conserve biodiversity, including forest and grassland species.
   However, previous studies on biodiversity conservation in shelterbelts,
   and the target taxa were limited since this aspect of shelterbelts has
   not received much attention in Japan. This study examines the effects of
   shelterbelts and their regeneration on the diversity of butterflies and
   flowering plants in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, Japan. Using a
   transect method, we compared environmental factors, butterfly, and
   flowering plant diversity in four habitats: inside forest, forest edge,
   regeneration sites, and semi-natural grasslands which include
   shelterbelts and surrounding landscapes. There were significant
   differences in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) among habitats,
   with higher PAR corresponding to higher numbers of butterfly species and
   individuals, and flowering plant species and flowers. Nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling results also showed that the species
   composition of flowering plants and butterflies differed among habitats.
   In addition, indicator value analysis showed that semi-natural
   grasslands and regeneration sites were characterized by endangered
   butterflies and their host plants. Our results indicated that
   shelterbelt regeneration and the surrounding environment (e.g.,
   semi-natural grasslands) contributed to the diversity of butterflies and
   flowering plants, including endangered species. Future studies
   evaluating the diversity of various taxa would provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of the effects of shelterbelts on
   biodiversity conservation.},

   Zosterops japonicus: Factors influencing its preference for two plant

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {623-634},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many frugivorous birds act as seed dispersers for freshly fruited
   plants. Typically, one bird species has multiple plant partners,
   functioning as a generalist disperser. However, specific interactions
   also can be formed, depending on the traits of birds and plants. Our
   field observation from 2017 to 2019 suggested that Zosterops japonicus
   as frugivore prefers the fruits of Aralia elata and Zanthoxylum
   ailanthoides, thus dispersing the seeds locally in central Japan. In
   this study, we examined the factors of the preference by comparing the
   morphological traits among plants and observing foraging efficiency on
   each plant. The tree traits of the two plants were characterized by
   large crop size and high number of fruits that Z. japonicus can forage
   on a certain point of a branch (NFZ). Their fruits were also
   characterized by small size and high share of lipids in the edible
   parts. The traits of edible parts differed between the two plants; A.
   elata fruits had succulent pulps, whereas Z. ailanthoides fruits only
   contained oil composed of oleic aids. Additionally, the number of fruits
   per second consumed by Z. japonicus was significantly higher in the two
   plants than those in other plants. The foraging efficiency was enhanced
   by large crop size, large NFZ, small fruit size, and high lipid content
   of fruits. The high foraging efficiency may increase the preference of
   Z. japonicus for the two plants, leading to the specific interactions.},

Title = {Stand dynamics over 15 years including an outlying population of Fagus
   crenata at the northern margin of its distribution range in Hokkaido,
   Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Fagus crenata, a dominant tree species in cool-temperate deciduous
   broad-leaved forest of Japan, is continuously distributed northward to
   the Kuromatsunai lowland of Hokkaido, beyond which its distribution is
   patchy and isolated. We analyzed stand dynamics over 15 years
   (2006-2021) in a plot (0.75 ha) including one such outlying population
   of F. crenata. At the stand level over 15 years, stem density decreased,
   but aboveground biomass increased. The dominance of F. crenata
   consistently increased in stem density and aboveground biomass. Change
   in the relationship between stem density and mean stem mass indicated a
   successional nature of the stand undergoing self-thinning. Increasing F.
   crenata dominance and the associated compositional shift was due to the
   higher growth rates and lower mortality of F. crenata compared to other
   tree species. Judging from tree-ring analysis, the oldest F. crenata
   tree in the plot established in 1821, but the density of F. crenata
   remained low till ca. 1895. The stand started to be affected by
   persistent disturbance since ca. 1895, with the waves of tree
   establishment and growth release both peaking at ca. 1930-1960. The F.
   crenata population mirrored the pattern of the stand, with more
   pronounced increases during these waves. We suggest that the
   long-lasting episode of tree establishment and growth release over ca.
   1930-1960 was caused by human disturbance, most likely selective logging
   for fuelwood. The results support the ``northward expansion{''}
   hypothesis, implying that F. crenata potentially can become dominant
   beyond the current northern limit of continuous distribution and that
   disturbance facilitates the range expansion.},

Abstract = {Scientists are increasingly encouraged to engage with the public about
   science. Key to normalizing and advancing ``public engagement with
   science{''} (PES) is the dissemination of such activities within the
   science literature. We developed a classification scheme to assess the
   extent and type of PES articles in ecology-themed scholarly journals.
   Our review indicated that although many ecologists interact with the
   public and intend to maintain this interaction, only a small minority
   publish about PES efforts, perspectives, strategies, successes, and
   challenges in ecology journals regularly read by their peers. We suggest
   that publication of PES in disciplinary journals offers a means of both
   providing professional credit and improving engagement practices. Thus,
   we encourage ecologists to write articles about their PES efforts, urge
   editors and reviewers to be responsive to such submissions, and
   recommend more consistent use of common PES keywords in science
   articles. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Title = {Idea paper: Extended benefits of pollinator-mediated microbial dispersal
   among flowers},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 26},
Abstract = {Since the production of large and conspicuous flowers can be costly,
   self-pollinated or asexually reproducing plants are expected to lose
   characters for pollinator attraction. However, some plants still produce
   conspicuous flowers despite not relying on pollinators for
   fertilization, suggesting overlooked benefits of receiving flower
   visitors. Here, we present visitor-mediated microbial dispersal as a
   potential benefit of receiving flower visitors. Recent studies revealed
   that diverse microbes inhabit plant surfaces or plant tissues and that
   these microbes substantially benefit host plants. Animal flower visitors
   disperse these microbes. Since some microbes can migrate to seeds, the
   enhanced dispersal via visitors can modulate microbial communities of
   the next generations. Microbial dispersal via flower visitors may
   improve plant fitness via increased opportunities to receive microbes
   mutualistic for seeds and higher variances in seed microbial communities
   that function as ``bet-hedging.{''} We can test this hypothesis by
   comparing microbial communities and the performance of seeds from
   experimentally visitor-excluded flowers and naturally animal-visited
   control flowers. Further experiments with sterilization or microbe
   inoculation may confirm the contribution of specific taxa or microbial
   community structures to the observed effects on seed performances.},

Title = {Permian parallelisms: Reanalysis of dagger Tshekardocoleidae sheds light
   on the earliest evolution of the Coleoptera},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Coleoptera provides an excellent example of the value of fossils for
   understanding the evolutionary patterns of recent lineages. We
   reevaluate the morphology of the Early Permian dagger Tshekardocoleidae
   to test alternative phylogenetic hypotheses relating to the Palaeozoic
   evolution of the order. We discuss prior interpretations and revise an
   earlier data matrix. Both Bayesian and parsimony analyses support the
   monophyly of Coleoptera excluding dagger Tshekardocoleidae (=
   Mesocoleoptera), and of Coleoptera excluding dagger Tshekardocoleidae
   and dagger Permocupedidae (= Metacoleoptera). Plesiomorphies preserved
   in dagger Tshekardocoleidae are elytra, which rest over the body in a
   loose tent-like manner, with flat lateral flanges, projecting beyond the
   abdominal apex, and abdomens that are flexible and nearly cylindrical.
   Apomorphies of Mesocoleoptera include shortening of the elytra and a
   closer fit with the flattened and probably more rigid abdomen. A crucial
   synapomorphy of Metacoleoptera is the tightly sealed subelytral space,
   which may have been advantageous during the Permian aridification. Taxon
   exclusion experiments show that dagger Tshekardocoleidae is crucial for
   understanding the early evolution of Coleoptera and that its omission
   strongly affects ancestral state polarities as well as topology,
   including crown-group taxa. By constraining the relationships of extant
   taxa to match those supported by phylogenomic analysis, we demonstrate
   that features shared by Archostemata with Permian stem groups are most
   reasonably supported as plesiomorphic and that the smooth and simplified
   body forms of Polyphaga, Adephaga, Myxophaga, and Micromalthidae were
   derived in parallel. Our study highlights the reciprocal illumination of
   molecular, morphological, and paleontological data, and paves the way
   for tip-dating analysis across the order.},

   for SIS disease dynamics. The control variable is the level of mixing in
   the population, which influences both revenue and the spread of the
   disease. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we find a closed-form
   solution for our problem. We explore an example of our problem with
   parameters for the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus in dairy cows,
   and we perform sensitivity analyses to determine how model parameters
   affect optimal strategies. We find that less mixing is preferable when
   the transmission rate is high, the per-capita recovery rate is low, or
   when the revenue parameter is much smaller than the cost parameter.},

Title = {Post-emergence movements and habitat use by hatchling diamondback
   terrapins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) inhabit estuarine
   environments, and adult females typically nest in coastal uplands.
   Hatchlings emerging from nests overwinter on land and in coastal salt
   marshes, but the proportions that use each land cover type is not well
   documented. From 2019 to 2021, we tracked movements and habitat use of
   hatchlings post-emergence to determine the importance of upland
   overwintering sites to a terrapin population in Rhode Island, USA. In
   late summer and early fall, we attached a radio-transmitter and passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) tag (n = 46) or only a PIT tag (n = 132) to
   carapaces of hatchlings emerging from nests. From August to June, we
   tracked the hatchlings via radio-telemetry and a sweeping PIT tag
   antenna, successfully documenting the fates of 46.6\% of them (n = 83).
   This group included 23 hatchlings that overwintered in the upland, 11
   hatchlings that moved to the salt marsh in fall, 46 predated hatchlings,
   and 3 hatchlings dead from unknown causes. Upon emergence from their
   nests, 68\% of hatchlings dispersed toward water and 32\% of hatchlings
   dispersed away from water. In the uplands, hatchlings typically
   overwintered within about 2 m of habitat edges. Movement in the uplands
   peaked from late August to early October, then ceased until hatchlings
   re-emerged in late April through early June. To protect terrapins, we
   recommend limiting the use of heavy equipment (e.g., mowers, tillers) in
   vegetated uplands near nest sites, and scheduling vegetation management
   for colder months (Nov-Mar in New England, USA) when hatchlings are
   inactive.},

Title = {Survival of Columbian sharp-tailed grouse chicks and juveniles in
   northwestern Colorado},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chick and juvenile survival are important vital rates for population
   monitoring and making sound management decisions. These demographics are
   poorly understood in Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus
   phasianellus columbianus) and survival estimation in the first 2 weeks
   is particularly challenging to assess. In 2015-2017, we captured 1,219
   chicks (1-7 days old) from 156 broods. We marked 625 chicks with
   radio-transmitters to monitor their survival and recaptured them to
   replace the radio-transmitter from 18-30 days old. Overall survival of
   chicks and juveniles for the brood-rearing season (initial capture-31
   Aug) was 0.30 +/- 0.02 (SE; 95\% CI = 0.26, 0.35, n = 746) using the
   Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. We used Cox proportional hazards
   regression to model survival and for chicks entering the study at 2-4
   days old, survival to 21 days old was 0.59 +/- 0.03 (95\% CI = 0.53,
   0.65, n = 529) and increasing chick mass had a positive effect on chick
   survival probability, with a 6.0\% decrease in mortality risk for each
   additional gram of mass at initial capture. Juvenile survival was 0.51
   +/- 0.04 (95\% CI = 0.43, 0.60, n = 294) and differed by study site. Of
   our 4 study sites, the 2 western sites (West Axial, Iles Dome) had
   65-80\% greater hazard compared to the 2 more eastern sites (Routt,
   Trapper). Juvenile survival was also influenced by hatch date, with a
   3.0\% greater hazard for each day later in the nesting season that a
   nest hatched. Because chick survival is positively influenced by greater
   mass at capture and juvenile survival was positively affected by earlier
   hatching dates of broods, management actions should focus on improving
   the habitat surrounding lek sites to increase the success of initial
   nests and to provide high quality (increased levels of calcium,
   phosphorus, and protein) and quantity forage to nesting females and
   chicks to increase survival and population stability. Additionally,
   given that lower mass increases the hazard for chick survival,
   researchers planning to mark chicks should not mark individuals <11 g
   when using a 0.55-g radio-transmitter. Radio-transmitters for chicks
   should not exceed 5.0\% of the chicks' body mass at the time of marking.},

Title = {Systematics and evolution of predatory flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae)

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are one of the most species-rich
   dipteran families and provide important ecosystem services such as
   pollination, biological control of pests, recycling of organic matter
   and redistributions of essential nutrients. Flower fly adults generally
   feed on pollen and nectar, but their larval feeding habits are
   strikingly diverse. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was
   used to capture and enrich phylogenetically and evolutionary informative
   exonic regions. With the help of the baitfisher software, we developed a
   new bait kit (SYRPHIDAE1.0) to target 1945 CDS regions belonging to 1312
   orthologous genes. This new bait kit was successfully used to exon
   capture the targeted loci in 121 flower fly species across the different
   subfamilies of Syrphidae. We analysed different amino acid and
   nucleotide data sets (1302 loci and 154 loci) with maximum likelihood
   and multispecies coalescent models. Our analyses yielded highly
   supported similar topologies, although the degree of the SRH (global
   stationarity, reversibility and homogeneity) conditions varied greatly
   between amino acid and nucleotide data sets. The sisterhood of
   subfamilies Pipizinae and Syrphinae is supported in all our analyses,
   confirming a common origin of taxa feeding on soft-bodied arthropods.
   Based on our results, we define Syrphini stat.rev. to include the genera
   Toxomerus and Paragus. Our divergence estimate analyses with beast
   inferred the origin of the Syrphidae in the Lower Cretaceous (125.5-98.5
   Ma) and the diversification of predatory flower flies around the K-Pg
   boundary (70.61-54.4 Ma), coinciding with the rise and diversification
   of their prey.},

Title = {Why are there so many species of mining bees (Hymenoptera, Andrenidae)?
   The possible roles of phenology and Wolbachia incompatibility in
   maintaining species boundaries in the Andrena proxima-complex},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The factors leading to the extraordinary diversity of the bees of the
   genus Andrena Fabricius, the second most speciose genus among bees,
   remain largely unknown. To examine the pattern of diversification in
   this genus, we investigate species boundaries within the controversial
   Andrena proxima-complex using a dataset of ultra-conserved elements and
   various species delimitation analyses (admixture analyses, BPP, DAPC).
   Our results confirm the presence of three separate species in this
   species group (Andrena proxima (Kirby), A. ampla Warncke and A. alutacea
   Stockhert) and suggest very low levels of interspecific gene flow.
   Andrena proxima and A. alutacea are regularly found in sympatry,
   suggesting an advanced stage of speciation. By contrast, A. ampla shows
   a parapatric distribution with both other species. Andrena alutacea
   harbours a unique strain of Wolbachia Hertig, absent in the other two
   species, which are infected by the two same strains of Wolbachia. In
   addition, the three species have distinct phenologies, with A. proxima
   flying earlier in the season and A. alutacea significantly later; the
   phenology of A. ampla is intermediate. Our results suggest that
   Wolbachia-induced incompatibilities and phenological differences
   maintain species boundaries in this group. The most advanced stage of
   speciation is observed in the two species showing putatively
   incompatible strains of Wolbachia and strongly distinct phenologies, A.
   alutacea and A. proxima. We propose that the smaller differences in
   phenological differentiation between A. ampla and both other species may
   explain the observed pattern of parapatric distribution. We discuss how
   these factors may underlie the high diversification rate observed in
   other groups of Andrena, a genus characterized by particularly variable
   and short flying periods.},

Title = {Phylogenomic inference of two widespread European leaf miner species

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Leafmining insects have extraordinarily intimate relationships with
   their host plants and are therefore prime candidates for potential
   ecological speciation in sympatry, but how commonly this mode of
   speciation occurs in any group of life remains debated. Prior research
   on the pygmy moth (Nepticulidae) genus Ectoedemia using morphology, DNA
   barcoding, and multi-marker phylogenetic approaches left two unresolved
   species complexes, each with each four described species. In this study,
   we thoroughly sampled each complex across a range of host plants and
   localities across Europe. We used a double digest restriction-site
   associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach to clarify species
   boundaries. In the E. rubivora complex, ddRAD data resolved all four
   species, contrary to morphological and COI data, which supports a
   potential scenario of host plant-driven speciation where the host plant
   specialization provides an ecological barrier to hybridization. However,
   we found no indication of host race formation within the oligophagous E.
   atricollis (Stainton). In the E. subbimaculella complex, SNP data only
   partly distinguishes between the parapatric E. subbimaculella (Haworth)
   and E. heringi (Toll), but with some statistical overlap, suggesting
   incomplete lineage sorting which may represent early phases of
   host-based ecological speciation, or admixture following a period of
   isolation.},

Abstract = {Forest trees species are often genetically adapted to local
   environmental conditions. Therefore, local seeds are recommended for
   ecological restoration. However, seedlings of broad-leaved tree species,
   such as Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), are limited in their commercial
   seedling production in Japan. Thus, long-distance transfer of seeds
   and/or seedlings is common. F. crenata's distinct geographical structure
   is well known; large-scale seed transfer may increase the risk of
   genetic disturbance. Several provenance trials of the species revealed
   that phenotypic traits such as leaf area and bud flush date differed
   latitudinally and/or between the Pacific Ocean side and the Japan Sea
   side. We investigated leaf size and bud flush date and identified the
   chloroplast DNA haplotype of trees planted in two provenance trials
   established in Hokkaido, Japan. We then examined whether cpDNA haplotype
   information is useful as a proxy in ecological restoration when using
   seedlings with incomplete seed source information. This study indicated
   that suitable seedlings could be selected based on chloroplast DNA
   haplotype information in F. crenata in the case of incomplete seed
   source information.},

   regions, intraspecific functional variation in plantation tree species
   is of great importance to forest ecosystems. Intraspecific variation in
   plantation tree species can result from natural geographical and
   cultivated variation. A previous study estimated the effects of
   geographical variation of Cryptomeria japonica, the most dominant
   plantation tree in Japan. The results showed that the significant
   consequences for ecosystem processes, such as calcium (Ca) dynamics and
   community composition of soil invertebrates, vary among the geographical
   variation of C. japonica. However, no studies have shown the effect of
   cultivar variation of tree species on the soil invertebrate community
   through alteration of the availability of nutrients. In this study, we
   used a common garden where four cultivars of C. japonica (Kumotoshi,
   Aya, Obi, and Satsumameasa) were planted in separate plots. In these
   plots, we measured the concentration of nutrients in leaves, litter and
   roots, strontium isotope ratio (Sr-87/Sr-86) of leaves. Root activities,
   exchangeable nutrients in soil, and soil parameters such as soil pH and
   abundance and composition of soil invertebrates. Our results show that
   cultivating different varieties of C. japonica may alter the
   accumulation of Ca in soil and soil pH. Furthermore, the effects of the
   cultivated varieties of C. japonica shape the abundance and composition
   of soil invertebrates by altering the soil properties, such as Ca
   concentration and pH in the soil.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have severely degraded the ecological integrity
   of global freshwater systems. Migratory freshwater fishes are especially
   threatened by the cumulative effects of multiple stressors and
   fragmentation, particularly those that impede access to critical
   habitats. To stimulate the conservation and protection of these species,
   we propose a ``Global Swimways{''} program to identify rivers that
   support the migration routes of biologically and/or socioeconomically
   important freshwater fishes. We test the utility of the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature Red List data to support the
   identification of Global Swimways and present case study regions
   containing rivers with either high species richness (west-central Africa
   and Southeast Asia), high numbers of threatened species (Eastern Europe
   and Central Asia), or multiple endemic species (the Rift Valley lakes in
   East Africa). We hope the Global Swimways program will provide metrics
   that can be used to identify rivers requiring increased protection or
   restoration, track trends, and stimulate the greater inclusion of
   migratory freshwater fishes in global policy mechanisms. Front Ecol

Abstract = {In this paper, we study a stage-structured wild and sterile mosquito
   interaction impulsive model. The aim is to study the feasibility of
   controlling the population of wild mosquitoes by releasing sterile
   mosquitoes periodically. The existence of trivial periodic solutions is
   obtained, and the corresponding local stability and global stability
   conditions are proved by Floquet theory and Lyapunov stability theorem,
   respectively. And we prove the existence conditions of non-trivial
   periodic solutions and their local stability. We can find that the
   system has the bistable phenomenon in which the trivial periodic
   solution and the non-trivial periodic solution can coexist under certain
   threshold conditions. All the results show that the appropriate release
   period and release amount of sterile mosquitoes can control the wild
   mosquito population within a certain range and even make them extinct.
   Finally, numerical simulation verifies our theoretical results.},

Abstract = {The species endangerment listing process is governed not solely by
   causal factors but also by human perception, particularly as it relates
   to observability. Because human perception is important in species
   detection, we hypothesized that ecological indicators associated with
   human perception would change noticeably over time. Testing our
   hypothesis on species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, we
   found that - in general and across (not within) different taxa - body
   mass and geographic range of listed species decreased over time and that
   animals that produced vocalizations and exhibited grouping behavior were
   listed earlier than silent and solitary animals. Specifically, since the
   year of their listing, the body mass of birds, mammals, and reptiles
   decreased, whereas the body mass of amphibians increased; likewise, the
   geographic range of insects, mammals, and plants contracted, whereas the
   geographic range of amphibians, bivalves, birds, and fish slightly
   expanded. Our results demonstrate a temporal shift in endangered species
   listings, suggesting that approaches to listing species may need to be
   reevaluated and methodologically revised.},

Abstract = {Agricultural expansion is a primary driver of biodiversity decline in
   forested regions of the tropics. Consequently, it is important to
   understand the conservation value of remnant forests in production
   landscapes. In a tropical landscape dominated by oil palm (Elaeis
   guineensis), we characterized faunal communities across eight taxa
   occurring within riparian forest buffers, which are legally protected
   alongside rivers, and compared them to nearby recovering logged forest.
   Buffer width was the main predictor of species richness and abundance,
   with widths of 40-100 m on each side of the river supporting broadly
   equivalent levels of biodiversity as compared to logged forest. However,
   width responses varied markedly among taxa, and buffers often lacked
   forest-dependent species. Much wider buffers than are currently mandated
   are needed to safeguard most species. The largest biodiversity gains are
   achieved by increasing relatively narrow buffers. To provide optimal
   conservation outcomes in tropical production landscapes, we encourage
   policy makers to prescribe width requirements for key taxa and different
   landscape contexts.},

Abstract = {Species that are dispersed across oceanic islands can have strong
   population structure due to genetic isolation, which makes it difficult
   to determine realistic and meaningful species boundaries. This becomes
   especially problematic when pest species are involved, and can result in
   undetected new invasions. The mango fruit fly, Bactrocera frauenfeldi
   (Schiner), is currently considered to be one of five morphologically
   similar members in a monophyletic species group distributed across
   Southeast Asia, Australasia, and Oceania, including three major pests.
   We used a phylogenomic approach with highly multiplexed amplicon
   sequencing to test species limits and evaluate the relationships among
   species in the B. frauenfeldi species complex and two closely related
   species. We obtained sequence data from 196 specimens for 395 nuclear
   DNA loci, totalling 102 kb, of which 2.2 kb were parsimony informative
   sites. Based on morphology, biogeography, and phylogenetic analyses, we
   conclude that there are five distinct species in the complex in our
   phylogeny. Our results show that the morphological differences between
   B. frauenfeldi and B. albistrigata (de Meijere) are part of a continuum
   that cannot be phylogenetically separated into monophyletic groups. We
   therefore synonymize the names of two major pests: B. albistrigata syn.
   rev. with B. frauenfeldi, making B. frauenfeldi now recognized as a
   widespread pest across Australasia and Southeast Asia. We evaluated the
   use of COI for pest recognition and conclude that it cannot reliably
   distinguish between six of the seven species we studied, thus new
   molecular approaches will be necessary for effective management and the
   prevention of incursions.},

Title = {Modularity in the trilobite head consistent with the hypothesized

Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {177-188},

Abstract = {The trilobite head served multiple functions and was composed of several
   fused segments. Yet, the underlying organization of the trilobite head,
   and whether patterns are conserved across trilobites, remains unclear.
   Modeling the head as being composed of modules, or subunits that vary
   and thus have the potential to evolve semi-independently can reveal
   underlying patterns of organization. Hypotheses of modular organization
   based on the comparative developmental biology of arthropods were
   evaluated using geometric morphometrics. Two-dimensional (semi)landmark
   datasets collected from the cranidia of two Ordovician trilobite
   species, Calyptaulax annulata (Phacopida) and Cloacaspis senilis
   (Olenida sensu Adrain, 2011) were analyzed. The degree and pattern of
   modularity were assessed using the covariance ratio (CR), which compares
   the covariation within putative modules to the covariation between them,
   and the fit of different models was compared using an effect size
   measure derived from the CR. When treating the eyes as a distinct
   module, the best modular hypothesis identified for C. annulata shows the
   eyes and anteriormost region of the head integrated as a single module.
   The best modular hypotheses for C. senilis are more complex but the eyes
   still covary mostly strongly with the anterior part of the head. The
   latter is also the case for all other well-supported models for both
   species. These results can be interpreted as a developmental signal
   corresponding to the anteriormost ocular segment of early arthropods
   that is retained throughout development, despite any likely selective
   pressures related to functional needs.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems around the globe are facing irreversible impacts due to
   climate change, habitat destruction, hunting, and an ever-increasing
   human population. Estimating densities of species across their
   geographical range helps us to understand natural variation and
   anthropogenic effects on species densities and to assess the
   effectiveness of existing conservation measures. Various methods have
   been used to produce accurate and precise population density estimates,
   each with associated limitations. Acoustic surveys for species producing
   loud calls have become common due to their ease of use, low cost, and
   reduced timescale. Relative to many other mammal taxa, primate species
   have been studied extensively, producing a wealth of data on
   socioecology and behavior, but for most species, density estimates over
   large geographical ranges are still lacking. We used an acoustic spatial
   capture-recapture model to estimate group density of unhabituated
   Thomas' langurs (Presbytis thomasi), a primate endemic to the Indonesian
   island of Sumatra, over a 60 km(2) area of lowland dipterocarp forest.
   We then assessed if vegetation structure and distance from human
   habitation affected density estimates. Estimates of group density
   differed almost threefold between survey locations (from 2.79 to 8.08
   groups/km(2)); there was no clear relationship with forest structure,
   but there was a significantly positive relationship between group
   density and distance from human habitation, with an increase of 0.38
   groups/km(2) for every km of distance. Although large-scale logging
   within the Sikundur region ceased similar to 30 years ago, the impacts
   of logging continue to have detrimental effects on the species within
   the area.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the forest dynamics and carbon sequestration
   abilities of, as well as the influences of sea-level rise on,
   Micronesian mangrove forests as revealed from long-term studies (more
   than 25 years). Monitoring surveys of the permanent plots in the area's
   major mangrove communities revealed that the tree density decreased,
   while aboveground biomass increased. However, in the Rhizophora stylosa
   community characterized by densely developed stilt roots, the
   aboveground biomass temporarily decreased due to a decrease in old stilt
   roots, but it increased again by generating a large amount of new stilt
   roots. The highest aboveground biomass was estimated to be 895 Mg
   ha(-1), which is the highest value of all the existing ground survey
   data from the tropics. Mangrove peat was deposited in the entire
   mangrove area, but its thickness differed according to the forest
   community, which indicated that the belowground stored carbon also
   differed depending on the community. In recent years, a rise in sea
   level exceeding 5 mm year(-1) was observed in this region, and surface
   erosion occurred in the Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Sonneratia alba
   communities. On the other hand, in the R. stylosa and Rhizophora
   apiculata communities, the ground level rose due to the accumulation of
   mangrove peat. The temporal decrease in old stilt roots and the
   accelerated increase in new stilt roots observed in the R. stylosa
   community may also be an effect of sea-level rise. Long-term monitoring
   surveys in mangrove forests are thus effective in quickly catching the
   effects of sea-level rise.},

Abstract = {Nonconsumptive effects (NCE) from natural enemy presence are known to
   change the behavior, morphology, and development of potential victims.
   However, the overwhelming majority of these studies focus on predation,
   documenting changes in prey behavior; far less is understood about
   parasitism risk and impacts on host physiology. We used the caterpillar
   Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) and two of its main natural
   enemies-a specialist parasitoid (wasp), Cotesia congregata (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae), and a generalist predator (soldier bug), Podisus
   maculiventris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)-to determine how the threat of
   parasitism and predation during larval development alter prey growth and
   immunity. Caterpillars developing near female predators and parasitoids
   were similar to 85\% larger compared to individuals without enemy
   exposure. Development time was not affected by natural enemies when
   compared to controls, but male P. maculiventris slowed M. sexta
   development compared to the other natural enemies. For immune
   functionality, phenoloxidase (PO) activity only responded to
   parasitoids, with wasp-exposed caterpillars exhibiting 35\% lower PO
   activity than all other treatments, while lysozyme activity was
   unaffected by any enemy treatment. This work emphasizes that parasites
   can induce changes to host immunity that potentially affect wasp
   development. More broadly, NCEs on victim immunity are likely given
   immunity's contribution to host defense but have been under-appreciated
   compared to more easily observed phenotypes like behavior and
   morphology.},

Title = {Variation in abundance of trees originating from sapling banks

Abstract = {The contribution of sapling banks to the coexistence of species with
   different shade tolerance under the ``wave regeneration{''} regime has
   not been researched extensively. This study first assessed spatial and
   temporal variations in the relative dominance of two Abies species,
   Abies veitchii and Abies mariesii, with different shade tolerance in a
   wave-regenerated forest. Second, we present the age structure and its
   spatial variation in young Abies stands (sapling stage) to exhibit the
   prevalence and variability of regeneration from sapling banks (defined
   as trees established 10 years before canopy opening). The relative
   dominance of A. mariesii, the more shade-tolerant species, compared to
   that of A. veitchii, did not change over a period of 10 years,
   irrespective of stand developmental stages, indicating the importance of
   initial dominance in determining the local species composition. The tree
   ages at the sapling stage were significantly higher for A. mariesii than
   for A. veitchii. Approximately, 30\% of all trees were likely to arise
   from a sapling bank, and 86\% of them were A. mariesii. Age structure
   significantly varied between 5 x 5 m quadrats; some quadrats were
   dominated by A. mariesii originating from sapling banks, while others
   were dominated by A. veitchii that were established at the time of
   canopy opening. These results indicate that regeneration from sapling
   banks contributes to the dominance of A. mariesii and that the spatial
   variation in the abundance of trees originating from sapling banks is
   essential for the coexistence of A. mariesii with A. veitchii.},

Abstract = {Species invasion in conventional ecosystems is an impedance to ecosystem
   management. The extensive invasion of American bullfrogs (Lithobates
   catesbeiana) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is seriously
   harmful to aquatic systems worldwide, including Japan. In recent years,
   the methods involving environmental DNA (eDNA) have significantly
   contributed to the detection of invasive alien species. These methods
   for the above two species had already been developed in previous studies
   overseas, but could be unsuitable for detection of the species in Japan
   due to matching of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers with the
   sequence of the co-existing species. The present study developed two
   eDNA detection methods for L. catesbeiana and P. clarkii in Japanese
   habitats. The eDNA of both invasive alien species was detected in all
   ponds where they had been captured and observed. A positive relationship
   was elucidated between the traditional survey (i.e., frog male calling
   detection or direct catch) and the presence or concentration of eDNA.
   The eDNA method applied in this study could be useful for monitoring the
   distribution of L. catesbeiana and P. clarkii in Japan.},

Title = {Genetic diversity and population history of the Japanese black bear
   (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) based on the genome-wide analyses},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {37},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) is a subspecies of
   the Asian black bear endemic to Mainland Japan. It has been reported
   that the extant Japanese bear population is genetically differentiated
   into several geographically restricted clusters with an estimated
   divergence time of 100,000-500,000 years ago. The ancestral population
   of the Japanese black bear migrated from the continent to the Japanese
   archipelago in the Pleistocene, and no interaction between continental
   and Japanese bear populations after their migration has been speculated.
   However, most of the previous studies are based only on mitochondrial
   DNA. Here, we sequenced the genome of a Japanese black bear and compared
   it with that of other Ursus individuals to evaluate the genetic status
   of this subspecies. We suggest that the Japanese black bear population
   is genetically almost uniform and has been structured only in recent
   30,000 years. This inconsistency between mitochondria and nuclear DNA
   may be explained by the female philopatry and male-mediated gene flow of
   this species. We also suggest ancestral admixture between the Japanese
   black bear and the Ussuri black bear (Ursus thibetanus ussuricus),
   implying a complex history of inter-subspecies interactions of the
   Japanese black bears. Genomic evidence of ancient admixture between the
   Asian black bear and the American black bear (Ursus americanus) sheds
   new light on the population history of the Asian black bears. The
   genetic diversity of the Japanese black bears is remarkably lower
   compared to thaother bear populations, and conservation of this
   subspecies is an urgent issue.},

Abstract = {The US federal government has implemented a variety of policies and
   subsidies that help coastal development remain viable, including
   investments in risk reduction measures, subsidized flood insurance, and
   post-disaster assistance. In this study, we explored how the removal of
   federal subsidies impacts coastal development patterns by measuring the
   causal effect of the US Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) on building
   activity. Implemented in 1982, CBRA withdrew eligibility for federal
   funding for infrastructure, post-disaster assistance, and subsidized
   flood insurance along designated sections of coastal barriers ({''}CBRA
   units{''}). Using a novel built-structures dataset, we employed a
   spatial regression discontinuity design to compare development rates
   within and outside of CBRA units in 1980 and 2016. We found that
   enactment of the CBRA has resulted in significant reductions in
   development activity: indeed, development rates were reduced by more
   than 75\% in CBRA areas as compared to non-CBRA areas. Our findings
   suggest that policies like CBRA can be effective at slowing development
   in other sensitive or hazardous areas, and could help to preserve
   natural environments for habitat conservation and climate adaptation
   purposes.},

Abstract = {Finding food is a key motivator of animal behavior and underpins an
   increasing number of conservation and wildlife management challenges.
   Introduced predators threaten many vulnerable native species, and some
   native predators are problematic for declining prey species. Likewise,
   browsing by native and introduced herbivores threatens endangered plant
   species, undermines habitat restoration efforts, and alters plant
   communities. Mammalian predators and herbivores use olfactory
   information to forage efficiently, pursuing cues that are useful and
   ignoring those that are not. Here, we present the theoretical basis for
   why olfactory misinformation should alter foraging decisions and provide
   compelling evidence that supports the theory. Drawing on this theory and
   evidence of the success of olfactory misinformation where it has been
   applied to date, we propose that there is enormous scope for its
   application more broadly in conservation and wildlife management. Such
   an approach offers a robust behavioral alternative for protecting valued
   plants and prey species that are otherwise vulnerable to foraging
   mammals.},

Abstract = {Soil respiration is one of the most important operations controlling
   carbon (C) erosion from territorial ecosystems and a useful index of
   whole underground allocation of C and stand efficiency. However, how
   tree species effects root (i.e., autotrophic respiration) and soil
   microbial respiration (i.e., heterotrophic respiration), based on
   precise experiential schemes, are still restricted, even though crucial
   to guide the selection of species for reforestation and C management
   purposes. This research was done to study how tree species effect soil
   characteristics and function at stand level and which are the main
   drivers of soil CO2 emission in mixed temperate forests in northern Iran
   (Mazandaran province). Four most common tree species at the experimental
   site (Parrotia persica, Ulmus minor, Quercus castaneifolia, and Populus
   caspica) that surrounded by same species, were selected. Around each
   selected tree, four replicates of soil and litter samples were taken
   from (30 x 30 x 15 cm) and mixed to characterize soil physicochemical
   characteristics (i.e., bulk density, texture, water content, pH,
   electrical conductivity, N, organic carbon, and available P, K, Mg, and
   Ca), basal respiration and substrate (i.e., D-manitol, D-glucose,
   L-asparagine, L-arginine, gluconic acid, quinic acid, succinic acid,
   malonic acid, D-glucosamine, L-glutamine) induced respiration. In the
   litter characteristics, total N, C (OC), and C/N ratio were measured.
   Our results confirmed that soil chemical properties are more sensitive
   to species composition than soil physical ones. Moreover, individual
   tree species in mixed deciduous forests strongly influence induced
   microbial respiration, independently of the used substrates. On the
   contrary, season was the major factor explaining variations of basal
   respiration.},

Abstract = {Division of the dentition into morphologically distinct classes of teeth
   (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) and the acquisition of
   tribosphenic molars facilitated precise occlusion between the teeth
   early in mammal evolution. Despite the evolutionary and ecological
   importance of distinct classes of teeth with unique cusp, crest, and
   basin morphologies, relatively little is known about the genetic basis
   for the development of different tooth classes within the embryo. Here
   we investigated genetic differences between developing deciduous
   incisor, canine, and premolar teeth in the domestic cat (Felis catus),
   which we propose to be a new model for tooth development. We examined
   differences in both developmental timing and crown morphology between
   the three tooth classes. Using RNA sequencing of early bell stage tooth
   germs, we showed that each of the three deciduous tooth classes possess
   a unique transcriptional profile. Three notable groups of genes emerged
   from our differential expression analysis; genes involved in the
   extracellular matrix (ECM), Wnt pathway signaling, and members of
   multiple homeobox gene families (Lhx, Dlx, Alx, and Nkx). Our results
   suggest that ECM genes may play a previously under-appreciated role in
   shaping the surface of the tooth crown during development. Differential
   regulation of these genes likely underlies differences in tooth crown
   shape and size, although subtle temporal differences in development
   between the tooth germs could also be responsible. This study provides
   foundational data for future experiments to examine the function of
   these candidate genes in tooth development to directly test their
   potential effects on crown morphology.},

Title = {Integration of mitogenomic and morphological data disentangles the
   systematics of Pollenia and establishes a revised phylogenetic
   hypothesis for the Polleniidae},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {296-315},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Polleniidae (Diptera) are a family of flies best known for species
   of the genus Pollenia, which overwinter inside human dwellings.
   Previously divided across the Calliphoridae, Tachinidae and
   Rhinophoridae, the polleniid genera have only recently been united.
   Several studies have utilized molecular data to analyse polleniid
   phylogenetic relationships, although all have suffered from low taxon
   sampling or insufficient phylogenetic signal in molecular markers. To
   alleviate these problems, we utilized two automated organellar genome
   extraction software, GetOrganelle and MitoFinder, to assemble
   mitogenomes from genome skimming data from 22 representatives of the
   polleniid genera: Dexopollenia, Melanodexia, Morinia, Pollenia and
   Xanthotryxus. From these analyses, we provide 14 new mitogenomes for the
   Polleniidae and perform phylogenetic analyses of 13 protein-coding
   mitochondrial genes using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference. Subfamilial phylogenetic relationships within the Polleniidae
   are interrogated and Pollenia is found to form a monophyletic clade
   sister to Melanodexia, Morinia and Dexopollenia, providing no evidence
   for the synonymisation of any of these genera. Our topology conflicts
   with previous morphology-based cladistic interpretations, with the
   amentaria, griseotomentosa, semicinerea and viatica species-groups
   resolving as non-monophyletic. We provide support for our topology
   through analysis of adult morphology and male and female terminalia,
   while identifying new diagnostic characters for some of the clades of
   the Pollenia. To test the validity of the current diagnostic morphology
   in the Polleniidae, newly assembled cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
   data are combined with a polleniid COI barcode reference library and
   analysed using the species delimitation software ASAP. COI barcodes
   support the current morphologically defined species within the Pollenia.},

Title = {Prescribed take levels of downy and hairy woodpeckers in the eastern
   United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hairy (Dryobates villosus) and downy (Dryobates pubescens) woodpeckers
   occur in high densities in residential areas of the eastern United
   States. In many areas of their range, they cause damage to wooden
   structures through foraging, excavation of nesting cavities, and
   drumming behaviors, causing requests for allowable take permits. Both
   species hold year-round territories, which could make them vulnerable to
   local extirpation with excess take. To meet the requirements of the
   Migratory Bird Treaty act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
   (USFWS) requested scientifically informed evaluation of take to minimize
   population effects as part of its approach to reduce human-wildlife
   conflict. We used a prescribed take approach, which uses data from
   population, demographic, and management parameter estimates to determine
   the allowable take from Louisiana to Minnesota and all states east.
   Furthermore, we used 2 different methods of estimating growth rates to
   control for demographic uncertainties. The resulting estimates provide
   take at the state and USFWS regional scales to improve stakeholder
   choices when setting allowable take. Current authorized take (2016-2018)
   is below the take that could be sustained by current populations, and
   current rates of take are not likely to cause population-level effects.
   These results were largely consistent across methodologies for
   calculating the rate of growth for both species. Take still needs to be
   managed to prevent local extirpation of these resident species.
   Allowable take estimates should be periodically updated to reflect
   changing management and population needs for both species.},

Title = {Origins of harvested American black ducks: stable isotopes support the
   flyover hypothesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Waterfowl management is more effective when based on detailed
   information on population connectivity between breeding, wintering, and
   stopover sites. For the American black duck (Anas rubripes), a species
   of conservation concern, estimates for the fall age ratio at harvest
   differed depending on whether harvest data were derived from Canada or
   the United States, suggesting regional differences. Within Canada,
   hunters in Atlantic Canada were more likely to harvest black ducks from
   nearby breeding locations compared to hunters in southern Ontario and
   Quebec, Canada, who were more likely to harvest individuals from the
   Boreal Softwood and Taiga Shield of eastern Canada. Black ducks
   harvested in the United States are thought to originate predominantly
   from northern portions of the breeding range, leading to the flyover
   hypothesis, which postulates that black ducks produced in the Boreal
   Softwood and Taiga Shield region are less susceptible to harvest by
   hunters in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. To test the
   flyover hypothesis, we examined regional and temporal differences in the
   origins of harvested black ducks using feathers from wings (n = 664)
   submitted by hunters to the species composition and parts collection
   surveys across 3 hunting seasons (2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020). We
   used a likelihood-based assignment method that relied on feather
   stable-hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) and stable-carbon isotopes (delta
   C-13) to determine the natal or molt origin of individuals harvested
   within eastern Canada and the United States. We also used a spatial
   clustering technique to group harvested individuals by area of origin
   without a priori knowledge of such regions. Adult female black ducks
   originated farther south compared to males and juveniles. All sexes and
   ages of black ducks harvested in Atlantic Canada showed predominantly
   southern origins, while those harvested in the United States and other
   Canadian provinces primarily originated farther north within the boreal,
   supporting the flyover hypothesis. By contrast, we found no relationship
   between timing of harvest or peaks of migration and individual origin.
   After combining band returns and stable isotopes, we inferred 2 distinct
   stocks: the Mississippi flyway stock and the Atlantic flyway stock. We
   recommend that regional demographic parameters, particularly for
   Atlantic Canada, be directly measured to promote more effective
   conservation of black ducks and optimize harvest opportunities in the
   United States and Canada.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {86},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding habitat selection by breeding birds and their newly
   fledged young can be an essential aspect of the conservation of
   vulnerable species. During 2015-2017, we examined nest site selection of
   Worthington's marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris griseus) and
   MacGillivray's seaside sparrow (Ammospiza maritima macgillivraii), and
   fledgling habitat use by Worthington's marsh wren, 2 imperiled species
   in northeast Florida, USA. We compared vegetation at unused points to
   vegetation at nests of both subspecies and at locations used by
   radio-tagged marsh wren fledglings. Vegetation was taller and stem
   counts were greater at nest sites compared to unused points.
   Worthington's marsh wrens also used nest sites with a greater proportion
   of tall-form smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) than was observed
   at unused points. Worthington's marsh wren fledglings also used
   locations with taller, denser vegetation, but vegetation use changed
   with fledgling age and tidal stage; older fledglings more frequently
   used areas with short-form smooth cordgrass and bare ground (and more so
   during low tides). In contrast, so few nests and nestlings were in black
   needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) that we could not consider it in our
   analysis despite its prevalence within our study sites. Our results
   indicate that tall, dense cordgrass is an important habitat component
   for these subspecies during the nesting and fledgling life stages in
   southeastern Atlantic salt marshes.},

Title = {Massive gene rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes and implications

Abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used for phylogenetic
   reconstruction and evolutionary analysis in various groups of Insecta.
   Gene rearrangements in the mitogenome can be informative characters for
   phylogenetic reconstruction and adaptive evolution. Trichoptera is one
   of the most important groups of aquatic insects. Prior to this study,
   complete mitogenomes from Trichoptera were restricted to eight families,
   resulting in a biased view of their mitogenome structure and evolution.
   Here, we assemble new mitogenomes for 66 species by high-throughput
   sequencing. The mitogenomes of 19 families and 47 genera are documented
   for the first time. Combined with 16 previously published mitogenomes of
   Trichoptera, we find 14 kinds of gene rearrangement patterns novel for
   Trichoptera, including rearrangement of protein-coding genes, tRNAs and
   control regions. Simultaneously, we provide evidence for the occurrence
   of tandem duplication and non-random loss events in the mitogenomes of
   three families. Phylogenetic analyses show that Hydroptilidae was
   recovered as a sister group to Annulipalpia. The increased nucleotide
   substitution rate and adaptive evolution may have affected the
   mitochondrial gene rearrangements in Trichoptera. Our study offers new
   insights into the mechanisms and patterns of mitogenome rearrangements
   in Insecta at large and into the usefulness of mitogenomic gene order as
   a phylogenetic marker within Trichoptera.},

Title = {Maritime midge radiations in the Pacific Ocean (Diptera: Chironomidae)},

Volume = {48},

Pages = {111-126},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maritime chironomid midges (Diptera) are diverse, yet these `pearls of
   the ocean' are little known. Emphasizing Pacific Ocean taxa, we used six
   genetic markers (18S, 28S, CAD1, CAD4, FolCOI and COI) and fossil
   calibrations to produce Bayesian time-calibrated phylogenies to date
   eight independent marine transitions in three subfamilies. Deep nodes
   involve subfamily Telmatogetoninae (originating mid-Cretaceous, 101-128,
   114 Ma), with sister genera Telmatogeton Schiner and Thalassomya Schiner
   splitting later in the Cretaceous (56-82, 69 Ma). Two transitions in
   Orthocladiinae involve Clunio Haliday and Pseudosmittia Edwards, dating
   from the upper Cretaceous, both with Eocene crown groups. In subfamily
   Chironominae, transitions to marine occur in two tribes. Four
   transitions occur within the otherwise nonmarine crown groups
   Kiefferulus Goetghebuer, Dicrotendipes Kieffer, Polypedilum Kieffer and
   Ainuyusurika Sasa \& Shirasaka. Two separate robust clades in tribe
   Tanytarsini involve: (1) a minor radiation within Paratanytarsus dated
   to the mid-Eocene around 43 Ma; and (2) an unexpected but fully
   supported diversification in Pontomyia Edwards plus Yaetanytarsus Sasa
   dated to around 47 Ma, with separation of Pontomyia from Yaetanytarsus
   around 40 Ma. Crown Pontomyia, represented by three species, was
   estimated to have diverged around 19 Ma, whereas the crown radiation of
   Yaetanytarsus, with 12 sampled species, dates to the mid-Eocene. In a
   comprehensive global review we concisely document new synonymies and new
   combinations revealed by the study. The evolutionary timing estimate
   provides insights into the frequency of marine transitions and
   diversifications in the Chironomidae in association with dynamic oceanic
   changes during the Oligocene and Miocene.},

Title = {On the hormonal control of posterior regeneration in the annelid

Abstract = {Regeneration is the process by which many animals are able to restore
   lost or injured body parts. After amputation of the posterior part of
   its body, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is able to regenerate the
   pygidium, the posteriormost part of its body that bears the anus, and a
   subterminal growth zone containing stem cells that allows the subsequent
   addition of new segments. The ability to regenerate their posterior part
   (posterior regeneration) is promoted, in juvenile worms, by a hormone
   produced by the brain and is lost when this hormonal activity becomes
   low at the time the worms undergo their sexual maturation. By
   characterizing posterior regeneration at the morphological and molecular
   levels in worms that have been decapitated, we show that the presence of
   the head is essential for multiple aspects of posterior regeneration, as
   well as for the subsequent production of new segments. We also show that
   methylfarnesoate, the molecule proposed to be the brain hormone, can
   partially rescue the posterior regeneration defects observed in
   decapitated worms. Our results are therefore consistent with a key role
   of brain hormonal activity in the control of regeneration and growth in
   P. dumerilii, and support the hypothesis of the involvement of
   methylfarnesoate in this control.},

Title = {Vegetation history of Cryptomeria japonica in Japan since the last

Abstract = {The natural distribution of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) has
   been disturbed by human activities, owing mainly to its value as timber;
   thus, its position in the vegetation zone of Japan is not clear.
   Therefore, it is important to determine the history of C. japonica
   forests before human influence. We reviewed the transitions in
   distribution and abundance of C. japonica in the Japanese Archipelago
   since the last interglacial period by using published pollen data.
   During the last interglacial, temperate deciduous broadleaf forests
   developed on northeastern Honshu Island, whereas on southwestern Honshu
   Island C. japonica populations increased, accompanied by warm-temperate
   evergreen broadleaf trees. During the first half of the last glacial
   period, C. japonica forests developed throughout the Japanese
   Archipelago except on Hokkaido. Thereafter, 60,000-30,000 years ago, C.
   japonica covered the area around Lake Biwa and the Izu Peninsula. During
   the Last Glacial Maximum, C. japonica was most abundant on the Izu
   Peninsula, and small refugial populations were located along the coast
   of the Sea of Japan from southwestern to northeastern Honshu, and along
   the Pacific coast of Shikoku Island. During the Middle Holocene, C.
   japonica populations increased rapidly in southwestern Honshu. Two
   thousand years ago, before the intensification of human activities, C.
   japonica was widespread in warm- to cool-temperate zones on the Sea of
   Japan side of Honshu, the Izu Peninsula, the Pacific coast of Shikoku
   Island, and Yakushima Island. This evidence indicates that C. japonica
   is one of the major tree species in the Japanese vegetation zone.},

Title = {Is there a loophole in Dollo's law? A DevoEvo perspective on
   irreversibility (of felid dentition)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL
   EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 29},
Abstract = {There is a longstanding interest in whether the loss of complex
   characters is reversible (so-called ``Dollo's law{''}). Reevolution has
   been suggested for numerous traits but among the first was Kurten, who
   proposed that the presence of the second lower molar (M-2) of the
   Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) was a violation of Dollo's law because all
   other Felids lack M-2. While an early and often cited example for the
   reevolution of a complex trait, Kurten and Werdelin used an ad hoc
   parsimony argument to support their. Here I revisit the evidence that
   M-2 reevolved lynx using explicit parsimony and maximum likelihood
   models of character evolution and find strong evidence that Kurten and
   Werdelin were correct-M-2 reevolved in E. lynx. Next, I explore the
   developmental mechanisms which may explain this violation of Dollo's law
   and suggest that the reevolution of lost complex traits may arise from
   the reevolution of cis-regulatory elements and protein-protein
   interactions, which have a longer half-life after silencing that protein
   coding genes. Finally, I present a developmental model to explain the
   reevolution M-2 in E. lynx, which suggest that the developmental
   programs required for the establishment of serially homologous
   characters may never really be lost so long as a single instance of the
   character remains-thus the gain and loss and regain of serially
   homologous characters, such mammalian molars, may be developmentally and
   evolutionarily ``simple.{''}},

Abstract = {Yak has evolved specific adaptative mechanisms to high-altitude
   environment. Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation
   in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and
   transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle
   tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan
   cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs
   potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis.
   Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly
   involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood
   pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA
   repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes
   associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle,
   suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes. Overall, the
   present study contributes basic data at the DNA methylation level to
   further understand the physiological metabolism in yak.},

Abstract = {Averting human-induced extinctions will require strong policy
   commitments that comprehensively address threats to species. A new
   Global Biodiversity Framework is currently being negotiated by the
   world's governments through the Convention on Biological Diversity. Here
   we explored how the suggested targets in this framework could contribute
   to reducing threats to threatened vertebrates, invertebrates, and
   plants, and assessed the importance of a proposed target to implement
   recovery actions for threatened species. Although many of the targets
   benefit species, we found that extinction risk for over half (57\%) of
   threatened species would not be reduced sufficiently without a target
   promoting recovery actions, including ex situ conservation,
   reintroductions, and other species-specific interventions. A median of
   54 threatened species per country require such actions, and most
   countries of the world hold such species. Preventing future
   human-induced extinctions requires policy commitments to implement
   targeted recovery actions for threatened species in addition to broader
   efforts to mitigate threats, underpinned by transformative change.},

Title = {Defensive spines are associated with large geographic range but not
   diversification in spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Several prominent evolutionary theories propose mechanisms whereby the
   evolution of a defensive trait or suite of traits causes significant
   shifts in species diversification rate and niche evolution. We
   investigate the role of cuticular spines, a highly variable
   morphological defensive trait in the hyperdiverse ant genus Polyrhachis,
   on species diversification and geographic range size. Informed by key
   innovation theory and the escape-and-radiate hypothesis, we predicted
   that clades with longer spines would exhibit elevated rates of
   diversification and larger range sizes compared to clades with shorter
   spines. To address these predictions, we estimated phylogenetic
   relationships with a phylogenomic approach utilizing ultraconserved
   elements and compiled morphological and biogeographic trait databases.
   In contrast to the first prediction, we found no association between
   diversification rate and any trait (spine length, body size and range
   size), with the sole exception of a positive association between range
   size and diversification in one of three trait-based diversification
   analyses. However, we recovered a positive phylogenetic correlation
   between spine length and geographic range size, suggesting that spines
   promote expanded geographic range. Notably, these results were
   consistent across analyses using different phylogenetic inference
   approaches and spine trait measurement schemes. This study provides a
   rare investigation of the role of a defensive trait on geographic range
   size, and ultimately supports the hypothesis that defensive spines are a
   factor in increased range size in Polyrhachis ants. Furthermore, the
   lack of support for an association between spines and diversification,
   which contrasts with previous work demonstrating a positive association
   between spines and diversification rate, is intriguing and warrants
   further study.},

Abstract = {Every year, field excursions engage students of ecology in experiential
   learning that results in wide-ranging and well-documented pedagogical
   benefits. Much less appreciated, however, is the potential for these
   excursions to contribute long-term data that advance scientific
   knowledge and natural resource management. Here we explore this
   potential by providing a global synthesis of field data collection,
   mapping the geography, temporal extent, and type of data collected by
   students worldwide, and calling attention to the associated benefits and
   challenges for course instructors. We then offer perspectives on how
   undergraduate courses in ecology can more broadly contribute to science,
   management, and policy. Finally, we highlight how several aspects -
   namely, existing frameworks, resources, and networks; enhanced

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Supporting and promoting invertebrate diversity within agricultural
   ecosystems has numerous benefits, including the provision of pollination
   services. Many insects, including wild pollinators, require floral
   resources for food and structural habitat for nesting. To support
   pollinators, research studies and agri-environment schemes have sought
   to supplement floral resources, but little is known about the value of
   different types of nesting habitat enhancements (e.g., trap-nests or bee
   hotels). We deployed eight replicates of each of three types (bamboo
   reed, hardwood block and sand/cement brick) of trap-nests at five
   orchards in two apple and cherry growing regions (Bilpin and Orange) in
   Australia. Both reed and hardwood block trap-nests attracted a diverse
   array of invertebrates, such as ants, wasps, spiders and bees, including
   a cleptoparasitic bee species (Thyreus sp.) not previously recorded in
   the region. Interestingly, two taxa of native bees (Megachile
   {[}Megachile] and Megachile {[}Eutricharaea]) used the artificial nests
   and were also observed visiting apple crops. There were significantly
   more native bees using trap-nests in Orange (n = 65), where orchards are
   surrounded by agricultural landscapes, than in Bilpin (n = 2), where
   orchards are surrounded by native forests. Our findings show that
   artificial nest enhancements are used by native bees, as well as other
   nontarget invertebrate taxa, some of which can be predators of bees
   (ants, wasps, and spiders). Nesting habitat augmentation thus has
   potential to be used as a conservation tool, especially in areas where
   nesting sites are limited. However, future studies should also consider
   measures to reduce colonization by non-target taxa.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Allocation strategies of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)
   are key to the reproductive processes of plants. Nutrient allocation to
   seeds depends on defensive traits of seeds and fruit because greater
   nutritional contents attract more seed predators. To compare resource
   allocation strategies for reproductive and defensive traits across
   species, we calculated the cost of resource investment in reproductive
   organs for nine species from four genera and defensive traits for seven
   species from two genera of Fagaceae. The results showed that no single
   element is the common resource currency across species, but that the
   reproductive strategy of each species is regulated by C, N, or P.
   Reproduction in Fagus crenata was limited by N but not by C, whereas in
   Quercus serrata it was co-limited by C and N. Among the seven Fagaceae
   species, there was a negative correlation between the thickness of the
   pericarp and the concentration of the total phenolics in the seed and
   pericarp, suggesting alternative strategies for developing defensive
   traits in ripening seeds with limited C-based resources. Overall, our
   results highlighted the diversity of resource allocation strategies to
   reproduction and defensive traits of Fagaceae species. To better
   understand the masting phenomenon at the population or community levels,
   comprehensive consideration of the diversity of resource allocation
   strategies among species is worth exploring in the future.},

Title = {Generative production and evaluation of ornamental plant potential of an

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {420-433},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The flax genus consists of several natural species, which have the
   potential as ornamental plants for ecological landscape applications.
   Linum pamphylicum subsp. olympicum is an endemic, naturally occurring
   flax species that can only be found in Bursa, Turkey. The aim of the
   study is to examine the morphological and biological characteristics of
   L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum in relation to its cultivation and
   ornamental plant potential, and to reveal the best germination
   practices, as well as to establish an ex situ conservation garden.
   According to the results, in natural conditions, L. pamphylicum subsp.
   olympicum taxon forms a spreading habitus that is resistant to infertile
   and arid soil conditions. It covers the soil surface with an average
   width of 40.50 cm and average height of 16.63 cm foliage. It grows an
   average of 50.80 annual flowering branches. It is a natural taxon that
   draws attention with its bright yellow and long-lasting flowers.
   Germination of L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds suffers due to
   physical and physiological dormancy. By this study, the germination of
   L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds was improved up to 92.33\% by
   using 4000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatments. Both cold-wet
   stratifications with soaking in 4000 or 2000 ppm GA(3) provided the
   fastest germination speed of T-50 = 14 days. With the current study
   germination of L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds was improved
   significantly, the phenological and morphological characteristics were
   determined and a seed resource garden was established for ornamental
   plant studies.},

Title = {Applicability of the source-sink population concept to marine intertidal
   macro-invertebrates with planktonic larval stages},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Local populations of marine benthic macro-invertebrates with planktonic
   larvae are believed to be in source-sink relationships via larval
   dispersal in a regional population complex. Practically, such a region
   is definable only after connectivity of constituent local populations is
   explored. Numerical simulations abound for hydrodynamic connectivity by
   larvae between local/regional populations. Empirical studies have
   scarcely integrated inter-local connectivity and intra-local population
   dynamics into demographic connectivity analysis. I review the current
   research and indicate fundamental and technical problems to demonstrate
   that some source-sink systems in intertidal shores, which are most
   accessible among benthic habitats, are a good model. The challenge in
   benthic source-sink research comes from that existent local populations
   may not be self-sustaining because of low larval self-seeding rates
   and/or low benthos' survival rates and yet can persist as latent sinks.
   They may receive larvae leaking from sources at good-quality habitat
   patches with stationary larval retention areas for self-recruitment. On
   an intertidal sandflat in an estuary-coastal ocean region, Kyushu, Japan
   during 1979-2019, the population of a trochid gastropod with 3- to 9-day
   larval duration became extinct and recovered. The extinction was caused
   by sediment destabilization by a callianassid shrimp population which
   increased in the early 1980s. The gastropod recovery was owing to the
   shrimp decline by stingray predation and the transport of larvae from
   some self-sustainable populations with lower shrimp densities 30 km
   away. It was estimated that the gastropod population before the shrimp
   proliferation on that sandflat might be a latent sink requiring
   allochthonous larval subsidy due to epi-benthic predation on juveniles.},

Title = {Vegetation change on mountaintops in northern Sweden: Stable
   vascular-plant but reordering of lichen and bryophyte communities},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems harbor remarkably diverse and distinct plant
   communities that are characteristically limited to harsh, and cold
   climatic conditions. As a result of thermal limitation to species
   occurrence, mountainous ecosystems are considered to be particularly
   sensitive to climate change. Our understanding of the impact of climate
   change is mainly based on vascular plants however, whereas cryptogams
   (i.e., lichens and bryophytes) are generally neglected or simply
   considered as one functional group. Here we aimed to improve our
   understanding of the drivers underlying temporal changes in vegetation
   of alpine ecosystems. To this end, we repeatedly surveyed the vegetation
   on four mountain summits along an elevational gradient in northern
   Sweden spanning a 19-year period. Our results show that the vascular
   plant communities remained relatively stable throughout the study
   period, despite fluctuations in terms of ground cover and species
   richness of shrubs and graminoids. In contrast, both lichens and
   bryophytes substantially decreased in cover and diversity, leading to
   alterations in community composition that were unrelated to vascular
   plant cover. Thermophilization of the vascular plant community was found
   only on the two intermediate summits. Our findings are only partially
   consistent with (long-term) climate-change impacts, and we argue that
   local non-climatic drivers such as herbivory might offset vegetation
   responses to warming. Hence, we underline the importance of considering
   local non-climatic drivers when evaluating temporal vegetation change in
   biologically complex systems.},

Abstract = {In plants, processes from flowering to seed maturation are influenced by
   various factors, including weather conditions, resource supply, and
   damage inflicted by seed predators, that collectively contribute to
   annual variability in seed production. To identify the important factors
   associated with sound acorn production in Quercus serrata, from 2014 to
   2020, we investigated the demographic processes from flowering to acorn
   maturation in six individual trees within a stand in a warm-temperate
   secondary forest in western Japan. We found that the annual production
   of female flowers was positively correlated with the difference in April
   temperatures between successive years. However, their fluctuation was
   low and unaffected by either seed or flower production in the previous
   year. Compared with those of female flowers, the annual variability in
   sound acorn production within an individual was significantly higher and
   more synchronized. Key factor analyses revealed that reproductive losses
   due to the oviposition and sap-sucking activities of Mechoris ursulus
   were the most prominent factors contributing to the observed annual
   variation in total predispersal losses at an individual level, and their
   effects were synchronized among individuals within a population.
   Survival from female flowering to sound acorn maturation was strongly
   predicted by the temperature in June, which corresponds to the period of
   adult M. ursulus emergence. Our findings indicate that the damage
   inflicted by the main seed predator during the predispersal stage can
   sufficiently regulate the sound acorn production patterns in Q. serrata
   that appear to resemble masting behavior (the highly variable and
   synchronized production of acorns within individuals).},

Abstract = {The introduction of nonindigenous species (NIS) threatens global
   ecosystems and results primarily from human transportation and trade
   activities. Although some NIS can disperse immediately upon arrival (for
   example, mobile species), actual inoculation for other (sessile) species
   can require a reproductive event to produce propagules that disperse and
   establish. NIS reproductive potential, however, can vary with
   environmental conditions experienced during transit and upon arrival
   that differ substantially by route. We propose that variation in
   reproductive responses, both across species and transit routes, is a
   critical but overlooked driver of species invasions. We illustrate these
   concepts using vessel biofouling organisms, which are exposed to vastly
   different conditions during transport across the world's oceans. Current
   knowledge gaps prevent precise predictions of the potential for species
   to be introduced via reproduction. Integrating reproductive potential
   into management strategies is key to limiting NIS spread, particularly
   as climate change and novel events continue to alter global
   transportation networks. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Effective digital environmental communication is integral to galvanizing
   public support for conservation in the age of social media.
   Environmental advocates require messaging strategies suited to social
   media platforms, including ways to identify, target, and mobilize
   distinct audiences. Here, we provide - to the best of our knowledge -
   the first systematic characterization of environmental personas on
   social media. Beginning with 1 million environmental nongovernmental
   organization (NGO) followers on Twitter, of which 500,000 users met data
   quality criteria, we identified six personas that differ in their
   expression of 21 environmental issues. General consistency in the
   proportional composition of personas was detected across 14 countries
   with sufficiently large samples. Within the US, although the six
   personas varied in their mean political ideology, we did not observe
   that the personas split along political party lines. Our results pave
   the way for environmental advocates - including NGOs, public agencies,
   and researchers - to use audience segmentation methods like the methods
   discussed here to target and tailor messages to distinct constituencies
   at high speed and at large scale.},

Abstract = {The environment plays an important role in an individual's development
   during early life, however, parents may also influence offspring
   development through so called ``parental effects.{''} We examined the
   effects of environmental enrichment in zebrafish (Danio rerio) across
   two generations through the paternal lineage. Fathers and grandfathers
   were exposed to either standard or high levels of housing enrichment for
   4-weeks during adulthood. First-generation (F1) and second-generation
   (F2) offspring were obtained from controlled breeding and tested as
   larvae for changes in morphology at hatching stage (72hpf), and in
   locomotor activity at larval stage (120hpf) in both generations. We
   found paternal experience of enrichment resulted in changes in trunk
   length of F1 offspring and changes in spine curvature and dorsal length
   of F2 offspring, while changes in snout morphology of F2 offspring
   seemed to be driven by whether grandpaternal and paternal experience of
   the environment was matched or not. We found that while paternal
   enrichment increased the frequency of spontaneous movement in F1 and F2
   offspring, interacting effects of paternal and grandpaternal enrichment
   on movement distance were seen in F2 offspring, and that spontaneous
   movement and the distance that larvae swam are thus distinct phenotypes
   that were differentially affected by the experiences of previous
   paternal generations. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
   parental and grandparental environment influence zebrafish behavior and
   morphology. The nature of these effects and the design of this study
   mean that these phenotypes were likely the result of nongenetic
   transmission through the paternal germline.},

Abstract = {The chondrocranium is a key structure of the skull, but our knowledge of
   its embryonic development is based mostly on investigations of few
   stages across taxa. Variation of chondrocranial features is known across
   species, but little is known about intraspecific variation, or its
   evolution in the context of domestication. Here, we investigated two
   specific structures of the chondrocranium in three windows of embryonic
   development. The anatomy of one of these structures was also compared
   among adult skulls of chickens and their wild ancestor (red junglefowl
   {[}RJF]). The proccesus tectalis and the prenasal process, along with
   the surrounding area of the orbitonasal foramina, presented variation
   throughout the ontogeny and in the adults. The processus tectalis showed
   distinct variation from the earliest stage studied to the adult. The
   numbers of orbitonasal foramina were also found to be variable in the
   ancestor and breeds studied. Furthermore, during early embryonic
   development, the prenasal process is similar across breeds and RJF, but
   later in embryonic development this structure presents variable states.
   The embryonic and adult variation found herein could be an example of
   intraspecific variation under domestication, resulting from different
   types of tissue interrelationship during development.},

Abstract = {Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is commonly used in geological and
   paleontological research to extract organic fossils for morphological
   and chemical studies. However, during HF treatment, organic matter can
   also be altered, which raises concerns that HF-treated organic matter
   may not be representative of the original organic matter. To provide
   reference data for protein studies on fossils, herein, we use Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the effect of HF
   (21.3 M) treatment on keratins, with treatment durations ranging from 2
   to 48 h. Results show that the FTIR spectra of HF-treated samples are
   overall similar to that of the untreated sample, while curve fitting
   shows that HF treatment has led to alteration of the secondary structure
   in all the HF-treated samples and the effect is time-dependent. The 2-
   and 4-h treatment mainly reduced the content of the random coils,
   alpha-helix, and intermolecular beta-sheet. From 8h onwards, the content
   of random coils greatly increased at the expense of other structures.
   Our results imply that for protein detection in fossils using FTIR
   spectroscopy, the negative effect of HF treatment is not substantial, as
   the bands characteristic of proteins, that is, amide A, amide B, amide
   I, amide II, and amide III, are still present after the 48-h treatment.
   If the target is a secondary structure, the effect of HF treatment
   should be considered. When HF treatment is necessary, limiting the
   treatment duration to less than 4h may be a choice.},

Abstract = {Wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs), the juxtaposition of highly and
   minimally developed lands, are an increasingly prominent feature on
   Earth. WUIs are hotspots of environmental and ecological change that are
   often priority areas for planning and management. A better understanding
   of WUI dynamics and their role in the coupling between cities and
   surrounding wildlands is needed to reduce the risk of environmental
   hazards, ensure the continued provisioning of ecosystem services, and
   conserve threatened biodiversity. To fill this need, we propose an
   expanded framework for WUIs that not only conceptualizes these
   interfaces as emergent and functional components of socioecological
   processes but also extends them vertically from the bedrock to the top
   of the vegetation and horizontally across heterogeneous landscapes. This
   framework encourages management that reconciles pervasive trade-offs
   between development and resulting multiple environmental impacts.
   Focusing on southern California as a case study, we use the framework to
   facilitate integration across disciplines and between scientists and
   managers.},

Title = {A comprehensive overview of studies related to the ecology and genetics
   of Fagus crenata Blume (Siebold's beech, Japanese beech) at the species'
   northernmost range limit},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 9},
Abstract = {Temperate forest species, including Fagus crenata Blume, have been
   experiencing distributional shifts during the climate oscillation
   throughout the Holocene epoch. This review describes the distinctive
   context of F. crenata populations at the northern range from the
   perspective of past distribution shifts, future expansion predictions,
   biotic and abiotic interactions in population establishment, forest
   vegetation characteristics, and genetic diversity during the expansion
   process. The current northern distribution limit of F. crenata is in
   southern Hokkaido and Okushiri Islands. Since 1900, a dozen of northern
   limit hypotheses has advocated the presence of restriction factors;
   however, the species shows signs of expanding its habitat northward at
   present. The current northern limit is not determined by physiological
   limitations because of the fact that artificial plantations of F.
   crenata grow well beyond its range. Several studies regarding climate
   scenarios have predicted species persistence in the future. Sociological
   studies revealed that a decline in vegetation units is observed from the
   southern to the northern populations on the Oshima Peninsula, Hokkaido.
   Also, vegetation on Okushiri Island includes remnants of warm temperate
   flora indicating a physiographic constraint of the F. crenata forest on

   northern marginal populations were revealed to be established at the
   time of large forest disturbance. The genetic diversity of local
   populations has been lost during the northward distribution shift due to
   the founder effect in the colonizing process. Then, the gene flow from
   rearward populations has dwindled by the completion of the population
   establishment.},

Title = {Small farmlands can serve as open habitat for birds in subtropical

Abstract = {Greenspace or green cover is one of the major factors affecting urban
   avian diversity. In China, small farmlands producing vegetables are
   relatively common in cities. Although these farmlands could be a part of
   greenspaces, their habitat value for birds is rarely known. I
   investigated how these farmlands influenced winter bird community in two
   cities of southern China, using the multivariate latent variable model.
   I considered three green cover types: crop (mostly vegetables), weed
   (pioneer spontaneous vegetation), and wood (tree/shrub). I calculated
   the percentage of each green cover at local (50 m radius circular area)
   and landscape (500 m radius circular area) scales. Of 30 bird species,
   the abundance of 13 species decreased as crop cover decreased with
   increasing woody cover at the local scale, whereas the abundance of only
   two bird species increased with decreasing crop cover. Habitat
   preference of species mediated these responses, leading to a strong
   association between the open habit trait and the negative responses.
   Open habitat bird species richness was also negatively affected by
   decreasing local crop cover. Tree/shrub bird species richness showed a
   positive response to decreasing crop cover but the explanatory power of
   the local scale model was low. Variables at the landscape scale were
   rarely associated with species abundance or richness. These results
   suggest that small vegetable-dominant farmlands can serve as open
   habitat for birds in urban areas where greenspace largely consists of
   tree/shrub vegetation. The results also indicate that urban bird
   diversity is more influenced by local habitat features than
   landscape-scale features.},

Abstract = {Global climate changes of rising temperature are threatening food
   security by causing desertification in many arid and semi-arid regions.
   Morpho-physiological adaptations in xero-halophytes under extreme
   conditions such as high temperature, drought, and salinity could provide
   information for producing more resilient cash crops. This study examined
   seasonal variations in growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant defense,
   water, and ion relations of the xero-halophyte Salsola drummondii in its
   natural habitat. The resistance of Sa. drummondii to seasonal
   alterations was related to plant interactions with soil and atmosphere.
   Leaf succulence, organic weight, photosynthesis, water use efficiency,
   compatible solutes, and antioxidant enzyme activities correlated well
   with precipitation, soil moisture, and electrical conductivity.
   Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance increased during the monsoon
   period with low vapor pressure deficit and moderate temperature. Sa.
   drummondii responded to reduced water availability by decreasing leaf
   succulence, xylem pressure, and osmotic potentials like a typical C-4
   plant displaying water and energy-saving seasonal adjustment. C-4 mode
   of photosynthesis, higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and
   accumulation of compatible solutes could be involved in protection
   against photo-oxidative stress. This study highlights the importance of
   physiological and biochemical adaptations of Sa. drummondii to seasonal
   alterations in a salt desert and could serve as a model for future crop
   development in arid-saline habitats.},

Abstract = {For decades, knowledge about the endangered proboscis monkey was gleaned
   from limited information about their behavior from boat surveys
   conducted along riverbanks, where the monkeys rest during the early
   morning and late afternoon. This was due to the dense and swampy
   habitats they live in, which made them nearly impossible to track once
   they moved into inland forests. By conducting full-day continuous
   observations on foot in riverine forests in Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia,
   alongside my colleagues, we produced pioneering research about this
   species. Conducted over a period of more than 15 years since 2005, our
   studies have resulted in the comprehensive collection of information
   about the proboscis monkey with regards to its feeding and ranging
   behaviors as well as novel findings about its fascinating digestive
   strategy of rumination and the unique functionality of its

Abstract = {Latently infected CD4+ T cells represent one of the major obstacles to
   HIV eradication even after receiving prolonged highly active
   anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term use of HAART causes the
   emergence of drug-resistant virus which is then involved in HIV
   transmission. In this paper, we develop mathematical HIV models with
   staged disease progression by incorporating entry inhibitor and latently
   infected cells. We find that entry inhibitor has the same effect as
   protease inhibitor on the model dynamics and therefore would benefit HIV
   patients who developed resistance to many of current anti-HIV
   medications. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results
   and show that the virus and latently infected cells reach an infected
   steady state in the absence of treatment and are eliminated under
   treatment whereas the model including homeostatic proliferation of
   latently infected cells maintains the virus at low level during
   suppressive treatment. Therefore, complete cure of HIV needs complete
   eradication of latent reservoirs.},

Title = {Life-cycle control of 13-and 17-year periodical cicadas: A hypothesis
   and its implication in the evolutionary process},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Periodical cicadas of the genus Magicicada exhibit a spectacular
   life-cycle phenomenon, with periodic mass emergence being observed every
   13 or 17 years in the eastern United States. It is entirely unclear how
   their periodical life cycles are controlled. Here, I review previous
   knowledge and hypotheses about Magicicada life cycles and propose an
   integrated hypothesis of the life-cycle control mechanism, which
   includes critical body weight for adult metamorphosis, an internal
   4-year clock, associated 4-year gate in 4 x n years of age for the
   timing of the metamorphosis decision, and genetic differences in growth
   rates between 13- and 17-year cicada nymphs (the former is faster). If
   the last (fifth) instar nymphs reach critical body weight in any of the
   4-year gates (8, 12, 16, and 20 years of age, but not other years), they
   prepare for adult eclosion in the following year. The proposed
   hypothesis can explain the synchronized emergence of cicadas with
   varying growth trajectories in scheduled years (13 or 17 years of age)
   and the off-schedule emergence of some cicadas in 4 years earlier or
   later than the scheduled year, owing to their phenotypic plasticity that
   arises in response to large variations in the realized growth rate. The
   proposed hypothesis can also explain how evolutionary life-cycle shifts
   between 13- and 17-year cycles occur through phenotypic plasticity and
   selection on growth rate during climatic changes. It also facilitates
   understanding of the evolutionary mechanism of Maigicicada, which
   contains three species groups that are parallelly diverged into 13- and
   17-year life cycles.},

Title = {Cranial shape variation in domestication: A pilot study on the case of
   rabbits},

   EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Domestication leads to phenotypic characteristics that have been
   described to be similar across species. However, this ``domestication
   syndrome{''} has been subject to debate, related to a lack of evidence
   for certain characteristics in many species. Here we review diverse
   literature and provide new data on cranial shape changes due to
   domestication in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a
   preliminary case study, thus contributing novel evidence to the debate.
   We quantified cranial shape of 30 wild and domestic rabbits using
   micro-computed tomography scans and three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics. The goal was to test (1) if the domesticates exhibit
   shorter and broader snouts, smaller teeth, and smaller braincases than
   their wild counterparts; (2) to what extent allometric scaling is
   responsible for cranial shape variation; (3) if there is evidence for
   more variation in the neural crest-derived parts of the cranium compared
   with those derived of the mesoderm, in accordance with the ``neural
   crest hypothesis.{''} Our own data are consistent with older literature
   records, suggesting that although there is evidence for some cranial
   characteristics of the ``domestication syndrome{''} in rabbits, facial
   length is not reduced. In accordance with the ``neural crest
   hypothesis,{''} we found more shape variation in neural crest versus
   mesoderm-derived parts of the cranium. Within the domestic group,
   allometric scaling relationships of the snout, the braincase, and the
   teeth shed new light on ubiquitous patterns among related taxa. This
   study-albeit preliminary due to the limited sample size-adds to the
   growing evidence concerning nonuniform patterns associated with
   domestication.},

Abstract = {Despite substantial progress in understanding global biodiversity loss,
   major taxonomic and geographic knowledge gaps remain. Decision makers
   often rely on expert judgement to fill knowledge gaps, but are rarely
   able to engage with sufficiently large and diverse groups of
   specialists. To improve understanding of the perspectives of thousands
   of biodiversity experts worldwide, we conducted a survey and asked
   experts to focus on the taxa and freshwater, terrestrial, or marine
   ecosystem with which they are most familiar. We found several points of
   overwhelming consensus (for instance, multiple drivers of biodiversity
   loss interact synergistically) and important demographic and geographic
   differences in specialists' perspectives and estimates. Experts from
   groups that are underrepresented in biodiversity science, including
   women and those from the Global South, recommended different priorities
   for conservation solutions, with less emphasis on acquiring new
   protected areas, and provided higher estimates of biodiversity loss and
   its impacts. This may in part be because they disproportionately study
   the most highly threatened taxa and habitats. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fungi have unique ecosystem functions, such as organic matter
   decomposition, parasitism, and symbiosis with other organisms in
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Their taxonomic and functional
   diversities are essential factors for predicting ecosystem functions and
   their responses to environmental changes. With the widespread use of
   high-throughput sequencing (HTS) in recent years, the detection of
   fungal DNA sequences in various regions and on different environmental
   substrates has advanced. HTS-obtained DNA sequences can be compared with
   those in databases to identify the taxa of organisms from which they are
   derived. Therefore, a global DNA database containing taxonomic
   information has been developed. However, functional data on the
   distribution and function of individual taxa remain scarce. In this
   study, the ecological information of each fungal family was compiled
   from review papers and published books. Specifically, the following
   information was collected: reported distribution (11 categories
   including information on the presence of fungi in Japan) and function
   (38 categories related to ecological functional data, such as guilds and
   habitats) of 553 families included in the literature. These data will
   provide information on the ecology of specific fungi detected in the
   field and help estimate the functional group composition and diversity
   of fungi from their DNA assemblage data. The detailed Metadata for this
   abstract published in the Data Article section of the journal is
   available in MetaCat in JaLTER at .},

Title = {Grazing alters seedling emergence number, dynamics, and diversity of
   herbaceous plants in a semiarid sandy grassland},

Abstract = {Overgrazing in semiarid grassland is a major cause of vegetation
   degradation. Understanding the changes in seedling patterns driven by
   grazing is crucial to unveiling mechanisms of plant community
   regeneration and succession in grazed grassland. However, the dynamics
   of seedling emergence and species diversity under grazing are rarely
   studied. This study used periodical field investigation to examine the
   variation in seedling emergence, plant diversity, species composition,
   and seedling survival of herbaceous plants under four grazing
   intensities, including light (LG), moderate (MG), heavy (HG), and
   non-grazed (NG), in a semiarid sandy grassland. The results showed that
   seedling number and density were significantly higher in HG plots, while
   the seedling survival rate was significantly lower in HG, and that
   seedling emergence dynamics varied with grazing. Seventy-five percent of
   the seedlings in HG emerged during early spring in April, while
   approximately 50\% of the seedlings in LG, MG, and NG emerged in May.
   Differences in species richness and diversity varied with growth stages
   and the diversity was always higher in LG than in other grazing habitats
   during the main growing season. Annual forb seedlings increased while
   annual grass seedlings decreased after grazing with no perennial grass
   seedlings in HG. Our study suggests that high seedling emergence but low
   seedling survival rate, and simple species composition especially the
   disappearance of perennial plants caused by HG may be an important
   factor leading to vegetation degradation in the semiarid grazed
   grassland.},

Title = {Zooplankton community and its environmental driving factors in Ulungur
   Lake, China},

Abstract = {This study investigated the zooplankton community structure in Ulungur
   Lake, located in the arid region of Northwest China, which has been
   slightly polluted by exogeneous sources. A total of 44 zooplankton
   species were identified in Ulungur Lake, which were sorted into seven
   functional groups: protozoan filter feeders (PF), rotifer filter feeders
   (RF), rotifer carnivores (RC), small copepod and cladoceran filter
   feeders (SCF), mid-sized copepod and cladoceran filter feeders (MCF),
   mid-sized copepod and cladoceran carnivores (MCC), and large copepod and
   cladoceran filter feeders (LCF). The dominant zooplankton functional
   group varied according to seasonal change. The RF group was dominant in
   the spring, comprising 87.77\% of the total biomass. In the summer, the
   dominant group was SCF, comprising 90.72\% of the total biomass, while
   the RF group accounted for only 7.24\%. In the autumn, the biomass was
   mainly distributed between the RC (36.38\%), SCF (30.62\%), and RF
   (30.06\%) groups. This seasonal difference in zooplankton community
   structure is related to fish production in Ulungur Lake, as well as to
   the competition and predation relationship among zooplankton species.
   This study showed a significant positive correlation between the PF and
   LCF groups, and between the RC, MCC, and MCF groups. This positive
   correlation was found to be related to the competition and predatory
   relationships between these functional groups. The predation pressure
   within the zooplankton functional groups in Ulungur Lake was not as
   significant as the pressure of food competition. The zooplankton biomass
   showed no significant difference between spring (0.0615 mg/L) and summer
   (0.0621 mg/L), but the biomass in autumn (0.3051 mg/L) was significantly
   increased. Nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) and Secchi Depth (SD) had
   significant correlations between species and functional groups, and were
   the major driving factors affecting the community structure of Ulungur
   Lake. In this study, the seasonal variations in the biomass of
   zooplankton were strongly influenced by environmental factors, which
   played an important driving role in structuring the ecological
   communities of zooplankton.},

Abstract = {Temperature and food density are the most important factors influencing
   the population dynamics of rotifers. In the present study, the effects
   of temperature and food concentration on the developmental durations,
   egg ratio, and life-table demography in Brachionus angularis and
   Keratella valga were studied at four temperatures (15 degrees C, 20
   degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and four food levels (0.5 x
   10(6), 1.0 x 10(6), 2.0 x 10(6) and 3.0 x 10(6) cells/mL Scenedesmus
   obliquus). The results showed significant effects of both temperature
   and food concentration, independently and interactively on the embryonic
   development (ED), juvenile period (JP), average lifespan (LS),
   generation time (T) and intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) in
   B. angularis, while the ED, life expectancy at hatching (e(0)), LS, T
   and r(m) in K. valga. In all conditions, the number of eggs per female
   and r(m) in B. angularis were higher than those in K. valga. These
   results suggested that B. angularis might be more suitable to mass
   culture in aquaculture than K. valga, and a potential prey for fish
   larvae in freshwater aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Large-scale changes in the ranges and abundance of a large number of
   species of both southern and northern origin have occurred in the Baltic
   region under the development of the warm phase of the climate in recent
   decades. Moreover, changes are far from being synchronous in different
   species of these groups. An increase in the population of the Caspian
   Tern Hydroprogne caspia and its active settlement in the northeast
   direction were observed in the first half of the 20th century. In recent
   decades, there has been, on the contrary, a general downward trend in
   the number. The article discusses in detail the history of the invasion
   of the species in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, the spatial
   distribution, and features of the habitat confinement of nesting birds.
   It is shown that, unlike other southern invaders of the region, the
   Caspian Tern has remained a rare species over the past 30-40 years with
   a tendency to strong population fluctuations. This is probably caused by
   the lack of a reserve of birds in the nearest breeding areas. It is
   shown that the Caspian Tern, which is a stenobiont species, usually
   nests on open sandy biotopes. Inhabiting the Gulf of Finland, it has
   mastered reproduction in a fundamentally different landscape, on selga
   massive-crystalline rocks.},

Title = {Intra-crown variation of leaf mass per area of Fagus crenata is driven
   by light acclimation of leaf thickness and hydraulic acclimation of leaf
   density},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-278},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In trees, leaf anatomy acclimates to the vertical light and hydraulic
   gradients within the crown. Intra-crown trait variation reflects
   phenotypic plasticity, which is considered a measure of individual-level
   acclimation to environmental variation. Here, we compared plasticity of
   leaf anatomical traits among trees from five regional populations of
   Fagus crenata and assessed the contribution of these traits to leaf mass
   per area (LMA). Intra-crown variation of LMA was larger than variation
   among trees from different sites, suggesting phenotypic plasticity is
   greater than genetic variation. After intra-crown light effects were
   removed, LMA increased with increasing height, suggesting, in addition
   to light acclimation, hydraulic limitation drives intra-crown variation.
   LMA was positively correlated with leaf thickness and negatively
   correlated with mesophyll porosity. Leaf thickness accounted for 39\% of
   the variation in LMA, while palisade thickness accounted for 62\% of the
   variation in leaf thickness, suggesting light was the main driver of
   leaf thickness. Thicker leaves also had denser mesophyll and thicker
   epidermal layers, both acclimations to low water availability (i.e.,
   hydraulic limitation). Among the traits, intra-crown plasticity was
   highest for mesophyll porosity, while there was no difference among
   trees from different sites in overall trait plasticity. Our results
   indicate phenotypic plasticity of leaf traits in F. crenata is mainly
   driven by light availability, while some traits, such as leaf density,
   may be driven by hydraulic limitation. In regional populations with high
   phenotypic plasticity, individual-level acclimation may buffer negative
   effects of future climate change on growth and productivity of F.

Title = {The impact of excessive protein consumption on human wastewater nitrogen
   loading of US waters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {452-458},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Total and per capita protein consumption rates in US diets, whether from
   plant or animal sources, rank among the highest in the world. When
   protein consumption outpaces physiologic protein demands, excess amino
   acids are degraded in the human body and nitrogen (N) is excreted and
   released to the environment, mainly in the form of urea. Such excess
   reactive N can enter downstream environments, thereby impairing human
   and ecosystem health as well as contributing to economic losses. We show
   that matching protein consumption with physiologic requirements would
   reduce US hydrologic N losses to aquatic ecosystems by 12\% and overall
   (atmospheric and hydrologic) N losses to ecosystems by 4\%. Were US
   citizens to consume protein at recommended rates, projected N excretion
   rates in 2055 would be 27\% less than they are today, despite population
   growth. Optimizing US protein consumption to levels that meet human
   health standards has environmental benefits on par with improving
   wastewater treatment using existing technology, while also generating
   impactful economic benefits.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies are changing how scientists and the public see and
   interact with cetacean specimens. As staff at a small, rural, marine
   science center, we employed LIDAR (light detection and ranging), x-ray,
   computational tomography, and structured light scanning along with
   three-dimensional (3D) printing to study and exhibit the remains of a
   7.9-m transient male killer whale (Orcinus orca) and a 22.4-m female
   blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). In collaboration with larger
   institutions, we applied these technologies to bone replication,
   skeletal articulation, soft-tissue anatomical studies, and digital
   modeling to create high-quality specimen replicas. These techniques
   surpass traditional modeling and restoration methods, and advance
   specimen-associated research and documentation. In addition, 3D
   technology supports education and public awareness through in-person and
   online exhibits and demonstrations. The decreasing cost and increasing
   appeal of advanced imaging can be used to enhance community engagement
   and the accessibility of science.},

Abstract = {To achieve a sustainable society and solve the problems caused by
   climate change and socioeconomic activities, it is necessary to monitor
   the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem functions, services,
   and biodiversity at both regional and global scales. During the last
   decade, we have seen rapid and significant improvement in satellite and
   near-surface remote-sensing technologies. In this review, we describe
   how remote-sensing observations are being used to effectively evaluate
   the spatial and temporal variability of land use and cover types and of
   plant phenology in East Asia. We discuss the current status,
   uncertainties, problems, and future perspectives for terrestrial
   ecosystem and biodiversity monitoring, and we address the
   multidisciplinary research by incorporating in situ and satellite
   observations for East Asia. Recent satellites with advanced optical
   sensors, such as MultiSpectral Instrument/Sentinel-2A/2B, Advanced
   Himawari Imager/Himawari-8, and PlanetScope, and satellites with
   synthetic aperture radar, such as Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2,
   allow detailed monitoring of land use and cover type changes and plant
   phenology. These satellite sensors can provide images with high spatial
   (3-10 m) and high temporal (10 min to 5 days) resolution, at both large
   (>= 1 km(2)) and small (<1 km(2)) scales. In particular, researchers are
   expected to develop discrimination techniques that will enable these
   advanced satellite technologies to detect evergreen broadleaf trees and
   ways to estimate the geographic distribution of leaf traits. We
   encourage more collaborations among ecologists, engineers, and
   remote-sensing scientists to share their abundant knowledge and
   experience and thereby improve the monitoring capabilities.},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows provide diverse ecosystem services that directly or
   indirectly benefit the coastal communities. Despite this, they are among
   the most threatened coastal ecosystems. Though coastal and marine
   conservation actions have progressed over the years, seagrasses received
   less attention compared with other more charismatic ecosystems such as
   coral reefs and mangroves. Among the influencing factors, the lack of
   societal recognition of what seagrasses are and their importance
   underlies the global crisis of seagrass conservation. Thus, in this
   study, we gathered rural and urban perceptions of seagrass ecosystem
   services, their threats, and management-related activities at the unit
   of barangay or village in the Philippines. Overall, rural respondents
   displayed higher awareness of seagrass ecosystem services than urban
   respondents. Socio-economic status and personal connection or direct
   experience to these services influenced their perceptions. Local-level
   threats were also perceived and recognizing these at the early onset can
   avoid severe habitat degradation. Though the role of seagrass blue
   carbon in climate change mitigation was barely discussed in local
   contexts, the impact of climate change-induced stressors on seagrass was
   perceived by the respondents. Thus, local stakeholders, practitioners,
   and policymakers have the opportunity to design future seagrass-focused
   management plans and programs in the era of climate change.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Latitudinal gradients in the variability of plant trait expression are
   insufficiently studied. Here, we infer the expression and variability of
   major reproductive traits in Japanese angiosperm woody plants using
   geographical distributions of 773 woody plant species and 4682 grid
   cells at the 10 x 10 km(2) spatial resolution. We focus on flower color,
   flower size, fruit size, fruit type, seed mass, and dispersal type and
   relate trait mean values and within cell variability to latitude, forest
   area and fragmentation, phylogenetic relatedness, and socioeconomic
   factors. To account for the correlation between variability and mean
   trait values, we use a recently developed model based on Taylor's power
   law (TPL). All studied reproductive traits exhibited strong although
   contrasting latitudinal gradients. Contrary to Gloger's rule, flowers
   tended to be darker at higher latitudes. Flower sizes increased and
   fruit and seed sizes decreased at higher latitudes. Color variability
   increased while variability in fruit size decreased toward higher
   latitudes. Higher human impact influenced fruit size positively and seed
   size negatively. We confirmed the usefulness of the TPL in the study of
   trait variability. We interpret the darker flower colors at higher
   latitudes as an adaptation to predominant bee pollination and thus as an
   effect of ecological filtering. Our study does not unequivocally
   corroborate the hypothesis that color variability within woody plant
   communities is governed by the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. We
   interpret the observed latitudinal trends toward higher variation in
   flower color and size in terms of increased numbers of generalist
   pollinators at higher latitudes.},

Title = {Landscape effects on pollinator abundance differ among taxonomic groups},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {434-445},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding how landscape composition affects pollinator abundance is
   crucial for conserving the sustainability of the symbiotic relationship
   between plants and pollinators. However, field evidence on the effect of
   landscape composition and spatial scales on the abundance of each
   pollinator group is biased toward bee pollinators, and non-bee
   pollinators tend to be excluded. This study aims to evaluate the effect
   of landscape composition at various spatial scales on diverse taxonomic
   groups of pollinators, including non-bee pollinators. We selected 22
   grasslands with varying landscape compositions in Shiroi City, Chiba
   Prefecture, Japan. We recorded the abundance of pollinators and floral
   resource availability at these sites. The effects of landscape
   composition within a 100-1000 m radius and the floral resource
   availability were analyzed using Bayesian generalized linear mixed
   models to determine whether these factors affected the abundance of each
   pollinator group. As a result, the difference in important factors among
   the pollinator groups was detected; Scoliidae, Lycaenidae, Stomorhina
   obsoleta, and Sphaerophoria were influenced by the landscape
   composition, whereas Bombus diversus and Hesperiidae were not. Scoliidae
   was affected by the proportion of agri-field and forest areas within a
   500-1000 m radius. St. obsoleta and Sphaerophoria showed different
   response patterns to the proportion of urban land within a 100 m radius.
   B. diversus and Hesperiidae were influenced by floral resource
   availability. Our study suggests that considering the spatial scales of
   landscape composition on the target species is essential to plan
   effective conservation measures.},

Title = {Seasonal patterns of sugar components and their functions in branches of
   Fagus crenata in association with three reproduction events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 29},
Abstract = {Soluble sugars have multiple functions in plants and both their absolute
   and relative abundances may vary in association with diverse
   physiological processes and life-history events. Some also have specific
   functions in different organs that vary seasonally. Therefore, studying
   the dynamics of sugar compositions in woody species would further our
   understanding of their functions, which has been mainly analyzed en
   bloc. In order to elucidate the functions of specific soluble sugars and
   the effects of reproduction on their profile, we monitored the soluble
   sugar composition in ``new `` (current-year) and ``old `` (1-3 years
   old) branches of Fagus crenata for 7 years, which included three
   reproduction ( ``masting ``) events. As well as the generally
   predominant sugar species (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), substantial
   amounts of raffinose (accounting for up to 42\% of the total sugars)
   were found in both new and old branches during winter hardening. In
   addition, myo-inositol (which plays important roles in cell growth and
   development) was detected mainly during the early growing season and
   fluctuated interannually in both new and old branches. Furthermore, the
   only clear change in soluble sugar contents associated with reproduction
   events was in myo-inositol concentrations in the new branches, which
   were lower in fruiting trees than in non-fruiting trees, possibly due to
   the growth reduction in fruiting tree branches identified in previous
   studies. The results show the importance of considering the dynamics of
   each sugar component, rather than en bloc, in attempts to elucidate
   their roles in physiological processes and responses to environmental
   changes.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {As a citizen-based research project in an elementary school, we examined
   the life-history traits of the endangered mud snail Batillaria
   multiformis in Mutsu Bay, one of the species northernmost populations in
   Japan. The snails occurred widely in the intertidal zone in summer, but
   they were densely aggregated near the low-tide line from autumn to
   winter. Shell lengths (SLs) ranged from 1.2 to 49.5 mm, and one to four
   or more size cohorts occurred in the population. Batillaria multiformis
   spawned from August to September, settled in autumn, and grew to 4-6 mm
   SL the following spring. The snails grew to 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and
   20-25 mm SL in the second to fifth autumns, respectively. The highest
   growth rates were from July to August, while shell growth stopped from
   September to April. The snails became sexually mature at least 4-10
   years (24.1 to ca. 50 mm SL) after settlement, at which time shell
   growth stopped and a callus knob was formed. Batillaria multiformis in
   Mutsu Bay exhibited much larger shell sizes and delayed maturation
   compared to southern populations. Shell growth rates differed in the
   summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016 (+0.69, +1.11, and +4.59 mm SL 30-d(-1),
   respectively), corresponding to the mean sediment temperatures in August
   (22.8, 24.5, and 26.4 degrees C, respectively). These results indicate
   that thermal conditions constitute an important determinant of annual
   shell growth in the northern limit population of B. multiformis. Ongoing
   climate change can lead to changes in life-history traits of
   macroinvertebrates, including mud snails, particularly near their
   northern distribution limits.},

Abstract = {Meleagris gallopavo L. (Wild Turkey) is a valued game species that is

   timing of turkey reproduction across North Carolina by examining
   camera-trap images collected from 527 sites over 3 years. We found a
   peak of male strutting behavior at Julian week 13 and, based on the age
   of poults photographed later in the summer, estimated the peak of egg
   hatching at week 22. The timing of strutting significantly varied across
   years but not across the 3 ecoregions of the state. Understanding turkey
   breeding and reproductive chronology can be useful when agencies set
   hunting seasons to balance the interest of hunters while minimizing
   potential impacts to reproduction.},

Title = {Changes in the Forest Bat Community After Arrival of White-Nose Syndrome
   in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas},
Journal = {SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-115},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Populations of some cave-hibernating bats have undergone declines in
   recent years due to an introduced fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans)
   that causes the disease white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is often fatal
   to bats during hibernation. Unprecedented declines in cave-hibernating
   species have the potential to change community composition via numerous
   mechanisms, including competitive release. We trapped bats for 6 years
   in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas prior to the arrival of WNS in the
   region and compared capture rates of 7 species to capture rates
   collected in 2020-2021 after WNS establishment. We found a 98\% decline
   in Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) and a 77\% decline
   in Perimyotis subflavus (Tricolored Bat) after WNS became prevalent.
   Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bat) captures increased by 220\% after
   WNS. Capture rates of Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat) increased by
   100\%, but this increase was not significant. We also found no
   significant differences in captures rates for Lasiurus borealis (Eastern
   Red Bat), Lasiurus seminolus (Seminole Bat), and Lasiurus cinereus
   (Hoary Bat) after the arrival of WNS. Our results indicate that the
   forest bat community of the Ouachita Mountains has been altered since
   the arrival of WNS in 2012, but it is unknown if these changes are
   permanent or if species will decline further or recover via adaptive or
   genetic changes in their populations in the future.},

Abstract = {Adaptive approaches are needed to effectively manage dynamic marine
   systems, and ecological forecasts can help managers anticipate when and
   where conservation issues are likely to arise in the future. The recent
   development of subseasonal global environmental forecasts provides an
   opportunity to inform management by forecasting species distributions in
   advance over operational timeframes. We demonstrate the utility of
   environmental forecasts for managing marine mammals by integrating
   species distribution models with subseasonal forecasts to predict the
   arrival of migratory humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at
   foraging grounds in the Northeast US. Environmental forecasts showed
   high model skill at lead times of up to 2 weeks and resulting humpback
   whale models performed well in predicting humpback arrival. Forecasts of
   whale distribution can shape management efforts to minimize both impacts
   on whales and economic costs. Applying subseasonal forecasts to
   anticipate future risk presents a powerful tool for the dynamic
   management of marine mammals. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Over most of the world's estuaries, coasts, and continental shelves, key
   indicators of seafloor biodiversity, anthropogenic stress, and
   ecological sustainability emphasize the need to shift habitat management
   and conservation from prevention of degradation to actions focused on
   ecological recovery. Here we discuss the role of ecological
   disturbance-recovery dynamics in devising and prioritizing effective
   management interventions. Understanding disturbance-recovery dynamics
   enables assessment of possible recovery outcomes and where these may be
   achieved. Ecosystem networks, biodiversity landscapes, species-specific
   biological traits, and location-specific contexts provide managers with
   information from which likely temporal and spatial scales of recovery
   can be determined. On the basis of ecological theory and empirical
   evidence, we emphasize the potential for key species to drive the
   recovery or maintenance of biodiversity in marine soft-sediment
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Adaptations of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora developed in the
   tropical climate of the Mexican mountain region determine the nature and
   extent of the predicted distribution of these species in the Caucasus.
   The complex factor of humidity is the main factor determining the
   potential distribution of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora in the
   Caucasus (82 and 48\% of the contribution in the Maxent models).
   Temperature and orographic ENVIREM predictors also play a significant
   role in the distribution of G. parviflora. The center of the predicted
   range of G. quadriradiata is located in the humid climate of the Black
   Sea coast; for G. parviflora, it is located in the relatively moist
   foothill and mid-mountain regions of the Western Caucasus. The lowest
   probability of finding both species is predicted in the lowland (steppe)
   regions and in the arid climate of the Eastern Caucasus. The invasive
   potential of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora in the Caucasus is
   similar: it includes a high degree of overlapping (Schoener's D = 0.76)
   and the same width (Levins' B = 0.91 and 0.92) of ecological niches and
   their visual overlapping in the orthogonal space of the analyzed
   ecological factors. Differences in the potential spatial distribution of
   the species in the Caucasus are associated with their biological
   characteristics (greater or lesser sensitivity to water and temperature
   regimes and orographic factors).},

Title = {Biological Characteristics of the Polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus
   (Fauvel, 1923) from Mass Settlements in the Coastal Water Area of the
   Kerch Strait (Black Sea)},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In September 2019, the polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel,
   1923), formerly known as Mercierella enigmatica Fauvel, 1923, was found
   in mass colonial settlements in the coastal water area of the Kerch
   Strait near the Arshintsevskaya Spit. Brackish water bodies in India are
   considered by some researchers to be the initial natural range of this
   polychaete species. This species is currently known to be widely
   distributed along the coasts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans
   and along the coasts of the North, Mediterranean, and Caspian seas. Only
   a few isolated individuals of F..nigmaticus have been found so far along
   the Crimean coast of the Black Sea, in the coastal zone of Sevastopol,
   and along the Karadag shores. The colonies described in this study do
   not constitute reef structures yet, but have already reached high
   population numbers. The colony has a diameter of 46 cm and comprises
   1774 individuals. The settlements of F..nigmaticus are true populations
   represented by individuals of different sizes, ranging in length from 2
   to 39 mm. The populations include both males and females: males account
   for 56\% and females account for 44\% of the population. The fecundity
   of the worms expressed as the number of mature eggs per female depends
   on the body size and varies between 5800 eggs for the body size of 12 mm
   and 24820 eggs for the body size of 29 mm. The present study describes
   the morphology of F. enigmaticus using scanning electron microscopy and
   identifies numerous sensory structures on the surface of the body,
   gills, and the pygidium for the first time. Judging from the presence of
   a mass settlement of the polychaete F..nigmaticus in the coastal water
   areas of the Kerch Strait, it can be presumed that this species has
   become completely naturalized in the Black Sea. Since this species is
   eurybiontic, it can be assumed that it will invade the Sea of Azov and
   adjacent estuaries, river deltas, and coastal lakes successfully, which
   will have an inevitable effect on the life of the local species and the
   ecosystems in general.},

   introduced in at least seven private menageries. As a result of studying
   feces of 34 imported reindeers carried out in 2018-2021, nematode larvae
   were isolated, whose morphological, morphometric, physiological and
   biological characteristics corresponded to those of E. rangiferi.
   Species identification was confirmed by subsequent molecular genetic
   studies. The discovery of larvae in the feces of second generation
   reindeer (born in 2018-2020) indicated the successful completion of the
   full life cycle by the helminth, which requires the participation of
   intermediate hosts such as terrestrial or freshwater gastropods. The
   following facts, including (1) the occurrence of reindeer infested with
   E. rangiferi in Leningrad oblast; (2) the presence of wild,
   agricultural, and zoo-kept ruminants capable of becoming definitive
   hosts for Elaphostrongylus in Leningrad oblast; (3) the spread of
   parasite larvae as a result of reindeers roaming freely in the forest,
   their lease and resale, and commercial sale of non-disinfected manure;
   (4) the ability of larvae to stay viable in feces and infected mollusks
   for about 2 years, withstanding freezing and drying; (5) high lethality
   among infected nonspecific hosts due to parasitic encephalomyelitis,
   pneumonia, etc.; and (6) the lack of treatment methods, all put
   ruminants of Leningrad oblast at risk.},

Title = {Alien and Native Dominants Exercise Similar Effects on the Species

Abstract = {It remains unclear whether the effect exercised by alien dominants on
   the species richness in plant communities is on average stronger than
   the effect exercised by native dominants. To clear up this point, 20
   synanthropic plant communities dominated by species of different
   biogeographical origins were surveyed in the Belaya River valley,
   Western Caucasus (190-680 m above sea level). For each of the studied
   communities, aboveground biomass samples were collected on 25-30 plots
   0.25 m(2) in size with different shares of dominants; the collected
   samples were subsequently sorted by species and weighed. Analysis of the
   field data made it possible to draw the following conclusions: (1)
   samples with high shares of alien and native dominants differ
   statistically insignificantly in the average number of species; (2) on
   average, the relationship between the degree of dominance of alien
   species and the species richness is as strong as the relationship
   between the degree of dominance of native species and the species
   richness; (3) in most cases, the relationship between these parameters
   can be satisfactorily explained by the ``energy-diversity{''}
   hypothesis; and (4) the proportion of synanthropic plant species in
   communities with high shares of alien and native dominants is not higher
   than that in communities with low shares of these dominants. Overall,
   the results indicate that alien and native dominants exercise similar
   and mostly nonselective effects on accompanying species in plant
   communities.},

Abstract = {Extinction-risk assessments play a major role in prioritizing
   conservation action at national and international levels. However,
   quantifying extinction risk is challenging, especially when including
   the full suite of adaptive responses to environmental change. In
   particular, evolutionary potential (EP) - the capacity to evolve
   genetically based changes that increase fitness under changing
   conditions - has proven difficult to evaluate, limiting its inclusion in
   risk assessments. Theory, experiments, simulations, and field studies
   all highlight the importance of EP in characterizing and mitigating
   extinction risk. Disregarding EP can therefore result in ineffective
   allocation of resources and inadequate recovery planning. Fortunately,
   proxies for EP can be estimated from environmental, phenotypic, and
   genetic data. Some proxies can be incorporated into quantitative
   extinction-risk assessments, whereas others better inform basic
   conservation actions that maximize resilience to future change.
   Integration of EP into conservation decision making is challenging but
   essential and remains an important issue for innovation in applied
   conservation science. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Gentrification operates as a social driver of health that can increase
   tick-borne disease (TBD) risk for communities of color through either
   population displacement or land-use change. Research on the emergence of
   TBDs in urban environments has primarily focused on the ecological
   processes of urban landscapes that facilitate favorable habitats for
   host reservoirs and tick vectors. However, neglecting to view infectious
   disease risk from a socioecological framework will continue to result in
   policies and planning that disadvantage communities of color. Using Lyme
   disease as a case study, we integrated elements of environmental
   epidemiology, ecology, public health, and urban planning to propose
   pathways of gentrification as a socioecological process with public
   health implications. By drawing connections between urban ecology, urban
   planning, and environmental racism, we seek to bring awareness to
   disease ecologists, policy makers, and public health managers on the
   potential role of gentrification as a driver of tick-borne pathogen
   exposure. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Abstract = {Globalization has led to the unintentional movement of thousands of
   species around the world, necessitating a better understanding of how
   species are spread by international trade to prevent new invasions.
   However, to date, the evidence implicating global trade in
   intercontinental species flows has been mixed. Here, we show that
   commonly used proxies of global trade, such as general and agricultural
   imports, fail to explain the invasion flows of alien ants from donor
   regions to the continental US. Analysis of 97 individual commodity flows
   revealed instead that plant and fruit imports - a small subset of all
   agricultural commodities - were primarily associated with invasion flows
   of ants. The transport patterns of all 95 other commodities, including
   most ``agricultural{''} commodities, differed from those of alien ants.
   Our findings highlight the need to determine precisely which commodities
   serve as introduction pathways for a particular taxon in order to
   account for invasion flows and identify likely source regions of future
   invasions in a world of evolving trade relationships.},

Abstract = {Allelopathic plants release secondary compounds into the soil that then
   suppress the growth of nearby plants. Allelopathy has been shown for the
   invasive Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and Bohemian knotweed (F.
   x bohemica). The aggressive and dominant invaders represent a serious
   threat to the local plant communities outside their native range. Here,
   we analysed the phenols in the knotweed rhizomes using nuclear magnetic
   resonance. We also evaluated the allelopathic potential of methanol
   extracts of F. japonica and F. x bohemica rhizomes and compared these
   with the effects of the individual knotweed phenols resveratrol,
   epicatechin and emodin, and their mixture. Rhizomes of both knotweeds
   contained similar amounts of epicatechin and emodin, with 24\% higher
   resveratrol in F. x bohemica. Only the F. x bohemica methanol extract
   inhibited radish (Raphanus sativus) seed germination. After 3 days of
   treatments with 10\% (w/v) extracts of both knotweeds, radish seedlings
   showed up to 70\% shorter roots. In contrast, root growth of seedlings
   treated with the individual phenols resveratrol, epicatechin and emodin,
   and their mixture, was inhibited by up to 30\%, similar to the 1\%
   knotweed extracts. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress also
   increased in the roots of treated seedlings, with high levels of
   malondialdehyde in particular indicating lipid peroxidation. Total
   antioxidative capacity was also increased in seedlings exposed to 0.6
   mg/mL resveratrol and emodin. This study shows higher allelopathic
   potential of the knotweed methanol extracts compared to the individual
   phenols and their mixture.},

Abstract = {The scent gland secretion of an undetermined species of Prionostemma
   from Costa Rica was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and
   shown to consist of medium-chain carboxylic acids (mainly octanoic acid)
   and a ss-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, eventually identified as myrmicacin (=
   (R)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid). While scent gland secretions in harvestmen
   have traditionally been considered to be products of de novo synthesis,
   we here provide evidence for the unusual case of sequestration-derived
   scent gland constituents: at least myrmicacin appears to be sequestered
   from leaf-cutter ants that constitute a part of the prey of the
   Prionostemma-species herein investigated. This is the first report on
   the scent gland chemistry of the sclerosomatid subfamily Gagrellinae as
   well as on a possible sequestration mechanism in harvestmen.},

Abstract = {The data on parasitizing of two species of myxosporeans of the genus
   Kudoa in the muscles of two species of alien gobies in the Black Sea off
   the coast of Sevastopol are presented. One isolate was found in the
   chameleon goby Tridentiger trigonocephalus, and the other one was found
   in the red-mouthed goby Gobius cruentatus. It is supposed that the
   source of infection for the alien fish were native gobies, in which the
   above species of parasites were previously known. A decrease in the size
   of spores and polar capsules as well as a slight deformation of the
   spore shape of K. niluferi were observed, which may be associated with
   parasitizing in an unusual host and in another part of the range.
   Molecular genetic identification of myxosporeans from two species of
   gobies confirms that the studied isolates belong to the genus Kudoa. Two
   18S rDNA sequences of these isolates turned out to be very similar, but
   not identical to each other (differences of 4.87\%), and also similar to
   two known species of goby myxosporeans from the Black Sea, K. nova and
   K. niluferi. The results obtained are the first evidence of parasitizing
   of both species of gobies by Myxosporea representatives in the area of
   invasion and also compensate for the absence of information on genomic
   variability of parasites of chameleon and red-mouthed gobies in the
   native range.},

Abstract = {Antarctic conservation science is crucial for enhancing Antarctic policy
   and understanding alterations to terrestrial Antarctic biodiversity.
   Antarctic conservation will have limited long-term impacts in the
   absence of large-scale biodiversity data, but if such data were
   available, it is likely to improve environmental protection regimes. To
   enable the prediction of Antarctic biodiversity across continental
   spatial scales through proxy variables, in the absence of baseline
   surveys, we linked Antarctic substrate-derived environmental DNA (eDNA)
   sequence data from the remote Antarctic Prince Charles Mountains to a
   selected range of concomitantly collected measurements of substrate
   properties. We achieved this through application of a statistical method
   commonly used in machine learning. Our analysis indicated that neutral
   substrate pH, low conductivity, and certain substrate minerals are
   important predictors of the presence of basidiomycetes, chlorophytes,
   ciliophorans, nematodes, and tardigrades. A bootstrapped regression
   revealed how variations in the identified substrate parameters influence
   probabilities of detecting eukaryote phyla across vast and remote areas
   of Antarctica. We believe that our work will improve future taxon
   distribution modeling and aid in developing more targeted surveys of
   biodiversity conducted under logistically challenging conditions.},

Abstract = {Society increasingly demands accurate predictions of complex ecosystem
   processes under novel conditions to address environmental challenges.
   However, obtaining the process-level knowledge required to do so does
   not necessarily align with the burgeoning use in ecology of correlative
   model selection criteria, such as Akaike information criterion. These
   criteria select models based on their ability to reproduce outcomes, not
   on their ability to accurately represent causal effects. Causal
   understanding does not require matching outcomes, but rather involves
   identifying model forms and parameter values that accurately describe
   processes. We contend that researchers can arrive at incorrect
   conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships by relying on
   information criteria. We illustrate via a specific example that
   inference extending beyond prediction into causality can be seriously
   misled by information-theoretic evidence. Finally, we identify a
   solution space to bridge the gap between the correlative inference
   provided by model selection criteria and a process-based understanding
   of ecological systems.},

   develops. The Ai-Petri Plateau is a reserve of the adult pest, which
   provides its expansion to other territories of southern Crimea by air
   currents. Chemical control of the C. arcuata population at the apex of

Title = {Ecogeographical Potential of the Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. Northward
   Expansion in European Russia Estimated on the Basis of a Comparison of

Abstract = {Field studies made it possible to specify the actual modern Ambrosia
   artemisiifolia naturalization boundary in European Russia. This boundary
   passes through the southern parts of Bryansk, Kursk, and Saratov oblasts
   and through the northern part of Voronezh oblast. The total mileage of
   field survey routes was some 8900 km; 777 sampling points were surveyed.
   A comparative ecogeographical analysis and modeling of the species
   distribution in northern parts of its secondary range in European Russia
   and primary range in Canada were performed to determine the Ambrosia
   artemisiifolia potential for further northward expansion. It is
   established that the main factor limiting its northward expansion is
   insufficient heat supply during the seed ripening period. To determine
   the ecogeographical niche of A. artemisiifolia, a global map reflecting
   the distribution of accumulated degree days >10 degrees C was produced
   for the period starting from the date of the day length transition
   through 14 h after the summer solstice and ending with the sustainable
   transition of autumn temperatures through 0 degrees C (accumulated
   degree days taking into account the photoperiodic threshold (ADD(ppt))).
   ADD(ppt) values were determined for the northernmost annual ragweed
   naturalization points in European Russia and in Canada. A comparison of
   ecogeographical limits performed on the basis of the heat supply factor
   showed that the ecogeographical niche currently realized by the species
   in North America is generally wider in comparison with that in European
   Russia. Possible reasons behind the insufficient occupation of the A.
   artemisiifolia environmental niche in European Russia were examined; an
   assumption that the species can continue its northward expansion has
   been made. On the basis of the heat supply factor, annual ragweed can
   spread further to the north in European Russia: to Bryansk, Oryol,
   Lipetsk, Tambov, Saratov, and Orenburg oblasts; to the southern half of
   Penza oblast; and to southern parts of Ulyanovsk and Samara oblasts and
   the Republic of Bashkortostan. The northeastward expansion of the
   species can be hindered by adverse effects of another factor:
   insufficient moisture supply. At the northern distribution limit of A.
   artemisiifolia in Saratov oblast and east of it, the species is in the
   ecological pessimum zone in terms of both heat and moisture supply.},

Title = {Ecogeographical Analysis of the Heracleum persicum, H. mantegazzianum,

   Ranges in Europe},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the distribution of Heracleum persicum, H.
   mantegazzianum, and H. sosnowskyi at the northern limit of their
   secondary ranges in Europe based on original and published data. The
   northernmost H. persicum occurrences are localized in coastal regions in
   the northern and central parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula (up to 71
   degrees N). In Fennoscandia, H. mantegazzianum and H. sosnowskyi were
   noted up to 69 degrees N. The gradient of climatic resources in the
   subarctic and temperate zones made it possible to identify factors
   limiting further expansion of these species in northern Europe and
   determine their tolerance limits to these factors. The duration of the
   frostless season at the northern boundary of the secondary range of
   invasive Heracleum species is 80-150 days. The probability of cold
   damage to vegetating plants in areas located north of 66 degrees N
   (i.e., in the northern part of Finland and in the continental northern
   part of European Russia) is high. The biological minimum for the sum of
   active air temperatures >= 5 degrees C is 1150 degrees C, while the
   minimum requirement of the studied plants for the sum of active
   temperatures >= 10 degrees C is over 450 degrees C. If available thermal
   resources exceed this level, then invasive Heracleum species can
   naturalize in climatic conditions of subarctic Europe. The presence of a
   sustainable snow cover more than 25 cm depth in areas where the minimum
   winter temperatures are less than -30 degrees C prevents the freezing of
   renewal buds and seedlings, thus, preserving the viability of plants. It
   is proposed to use climatic indices computed as ratios between the air
   temperature and the snow cover depth (or the precipitation amount in
   winter) as climatic markers characterizing wintering conditions for
   plants. The main factors limiting the spread and naturalization of
   invasive Heracleum species in northern Europe are lack of heat, soil
   freezing to temperatures critical for hibernating plant organs, and
   early autumn frosts.},

Abstract = {One of the most difficult aspects of studying intact amphibian
   communities is that they tend to occupy isolated areas within
   inaccessible terrain-factors that both protect watersheds from
   development and disturbance while also making them difficult to study.
   We conducted an extensive survey of the freshwater herpetofauna of the
   remote King Range National Conservation Area in Northern California
   using a combination of visual encounter surveys and environmental DNA
   (eDNA) sampling. We found twelve species of native aquatic amphibians
   and the western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), and no introduced
   amphibians. Detection probabilities for the four most commonly
   encountered species, giant salamanders (Dicamptodon sp), foothill
   yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), and
   black salamanders (Aneides flavipunctatus), were affected by substrate
   and canopy cover, but the effects of these habitat characteristics on
   detection probability were species specific. Neither survey method,
   visual encounter surveys nor eDNA sampling, was more effective than the
   other, and our study suggests that the use of visual encounter surveys
   in conjunction with eDNA sampling may counteract the shortcomings of
   either when done individually. Five species were found using both
   methods, seven were only encountered during visual encounter surveys,
   and one recorded only from eDNA sampling. DNA samples from two taxa,
   toads and giant salamanders, could not be resolved to species. Toad
   species identity was assigned to the only member of the candidate
   species with a species range known to overlap the study area; the other
   three candidate species occupy restricted ranges far from the study
   area. Neither of the two giant salamander candidate species have known
   species ranges overlapping the study area. One, the California giant
   salamander (D. ensata), is known to occur within 100 km. However, there
   is a paucity of genetic material in GenBank DNA library for both the
   California giant salamander and the coastal giant salamander (D.
   tenebrosus), a widely distributed species with a range overlapping the
   study area, which could lead to inaccurate assignment of eDNA fragments.},

Abstract = {Amphipods of the genus Melita (Melitidae, Amphipoda) were found in the
   Kerch Strait (Black Sea) in September 2019 and March, July, and November
   2020. The material was collected in the formations formed by the
   polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1923). The depth ranged from
   0.1 to 0.2 m. The individuals found in this site do not belong to the
   species Melita palmata (Montagu, 1804) known in the Black Sea, but they
   correspond to the morphological characters of the genus Melita. The
   species discovered is as close as possible to the species Melita
   setiflagella Yamato, 1988, whose natural range is located in the
   estuaries of rivers in Japan. The invasive range covers coastal waters
   of the Atlantic coast of Europe, the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the
   United States, and the Atlantic coast of Argentina. Presumably, this
   invader was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea with ballast
   waters or by transfer with fouling of ship surfaces. M. cf. setiflagella
   formed a stable self-reproducing population in the Kerch Strait.
   Therefore, it is important to monitor the distribution of this amphipod
   in order to predict the consequences for endemic species and local
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Diel and seasonal changes in the gut contents of omnivorous-carnivorous
   macroinvertebrates were examined in a Japanese mountain stream based on
   direct observation of gut contents. Carnivorous-omnivorous (predator)
   macroinvertebrates were sampled at four time periods (02:00-03:00,
   08:00-09:00, 14:00-15:00, and 20:00-21:00) on 3 days in each of March,
   June, September, and December. A total of 1391 individual
   macroinvertebrates belonging to 71 taxa were dissected: identifiable gut
   contents were observed in 928 individuals and prey identified to the
   family level were observed from the guts of 564 individuals. Using
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling, interspecific variation in foraging
   patterns was summarized into two axes that approximately correspond to
   body size and habitat preferences of prey taxa. Although seasonal
   patterns in the number of prey individuals in a gut varied among taxa,
   in March and December, several predators notably foraged on taxa such as
   Simuliidae, which inhabits stone surfaces in river sections with a rapid
   current. This pattern may be explained by season-specific prey
   availability and predation risks from vertebrates. Diel changing
   patterns in the number of prey individuals per gut varied among predator
   taxa, and most predators did not show obvious proportional changes in
   gut contents. These results indicate that subcompartments of interaction
   networks and numerous indirect effects via intraguild predation
   potentially exist within the ``guild `` of macroinvertebrates, which are
   often summarized as mesopredators of stream food webs.},

Title = {Testing the Enemy Release Hypothesis in the Invasive Fish Amatitlania

Abstract = {The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) posits that invasive species are
   released from their natural enemies in their invasive range, which
   promotes their successful invasion. In this study, we tested the ERH in
   a population of the convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata, an
   invasive species in Mexico. The ERH predicts that the convict cichlid:
   (a) is not infected by specialist helminth parasites in the invasive
   range; (b) has lower infection parameter values, as measured through
   richness, prevalence, abundance and diversity of helminths, than a
   native species-the redside cichlid Cichlasoma istlanum; and (c) is not
   affected in its condition factor by the abundance of helminths it
   carries. The convict cichlid was infected by two (33\%) specialist
   helminths relative to the six specialist helminths that infect the
   cichlid in its native range. The convict cichlid had lower helminth
   richness and diversity than the redside cichlid. However, the prevalence
   and abundance of the parasite species varied between the host fish.
   While the prevalence and abundance of the nematode Rhabdochona kidderi
   was higher in the redside cichlid, the prevalence and abundance of the
   trematode Uvulifer sp. was higher in the convict cichlid. The condition
   factor in both host fish was not correlated with helminth abundance. Our
   results do not agree with the prediction that the convict cichlid is
   completely released from specialist parasites, nor with the prediction
   that this invasive species has lower infection parameter values than the
   native redside cichlid. However, our results agree with the prediction
   that the abundance of parasite helminths do not affect the cichlid's
   condition factor. More studies are necessary to determine the advantages
   that the convict cichlid could have in the invasive range when it is
   infected with a low richness and diversity of helminths.},

Abstract = {While there is substantial support for the river continuum concept (RCC)

   using ultraviolet lights. Specimens were identified to the genus level
   and the AFDM of each functional feeding group (FFG) was calculated.
   Forty-two environmental and river morphological variables were tested
   for their ability to predict differences in EPT FFG biomass. A
   determined environmental gradient relating to increasing river size
   predicted over 80\% of FFG biomass differences. Biomass of each
   individual FFG increased along the determined gradient, except for
   scrapers which decreased at the most downstream sites. The number of EPT
   genera also increased along the gradient. Our results were similar to
   those of previous studies, except that shredders nearly doubled in
   importance compared to RCC predictions, suggesting a greater ecological
   impact of shredders on forested streams than is typically reported.},

Title = {Testing the effect of the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum
   (L.) on heterotrophic bacterioplankton densities under different levels
   of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in shallow lake mesocosms},

Abstract = {To investigate the effect of submerged macrophytes on heterotrophic
   bacterioplankton communities in response to nutrient enrichment, we
   simulated mesocosms to test two factors, namely, the presence of
   Ceratophyllum demersum (L.) and the level of nutrients (slight and
   medium nutrient enrichment) under four possible system combinations for
   a duration of more than 3 months. The results show that C. demersum can
   affect the temporal dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton density
   (HBD) and cause it to decrease. However, the effect of C. demersum on
   HBD was more pronounced under medium nutrient enrichment. The mean
   values of HBD in the treatment and control systems under slight nutrient
   enrichment were 1.30 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) and 1.34 x 10(5) cells mL(-1),
   respectively; whereas for medium nutrient enrichment, they were 1.78 x
   10(5) cells mL(-1) and 2.65 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), respectively. The
   total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were
   maintained throughout the experiment, and no significant differences
   were observed in the pH value, chlorophyll a (Chl. a) concentrations or
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels between the systems with and
   without macrophytes, regardless of the nutrient level. Furthermore,
   linear mixed models revealed that environmental variables had a limited
   impact on HBD and that C. demersum had no significant direct effect on
   the environmental variables in the systems. A likely explanation is
   higher predation on bacterioplankton in the mesocosms, although
   allelopathic effects exerted by C. demersum cannot be excluded.},

   leaf. There is no decrease in decorativeness. Nevertheless, because of
   the fairly widespread use of Robinia pseudoacacia in the landscaping of
   the region, further spread of its phytophage Nematus tibialis is
   possible. To assess the spread of the pest in the south of the Far East
   and evaluate the harm it causes, it is necessary to monitor plantations

   in Bastrop County, TX, during the spring of 2021. Of 191 toads examined,
   2 (1\%) were each infested with a single leech. Molecular analysis of
   the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene identified 1 of those leeches as
   Helobdella austinensis. This constitutes the first reported association
   of H. austinensis with a vertebrate host and extends the known range of
   H. austinensis similar to 50 km eastward. Leech attachment in this
   Houston Toad population is rare and the nature of the association

Abstract = {Acipenser brevirostrum (Shortnose Sturgeon) is an endangered fish found
   in eastern North American rivers. Age data are largely lacking for the
   species, particularly in southern rivers. Such data can be acquired by
   examining the annuli of the pectoral fin rays. This study's objective
   was to compare ages derived from the first versus second pectoral fin
   rays. In 2020, we obtained paired pectoral ray samples from 59 Shortnose
   Sturgeon from 2 Georgia rivers. After processing, 35 ray pairs were
   examined by 3 independent readers. Only 21\% of ray pairs were assigned
   the exact same age; 56\% of pairs were assigned ages within 1 year.
   There was considerable overlap in length at assigned age for both first
   and second pectoral rays.},

Abstract = {Dispersal is an important factor in shaping ecosystems and patterns of
   biodiversity. However, animals use several different modes of dispersal,
   each of which can have varying impacts on the ecology and evolutionary
   history of a group. One of these modes is phoresy, when an animal (the
   phorant) will temporarily attach itself to another animal (the host) as
   a means of dispersal. This behavior has been described in many groups of
   animals, but very infrequently in the thrips (Insecta: Thysanoptera).
   Here, we report the collection of 2 species of live thrips, Hoplothrips
   sp. and Neohydatothrips variabilis, from 2 species of live birds,
   Cardinalis cardinalis (Northern Cardinal) and Zenaida macroura (Mourning
   Dove), respectively, in northeast Arkansas. Most previous records of
   thrips associated with birds were from nesting material or found on
   deceased birds. The presence of thrips on live birds suggests some
   thrips are phoretic on birds, or at the very least that interactions

Abstract = {Water regime plays a determinant role in plant community development and
   patterns of plant zonation in wetlands. The waters located in the middle
   reach of the Yangtze River (China) have experienced a large decrease in
   wetland area from human activities for a long time, especially after the
   hydrological drought events in recent years. This outdoor study was
   conducted to clarify the morphological responses and reproductive
   strategy of Vallisneria spinulosa to water depth gradients (0.6 m, 1.0
   m, 1.5 m) and to drawdown (down to 0.3 m). In static water, water depth
   of 1.0 m was the best condition for V. spinulosa to grow, manifested as
   high biomass of vegetative parts, tubers and sexual structures. However,
   V. spinulosa growing in water depth of 1.5 m was able to adapt to the
   decline in water depth in autumn, expressed as increased ramet number,
   stolon weight and belowground biomass. The low water depth of 0.6 m
   produced small plants with slight vegetative biomass and drawdown
   produced more tuber biomass. The drawdown caused a decline in vegetative
   ratio of V. spinulosa. Moreover, it caused an increase in clonal ratio
   at water levels of 1.5 m and 0.6 m, and a decline in sexual ratio at
   water levels of 1.5 m and 1.0 m. The results show that under the
   condition of relatively large fluctuations in water level, V. spinulosa
   will reduce the allocation of sexual biomass and increase the allocation
   of clonal biomass in order to cope with environmental changes so that it
   can proliferate better. Thus, water level changes have a great influence
   on the growth and reproduction of V. spinulosa.},

Title = {Development of a benthic macroinvertebrate predictive model based on the
   physical and chemical variables of rivers in the Republic of Korea},

Abstract = {Predictive models for the benthic macroinvertebrate community based on
   environmental variables facilitate the identification of the organisms
   expected to inhabit an area according to the target environmental
   conditions when restoring rivers. In this investigation, a biotic
   community predictive model was developed using benthic macroinvertebrate
   and environmental variable data collected from 1,210 sites in the
   Republic of Korea from 2010 to 2020. The sites were classified into six
   groups according to Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and
   based on their individual abundance/m(2) of benthic macroinvertebrates.
   The TWINSPAN groups were related to 14 variables by stepwise
   multi-discriminant analysis. The relative importance of the
   environmental variables that classified each TWINSPAN group was in the
   order of mean diameter of particle size, catchment area, altitude,
   velocity, total phosphorus, latitude, pH, longitude, conductivity, water
   depth, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, stream order, and
   total nitrogen. Discriminant functions 1-4 showed statistically
   significant and a predictive model was developed using functions 1 and 2
   based on Wilks' lambda values. The fit of the derived model was
   confirmed using Sorensen similarity (number of taxa) and Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity (individual abundance/m(2)) analyses between the predicted
   organisms and those observed at the sites. The distributions of
   similarity and dissimilarity that were confirmed by stream type ranged
   from 0.60 to 0.72 and 0.46-0.56, respectively, based on the mean. Based
   on the predicted and observed values, the ratio of shredders and
   scrapers to collectors showed similar results overall for each stream
   type. The predictive model derived using nationally managed available
   data is expected to be applicable to stream and river restorations in
   the future, as it provides a statistical assessment of the biotic
   communities that are expected to inhabit a given environment.},

Abstract = {Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic
   continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be
   associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of
   some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed)
   footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most
   paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some
   workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph
   ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is
   usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead
   attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a
   pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of
   the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal
   dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously
   available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those
   of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges
   from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of
   both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of
   prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal
   sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these
   features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit
   I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some
   pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all)
   morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been
   made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to
   determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.},

   including about its distribution and roost habitat. Our objectives were
   to document the distribution of Eastern Small-footed Bats and determine
   landscape and local characteristics that influence their probability of
   presence in the mountains of west-central Arkansas. Using acoustic
   monitoring, visual searches of rock formations, and mist-netting, we
   found that presence of Eastern Small-footed Bats was more likely in
   regions with talus slopes and nearby forest cover. These features may
   benefit the species by providing abundant options for roost switching,
   unique thermal properties, and short distances to foraging habitat.},

Abstract = {Understanding habitat use and nursery areas of larval fish is a key
   component to managing and conserving riverine fishes. Yet, freshwater
   researchers often focus only on adult fishes, resulting in a limited
   understanding of the habitat requirements for the early life stages of
   freshwater fishes. The goal of this study was to quantify the larval
   fish microhabitat use of three fish families in Twelvemile Creek, a
   fifth-order tributary of Lake Hartwell (Savannah River basin) in the
   Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. We used handheld dipnets to
   sample larval fishes along 20 equidistant transects spaced 10 m apart
   weekly from May to July 2021 along a 200 m stream reach. We also
   collected microhabitat data at each larval fish capture location. Most
   captured individuals were in the metalarval stage and were identified to
   the family level. A partial distance-based redundancy analysis indicated
   that water velocity contributed to changes in larval fish assemblage
   structure. Larval fishes occupied a subset of the available habitat that
   was characterized by low water velocity, non-Podostemum substrate, and
   shallow habitats close to the shore or bed rock structure. We also
   detected temporal patterns in larval fish counts, with peak Percidae and
   Leuciscidae counts in late July and the highest Catostomidae counts in
   late May-early June. Our results suggest that larval fishes select
   habitats with low water velocity and shallow habitats close to shore
   microhabitat characteristics, and that riffle-pool sequences may serve
   as a nursery habitat for Percidae, Catostomidae and Leuciscidae
   metalarvae.},

Title = {The effects of temperature and host-parasite interactions on parasite

Abstract = {Although the outcome of parasitic infections can be explained by a
   combination of environmental and host/parasite genetic factors, these
   factors are often confounded by geography. Thus, linking temperature, a
   locally variable environmental factor, with host and parasite genetics
   can reveal complex spatial host-parasite interactions. We used Daphnia
   magna genotypes from Central Europe, where the Hamiltosporidium
   tvaerminnensis parasite has not yet been reported, and from two regions
   where it is frequently found, Northern Europe and Mediterranean basin.
   In Central Europe habitats are usually permanent and hosts are typically
   in their planktonic phase during summer - the hottest time of the year.
   In Northern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, on the other hand, hosts
   inhabit ponds that frequently dry-up in summer. We predicted that high
   temperatures during host and parasite active phases would prevent
   long-term parasite persistence. By exposing all hosts to two parasite
   isolates at ambient and stressfully high temperatures we tested this
   prediction. At ambient temperatures, we confirmed that long-term
   parasite persistence is only possible in Northern and Mediterranean host
   genotypes, while we observed reduced persistence at high temperature,
   but only for the Mediterranean hosts. Virulence was higher in Northern
   host genotypes only at ambient temperature. These results were
   consistent among the two parasites isolates. Our findings, thus, do not
   corroborate our hypotheses and suggest that predictions about responses
   to future climate change are highly complex in this host-parasite
   system.},

Abstract = {The chorioallantoic membrane of oviparous reptiles forms a vascular
   interface with the eggshell. The eggshell contains calcium, primarily as
   calcium carbonate. Extraction and mobilization of this calcium by the
   chorioallantoic membrane contributes importantly to embryonic nutrition.
   Development of the chorioallantoic membrane is primarily known from
   studies of squamates and birds. Although there are pronounced
   differences in eggshell structure, squamate and bird embryos each
   mobilize calcium from eggshells. Specialized cells in the chicken
   chorionic epithelium transport calcium from the eggshell aided by a
   second population of cells that secrete protons generated by the enzyme
   carbonic anhydrase. Calcium transporting cells also are present in the
   chorioallantoic membrane of corn snakes, although these cells function
   differently than those of chickens. We used histology and
   immunohistology to characterize the morphology and functional attributes
   of the chorioallantoic membrane of corn snakes. We identified two
   populations of cells in the outer layer of the chorionic epithelium.
   Calbindin-D-28K, a cellular marker for calcium transport expressed in
   squamate chorioallantoic membranes, is localized in large, flattened
   cells that predominate in the chorionic epithelium. Smaller cells,
   interspersed among the large cells, express carbonic anhydrase 2, an
   enzyme not previously localized in the chorionic epithelium of an
   oviparous squamate. These findings indicate that differentiation of
   chorionic epithelial cells contributes to extraction and transport of
   calcium from the eggshell. The presence of specializations of
   chorioallantoic membranes for calcium uptake from eggshells in chickens
   and corn snakes suggests that eggshell calcium was a source of embryonic
   nutrition early in the evolution of Sauropsida.},

Abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of adaptations in coevolving species
   requires identifying the genes that underlie reciprocally selected
   phenotypes, such as those involved in venom in snakes and resistance to
   the venom in their prey. In this regard, California ground squirrels
   (CGS; Otospermophilus beecheyi) are eaten by northern Pacific
   rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus oreganus), but individual squirrels may
   still show substantial resistance to venom and survive bites. A recent
   study using proteomics identified venom interactive proteins (VIPs) in
   the blood serum of CGS. These VIPs represent possible resistance
   proteins, but the sequences of genes encoding them are unknown despite
   the value of such data to molecular studies of coevolution. To address
   this issue, we analyzed a de novo assembled transcriptome from CGS liver
   tissue-where many plasma proteins are synthesized-and other tissues from
   this species. We then examined VIP sequences in terms of three
   characteristics that identify them as possible resistance proteins:
   evidence for positive selection, high liver expression, and
   nonsynonymous variation across CGS populations. Based on these
   characteristics, we identified five VIPs (i.e., alpha-2-macroglobulin,
   alpha-1-antitrypsin-like protein GS55-LT, apolipoprotein A-II,
   hibernation-associated plasma protein HP-20, and hibernation-associated
   plasma protein HP-27) as the most likely candidates for resistance
   proteins among VIPs identified to date. Four of these proteins have been
   previously implicated in conferring resistance to the venom in mammals,
   validating our approach. When combined with the detailed information
   available for rattlesnake venom proteins, these results set the stage
   for future work focused on understanding coevolutionary interactions at
   the molecular level between these species.},

Abstract = {Systematic bias is one of the major phylogenetic issues arising over the
   last two decades. Using methods designed to reduce compositional and
   rate heterogeneity, hence systematic bias, Cai and co-workers (2022) (=
   CEA22) reanalyzed the DNA sequence dataset for Coleoptera of Zhang et
   al. (2018) (= ZEA). CEA22 suggest that their phylogenetic results and
   major evolutionary hypotheses about the Coleoptera should be favoured
   over other recently published studies. Here, we discuss the methodology
   of CEA22 with particular attention to how their perfunctory reanalysis
   of ZEA obfuscates rather than illuminates beetle phylogeny. Similar to
   published rebuttals of an earlier study of theirs, we specifically find
   that many of their claims are misleading, unsupported, or false.
   Critically, CEA22 fail to establish the stated premise for their
   reanalysis. They fail to demonstrate how composition or rate
   heterogeneity supposedly impacted the phylogeny estimate of ZEA, let
   alone the results of other recent studies. Moreover, despite their claim
   of comprehensive sampling of Coleoptera, their dataset is neither the
   most diverse with respect to species and higher taxa included, nor
   anywhere near the largest in terms of sequence data and sampled loci.
   Although CEA22 does contribute additional fossils for calibration, those
   seeking the best available estimate for Coleoptera phylogeny and
   evolution based on molecular data are advised to look elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Patterns in morphological variation are a central theme of evolution.
   Uncovering links between morphological character evolution and natural
   history, specifically feeding behaviour, is important to understanding
   biological diversity. Species within the sap beetles (Nitidulidae)
   exhibit a tremendous diversity of feeding behaviours. This immense
   diversity of feeding can be seen both between major lineages and very
   closely related taxa. Feeding behaviour diversity may drive
   morphological variation in several character systems (e.g., eyes). For
   example, in a shift from feeding on rotting fruit to flower-visiting
   (anthophily), selective pressures on the visual system may vary and
   ultimately lead to differences in eye morphology. We tested for
   potential morphological shifts in relative eye size among adult beetles.
   We specifically tested for significant relationships between relative
   eye size and the following factors flower-visiting and sex. We also
   tested for the influence of phylogeny on the evolution of relative eye
   size, implementing tests of trait correlation across a topology. We
   found greater relative eye size in taxa exhibiting anthophilous
   behaviour, regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or feeding behaviour
   of sister taxa. We were unable to recover a relationship between
   relative eye size and sex. Thus, feeding behaviour is currently the
   strongest predictor of eye size in sap beetles.},

Abstract = {Parapatrically distributed taxa pose a challenge for species
   delimitation due to the presence of gene flow and inherent arbitrariness
   of exactly defining the species boundaries in such systems. We tackled
   the problem of species delimitation in a parapatric species pair of
   Melitaea butterflies using two popular genomic methods-double digest
   restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) and target
   enrichment. We compared newly generated target enrichment dataset with
   1733 loci to the already available ddRAD data from a previous study on
   the same set of specimens using a suite of phylogenetic, population
   genetic, and species delimitation methods. We recovered consistent
   phylogenetic relationships across the datasets, both demonstrating the
   presence of a genetically distinct Balkan lineage and paraphyly of
   Melitaea athalia with respect to Melitaea celadussa. Population genetic
   STRUCTURE analyses supported the presence of two species when using
   ddRAD data, but three species when using target enrichment, while a
   Bayes factor delimitation analysis found both two and three species
   scenarios equally decisive in both datasets. As the results obtained
   from both methods were largely congruent, we discuss some practical
   considerations and benefits of target enrichment over RAD sequencing. We
   conclude that the choice of method of genomic data collection does not
   influence the results of phylogenetic analyses at alpha taxonomic level,
   given a sufficient number of loci. Finally, we recommend a solution for
   delineating species in parapatric scenarios by proposing that parapatric
   taxa be consistently classified as subspecies or complete species, but
   not both, to promote taxonomic stability.},

Abstract = {The Bigeye Chub (Hybopsis amblops) once inhabited streams and rivers in
   eastern and southeastern Illinois and was thought to be extirpated in
   the state by the 1970s. However, it was rediscovered in the 1990s from
   the Little Vermilion River. Today, H. amblops has become widespread and
   locally abundant in streams of the Wabash River drainage. Currently,
   little is known about the spawning and reproductive ecology of H.
   amblops. We conducted a study in the Salt Fork Vermilion River to
   determine the spawning schedule and microhabitats of H. amblops. Based
   upon near-weekly samples in May and June in 2019 and 2021, we determined
   H. amblops spawns in moderate water velocity over sandy gravel
   substrates when water temperatures are between 18-22 degrees C.
   Understanding such ecological traits is necessary for the continued
   success of H. amblops throughout its range.},

Abstract = {To study the response of the Vallisneria natans morphological and
   physiology to water level change, seedlings were placed in a submerged
   condition at depths ranging from 50 cm to 135 cm and set the rising and
   declining water levels respectively (0.2 cm/d, 0.5 cm/d, 0.8 cm/d, 1.1
   cm/d, 1.4 cm/d, 1.7 cm/d). After 50 days of simulation experiment, we
   observed the effects on plant height, the number of blades, root
   activity, biomass, chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b),
   chlorophyll (a + b) (Chl a + b), carotenoid (Car), soluble protein (SP)
   and soluble sugar (SS) of V. natans under different water level change
   rates. The results showed that (1) plant height and the number of blades
   showed an overall upward trend under the condition of high-rate water
   level change, while the low-rate change of water level showed a trend of
   first rising and then decreasing. (2) the root activity of 0.5-1.7 cm/d
   groups increased with the test time at rising water level, and the
   declining water level showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing.
   The total biomass showed an upward trend with the extension of the test
   time. (3) Chl a, Chl b, Chl (a + b), and Car showed a multi-peak
   downward trend with the extension of the test time. (4) the response of
   SP and SS to the test time showed a trend of first increase and then
   decrease with water level changes. In conclusion, our study demonstrates
   that the morphological and physiology of V. natans could adapt to water
   level changes, but it could be stressed if the water level exceeded the
   suitable range.},

Title = {Potential vulnerability of black bullheads to multiple predators in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Overabundant species can alter a fish community and negatively influence
   recreationally important species. Introducing new or more predators into
   a system to control such nuisance fish has been met with limited success
   and may involve some risk. Understanding to what degree consumption of
   nuisance species occurs by existing predators and whether an existing
   predator community is physically capable of consuming the nuisance
   species can help to determine whether biological control may be possible
   without new introductions of predators. The objectives of this study
   were to: (1) document consumption of black bullheads Ameiurus melas by
   three predators; and (2) determine the relative vulnerability and
   potential ingestion of bullheads by these predators. We used gastric
   lavage monthly from May through September to collect stomach contents of
   channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, largemouth bass Micropterus
   salmoides, and walleye Sander vitreus in four reservoirs to calculate
   the percent occurrence of black bullheads in predator stomachs. We also
   collected various sizes of juvenile black bullheads to measure body
   width and depth, with and without the pectoral and dorsal spines
   extended, respectively. This information was coupled with measured gape
   widths from the predators to calculate relative vulnerability curves and
   probabilities of ingestion based on predator size. Black bullheads were
   rarely consumed by the three predators, and stomach contents generally
   contained a single black bullhead when consumption did occur. Relative
   vulnerability based on body depth was similar for all three predators.
   Potential ingestion was similar among all three predators but was higher
   for channel catfish compared to the other two predators when black
   bullhead depths were measured with the dorsal spines extended. This
   study provides new information about the potential for biological
   control of black bullheads by an existing predator community.},

Abstract = {16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the changes in the
   microbial community structure of Macrobrachium rosenbergii (M.
   rosenbergii) larvae and environmental water at different stages (0, 7,
   14 and 21 days). The PICRUSt was used to precalculated the predicted
   genes and their functions. The Alpha and Beta diversity analysis showed
   that the abundance and uniformity of the flora of larvae and water
   samples were significantly different at four stages. At the phylum
   level, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were
   the dominant flora of larvae, while Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and
   Actinobacteria were the dominant flora of environmental water. But at
   the genus level, Raoultella and Blastopirellula were the main changes in
   larvae, and Dyadobacter, Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas were the main
   changes in environmental water. The gene function prediction analysis
   indicated that the amino acid metabolism, immune system, immune system
   disease, nervous system, sensory system and other pathways enriched in
   the different stages of larvae and environmental water were closely
   related to the breeding of M. rosenbergii. This research might provide

Title = {A comparison of fish communities between coves of varying connection to
   Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska},

Abstract = {Sediment berms of various heights have developed in the mouths of
   several coves within Harlan County Reservoir due to a combination of
   sediment deposition and lateral drift of eroded sediments. These berms
   can isolate coves from the main reservoir if the berm height is greater
   than the water elevation of the reservoir. Previous research in other
   reservoirs has shown that fish communities may differ in coves based on
   their connection histories. This study examines similarities and
   differences in fish assemblages between several disconnected coves and
   connected coves in Harlan County Reservoir. Connected coves had greater
   species richness and diversity compared to disconnected coves. Fish
   communities between cove types were relatively similar based on
   presence-absence data but notably different based on species abundance.
   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed that fish
   communities were distinct between cove types. Eleven fish species were
   indicators of connected coves, and two species were indicators of
   disconnected coves. Disconnected coves had higher abundances of
   understudied native species rarely found in the main reservoir, such as
   Orangespotted Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead. Further
   research evaluating the influence of water quality, food availability,
   and duration of isolation is needed to understand the effect of cove
   disconnection on fish communities. Managers can use this information
   when planning cove renovations by weighing the costs and benefits of
   either maintaining ecologically distinct coves versus connecting coves
   and improving habitat accessibility for reservoir fishes.},

Title = {Environmental DNA metabarcoding of fish communities in a small
   hydropower dam reservoir: a comparison between the eDNA approach and
   established fishing methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA methods have emerged as a promising tool in fish
   diversity studies and fishery management in various aquatic ecosystems.
   However, eDNA metabarcoding of fish communities in small hydropower dam
   reservoirs has received limited attention. In this study, we tested
   whether eDNA metabarcoding was an appropriate approach for the
   characterization of fish communities and fishery stock assessment by
   comparing its results with combined capture-based fishing methods and
   hydroacoustic surveys, which involved species detection and
   abundance/biomass evaluation. Our results indicated that the species
   detection performance of eDNA metabarcoding was basically similar to
   that of traditional capture-based fishing gear. However, it was also
   noteworthy that the eDNA method failed to cover all species detected by
   capture-based method, although some additional species were found.
   Besides, although we observed a significant correlation between site
   occurrence and sequence abundance for fishes, an effort to
   quantitatively establish a correlation between eDNA sequence counts and
   fish abundance/biomass was unsuccessful. Therefore, our study suggested
   that eDNA metabarcoding was an important supplementary tool to
   traditional capture-based fishing methods for the investigation and
   biomonitoring of fish diversity in small hydropower dam reservoirs.
   Further studies on the mechanisms of eDNA production, persistence,
   transportation and degradation in reservoirs might facilitate the
   interpretation of fish abundance and biomass from eDNA data.},

Abstract = {The state of the population of the invader Mnemiopsis leidyi (A.
   Agassiz, 1865), the concentration and composition of mesozooplankton,
   and the trophic relationships and predatory impact of M. leidyi on the
   prey populations in the western and eastern sectors of the open Black
   Sea were studied in July-August 2017. The average biomass of M. leidyi
   at the peak of its seasonal development in these areas was 92-258 g
   m(-2). The food spectrum of M. leidyi was dominated by copepods Acartia
   spp. and Calanus euxinus (Hulsemann, 1984). Spatial differences in the
   quantitative development of M. leidyi and zooplankton, the intensity of
   food consumption, and prey grazing were found. A high rate of food
   consumption (specific daily ration of 45.50 +/- 8.31\% C of body) and
   intensive grazing of M. leidyi (up to similar to 50\% of the biomass of
   Acartia spp. per day) in the western offshore part of the sea should be
   accompanied by a decrease in mesoplankton biomass. On the contrary,
   predation by M. leidyi did not significantly affect the plankton
   community in the east, where M. leidyi consumed about 6\% of the biomass
   of Acartia spp.},

Abstract = {The article summarizes information on the penetration and spread of 14
   most dangerous or potentially dangerous invasive species across the
   territory of Armenia, threatening natural biodiversity, natural
   ecosystems, and, to some extent, public health. It is shown that 8 out
   of 14 species were deliberately introduced into Armenia as ornamental
   plants or plants for landscaping of settlements and forest protection
   zones along roads and railways. At the same time, five of these species
   are arborous plants. Four species ended up on the territory of the
   republic as a result of their self-dispersal, and two species appeared
   as a result of unintentional introduction. The degree of threat to
   biodiversity and natural ecosystems is characterized as ``high{''} for
   seven species and ``very high{''} for four species, and three species
   are listed as ``potentially invasive.{''} At the same time, one species
   (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) represents a ``very high{''} threat to public
   health. The article proves the absolute necessity of conducting an
   examination on the threat of invasion when planning the introduction of
   plants in order to grow them in open ground, first of all, when creating
   plantations and using them in landscaping settlements and when creating
   or restoring damaged forest ecosystems and protective forest belts.},

Abstract = {Polygraphus proximus, a four-eyed fir bark beetle, is an invasive bark
   beetle species which has caused extensive damage to forests of Abies
   sibirica in southern and western Siberia and to Abies species in the
   European part of Russia. There is a high risk that the pest insect will
   spread to areas where it is currently not considered present, such as
   the European Union. In these areas, it threatens to attack conifer
   forests of various species which may result in major environmental and
   economic impact. The aim of this study was to identify pheromone
   components of P. proximus that can be used as pheromone baits. Males and
   females of P. proximus were allowed to bore into the bark of stem
   sections of Abies sibirica at the laboratory, and volatiles were
   collected with solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Analyses of these
   extracts with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed
   several sex-specific compounds. In total, twelve male-specific compounds
   and one female-specific compound were identified. The major
   male-specific compound determined by GC peak area was
   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol {[}(Z)-DMCHE] and the minor
   male-specific compounds were 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol,
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-2-butenal, benzyl alcohol, fragranol,
   7-methyl-3-methylene-6-octen-1-ol, (Z)- and
   (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde, geraniol, geranial and
   papayanol. The only female-specific compound was identified as
   1-hexanol. Two of the male-specific compounds, (Z)-DMCHE and
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol were shown to attract males and females of P.
   proximus in field studies. Thus, we now for the first time can present
   the structures of two male-specific components that are biologically
   active parts of P. proximus aggregation pheromone. However, some
   chemical communication overlap between P. proximus and P. subopacus
   needs to be further investigated as (Z)-DMCHE also attracted males and
   females of P. subopacus.},

Abstract = {A vast diversity of parasites associates with ants. Living in and around
   ant nests of these organisms must overcome ant colony defenses. As ant
   defensive behavior is mainly mediated by species-specific cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) or alarm pheromones, and ant-associated parasites
   can either crack their hosts' chemical communication code by modifying
   their own CHC profiles or use pro-active strategies like chemical
   weaponry for distraction and repellency. While the chemical nature of
   ant-parasite interactions has been intensively studied for highly
   host-specific parasites, the chemical-deceptive strategies of the rather
   rare ant-resembling heteropterans are unknown. To gain insight into this
   system, I studied the bug Scolopostethus pacificus (Barber 1918) which
   can be found near the nests of the ecologically dominant and aggressive
   velvety tree ant (Liometopum occidentale, Emery 1895). Using behavioral,
   chemical, and molecular approaches, I disentangled the relationship of
   S. pacificus and its host ant. Chemical profiling of the bug and the ant
   revealed that the bug does not make use of CHC insignificance or
   mimicry, but instead uses a cocktail of volatile compounds released from
   its metathoracic glands that likely moderates encounters with its
   aggressive host. Feeding trials with armed and artificially disarmed
   bugs revealed a defensive function of the gland exudates. Targeted
   molecular gut barcoding showed that S. pacificus does not feed on L.
   occidentale. These results suggest that chemical weaponry, rather than a
   chemical code-cracking CHC matching or chemical insignificance, enables
   S. pacificus to get along with and live in close proximity to its host
   ant.},

Abstract = {Florida scrub is a unique habitat type in the Southeastern United
   States. Once thought completely barren and undeserving of protection, it
   is now recognized for its unique geological history and high levels of
   endemism. Very few intact stands of Florida scrub remain today. Despite
   the attention given to certain taxa in this unique system, there exists
   a gap in the literature on the invertebrate communities in scrub
   wetlands, the dynamics of which are highly important for many threatened
   species. Herein, a list of aquatic invertebrate species from wetlands
   surveyed in 2017 in Martin County, FL, is presented. Several of these
   species represent new county records. This report provides a snapshot of

   Ordination diagrams reflecting the spatial distribution of stellate
   sturgeon in different years in the plane of two principal components

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the physicochemical characteristics regulating
   the distribution and abundance of M. marcella larvae in six wetlands in
   the northern Colombia. Standardized techniques for collecting
   invertebrate and physicochemical data were used in 29 sampling points in
   an intraannual period. Mean pH and temperature oscillated in narrow
   ranges within wetlands (7.7 +/- 0.09-8.6 +/- 0.07; 28.1 +/- 0.29-32.8
   +/- 0.17 degrees C, respectively), whereas ammonium concentrations and
   conductivity exhibited a wide variation (0.2 +/- 0.03-2.8 +/- 0.54 mg
   NH4 L-1; 861 +/- 30.7-19254 +/- 1706 mu S cm(-1), respectively). A total
   of 2586 individual M. marcella larvae were collected. Abundance was
   greater in wetlands influenced by the Magdalena River, with 19.4 +/- 1.7
   and 9.3 +/- 1.4 individuals; followed by wetlands hydrologically
   influenced by seasonal runoff, with 8.1 +/- 0.4 and 6.4 +/- 0.4
   individuals; and lowest in wetlands with influence of the Caribbean Sea,
   with 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 individuals. Abundances of M. marcella
   larvae exhibited similar variations at different months during the
   sampling period. Abundance and distribution of M. marcella larvae in
   wetlands of northern Colombia is strongly dependent on water
   conductivity, transparency and alkalinity. This study evidence that
   Odonata larvae are a valuable tool as bioindicators for wetland
   assessment and monitoring.},

Abstract = {Ondatra zibethicus (Common Muskrat) are often considered herbivores;

   the Coldwater River National Wildlife Refuge, Quitman County, MS,
   consisted of a ditch with a water-control structure on the edge of a

Abstract = {Food availability resulting from anthropogenic land-use changes may have
   contributed to the recent increase of Cathartes aura (Turkey Vulture)
   and Coragyps atratus (Black Vulture) populations. We assessed
   anthropogenic contributions to diets of these species by analyzing 176
   pellets collected from communal roosts in coastal South Carolina. To
   provide further insight into diets, we conducted a literature review of
   pellet-based studies for both species. Our pellet analyses demonstrated
   consumption of 12 mammal species with Odocoileus virginianus
   (White-tailed Deer) as the primary food item, present in 65\% of samples
   and constituting 35\% average percent volume in pellets. Mephitis
   mephitis (Striped Skunk) and Procyon lotor (Raccoon) were also commonly
   consumed. Presence of anthropogenic items in 47\% of pellets indicated
   substantial garbage consumption. Our review consisted of 14 studies and
   revealed wide variability in diet across study sites, with large mammals
   (>15 kg) typically comprising the majority of species consumed. We
   suggest that increasing deer populations provide an important source of
   carrion for vultures in this area and likely throughout eastern North
   America. Ungulate populations, roadkill, and garbage appear to
   contribute considerably to Turkey Vulture and Black Vulture diets. As
   such, mitigation of human-vulture conflict will require effective
   garbage and roadkill management as Turkey Vulture and Black Vulture
   populations increasingly expand.},

Title = {Modelling the effect of tourism disturbance on hatching rate of the

Abstract = {The endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is an
   endangered species among the conserved Chinese amphibians.
   Tourism-related pressures have increased for this species recently. The
   effect of tourism on the hatching rate of the target species was
   determined by experimentally observing the influences of different
   intensities of tourism disturbance on salamander in the Zhangjiajie
   Chinese Giant Salamander National Nature Reserve. Water quality factors
   (e.g. total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and Escherichia
   coli abundance) were analysed, and hatching rate was estimated. Results
   showed that high levels of tourism disturbance (500,000-1,200,000
   visitors per year) had active effects on the hatching time and negative
   effects on the hatching rate. The prediction performance of artificial
   neural network models was validated by the low root mean square error
   values of 2.2539 and 3.2612 for the training and testing data and high
   determination coefficient values of 0.9732 and 0.9508 for the training
   and testing data, respectively. The potential for positive or negative
   feedback mechanisms in such relationships between tourists and wildlife
   highlights the importance of considering both sides of the complex
   interaction to find a balance between the development of tourism and
   wild animal protection.},

Abstract = {On 17 June 2019, we collected a unique juvenile rattlesnake from a
   wildlife response call on Jekyll Island State Park, GA. The snake
   exhibited intermediate color patterns and gross anatomical features
   suggesting potential hybridization between Crotalus horridus
   (Canebrake/Timber Rattlesnake) and Crotalus adamanteus (Eastern
   Diamond-back Rattlesnake). Using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic
   sequencing, venom analyses, and morphological characteristics to test
   that hypothesis, we were able to verify that this specimen represents
   only the second documented observation of natural hybridization between
   C. adamanteus and C. horridus and the first reported with multiple lines
   of evidence sufficient for confirmation. Surprisingly, genetic analyses
   found evidence of previous intro-gression between these species,
   suggesting hybridization may not be a rare occurrence in the area (and
   perhaps specifically on Jekyll Island). We will continue to monitor the
   hybrid individual via radio-telemetry to assess its survival and any
   subsequent F2 hybridization reproduction events.},

Abstract = {The phytoplankton structure of ecologically diverse areas of the sea and
   the role of marine alien species in a formation of the quantitative
   indices of a community were studied in the autumn periods of 2008, 2009,
   and 2012 on the meridional and latitudinal trans-Caspian transects. A
   continuing transformation of the phytoplankton community in the Caspian
   Sea caused by the invasion of Black Sea diatoms, Chaetoceros peruvianus,
   Cerataulina pelagica, and Pseudo-nitzschia seriata, was observed. During
   the autumn bloom of the phytoplankton observed in November 2008, the
   abundance of alien species reached 1.3-2.3 x 10(5) cells/L; the
   contribution of C. peruvianus and P. seriata to the total raw biomass of
   the community reached 49-50\%. The highest abundance of alien species
   was registered for the shelf areas of the Middle Caspian at its eastern
   (C. peruvianus, 2.3 x 10(5) cells/L), western (P. seriata, 1.4 x 10(5)
   cells/L), and northern (C. pelagica, 1.3 x 10(5) cells/L) parts. During
   the period of studies, the northern expansion of the alien species in
   the Caspian Sea was limited by the isohaline 5.0, which coincided with
   the highly productive frontal zone (4.0-6.0) of the marginal filter of
   the Volga River. During the period preceding the autumn bloom
   (September-October), C. peruvianus was shown to be a part of the
   phytoplankton from the upper (25- to 30-m) productive water layer in
   both the Middle and Southern Caspian. During this period, the maximum
   abundance of this species (1.6 x 10(4) cells/L) was observed in the
   shallow areas of the Apsheron Sill and the eastern part of the Middle
   Caspian in the coastal wind upwelling zone.},

Abstract = {We performed systematic surveys for members of the Eurycea
   quadridigitata (Dwarf Salamander) complex in Georgia to determine the
   distribution of member species. Over 409 person-hours of search effort,
   we sampled 211 locations in 38 counties, detecting 108 individuals,
   including many that bridge substantial distribution gaps. Molecular data
   document Georgia specimens belong to 2 species, E. hillisi and E.
   quadridigitata. No specimens attributable to E. chamberlaini were found
   in Georgia, indicating this species has a distribution restricted to
   South and North Carolina. We used color patterns and measures of body
   size and shape of specimens identified by molecular methods to separate
   4 species of 4-toed Eurycea from the Coastal Plain of Alabama, Florida,
   Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Large body size and the
   presence of melanophores across the chin and surrounding the cloaca
   separated E. quadridigitata from all others. Additionally, E.
   sphagnicola and E. quadridigitata possessed dark sides to the body and
   tail, with these features being disrupted by irregular white stripes or
   spots. In contrast, E. chamberlaini and E. hillisi possessed light sides
   to the body and tail that lacked irregular white stripes. Small body
   size distinguished E. sphagnicola from E. quadridigitata, but no feature
   distinguished E. chamberlaini from E. hillisi.},

Abstract = {River water degradation arising from wastewater effluents is a major
   factor contributing to the deterioration of river ecosystems; yet direct
   evidence of the beneficial influence of long-term sewerage development
   on such ecosystems is scarce at a basin scale. The present study, over
   12 years, examined changes in sewerage connection rate, water quality,
   and invertebrate assemblages at 10 study sites in the Shigenobu River,
   southwestern Japan, and investigated the relationships between them.
   Sewerage connection rates increased in the three main municipalities in
   the basin during the study period (range: 8.6\%-31.4\%). At the lowland
   sites, the concentration of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) decreased by
   38.9\% on average and the richness metrics of invertebrate assemblages
   significantly increased at several sites. Furthermore, the richness
   metrics negatively related with TIN concentration, implying that
   invertebrate diversity recovery was the result of water quality
   improvement. Our findings strongly suggest that sewerage system
   improvement is an effective measure for restoring river ecosystems.},

Title = {The response of benthic diatom community to anthropogenic eutrophication
   of a river basin under agricultural influence in NE China},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication has universally threatened river ecological
   health and has been a key issue in river conservation. Agricultural
   sewage, which leads to increased nutrient levels and results in the loss
   of ecological function and biodiversity, results from the growth of
   agricultural activity and human populations. Consequently, attention has
   increasingly been focused on developing a relevant tool to describe the
   relationship between the biotic communities and anthropogenic
   eutrophication. The benthic diatom community has been widely used as an
   effective tool for indicating the ecological status of river systems
   especially in the context of recent international Water Framework
   Directive policies (WFD). In this study, a statistical method consisting
   of trophic status index (TSI), Specific Polluosensitivity Index (IPS),
   Descy Index (DES), redundancy analysis (RDA), and the geographic
   information system (GIS) technique was conducted to explore the response
   of benthic diatom community to anthropogenic eutrophication. Initially,
   the TSI, IPS and DES were determined to differentiate the trophic
   gradient along a gradient in agricultural intensity. Subsequently, RDA
   was used to identify spatial distribution patterns of environmental
   parameters and benthic diatom communities. Finally, the RDA scores as
   calculated and spatially interpolated were applied to GIS technology to
   reveal the response of benthic diatom communities to anthropogenic
   impacts along the trophic gradient. Our results revealed that the
   studied basin mostly exceeded the eutrophic level. Two different
   patterns of diatom communities response to ecological gradient were
   identified based on RDA, one representing the agriculture eutrophication
   discharges in electrical conductivity (EC) and the other representing
   organic pollution as chemical oxygen demand (COD). The developed method
   in this study highlight that the EC was more effective than the nutrient
   indices in determining diatom distribution in a eutrophic
   agriculturally-influenced river system.},

Abstract = {River ecosystems receive a large amount of organic matter, which will
   increase the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon
   dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Despite extensive
   research on the distribution of greenhouse gases and dissolved organic
   matter (DOM), little is known about the associations between greenhouse
   gases and DOM compositions. In this study, the distributions of GHGs
   (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and DOM in the overlying water of the main rivers
   around Taihu Lake were investigated. The results showed that the
   concentration of GHGs was positively correlated with dissolved organic
   carbon concentrations. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix
   fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were employed to identify the
   source of the DOM, which was related to protein-like and humic-like
   components. The DOM was a combination of terrigenous and endogenous
   origins. The GHGs (except CO2) were significantly associated with DOM
   composition. These results emphasize the importance of the relationship
   between GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and DOM compositions in river
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Extremely high abundances of Prasiola crispa-associated micrometazoans
   in East Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {To elucidate poorly known aspects of the microscopic metazoan
   distribution in ice-free parts of the Antarctic, we examined samples of
   the multicellular terres-trial alga Prasiola crispa, collected over the
   last decade in different parts of con-tinental East Antarctica and
   Haswell Island. We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae
   consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea),
   followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer
   assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species).
   Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities
   ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight
   and the maximum value num-bered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry
   sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with
   mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in
   the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of cor-relations
   between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and
   Na). Our findings are consistent with the patchy distribution of
   terrestrial micrometazoans in the Antarctic that has previously been
   found.},

Abstract = {We surveyed the Naval Air Station in Key West, FL, to document
   state-listed herpetofauna in 2 different vegetation types using 3
   motion-detecting infrared cameras centered within radiating drift
   fences. Cameras were activated on 21 June 2021 and retrieved on 30
   November 2021. Of 225,153 photos taken, 1210 were of vertebrates (603 of
   herpetofauna, 512 of mammals, and 95 of birds). July produced the most
   photographs of vertebrates per camera day (6.84/camera day), whereas
   August had the fewest (1.17/camera day), likely due to low
   precipitation. The mean time of day when vertebrate photos were taken
   was midday at 1247 hours. We found no Florida-listed birds or
   herpetofauna present on Navy lands during our camera-trap research;
   however, we did have 259 photos of the federally endangered Sylvilagus
   palustris hefneri (Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit). Additionally, 4 species of
   invasive herpetofauna were detected.},

Title = {Why are Svalbard Arctic foxes Brucella spp. seronegative?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are susceptible to smooth Brucella
   (s-Brucella) infection and may be exposed to such bacteria through the
   consumption of infected marine mammals, as implied by the finding of
   s-Brucella antibodies in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard have not previously been investigated for s-Brucella
   antibodies, but such antibodies have been detected in Arctic foxes in
   Iceland, Alaska (USA) and Russia. We investigated blood from Svalbard
   Arctic foxes for s-Brucella antibodies using an indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (iELISA). The animals (0???13 years old) were either
   caught by fur trappers (1995???2003, n = 403) or found dead (1995 and
   2003, n = 3). No seropositive animals were detected. Morbidity and
   mortality due to the infection cannot be ruled out. However, no known,
   large disease outbreaks of unknown aetiology have been reported.
   Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Svalbard Arctic fox is resistant to
   infection as Arctic foxes from other populations are susceptible, and
   there is circumpolar connectivity between populations. The discrepancy
   between the findings in Iceland and Svalbard is surprising as both
   populations are on islands with no known local sources of exposure to
   s-Brucella other than marine mammals. However, our negative findings
   suggest that marine mammals may not be a major source of infection for
   this species. Comparative investigations are needed in order to draw
   conclusions regarding the epizootiology of s-Brucella in Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard and Iceland.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) has important functions that regulate insect life.
   In adult individuals, it induces gonadotropic and behavioral changes.
   Manipulating JH levels helps to understand how it influences insect
   physiology. The effects of JH on Epiponini swarm-founding wasps have
   shown contrasting results, affecting reproduction, chemical compound
   expression, behavior, and age polyethism. In this study, we investigated
   whether JH affects reproductive physiology and production of fertility
   cues in a swarm-founding wasp species Polybia occidentalis in an
   age-controlled experimental setup. We treated newly emerged females with
   methoprene (JH analogue) and precocene-I (JH inhibitor) to determine
   their effects on ovary activation and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC)
   expression. Furthermore, we compared the chemical profiles of treated
   workers with those of queens. Our results show that methoprene and
   precocene-I affected the CHC production in P. occidentalis.
   Additionally, females treated with methoprene were chemically more
   similar to queens than precocene- and acetone-treated females.
   Methoprene affected ovarian status (increasing ovary activation). These
   results suggest that different levels of JH reflect changes in chemical
   and reproductive traits in P. occidentalis females. Furthermore, we
   point out the existence of fertility cues in this Epiponini wasp.},

Abstract = {With the aim of exploring the features of the phytoplankton community
   and eutrophication status in the lower reaches of the Haihe River Basin
   near Tianjin, sampling surveys were carried out in May, July and
   September of 2021. The results showed 53 dominant phytoplankton species
   in the survey area, of which 36 species were found in May, while 28 were
   found both in July and September. Ten dominant species were highlighted
   in the surveys, mainly belonging to Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta,
   Bacillariophyta, and Cryptophyta. The regions with relatively higher
   levels of phytoplankton biomass and abundance were Duliujian River,
   Qilihai Wetland and New Chaobai River, while the highest species
   richness and biodiversity occurred in Yuqiao Reservoir, Duliujian River,
   New Chaobai River and Ji Canal. The highest TN content was observed in
   Duliujian River, and the highest TP, chl-a, CODMn and EI were recorded
   in New Chaobai River. In contrast, the region with the lowest level of
   eutrophication was Yuqiao Reservoir. Correlation analysis and RDA
   analysis showed that the eutrophication assessment indices affecting the
   phytoplankton community and distribution of dominant species were mainly

Abstract = {Journals dedicated to the polar sciences have been outliers. Within both
   the history of science and the history of media, they stand out in
   several ways, including their comparatively late establishment of

   polar sciences journals began to carry predominantly peer-reviewed
   original research rather than synopses of research published elsewhere.
   This Perspective piece uses the 40th anniversary of Polar Research as an
   opportunity to look at the past of polar sciences periodicals-and

Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The endostoma of eurypterids is a small ventral structure previously
   known from only 11 specimens and in detail from only a single species,
   Eurypterus tetraganophthalmus. Four previously undescribed eurypterid
   specimens from the Samuel J. Ciurca Jr. Collection, Yale Peabody Museum
   of Natural History, likely belonging to Eurypterus, and a previously
   documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New
   York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and
   homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a
   bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly
   facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are
   noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates
   with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous
   interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh
   body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria.
   This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the
   metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.},

Abstract = {Myotis austroriparius (Southeastern Myotis) traditionally inhabit
   bottomland hardwood forests along the Atlantic coastal plain and lower
   Mississippi River Valley. This insectivorous bat is a species of
   conservation concern in Alabama and Georgia and was thought to be
   restricted to the Southern Coastal Plain and Southeastern Plains
   ecoregions. Based primarily on cave, transportation-structure, and
   mist-netting surveys, we documented occurrences of Southeastern Myotis
   in 14 Alabama and 20 Georgia counties outside and along the border of
   the accepted range, including in the Piedmont, Ridge and Valley,
   Interior Plateau, and Southwestern Appalachians ecoregions. We reviewed
   observations of bats year-round in both states, including pregnant and
   lactating females and winter hibernacula. Roosting sites included caves,
   culverts, bridges, and tree cavities. Combined, these observations
   provide strong evidence that the range of Southeastern Myotis should
   consist of all Alabama and Georgia except for the Blue Ridge ecoregion.
   This increase in distribution may result from increased surveying
   efforts and/or range expansion due to climate change, as observed in
   other southeastern bat species.},

Abstract = {Winter Bird Population Studies (WBPS) were initiated in 1948. The
   recommended minimum number of surveys for WBPS plots has been 8, but
   examination of the influence of the number of surveys on counts of
   individual species on WBPS plots has been restricted to only a few types
   of forested habitats in eastern North America. This study documents that
   10 surveys, not 8, were required to produce stable mean counts of most
   common and some uncommon species on a WBPS plot in an open to semi-open,
   urban habitat (central business district of Rockingham, NC). However,
   more studies are needed to produce stronger inferences about the minimum
   number of surveys required for counts of individual species on WBPS
   plots in other urban and non-urban habitat types. Until our knowledge is
   refined, observers should strongly consider conducting a minimum of 10
   surveys on WBPS plots in urban habitat types.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Florida is renowned for its non-native reptile communities, with 2 such
   pervasive non-native species including the apex predator Python
   bivittatus (Burmese Python) and the herbivorous Iguana iguana (Green
   Iguana) that showcase the spectrum of their ecological impacts. Both
   species have recently expanded into the Florida Keys. We used a camera
   trap to survey a radio-tagged Burmese Python and documented both
   non-native reptiles cohabitating in the active, natural stick-nest of an
   endangered rodent, Neotoma floridana smalli (Key Largo Woodrat), in
   Dagny Johnson Botanical State Park, Key Largo, FL. An additional nest
   visitor included Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola (Key Largo Cotton
   Mouse), another endangered rodent and potential prey for the python.
   Camera placement allowed us to detect both rodents on the exterior of
   the stick-nest. The presence of the Key Largo Woodrat and Key Largo
   Cotton Mouse at the nest warrant continued monitoring of the 2 reptile
   species and their interactions with the endangered small mammals as
   their presence becomes more common in the Florida Keys.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {589-601},
Abstract = {Bothriochloa ischaemum (Old World Bluestem) is a problematic invasive
   grass throughout the southern United States. We measured the long-term
   effects (12 years) of a single growing-season fire (September 2006) in a
   grassland dominated by Old World Bluestem. Prescribed fire drastically
   reduced Old World Bluestem cover (prefire: 76 +/- 4\% {[}mean +/-
   standard error], 2007: 8 +/- 2\%) and cover remained low (21 +/- 6\%) in
   2018 with no additional management. Surprisingly, Old World Bluestem
   cover in unburned plots decreased 12\% during the same time. After the
   burn, native graminoid cover peaked after 3 years (29 +/- 7\%) but
   decreased to 18 +/- 5\% by 2018, and native annual forb cover, almost
   absent before the fire, increased dramatically to 39 +/- 7\% in 2007,
   then quickly decreased to pre-burn levels. Native perennial forb cover
   more than doubled in 2007 and continued to increase to 58 +/- 5\% in
   2018. A single growing-season fire greatly reduced the cover of Old
   World Bluestem, likely due to high fuel loads, low rainfall, and
   phenological timing; the fire also allowed perennial forbs to establish.
   Restoring dominance of native grasses after removal of this invasive
   species will require additional active restoration such as seeding or
   planting.},

Title = {Population Characteristics of the Etheostoma pallididorsum Distler and

Abstract = {Etheostoma pallididorsum (Paleback Darter) is endemic to the headwater
   reaches of 2 river systems in the Ouachita Highlands of Arkansas.
   Records of low abundance and habitat alterations have resulted in the
   species' imperiled conservation status and being petitioned for federal
   listing under the Endangered Species Act. The objective of this study
   was to conduct seasonal surveys across the Paleback Darter's
   distribution to better characterize growth, spawning patterns, and
   mortality using the seasonal von Bertalanffy statistic with an optimized
   electronic length frequency analysis (ELEFAN), as well as assess sex
   ratios throughout a calendar year to better inform future conservation
   management decisions for the species. We established seasonal survey
   collection sites at 4 localities and sampled with a backpack
   electrofishing unit and dip nets from January 2016 to October 2017. The
   study indicated relatively high abundance, based on catch per unit
   effort (CPUE), across all sampled localities throughout the duration of
   the study, with representation of the entire population from 3 age
   classes: 0, 1, and 2. Growth and coarse spawning patterns, based on the
   seasonal von Bertalanffy statistic, were comparable between the
   populations, suggesting similar and stable environmental factors
   throughout the distribution. Lastly, there was evidence of multiple
   spawn events occurring during winter and late spring or early summer
   that has not been documented for this species, warranting additional
   research. Collectively, this study, though narrow in scope and with
   limited data, suggest that the Paleback Darter populations assessed are
   not impaired. The endemic status and narrowly fragmented distribution of
   the Paleback Darter, however, still renders this species vulnerable to
   extirpation or extinction by stochastic events.},

Abstract = {The reproductive output of Malaclemys terrapin (Diamond-backed Terrapin)
   is highly variable across its geographic range. While much of the
   literature is based on populations from the Atlantic coast of the United
   States, little reproductive-output data exists for the Gulf of Mexico
   populations. We captured female Diamond-backed Terrapins in southwestern
   Louisiana and assessed their reproductive output using radiographic-and
   ultrasound-imaging techniques. X-rays identified that average clutch
   size was 7.2 and average egg width was 21.9 mm. We revealed a positive
   relationship between female size (plastron length) and both clutch size
   and egg width, but no relationship between egg size and clutch size.
   Ultrasound imaging in a subset of individuals revealed large
   pre-ovulatory follicles and fully shelled eggs concurrently in females,
   indicating the potential for at least 2 clutches annually in this
   region. Our results suggest Diamond-backed Terrapins in southwestern
   Louisiana show variation in reproductive output compared to other
   populations at similar latitudes, indicating the need for additional
   study within and between populations in the region.},

Abstract = {Varanus salvator (Asian Water Monitor) is the second largest species of
   lizard in the world and is a member of the Varanidae Family. This highly
   aquatic species can also be found in arboreal environments and is an
   active predator and scavenger. Originating from southeastern Asia,
   including parts of India, this species is common in the international
   pet trade. Its popularity in the pet trade has led to multiple
   introductions outside of their native range, making this a species of
   concern as potentially invasive to the southeastern US with ready access
   to the Caribbean and Latin America. As a generalist species that has
   already been identified in Florida, there is a high likelihood for
   establishment as an invasive species. In cases such as these,
   implementing early detection and rapid response for successful
   management of invasive species is critical. Here, we provide a
   comprehensive summary of natural history findings on the Asian Water
   Monitor, including management methods and potential ecological impacts
   as an invasive species.},

Title = {Comparison of the Relative Abundance of Potential Prey to the Diet of
   the Louisiana Pine Snake (Pituophis ruthveni)},
Journal = {SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pituophis ruthveni (Louisiana Pine Snake) occurs in parts of western
   Louisiana and eastern Texas and was recently listed as a threatened
   species under the Endangered Species Act. It is considered a diet
   specialist because it mostly feeds upon Geomys breviceps (Baird's Pocket
   Gopher). which make up similar to 75\% of its estimated total prey
   biomass. Diet specialization is rare among vertebrates. One factor that
   can influence dietary diversity is the availability and abundance of
   prey items. To gain more insight on the Louisiana Pine Snake's diet, we
   sampled terrestrial and subterranean small mammals across 3 study sites
   within the range of this snake species in Louisiana to determine their
   relative abundance and availability. We compared these results to diet
   studies of the Louisiana Pine Snake to determine if any small mammal
   species were consumed more often than expected. The total of 59 small
   mammals captured consisted of Baird's Pocket Gopher, Sigmodon hispidus
   (Hispid Cotton Rat), Peromyscus spp. (deer mice), and Reithrodontomys
   spp. (harvest mice). Baird's Pocket Gopher had significantly higher
   relative abundances and biomass than terrestrial small mammals. When
   compared to proportions of actual consumed prey species, the Louisiana
   Pine Snake preyed upon Baird's Pocket Gopher significantly more than
   expected based on their availability in the environment. Finally,
   Chesson's prey selection index determined that the Louisiana Pine Snake
   positively selected Baird's Pocket Gopher, while the other species were
   either randomly or negatively selected. The results of this research
   provide some insight into the factors affecting the diet choices of the
   Louisiana Pine Snake.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Accelerated warming of the Arctic has reduced sea ice and has increased
   the occurrence of winter extreme events like rain-on-snow and storms
   that impact sonal movements and grazing conditions. We used caribou
   movements between Banks, Melville and Victoria islands and mainland
   Canada, documented from Indigenous Knowledge, to assess whether
   spatiotemporal trends in sea-ice anomalies (1983-2019) can be used as an
   indicator of caribou movement. We used the SNOWPACK model to evaluate
   how foraging conditions (as indexed by simulated snow properties)
   contribute to the prediction of caribou presence. Our results suggest
   that changes in sea-ice anomalies over time have impacted caribou
   crossings between islands: caribou no longer use areas with less sea ice
   whilst they continue to use areas with more sea ice. Our model
   evaluation shows that, when the simulated snow conditions are paired
   with other environmental variables, the ability of models to predict
   Peary caribou occurrence on land was enhanced across Banks and Melville
   islands. Overall, the land models suggest that caribou are more likely
   to occupy areas with lower density of snow accumulation and a majority
   of forb tundra with dwarf shrubs for Banks Island and cryptogam tundra,
   rush and grass for the Melville Island Complex. Our results suggest that
   future work monitoring changes in sea-ice and snow conditions will be
   important for understanding the impact of climate change on the
   distribution of Peary caribou in the western Arctic.},

   associated with earlier seasonal fragmentation and shorter annual
   per-sistence of sea-ice cover, potentially affecting the life history of
   the Pacific walrus. In this study, 24 Landsat satellite images were
   classified into thick ice, thin ice or open water to assess sea-ice
   fragmentation over the spring-summer breakup period. Geospatial
   fragmentation analyses traditionally used in terres-trial landscapes
   were newly implemented in this study to characterize the ices -cape
   environment. Fragmentation of sea ice was assessed based on the Percent
   of Landscape, Number of Patches, Mean Area, Shape Index, Euclidean
   Nearest Neighbor and Edge Density. Results show that lower sea-ice
   concentrations in both the SLI and Wainwright regions were associated
   with smaller sea-ice floes. In the Bering Sea, lower sea-ice
   concentrations were also associated with increases in the number of ice
   floes, floe isolation and edge density. By contrast, lower sea-ice
   concentrations in the Chukchi Sea were associated with ice floes that
   were more circular in shape. The continuation of sea-ice decline with
   shift-ing icescape characteristics may result in walruses having to swim
   longer dis-tances in the northern Bering Sea and adapt to use
   less-preferred, rounder ice floes in the Chukchi Sea.},

Title = {Hormone profiles from Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and aquarium beluga whales},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from Cook Inlet (CI), Alaska, are
   listed as ???endangered??? because of dramatic declines in abundance,
   with no indications of population recovery. Serum samples from this
   population are exceedingly rare. Longitudinal samples from aquarium (AQ)
   belugas can potentially provide health assessment reference ranges for
   free-ranging beluga, including reproduc-tive and metabolic hormones. We
   analysed serum hormone concentrations from CI (n = 6, three females and
   three males) and Bristol Bay (Alaska; BB; n = 5, four males and one
   female), alongside AQ (n = 3, two females and one male) belugas, to
   conduct physiological comparisons of reproductive hormones
   (progesterone, testosterone and total oestrogens) and metabolic hormones
   (total thyroxine, triiodothyronine and cortisol) in beluga serum.
   Oestrogen and progesterone profiles from January through May from two AQ
   female beluga were typical of non-pregnant, cycling females. CI and BB
   sex steroid concentrations were within AQ hormone ranges, with the
   exception of elevated progesterone concentrations in four potentially
   pregnant females. Both CI and BB belugas had elevated meta-bolic
   hormones, which may indicate greater metabolic effort required in the
   wild environment or capture response. Because sample collection from CI
   belugas is rare, analysis of even the few samples that we analysed may
   contribute to the conservation of the small and declining population of
   genetically distinct CI beluga whales. It is important that each sample
   collected from free-range CI belu-gas provides the maximum biological
   information possible. Continued compari-son of hormones in AQ and
   free-ranging beluga will enhance the interpretation of health data in
   both groups.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Many areas in the Arctic are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change. We observe large-scale effects on physical, biological, economic
   and social parameters, including ice cover, species distributions,
   economic activity and regional gover-nance frameworks. Arctic living
   marine resources are affected in various ways. A holistic understanding
   of these effects requires a multidisciplinary enterprise. We synthesize
   relevant research, from oceanography and ecology, via economics, to
   political science and international law. We find that multidisciplinary
   research can enhance our understanding and promote new questions and
   issues relating to impacts and outcomes of climate change in the Arctic.
   Such issues include recent insights on changing spawning migrations of
   the North-east Arctic cod stock that necessitates revisions of
   socioeconomic estimates of ecosystem wealth in the Barents Sea, better
   integrated prediction systems that require increased coopera-tion
   between experts on climate prediction and ecosystem modelling, and
   institu-tional complexities of Arctic governance that require enhanced
   coordination.},

Abstract = {Riverine ecosystems contribute considerable fisheries production.
   However, in Ethiopia, there is a lack of comprehensive biological
   studies on such ecosystems. This study assessed the feeding habits of
   commercially important fishes of the Ayima and Gelegu Rivers. Fishes'
   guts were sampled seasonally from April 2017 to November 2018 using gill
   nets, cast nets and electrofishing. Four hundred and forty-nine stomachs
   were analysed. Niche breadth and overlap indices were estimated using
   Levin and Schoener indices, respectively. The data indicated that
   Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), Bagrus docmak (Forsskal, 1775) and
   Hydrocynus forskahlii (Cuvier, 1819) mostly preyed on fish, whereas
   Heterotis niloticus (Cuvier, 1829) and Labeobarbus bynni (Forsskal,
   1775) consumed detritus and macrophytes. H. niloticus, L. bynni and H.
   forskahlii were generalist feeders. There was a slight ontogenetic
   dietary shift observed in some predator fishes. In smaller sized L.
   bynni (6-20 cm, TL), insects and ostracods were important preys and
   their contribution differed significantly (p < 0.05). In H. forskahlii,
   the volumetric contribution of bivalves and detritus differed
   significantly amongst the different size classes. Generally, resource
   availability had little effect on the feeding behaviour of most fishes.
   This implies that fishes in floodplain rivers can forage any available
   prey without preference and accustom to a general feeding strategy to
   form biologically insignificant dietary overlap.},

Abstract = {Invasive exotic species are problematic to biodiversity conservation.
   However, the knowledge of exotic invaders in tropical forests remains
   limited. Lessons from sites elsewhere suggest that the problem could be
   worse than is known. To increase our understanding of this problem, we
   surveyed exotic woody plants in Mabira Central Forest Reserve, Uganda.
   The site has a long history of anthropogenic disturbance. Seven woody
   exotic species were encountered, three of which had population
   structures indicative of invasiveness and distributions suggestive of
   the early stages of invasion. One of these species Senna spectabilis
   (DC.) H.S.Irwin \& Barneby was localised to an 8.6 ha site north of the
   reserve. Terminalia superba Engl. \& Diels occurred mainly in an 8.7 ha
   patch south of the reserve, while Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. was more
   widely distributed. T. superba has been reported to be invasive in two
   other countries, but it is not yet clear whether or not the reported
   invasions are occurring in protected forests. A. heterophyllus is
   reported to be invasive in various countries, yet rarely quantitatively
   demonstrated outside the Brazilian Atlantic forests. S. spectabilis is a
   common invasive in forests throughout the tropics, and this is the first
   report of its invasiveness in this reserve.},

Abstract = {This study investigated for the first time species richness, abundance
   of butterflies and disturbed habitats in Souk Ahras Forest. The
   assessment of butterflies' diversity and relative abundance was
   conducted from July 2019 to July 2021. We recorded 60,696 individuals of
   49 butterfly species belonging to six families (Papilionidae, Pieridae,
   Lycaenidae, Nymphalidae, Hesperiidae and Sphingidae). Nymphalidae was
   dominant by 19 species, followed by Lycaenidae 13 species, Pieridae 10
   species, Hesperiidae 4 species, Papilionidae 2 species and diurnal moths
   `Sphingidae' with only one species. The highest number of species was
   recorded in oaks groves (medium high altitude) with 35 species; in terms
   of abundance, grassland (low altitude) dominates in number (n = 20,094).
   The lowest species diversity (S = 7) and number of individuals (n =
   1227) were recorded in the Dense tree stratum scrub station which
   records significant water pollution. We notice that the abundance of
   butterflies was important during the spring and summer periods but less
   important during the winter. Landscape composition and habitat influence
   butterfly diversity and their dynamics. Many species used more than one
   distinct habitat type, or just one special habitat; we suggest that
   vegetation cover is an important mechanism for butterfly diversity
   persistence in forest ecosystems mosaics.},

Title = {Managing cumulative impacts and protected areas in Antarctica: what can
   we learn from the rest of the world?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {For more than 20 years Antarctic Treaty Parties have been discussing how
   to appropriately manage cumulative impacts in the continent. Preventing
   cumu-lative impacts requires the fluent exchange of information to
   enable proper and timely assessment of, and response to, the impacts
   that result from multiple activities, undertaken by multiple
   stakeholders and supervised by different Parties. This is a particular
   challenge for the effective management of Antarctic Specially Protected
   Areas (ASPAs), as a lack of coordination may potentially put at risk the
   fulfillment of their conservation objectives. Here we suggest that
   incorporating lessons learnt from protected areas management elsewhere
   might improve the effectiveness of ASPAs and provide valuable
   experiences and insights on how to better manage cumulative impacts in
   the rest of the continent. Key concepts to incorporate in Antarctica???s
   environmental manage-ment toolbox include (1) the notion of adaptive
   management, which is a cor-nerstone of protected areas management

Title = {Citizen science indicates significant range recovery and defines new
   conservation priorities for Earth's most endangered pinniped in Greece},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Conservation actions for endangered species often require detailed data
   over large temporal and spatial scales, which are usually hard to obtain
   from traditional scientific surveys that operate at localized scales. In
   contrast to the terrestrial conservation world where citizen science has
   become nowadays a highly relevant and useful tool to overcome such
   difficulties, Marine Citizen Science is still highly underrepresented.
   Using a dataset of 20 years of citizen science data and appropriate
   statistical modelling, we developed a methodological approach to monitor
   the presence of the endangered, notoriously elusive Mediterranean monk
   seal Monachus monachus. We used sighting data collected in Greece from
   2000 to 2020 and fitted dynamic occupancy models that allow inferring
   range dynamics whilst accounting for species imperfect detectability to
   estimate species occupancy. The occurrence of Mediterranean monk seals
   of all age categories combined, and pups separately, increased during
   the study period. Mediterranean monk seal occurrence increased also
   spatially: the distribution of the species in Greece increased by
   approximately 12.5\% for seals of all age categories and by
   approximately 185\% for monk seal pups. Most of this distribution (i.e.
   67 and 72\% of the distribution of seals of all age categories and of
   pups, respectively) was located within the boundaries of the network of
   protected areas in the country. These results indicate a significant
   range recovery of the Mediterranean monk seal in Greece over the last
   two decades and facilitate the prioritization of conservation actions
   for the species in the country. We demonstrate how occupancy modelling
   and citizen science can be used to evaluate the distribution of an
   endangered species and become a highly relevant and reliable tool in
   marine mammal conservation. We advocate the increased use of citizen
   science in the conservation of the Mediterranean monk seal in the
   eastern Mediterranean Sea.},

Title = {Simulated genetic efficacy of metapopulation management and conservation
   value of captive reintroductions in a rapidly declining felid},

Abstract = {In South Africa, cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) occur as a relictual,
   unmanaged population of `free-roamers', a managed metapopulation across
   fenced reserves, and in various captive facilities. To ensure that the
   Cheetah Metapopulation Project (CMP) is not at risk of losing overall
   genetic variation to drift or inbreeding, we propose various
   interventions, including exchanges between free-roamers and the
   metapopulation or supplementation with unrelated individuals from
   captivity. Simulated trajectories of genetic diversity under such
   intervention strategies over time could directly inform conservation
   action and policy towards securing the long-term genetic integrity of
   the CMP. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for 172
   adult cheetahs across the free-roamer population, the metapopulation,
   and three major captive facilities. Management intervention trajectory
   models were tested including, (1) no intervention, (2) genetic exchange
   between free-roamers and the metapopulation, (3) translocation from a
   single captive facility and (4) translocation from several captive
   facilities into the metapopulation. Discriminant Analysis of Principal
   Components (DAPC) showed that two captive populations are highly
   differentiated from the metapopulation and each other, whilst the third
   captive and free-roamer populations are genetically more similar to the
   metapopulation. Simulated genetic variation over 25 generations
   indicated that models 1 and 2 show significant losses of heterozygosity
   due to genetic drift and present a proportional increase in the
   frequencies of 1st- and 2nd-degree relatives, whilst this variation and
   pairwise relatedness remain relatively constant under models 3 and 4. We
   emphasise the potential importance of captive facilities as reservoirs
   of genetic diversity in metapopulation management and threatened species
   recovery.},

Title = {Response of farmland reptiles to agricultural intensification: Collapse
   of the common adder Vipera berus and the western green lizard Lacerta
   bilineata in a hedgerow landscape},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {25},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agricultural landscapes cover a large portion of the planet and the
   intensification of farming is a primary cause of biodiversity loss.
   Changes in agricultural practices have been particularly marked in
   Western Europe over the last century. Hedgerow landscapes consist of
   complex mosaics of pastures, ponds, and hedges connected with forest
   patches that are favourable for biodiversity. Recently, however, these
   traditional farming landscapes have been profoundly simplified with a
   massive reduction in hedgerows. Reptiles are currently facing an
   important global decline, but the impact of the intensification of
   agricultural practices on their populations remains understudied. We
   studied the common European adder Vipera berus and the western green
   lizard Lacerta bilineata in Western France in a hedgerow landscape
   undergoing agricultural intensification. We first quantified the habitat
   changes (density of hedgerows and forest edges) from 1950 to 2015.
   Second, we documented changes in the distribution of V. berus and L.
   bilineata in the area between two surveys conducted 18 years apart
   (survey 1: 1994-1997 and survey 2: 2012-2015). The two species were more
   likely to be found at sites with dense hedgerows and forest edges at the
   first survey. We detected marked range contractions in the distributions
   of both species over 18 years (92\% and 74\%, respectively, for V. berus
   and L. bilineata). Population monitoring of the adder with
   capture-mark-recapture at two sites revealed marked declines related to
   the degradation of hedgerows and closure of the forest patches. Our
   results underline the importance of traditional agricultural landscapes
   for biodiversity conservation and the value of squamate reptiles as
   indicator speciesed in such landscapes.},

Title = {Disproportionate admixture improves reintroduction outcomes despite the

   for a translocation of the greater stick-nest rat},

Volume = {26},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Translocation is becoming an increasingly important approach to
   threatened species conservation. Coupled with the knowledge that
   maximizing genetic diversity aids population establishment, the growing
   use of translocations can place unsustainable harvesting pressure on
   critical and vulnerable source populations. However, adaptive,
   genetically informed modelling tools such as Population Viability
   Analysis (PVA) can be used to predict translocation outcomes and
   optimize harvesting strategies. In this study, we use PVAs for the
   frequently translocated greater stick-nest rat (Leporillus conditor) to
   demonstrate the value of admixing founder populations for translocation,
   even when one source population is deemed genetically depauperate. This
   approach not only maximizes genetic diversity in the translocated
   population but reduces harvesting pressure on critical populations.
   Further, we show that admixed harvesting ratios can be skewed
   significantly towards the genetically depauperate population in order to
   further protect the critical population while still producing favourable
   outcomes, providing adequate founder numbers are used. As many
   threatened species are limited to fragmented and bottlenecked
   populations, these results are broadly applicable to the science of
   reintroduction biology, and demonstrate the value of PVAs for
   preliminary translocation planning and species management.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, nature-based tourism is becoming more popular and important
   economically. However, there is still debate regarding its impact on
   wildlife in protected areas. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to
   investigate the effects of tourism on the mammal community of Cavernas
   do Peruacu National Park, a priority area for conservation in Brazil. We
   used camera traps to survey tourist and non-tourist trails during
   2011-2017, encompassing periods before and after tourism started in the
   Park. We used four metrics for assessment: species richness, probability
   of using trails, activity levels and daily activity patterns. After
   tourism began in the Park there was no significant change in species
   richness and the probability of using tourist trails either increased or
   remained stable for five of the six species assessed. The rock cavy
   Kerodon rupestris was the only species to be displaced from tourist
   areas and to show reduced overall activity on tourist trails after
   tourism began. The ocelot Leopardus pardalis showed reduced diurnal
   activity on tourist trails, an indication of temporal adjustment.
   Overall, our results show that the initial years of visitation at the
   Park had limited negative impacts on the target mammal species,
   supporting the possibility of accommodating tourism activity and
   effective conservation of wildlife in the region. However, it is
   essential to continue monitoring in the Park because of the expected
   growth in tourism and potential time lags in responses of species.},

Abstract = {As threats facing wildlife and protected areas across Africa increase,
   demand for innovative and transformational leadership to tackle the
   challenges remains high. Traditional academic training programmes are
   playing a critical role in meeting capacity development needs, yet
   opportunities for strengthening leadership capabilities are limited.
   This was the rationale behind Mentoring for ENvironmental Training in
   Outreach and Resource conservation (MENTOR), initiated in 2007 by the
   U.S. Fish \& Wildlife Service through a collaborative effort with
   various partners to support conservation leadership and capacity
   development across sub-Saharan Africa. Five independent programmes were
   implemented over a decade, each designed to combine rigorous academic
   and field-based training with mentoring and experiential learning for
   teams of 8-9 fellows selected through a competitive process. It was
   envisioned that this approach to leadership and capacity development
   would strengthen the resolve, capabilities and competences of the
   fellows and position them as conservation leaders. Using data from
   interviews and online surveys, we assessed three key aspects of the
   programmes: strategic relevance and design; progress, effectiveness and
   impact; and sustainability. Overall, we found that all five programmes
   successfully delivered the objective of strengthening leadership for
   conservation in Africa, with the cadre of professionals acquiring new
   skills and expertise to advance their careers, and developing life-long
   relationships and networks. We discuss the potential of this approach
   for developing African conservation leaders.},

Title = {Group composition impacts reproductive output and population viability
   in captive white rhinoceros},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {290-302},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Captive breeding programmes can play an important role in the
   conservation of species threatened with extinction in the wild. White
   rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, have suffered drastic declines due to
   illegal poaching across their range, and captive populations have the
   potential to safeguard this species from extinction. However, white
   rhinoceros birth rates in captivity have been extremely low, and there
   is substantial variation in breeding success between different
   institutions. A better understanding of the factors limiting their
   reproduction in captivity could improve their breeding management and
   conservation potential. This study used studbook data (n = 467) and
   comparisons with wild populations in Kenya (n = 236) to assess the
   breeding performance and viability of the European captive southern
   white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum simum, population. Our results
   show that the European population is declining 2\% annually under
   current demographic parameters. On average, just 10\% of females calved
   annually, in comparison to almost 40\% across wild populations. To
   become self-sustaining, this must increase to a minimum of 17\%, though
   reaching this target may lead to additional management challenges.
   Further analyses using studbook (n = 134 individuals) and
   multi-institutional questionnaire data (n = 20 institutions) suggest
   that modifying the social structure of captive groups could improve
   female breeding success. Institutions housing larger groups had
   proportionally greater breeding success, and females were more likely to
   copulate if housed with another breeding female, and more receptive to
   bulls if housed in a group with a lower mean age. These findings
   highlight the importance of considering social conditions in captive
   breeding programmes, particularly for species with complex social
   systems and low reproductive rates.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest of South America supports a rich terrestrial
   biodiversity but has been reduced to only a small extent of its original
   forest cover. It hosts a large number of endemic mammalian species but
   our knowledge of arboreal mammal ecology and conservation has been
   limited because of the challenges of observing arboreal species from
   ground level. Camera trapping has proven to be an effective tool in
   terrestrial mammal monitoring but the technique has rarely been used for
   arboreal species. For the first time in the Atlantic Forest, we obtained
   data on the arboreal mammal community using arboreal camera trapping,
   focusing on Caparao National Park, Brazil. We placed 24 infrared camera
   traps in the forest canopy in seven areas within the Park, operating
   them continuously during January 2017-June 2019. During this period the
   camera traps accumulated 4,736 camera-days of footage and generated a
   total of 2,256 photographs and 30-s videos of vertebrates. The arboreal
   camera traps were able to detect arboreal mammals of a range of body
   sizes. The mammal assemblage comprised 15 identifiable species,
   including the Critically Endangered northern muriqui Brachyteles
   hypoxanthus and buffy-headed marmoset Callithrix flaviceps as well as
   other rare, nocturnal and inconspicuous species. We confirmed for the
   first time the occurrence of the thin-spined porcupine Chaetomys
   subspinosus in the Park. Species richness varied across survey areas and
   forest types. Our findings demonstrate the potential of arboreal camera
   trapping to inform conservation strategies.},

Journal = {ORYX},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {55-62},

Abstract = {With the advent of automated recording units, bioacoustic monitoring has
   become a popular tool for the collection of long-term data across
   extensive landscapes. Such methods involve two main components: hardware
   for audio data acquisition and software for analysis. In the acoustic
   monitoring of threatened species, a species-specific framework is often
   essential. Jerdon's courser Rhinoptilus bitorquatus is a Critically
   Endangered nocturnal bird endemic to a small region of the Eastern Ghats
   of India, last reported in 2008. Here we describe a reproducible and
   scalable acoustic detection framework for the species, comparing several
   commonly available hardware and detection methods and using existing
   software. We tested this protocol by collecting 24,349 h of data during
   5 months. We analysed the data with two commercially available sound
   analysis programmes, following an analysis pipeline created for this
   species. Although we did not detect vocalizations of Jerdon's courser,
   this study provides a framework using a combination of hardware and
   software for future research that other conservation practitioners can
   implement. Vocal mimicry can aid or confound in detection and we
   highlight the potential role of mimicry in the detection of such
   threatened species. This species-specific acoustic detection framework
   can be scaled and tailored to monitor other species.},

Abstract = {The paucity of biodiversity assessments in the Palaeotropics has
   constrained recommendations for tropical forest conservation in areas
   such as Siberut, one of the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia known for its
   high endemicity. Taking advantage of information from museum collections
   amassed from the Indo-Malaya archipelago from the early 20th century
   onwards, we show how species records available through online databases
   of natural history collections can be used to assess the state of
   biodiversity when used in conjunction with a field survey, using bat
   species on Siberut as a study case. We obtained a total of 15 years of
   records from 1903 to 2013 (following searches of databases up to 2020),
   documenting 20 bat species on Siberut. Of these, our field survey
   contributed records of three additional species not previously recorded
   on the island. The species accumulation curve has not levelled off,
   suggesting that future surveys may discover additional bat species and
   highlighting Siberut's importance as bat habitat and source of tropical
   biodiversity.},

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sustainable ecotourism development and conservation depend on
   understanding factors that affect flagship species. This study analysed
   environmental factors and their effects on flagship species: African
   buffalo (Syncerus caffer), red-river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), olive
   baboon (Papio anubis), duiker (Cephalophus spp.), and crocodile
   (Crocodylus niloticus) distribution in Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary
   (BWS). Secondary data (camp reports 2017-2019) showed flagship species
   distribution across four vegetation types in 14 sites. Field
   observations were used to reconstruct camp report information using GPS
   coordinates to show animal distribution. Environmental factors were
   assessed based on the scope and severity of their threats to the
   species. PAST ver.3.06 was used to analyse animal and vegetation data. A
   total of 995 individual animals were recorded. Riverine forest (n = 325)
   had the highest, followed by semi-deciduous (n = 316), and woodland
   Savanna (n = 192). Bushfire was the major predictive factor on animal
   distribution, followed by grazing pressure, farming activities,
   elevation, and erosion. These findings imply that an increased scale of
   disturbances reduces the chance of sighting flagship animals. A higher
   concentration of these species in riverine and semi-deciduous forests
   calls for increased patrols as a conservation measure. Constructing
   viewing platforms and hiking trails in areas of higher animal activity
   would improve ecotourism development.},

Title = {Three birds with one stone? Sex ratios of seized critically endangered
   helmeted hornbill casques reveal illegal hunting of males, females and
   juveniles},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {502-515},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hunted wildlife can often be used to answer questions about wild
   individuals. Sex ratios of hunted individuals can be important for
   understanding changes in population demographics and viability. Here we
   determined the sex ratio of the illegally hunted helmeted hornbill
   Rhinoplax vigil, a critically endangered species from Southeast Asia, to
   examine their vulnerability to hunters. Using casques seized in Hong
   Kong SAR between 2012 and 2016, we identified the sex of seized
   individuals using morphological and molecular methods as well as
   discriminant analysis. As R. vigil females can spend up to 6 months of
   the year sealed into tree cavity nests, they are reliant on males for
   food. The unique breeding ecology of this elusive species means that
   males are more likely to be observed than females throughout the year.
   These behavioural differences mean that there are several potential
   outcomes which may be observed in the sex ratio of the seized casques,
   depending on hunting strategies. Our results suggest that sex
   identification is possible via visual inspection of the gular skin
   colour and beak-tip markings, but when these are not available, genetic
   methods or morphological measurements can be used. Our findings also
   indicated a primarily male-biased sex ratio across the seizures;
   however, females, as well as juveniles, were also present in seizures.
   Although removing one sex from the wild can cause shifts in demographic
   dynamics over time, illegal and unsustainable hunting of any measure of
   a critically endangered species will ultimately heighten its risk of
   extinction. These methods and results are useful to conservationists and
   researchers interested in further study of hornbill populations and
   their viability and are ultimately important for the conservation and
   management of this critically endangered species.},

Title = {Testing the importance of individual nest-site selection for a social

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-13},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nest-site selection by species is expected to be adaptive and lead to
   improved breeding productivity, but in some settings, there exist
   mismatches between preferred nesting habitat and breeding productivity.
   We tested the expectation that nest-site selection is adaptive in a
   sample of 63 nests of a long-lived social species that breeds and
   forages in groups: the critically endangered white-backed vulture (Gyps
   africanus). By studying breeding groups in the same area, we controlled
   for landscape-level effects on habitat selection and investigated how
   fine-scale nest-site characteristics affect breeding productivity. We
   developed models to assess how nine characteristics of nest sites
   selected by breeding vultures compared with 70 random trees and tested
   associations between these characteristics and breeding productivity.
   White-backed vultures selected nest sites in taller trees (>7 m), but
   neither tree height nor any other nest-site characteristics had a clear
   effect on breeding productivity. Vultures selected nest trees closer to
   each other than random trees, and the associations between nest density,
   nearest neighbour distance and breeding success were all positive. These
   positive associations and the absence of an observable effect between
   nest-site characteristics and breeding productivity suggest that for
   this semi-colonial breeder, the social imperative of proximity to
   conspecifics (i.e., nesting near other vultures and group foraging) may
   be more important than individual nest-site selection.},

Abstract = {Giant millipedes are involved in the breakdown of organic matter and
   confined to tropical biomes. A review of giant millipedes from
   historical reports and new field data were carried out to assess
   distribution and diversity patterns throughout the Cameroon rainforest,
   while the conservation status of endemic species was evaluated for the
   first time using IUCN Red List criteria and categories. Fourteen species
   were identified in the Cameroon fauna. Of these, nine were endemic
   (64\%) while five species have been introduced (36\%). Recently, two
   species (Pachybolus togoensis, and Ophistreptoides gabonensis) were
   added to the known fauna of Cameroon. Of the extant endemic species,
   Telodeinopus canaliculatus has a wide distribution and has been recorded
   in five regions, while Pelmatojulus excisus and Odontostreptus
   sjoestedti were found in three regions, and Spirostreptus crenulatus was
   restricted to a single region. Based on IUCN Red List criteria, six
   species (60\%) could be considered extinct in their distribution range
   and in surrounding localities, one species (10\%) is likely endangered,
   two species (20\%) are probably vulnerable and one species (10\%) is of
   least concern. Our findings represent a substantial contribution of the
   knowledge of the giant millipedes in Africa.},

Title = {Jaguars in the matrix: population, prey abundance and land-cover change
   in a fragmented landscape in western Mexico},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {4},
Pages = {546-554},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity worldwide, particularly
   affecting large-bodied species that require vast territories and move
   across long distances, including most large felids. The jaguar Panthera
   onca has lost more than half of its habitat throughout its range and its
   subpopulations are becoming isolated, making them susceptible to local
   extinction. Knowledge about the status of its subpopulations in highly
   fragmented environments is lacking but urgently needed. Using camera
   traps during 2019-2020, we estimated number of individuals, age classes
   and sex ratio, occupancy, relative abundance and density of jaguars in
   Nayarit, western Mexico. We also determined the relative abundance of
   potential prey and estimated the land-cover change rate during
   1999-2019, using GIS. We found that a resident subpopulation of five
   adult females, two adult males and one cub, at a high density (5.3
   individuals/100 km(2)), is supported by at least 14 wild prey species.
   Natural habitat in the area is rapidly decreasing because of expanding
   agriculture and shrimp farming: agricultural areas increased from 39 to
   50\% and mangroves decreased from 35 to 26\% of the study area over 20
   years. The high jaguar population density and the diversity and relative
   abundance of remaining wild prey are remarkable, considering that
   natural habitat in the area is highly fragmented, shrinking rapidly and
   embedded in a matrix of human-dominated land-cover types. Effective
   conservation actions are needed urgently, including the protection of
   patches with native vegetation, reforestation to maintain connectivity
   between these patches, and the involvement of local communities.},

Title = {Fifteen years of delegated protected area management in West and Central
   Africa: five recommendations to guide maturity},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Delegated protected area management (transferring management
   responsibilities from a public to a private partner) has been promoted
   to give impetus to ailing protected areas in West and Central Africa.
   Since their inception in 2005, the number of partnerships has increased
   to 20 protected areas covering c. 250,000 km(2), an area similar to that
   of the UK. A review of the lessons learnt from these first 15 years
   shows that delegated management has improved day-to-day management of
   these protected areas. There remain, however, challenges with funding
   and with the capacity of national managerial staff, and also concerns
   regarding human rights. Based on an analysis of these challenges, I
   develop five recommendations to guide more mature delegated management:
   governments should (1) ensure an enabling legal-procedural environment;
   and (2) prepare delegated management contracts systematically; (3)
   private partners should render themselves dispensable through capacity
   building of national managerial staff and by initiating sustainable
   financing mechanisms; (4) governments and private partners alike should
   respect human rights and build coalitions with communities; (5)
   governments, private partners and funders should strive to delegate
   non-core management tasks, such as tourist guiding and reception,
   community development and research, to specialized locally-based
   individuals and organizations. Although these recommendations have a
   specific West-Central African perspective, they have relevance for the
   increasing number of delegated management initiatives elsewhere in
   Africa and beyond.},

   case study},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {6},
Pages = {877-887},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Extensive cattle ranging is an important economic activity in mountains,
   with diverse effects on native mammal communities. The effects of cattle
   Bos taurus can be negative, positive or neutral, mostly depending on the
   stocking rate. We examined the effect of cattle on the diversity and
   abundance of native mammalian species in the Austral Yungas region of
   Argentina, considering environmental variables, land protection status,
   and human influence. Using 12,512 trap-nights from 167 camera-trap
   stations over 11 years (2009-2019), we calculated a relative abundance
   index using camera events and used generalized linear models to estimate
   the effect of cattle on small mammals, large herbivores, species of
   conservation concern and felids. Cattle had different effects on each
   group of native mammals. We observed a lower abundance of large native
   herbivores and the absence of small mammals in areas with high cattle
   abundance. The tapir Tapirus terrestris, jaguar Panthera onca and
   white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari are rare in the Yungas and therefore
   potentially vulnerable to extinction there. Conservation of small felids
   and low cattle abundance could be compatible, but felids are threatened
   by other anthropogenic influences. Native mammalian diversity and
   richness were related to land protection status. The entire ecoregion is
   potentially suitable for cattle, suggesting the potential for further
   threats, and that cattle should be excluded from strictly protected
   areas. To ensure extensive cattle ranging is compatible with wildlife
   conservation in areas where exclusion is not possible, we recommend
   improved management of cattle and moderate stocking rates.},

Title = {Surviving in a hostile landscape: Nothofagus alessandrii remnant forests

Volume = {57},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nothofagus alessandrii, categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List,
   is an endemic, deciduous tree species of the coastal range of central
   Chile. We assessed the effects of fire severity, invasion by the exotic
   fire-prone Pinus radiata, and land-cover composition and configuration
   of the landscape on the resilience of fragments of N. alessandrii after
   a mega-fire in 2017. We used remote sensing data to estimate land-use
   classes and cover, fire severity and invasion cover of P. radiata. We
   monitored forest composition and structure and post-fire responses of N.
   alessandrii forests in situ for 2 years after the mega-fire. In the
   coastal Maule region wildfires have been favoured by intense drought and
   widespread exotic pine plantations, increasing the ability of
   fire-adapted invasive species to colonize native forest remnants. Over
   85\% of N. alessandrii forests were moderately or severely burnt. The
   propagation and severity of fire was probably amplified by the exotic
   pines located along the edges of, or inside, the N. alessandrii
   fragments and the highly flammable pine plantations surrounding these
   fragments (> 60\% of land use is pine plantations). Pinus radiata, a
   fire-adapted pioneer species, showed strong post-fire recruitment within
   the N. alessandrii fragments, especially those severely burnt. Positive
   feedback between climate change (i.e. droughts and heat waves),
   wildfires and pine invasions is driving N. alessandrii forests into an
   undesirable and probably irreversible state (i.e. a landscape trap). A
   large-scale restoration programme to design a diverse and less flammable
   landscape is needed to avoid the loss of these highly threatened forest
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The Colorado River and its tributaries on the Colorado Plateau are home
   to unique desert river ecosystems and changing environmental conditions.
   Within this region, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA) is
   composed of rugged, high desert terrain and is managed by the United
   States National Park Service as both a recreational and conservation
   area. Despite the ecological and economic importance of GCNRA,
   significant components of the ecological communities therein remain
   poorly characterized, including lichens. Accurately characterizing
   lichen-forming fungal diversity is challenging due to poorly known
   taxonomic groups, underexplored regions/habitats, and varying
   interpretations of morphological differences, including the recognition
   of environmentally modified forms. To better understand lichen diversity
   in GCNRA, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, incorporating both
   traditional morphology-based identification and information from the
   standard fungal DNA barcoding marker, the ITS, to compile a thorough
   inventory of lichen-forming fungi in Fifty-Mile Canyon. Vouchered lichen
   specimens were collected in 2019, and from these the ITS marker was
   sequenced. Candidate species-level lineages were delimited from
   family-level multiple sequence alignments using the Assemble Species by
   Automatic Partitioning web server. Specimens comprising DNA-based
   candidate species were then evaluated using traditional taxonomically
   diagnostic characters to link these, where possible, to currently
   described species. For Fifty-Mile Canyon, we document 100 putative
   species in 15 families, each represented by vouchered specimens, ITS
   sequence data, and photographic documentation. For comparison, a survey
   of historic records from GCNRA revealed a total of 124 documented
   lichen-forming fungal species throughout the NRA and adjacent land.
   Approximately 50\% of the species documented in Fifty-Mile Canyon had
   not previously been found in GCNRA, and similar proportions of species
   diversity have been documented in GCNRA but not observed in our survey.
   We report 3 species new to North America-Calogaya ferrugineoides (H.
   Magn.) Arup, Froden \& Sochting, Endocarpon deserticola T. Zhang, X.L.
   Wei \& J.C. Wei, and Xanthocarpia ferrarii (Bagl.) Froden, Arup \&
   Sochting-verified using ITS sequencing data. In addition, Circinaria
   squamulosa sp. nov. is formally described here, currently known only
   from sandstone slabs in Fifty-Mile Canyon. However, the taxonomic
   identity of many of the candidate species from Fifty-Mile Canyon
   remained ambiguous at the species level, and some collections likely
   represent undescribed species-level lineages. Our results revealed
   unexpected, high species-level diversity of lichen-forming fungi at
   local scales and that overall lichen diversity across the entire GCNRA
   is likely vastly undercounted. These data-including DNA barcodes for the
   vast majority of lichen-forming fungi occurring in this canyon-provide
   an important resource that can be integrated into subsequent lichen
   biodiversity research in the southwestern United States and other
   semiarid climates.},

Abstract = {Wetlands in drylands are important resources for agriculture and
   wildlife, but competition may result in human-wildlife conflict. We
   sought to understand conditions under which people and wildlife sharing
   wetlands in drylands may coexist. We applied track counts in riverine
   wetlands in the dry and wet season (n = 36 days) using belt transects,
   focus group discussions (n = 3), key informant interviews (n = 26), a
   household socio-economic survey (n = 180) and secondary data analysis to
   study human-wildlife interactions in a community-based wildlife
   management area in Zimbabwe. Twenty-six wildlife species that used
   riverine wetlands were identified. High population density and riverine
   agriculture - with access to cattle and ploughs enabling cultivation of
   larger fields - limited wildlife access to wetlands. Seasonality,
   drought, water availability and soil fertility, aggravated by limited
   alternative livelihood opportunities and lack of political will to
   control cropping and settlement in wetlands, were drivers of conflict.
   Hence, models based on population pressure and resource availability are
   insufficient to inform human-wildlife conflict mitigation. Strategies
   that undercut rent-seeking behaviour are needed to enable human-wildlife
   coexistence. Concerted action among stakeholders including linking
   wildlife conservation benefits to compliance with wetland-use
   regulations, water-user committees, water provisioning and labour-saving
   technologies in uplands, livelihood diversification and incentivised
   production of drought-tolerant crops are recommended.},

Abstract = {The objective of the current study was to determine the potential
   effects of changes in climate, population density and land use land
   cover (LULC) on the spatial distribution of Adansonia digitata (baobab
   tree) suitable habitats in Africa using MaxEnt. Across its distribution,
   A. digitata is confined to Africa's mainland and isolated parts of the
   continent such as Madagascar. The geographical distribution of A.
   digitata will shrink gradually under climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5
   and RCP 8.5), population density and LULC-development threat changes.
   Rainfall wettest quarter, soil type, elevation, rainfall seasonality and
   mean annual rainfall were the most important variables in terms of
   relative contribution to the occurrence of A. digitata. Population
   density was also important compared to LULC - development threat index.
   Only a small part of the current range of the baobab tree in Africa will
   retain suitable environmental conditions for viable baobab populations
   in future, high concentration will be in Malawi, Mozambique and parts of
   Benin, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania and
   Madagascar. Despite threats to the specie, there are areas currently not
   suitable although they will be suitable in future. There is an urgent
   need for conservation strategies aimed at preserving A. digitata to
   benefit local communities socially and economically.},

Title = {Ground-based vegetation descriptions and remote sensing as complementary

Volume = {26},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Non-human primate species are threatened worldwide. Their population
   declines go along with the loss of ecological functions such as seed
   dispersal that plays a crucial role in plant regeneration. Restoring
   essential habitat structures could thus not only protect primates, but
   also facilitate forest regeneration. We used classical vegetation
   description on the ground and a remote sensing analysis to describe
   habitat use of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), a seed-dispersing
   primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Our aim was to find vegetation
   characteristics important for lemurs that might be targeted in a
   restoration approach. For this, we applied both methods in differently
   degraded forest types. Both classical vegetation description and remote
   sensing analysis were able to distinguish these forest types. The
   habitat use of our two study groups was associated consistently with
   vegetation structures measured on a small scale such as tree height and
   density of thick trees. In contrast, vegetation productivity and water
   content derived from satellite imagery on a larger scale could not
   consistently explain habitat use of lemurs. Thus, measurements on the
   ground can identify suitable microhabitats that do not show on the
   satellite imagery scale. These microhabitats might be very important
   conservation elements to create buffer zones and corridors. Further,
   they might attract seed-dispersing species into degraded areas targeted
   for forest restoration, acting as natural regeneration nuclei. The
   potential of these microhabitats for conservation would not be
   recognized when analyses were based solely on landscape analyses on
   large scales.},

Title = {Global warming facilitates the nesting of the loggerhead turtle on the

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The ranges of many species are shifting poleward as global warming
   intensifies, but this process might be less intense in philopatric
   species, i.e. those with the tendency to reproduce at their natal sites.
   Marine turtles are highly philopatric and their vulnerability to global
   warming is exacerbated by a life history combining delayed sexual
   maturity, temperature-dependent sex determination and low embryo
   survival at high incubation temperature. Detection of nesting events of
   loggerhead turtles in the Western Mediterranean Sea has increased
   largely during the first two decades of the 21st century, which could be
   a response to global warming or the result of increased sampling effort.
   The deployment of temperature data loggers at 52 beaches scattered along
   the Mediterranean coast of Spain demonstrated that sand temperature is
   currently high enough to allow the incubation of loggerhead turtles
   clutches in most Spanish beaches. However, the reconstruction of sand
   temperature from 1950 to 2019 revealed that thermal conditions suitable
   for the regular nesting of loggerhead turtles have existed in Spanish
   beaches only since 2010, although sporadic nesting was possible
   previously in exceptionally warm years. The future establishment of a
   self-sustained population would probably require further increases in
   temperature, to ensure a female-biased offspring production, but the
   process might be jeopardized by increased erosion and beach flooding
   resulting from sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Installation of offshore wind farms (OWFs) is becoming increasingly
   important to ensure a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; however,
   OWFs also pose a threat to migrating birds and other wildlife. Informed
   marine spatial planning is therefore crucial, but individual-based
   high-resolution data on bird migration across the sea are currently
   lacking. We equipped 51 individuals of the near threatened Eurasian
   curlew Numenius arquata with GPS tags (118 flight tracks) across
   multiple years and countries to assess their four-dimensional migration
   routes across the Baltic Sea (i.e. flight tracks, altitudes, phenology
   and diurnal patterns), to inform collision-risk models and assess
   potential conflicts with current and future OWFs. Despite a broad-front
   migration, we identified core migration areas in the south-western
   Baltic Sea (and adjacent mainland), largely overlapping with already
   operating OWFs. Generalized linear models based on a resampling
   procedure to overcome autocorrelation of tracking data showed that
   flight altitudes across the sea and during autumn (median: 60 m) were
   significantly lower than those across land (median: 335 m) and during
   spring (median across sea: 150; median across land: 576 m). Across the
   sea, curlews spent 74.8\% and 62.2\% of their migration times below 300
   m during autumn and spring, respectively, indicating a potentially high
   collision risk with OWFs. The mean flight speed was 56.3 km/h (+/- 20.3
   km/h). Migration intensity was highest at night over a 10-day period
   during April, suggesting that restricted turbine operation for several
   days might be a possible management measure. Our study showed that, even
   for broad-front migrants, it is possible to identify particularly
   sensitive sea areas deserving special protection enabling a sound marine
   spatial planning. This is a crucial finding also for various other
   shorebirds on the East Atlantic Flyway. Further studies are needed to
   assess the behavioural reactions of migrating birds with respect to OWFs
   using high-resolution tracking data.},

Title = {Age structure dynamics in an eastern collared lizard population from
   founding to demographic stability},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-173},

Abstract = {The global decline of reptile species has raised much concern, and many
   translocation programs have been implemented in response to this
   decline. Most of these programs have not been successful, but one
   exception is the translocation program for eastern collared lizards that
   had experienced massive local extinction on glades in the Ozarks in
   central North America. Translocation coupled with glade restoration was
   initiated in the 1980s, including reintroductions starting in 1984 on
   Stegall Mountain in southern Missouri. The translocated populations
   underwent three distinct demographic phases: (1) an isolate phase with
   no net growth in population size, no colonization of nearby glades and
   almost no dispersal among populations, (2) a colonizing phase of high
   dispersal, colonization of new glades and population growth that started
   with the onset of prescribed woodland burning and (3) a stable
   metapopulation phase established by 2000 on Stegall Mountain in which
   the number of occupied glades, total population size and measures of
   genetic variation were roughly constant. This study uses distinct color
   phases to infer the age of 1162 marked individuals. Age probabilities
   were assigned to 391 individuals based on time-of-capture within the
   field season and snout-vent length, as calibrated from following 529
   individuals first captured as hatchlings. Age structure differed
   significantly between phases. The isolate phase was characterized by an
   old age structure. The colonization phase had a younger age structure
   and much more recruitment. The stable metapopulation phase had an
   intermediate age structure. These dynamic age structure attributes show
   that species cannot be regarded as static units, and ignoring this
   dynamism can result in poor conservation practice. These results also
   validate age-structure as a monitoring device for a conservation program
   and a tool to identify significant shifts in the environment or
   management that have a conservation impact, in this case prescribed
   woodland burning.},

Title = {A global assessment of research on urban ecology of reptiles: patterns,
   gaps and future directions},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global urban expansion has multiple impacts on biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning. Still, urban centres may play an important role
   in the conservation of reptiles, an undersampled, megadiverse and
   unevenly distributed group especially vulnerable to anthropogenic
   impacts. However, major gaps in research on the urban ecology of
   reptiles and species responses to urbanisation persist, which may limit
   our capacity to guide suitable conservation policies. We conducted a
   global systematic literature review to evaluate biogeographic, taxonomic
   and ecological research biases in the urban ecology of reptiles and
   ultimately to detect major gaps and steer future sampling efforts. Our
   database comprised 278 articles dealing with biological responses to
   urbanisation of 493 species across 45 countries, comprising 658 cases
   between a given species and specific biological response. Research on
   the urban ecology of reptiles was geographically and taxonomically
   biased. Developed countries within temperate regions were better
   sampled, whereas developing tropical and megadiverse countries were
   mostly undersampled or neglected. Among reptile orders, Testudines and
   Crocodylia were proportionally more studied than Squamata. Across lower
   groups within Squamata, lizards were present in most studies and were
   the biological model most commonly used. Studies evaluating biological
   responses associated with landscape-level processes, behaviour and/or
   population dynamics were prevalent, whereas conservation, human-reptile
   conflicts and wildlife management were the least considered topics. Our
   results show that research on urban ecology of reptiles is unevenly
   distributed across regions and lineages. Overcoming these major gaps is
   an important step towards the improvement of the conservation of
   reptiles worldwide under the upcoming biodiversity loss scenario. Beyond
   spreading sampling efforts across undersampled countries, taxa and
   research topics to meet conservation objectives, we recommend more
   multidisciplinary approaches to evaluate and compare the actual
   performance of reptiles in urban environments and to achieve the
   equilibrium between human well-being and species conservation.},

Abstract = {African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are a critically
   endangered and visually cryptic species that inhabits Central African
   rainforests. Using a 1250 sq-km grid of 50 acoustic sensors in Republic
   of Congo, we investigated the landscape-scale behavioural response of
   forest elephants to poaching events. We detected eight automatic weapon
   fire events over 1.5 years of recording (2017-2019). We examined
   detections of elephant vocalisations across grid sites within 10 km of
   the gunfire events in the 48 h surrounding the gunfire, and in paired
   48-h control periods free of gunfire. Fewer vocalisations were detected
   before gunfire events than during control periods, suggesting elephants
   show behavioural responses to poacher presence before any shots are
   fired. Immediately following the gunfire events, a significant increase
   in elephant calls was detected, which may indicate increased
   communication to facilitate group cohesion and movement. Elevated call
   levels dropped to lower-than-baseline rates after several hours,
   suggestive of a sustained response. These patterns indicate forest
   elephants respond to both poacher presence and to gunfire events
   themselves. As these patterns may reflect behaviours that mediate
   population processes, conservation strategies should account for the
   potential of poaching to impact populations via indirect effects on
   nontarget elephants in the area.},

Abstract = {The effects of urbanisation are increasingly pervasive across
   landscapes, and this has implications for animals and the ecological
   functions they support. Differences in ecological attributes and
   assemblages between ecosystems means we cannot assume that different
   ecosystems within the same landscapes are affected by urbanisation in
   the same trajectory or over the same spatial scales. We test whether and
   how ecosystem type can modify ecological responses to urbanisation,
   contrasting beaches, estuaries, rocky headlands and coastal lagoons
   impacted by a range of urbanisation intensities on the Sunshine Coast in
   eastern Australia. We sampled coastal vertebrates and measured carrion
   scavenging, a key ecological function in all ecosystems, using baited
   camera traps at 85 sites distributed among five beaches (25 sites at
   five sites per beach), three estuaries (15 sites at five sites per
   estuary), four coastal lagoons (20 sites at five sites per lagoon) and
   five headlands (25 sites at five sites per headland). Coastal vertebrate
   assemblages were best predicted by the additive effects of ecosystem
   type and the extent of urbanisation within 5 km of each site, and this
   was typically characterised by increases in synanthropic species
   abundance at sites with high to intermediate extents of urbanisation
   nearby. However, two key indicator species had opposing relationships
   with the extent of urbanisation, and four varied only between ecosystems
   and not with urbanisation. Urbanisation substantially depressed rates of
   carrion scavenging, with some variation in species-specific consumption
   rates among ecosystems. While native crows, raptors and water rats
   accounted for 2/3 of carrion consumed, invasive black rats and
   free-ranging domestic dogs were significant consumers of carrion. Our
   results not only stress the pervasive effects of urbanisation on species
   distributions and abundance across multiple ecosystems in landscapes,
   but highlight that pivotal ecological functions can be compromised
   across multiple ecosystems embedded within the same landscape.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {The IUCN now recognizes the savannah Loxodonta africana and forest
   Loxodonta cyclotis elephants to be separate species. Despite ecological,
   behavioural and morphological differences, and different habitat ranges,
   genetic studies confirm that the two species and hybrids coexist in
   forest-savannah ecotones. However, the hybrid phenotypes have not yet
   been described. In this survey we examined whether the phenotypes of the
   two species and of hybrids can be distinguished. In the first step, we
   used a machine learning algorithm (K-nearest neighbours) to compare 296
   reference images of African elephants from five forest areas and six
   savannah areas where hybrids have not been recorded, confirming that six
   morphological criteria can be used to distinguish the species with more
   than 90\% confidence. In the second step, we analysed 1,408 videos of
   elephants from 14 camera traps in Sebitoli, in Kibale National Park,
   Uganda, part of the main hybridization area. We used a multiple
   correspondence analysis and a species assignment key, highlighting the
   presence of three categories of phenotypes. Compared to the savannah and
   forest phenotypes (36.8 and 12.1\%, respectively), the intermediate
   phenotypes, which could include hybrids, were more frequent (51.1\%).
   Further studies combining morphology and genetics of the same
   individuals will be necessary to refine this species assignment key to
   characterize phenotypes confidently. This non-invasive, fast and
   inexpensive phenotypical-based method could be a valuable tool for
   conservation programmes.},

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The prehensile-tailed skink Corucia zebrata is endemic to the Solomon
   Islands. It is the most traded reptile from the country. During
   2000-2019, CITES reported the legal export of 10,567 individuals.
   Although the level of this trade is well documented, impacts on the
   skink's survival in its native range are comparatively unknown. During
   January-May 2020, we surveyed 146 people on 12 islands to collect
   information on the habitats preferred by the prehensile-tailed skink, to
   understand perceptions of the species' conservation status and identify
   any potential threats. Respondents reported lowland and hill forests as
   being favoured habitats, with low proportions of respondents identifying
   coastal and montane forests as suitable habitat. Habitat loss (72\%),
   hunting (17\%), and predation (6\%) were identified as the main threats.
   People younger than 30 years of age reported killing the skinks more
   frequently than did people over the age of 30. Prehensile-tailed skinks
   have a relatively small home range, long reproductive cycle, and are
   vulnerable to numerous threats. We thus recommend a halt to the current
   practice of exporting wild-caught prehensile-tailed skinks, and
   replacement by a well-regulated captive breeding programme.},

Abstract = {The Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Reserve (Reserve de l'Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim)
   in central Chad supports large numbers of livestock and rare antelopes,
   and is the site of ongoing reintroductions of the scimitar-horned oryx
   Oryx dammah and addax Addax nasomaculatus. We present results of surveys
   conducted during 2011-2019 to examine patterns of relative abundance and
   distribution of dorcas gazelles Gazella dorcas, dama gazelles Nanger
   dama and livestock in relation to each other and to water sources in a
   3,500 km(2) area in the centre of the Reserve. Dorcas gazelles numbered
   7,700-18,000, moving extensively across the area. Livestock varied
   between c. 2,000 and 68,000 tropical livestock units across surveys,
   with density doubling in the wet season. Dorcas gazelle distribution was
   negatively associated with livestock, and livestock density was
   positively associated with artificial water sources. Dorcas gazelle
   densities were positively associated with locations where there had been
   wild fires in the 6 months prior to a survey. Dama gazelles were
   encountered only 13 times, insufficient to estimate their population
   size reliably. Opportunistic observations suggest dama gazelles avoid
   livestock and burnt ground. Our findings highlight the importance of the
   Reserve. We recommend the designation of a large, well-managed
   conservation priority zone in the Reserve's core area in which no
   further development of water resources is permitted. Management of
   livestock numbers within this zone at or below current levels is
   essential to integrate national goals for both biodiversity conservation
   and pastoralism development.},

Title = {Rediscovery of the Critically Endangered Primula esquirolii, a karst
   cave species with an extremely small population endemic to China},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 25},
Abstract = {The rare plant Primula esquirolii, a karst cave species in the family
   Primulaceae, endemic to Guizhou, China, and with a presumed extremely
   small population, had not previously been observed since 1910. It is
   categorized as Endangered on the China Species Red List. In surveys
   during 2018-2022, we were unable to locate the species in its type
   location in Pingba county, but we discovered a previously unrecorded
   population of 44 mature individuals, 37 of which were long homostylous
   and seven of which were heterostylous. These individuals were discovered
   in Xiuwen county in February 2022, in an area of c. 50 m(2), c. 40 km
   from the type location. All seven heterostylous individuals showed the
   short-styled morph. The almost homostylous P. esquirolii potentially
   faces the same high genetic load as other homostylous plants, and this
   may have led to its small population size and potential sensitivity to
   habitat destruction. Field surveys and informal interviews with local
   people indicated that the main threats to this species are its small
   population size and the loss of suitable habitat as a result of human
   activities. The most urgent requirement for the conservation of this
   species is to protect the habitat of this single known extant population
   and to carry out ex situ conservation. Further field surveys and
   research are also required to improve our understanding of the status of
   this species.},

Title = {Anthropogenic food: an emerging threat to polar bears},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 20},
Abstract = {Supplemental food from anthropogenic sources is a source of conflict
   with humans for many wildlife species. Food-seeking behaviours by black
   bears Ursus americanus and brown bears Ursus arctos can lead to property
   damage, human injury and mortality of the offending bears. Such
   conflicts are a well-known conservation management issue wherever people
   live in bear habitats. In contrast, the use of anthropogenic foods by
   the polar bear Ursus maritimus is less common historically but is a
   growing conservation and management issue across the Arctic. Here we
   present six case studies that illustrate how negative food-related
   interactions between humans and polar bears can become either chronic or
   ephemeral and unpredictable. Our examination suggests that attractants
   are an increasing problem, exacerbated by climate change-driven sea-ice
   losses that cause increased use of terrestrial habitats by bears.
   Growing human populations and increased human visitation increase the
   likelihood of human-polar bear conflict. Efforts to reduce food
   conditioning in polar bears include attractant management, proactive
   planning and adequate resources for northern communities to reduce
   conflicts and improve human safety. Permanent removal of unsecured
   sources of nutrition, to reduce food conditioning, should begin
   immediately at the local level as this will help to reduce polar bear
   mortality.},

Title = {Diurnality in the defensive behaviour of African honeybees Apis
   mellifera adansonii and implications for their potential efficacy in
   beehive fences},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Across the range of African elephants Loxodonta spp., negative
   interactions with people are prevalent, and the impact of the resulting
   economic losses on farmers calls for solutions. The use of beehive
   fences, a mitigation method with ecological and socio-economic benefits,
   is gaining momentum in African savannah landscapes. We assessed the
   diurnal and nocturnal defensive behaviours of African honeybees Apis
   mellifera adansonii in response to visual and physical disturbances in
   the Campo-Ma'an conservation area, Cameroon. We examined six bee
   colonies, assessing their activity level, aggressive behaviour and
   ability to defend themselves when disturbed at different times of day.
   We found that activity levels varied between colonies and that colonies
   were more active during the day and inactive at night. The defensive
   perimeter around the hives also varied between the colonies and was
   generally greater during morning and evening periods. Bee colonies did
   not defend their hives around midday and at night. In response to a
   threat, bees were more likely to fly out from the hive during daytime
   than at night, with variation amongst colonies. Overall, as elephant
   intrusions occur mostly at night, beehive fences alone may not be an
   adequate mitigation method against crop damage caused by forest
   elephants Loxodonta cyclotis. We suggest combining beehive fences with
   other mitigation methods to improve crop protection.},

Abstract = {Long-term vegetation monitoring is essential to understanding plant
   responses to both climate and grazing. The objective of this study was
   to monitor the long-term effects of precipitation on vegetation changes
   within a salt desert shrub plant community and determine whether grazing
   by livestock altered the vegetation during this time. The study was
   located within the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah. Two sites were
   selected. One exclosure was constructed at each site, and foliar cover
   was measured inside and outside the exclosure to separate the effect of
   grazing from precipitation on vegetation change over a 30-year period.
   Shrubs were the dominant vegetative cover at the start of the study,
   with the invasive shrub Gutierrezia sarothrae being the dominant shrub
   accounting for 53\% of total plant cover. As the invasive shrub died out
   due to drought, native shrub cover as well as C-4 grass cover increased.
   Native shrub cover displayed positive correlations with current winter
   and cool-season precipitation. C-4 grass cover displayed positive
   correlation with cool-season precipitation. Winter and spring grazing at
   moderate stocking rates were not detrimental to these desert plant
   communities. Climatic conditions were the dominant influence on
   vegetation.},

Abstract = {The marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumenifer) is widespread and generally
   abundant in East and Southern Africa, but recent research has found
   range loss indicative of a population decline in West Africa in recent
   decades. In the absence of population data, we conducted an in-depth
   review of the status of the marabou in the region using a plethora of
   sources together comprising the largest database on the occurrence of
   the species. Despite caveats and coarseness of the assessment, we
   estimate the range loss at 52\% in West Africa, including extirpation of
   approximately 64\% of known nesting colonies since 2000. The resulting
   fragmentation has left a metapopulation of likely no more than 100
   breeding pairs in The Gambia and Benin and an unknown number of breeders
   in Cameroon. Knowledge gaps about marabou population ecology in West
   Africa are significant and prevent an empirical assessment of regional
   extinction probability. Therefore, we recommend immediate field surveys,
   especially for breeding colonies, and research into threats and
   population dynamics. We also recommend the West African metapopulation
   be listed as regionally critically endangered and that a working group
   be formed comprising stakeholders from across the region to aid in
   assessing threats and implementing research and conservation action.},

Abstract = {The present study aims at determining the phytogeographical distribution
   and economic potential and documenting the degree of risk to the
   extinction of tree species, and the changes these species have undergone
   over the past 20 years. Field surveys were conducted at many locations
   in Egypt between January 2017 and March 2020. From each location, GPS
   coordinates were taken and the number of individuals was estimated.
   Also, specimens and seed samples for each species were collected from
   different habitats as can as possible. Other data were collected through
   herbaria visits and existing literature. The recorded taxa were arranged
   alphabetically according to Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system (APG IV).
   Evaluation of conservation status was based on IUCN Red List Categories
   and Criteria. In the present study, we applied Criterion B that concerns
   the geographical range in the form of both B1 (extent of occurrence:
   EOO) and B2 (area of occupancy: AOO). Calculations of both AOO and EOO
   and the assessment process were assisted using the GeoCAT software.
   Fifty-seven taxa were recorded, and most of them occur in Elbanian
   sector. Among them, five alien species were recorded. Many taxa offered
   economic goods such as medicinal, timber and fuel values; and
   environmental services as shaders and phytoremediators. Fifty taxa
   suffered from over-collecting and over-cutting. Among the 52 native
   trees in the present study, 31 taxa are evaluated as threatened with
   extinction; 10 taxa are Critically Endangered, 16 are Endangered and 5
   are Vulnerable. There are two taxa assessed as Near Threatened and 15 as
   Least Concern. On the contrary, four taxa fall in the category of Data
   Deficient. There are 28 in situ conserved taxa in the protected areas.
   Also, 28 taxa are under ex situ conservation. In conclusion, land-use
   patterns, climate change and human impact lead to put about 61\% of the
   trees in Egypt under threat of extinction. Consequently, nature
   conservation organisations should take an action towards the
   conservation of these valuable taxa.},

Abstract = {A rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted in the Republic of the
   Congo including a systematic biodiversity study (including a targeted
   study of mammals), implemented over two seasons. One hundred thirteen
   recce transects (250 m by 2 m) were undertaken over 34 days of
   fieldwork. A total of 19 species were detected (3 to genus level only).
   The encounter rate was 26.65 mammalian signs per km; no differences in
   numbers of signs between season appeared; however, the dry-season
   species accumulation pattern was higher than during wet season.
   Correlation analysis showed increasing density of mammals as distance
   away from villages, lakes and coast increased. The correlation result is
   deemed to highlight not only a substantial hunting pressure and
   avoidance of humans, but also preference for forested habitats noted to
   appear from 20 km distance from the coast. Using high numbers of
   relatively short recce transect proved a useful supplementary method for
   assessing mammalian diversity during rapid biodiversity assessments.
   Results suggest that 70 recce transects (with a minimum of eight per
   habitat type) would have been sufficient to yield this information.},

Abstract = {The ecology and phenology of the Dysderidae (Araneae) were investigated
   in two different sites (Tala-Guilef and Tikjda), located at opposite
   slopes of the Djurdjura National Park in Algeria. The following
   questions were investigated: Are there any endemic species in the
   studied area? Do the slopes' orientation influence the abundance,
   richness and diversity of these spider communities? Are the activity and
   the vital cycle of the three most abundant species different in the two
   different plant physiognomies (cedar forests and alpine grasslands)? The
   Dysderidae were collected monthly for 2 years using pitfall traps. In
   total, 1532 specimens were collected: 333 males, 389 females and 381
   juveniles in Tala-Guilef and 230 males, 66 females and 133 juveniles in
   Tikjda. Among the total of 10 species sampled, three species belonging
   to three genera in Tala-Guilef, 10 species belonging to four genera in
   Tikdja and four endemic species was recorded. The slope orientation
   influence the abundance and the species richness. The activity and the
   vital cycle of the three most abundant species were not different in the
   cedar forests and alpine grasslands. For these species, no relationship
   was found between the activity cycle and the vegetation physiognomy.},

Title = {Not just the Big Five: African ecotourists prefer parks brimming with

Abstract = {Ecotourism helps sustain protected areas (PAs) that in turn conserve
   Africa's declining fauna. Identifying ecotourist preferences and which
   species and landscapes benefit from ecotourism could therefore support
   African biodiversity conservation efforts. Due to historic associations
   with trophy hunting and subsequent ecotourism marketing efforts,
   ecotourist preferences have been thought to traditionally center around
   the `Big Five': elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros. But
   these preferences may be evolving. Here, we ask two questions, one about
   the drivers and one about the consequences of ecotourism: (1) Which
   species and landscapes do ecotourists most prefer based on realized
   visitation data? And (2), differently, which species and landscapes
   benefit most from ecotourism? We gathered data on average annual tourist
   visits, the occurrence of nine mammals, bird species richness, forest
   cover, national wealth, local human population and accessibility for 164
   Sub-Saharan African PAs. To address our first question, we used a
   Bayesian multivariable model to identify whether bird and megafaunal
   diversity explain visits to PAs while controlling for other factors. To
   address our second question, we used Bayesian univariate models to
   analyze the relationships between park visitation and each
   species/landscape. We found that tourist preferences extend beyond the
   Big Five to include bird diversity. We also observed that ecotourism may
   be well suited to conserve bird diversity, lion, cheetah, black and
   white rhinoceros, African wild dog and giraffe species. Collectively,
   our results may help inform how to leverage ecotourism to conserve
   African fauna.},

Title = {Cascading effects of social dynamics on the reproduction, survival, and
   population growth of mountain gorillas},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {398-411},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Whilst the conservation impacts of density-dependent population effects
   have been well studied, the impact that socially-driven changes (e.g.
   group fissions that increase group density) can have on population
   growth in social species have only recently come to light. An increase
   in group density and intergroup encounters in a subpopulation of
   mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei was shown to have driven a
   more than fourfold increase in infanticide, slowing population growth.
   In this study, we delve deeper into the consequences of these
   socially-driven changes in group density, examining how patterns of
   reproduction and survival have changed in this subpopulation across more
   than 50 years. We show that adult female survival increased with
   strengthening conservation efforts early in the study, then remained
   stable, while age at first birth remained stable across the entire
   study. Interbirth intervals and female reproductive success did not vary
   significantly across time overall. However, socially-driven increases in
   group density since the mid-2000s appear to have had a cascade of
   effects. In addition to the increase in infant and adult male mortality
   from violence during intergroup encounters, higher encounter rates, and
   mortality were likely responsible for an increase in female transfers,
   which delayed reproduction. Females faced a 7.5-month delay when
   transferring once and a 1.5-year delay when transferring twice or more
   between births. We show these changes correspond with a 26.63\%
   reduction in female reproductive success in 2007 to 2018, compared to
   1994 to 2006, with females taking more than 2 years longer to produce an
   offspring that survived infancy. These findings demonstrate that social
   dynamics can have consequences for population growth beyond the
   immediate mortality effects of violent encounters. This further
   highlights the critical importance of social dynamics in the
   conservation of social species, particularly when populations are
   restricted to small or fragmented regions of habitat.},

Title = {Influence of landscape and connectivity on anuran conservation:
   population viability analyses to designate protected areas},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-397},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Threatened species with restricted ranges are at risk from habitat
   fragmentation and loss, which amplifies genetic bottleneck and impacts
   of small changes to their environments. Ecological models including
   population viability analyses (PVAs) can predict the trajectory of
   populations in a way that is not invasive or detrimental to the study
   species. They can therefore be a vital tool in modeling populations for
   conservation purposes. Although habitat suitability models have been
   used in studies to suggest areas for protected area designation, PVAs
   are generally not used in this regard. Dryophytes suweonensis and
   Dryophytes flaviventris are two threatened treefrog species endemic to
   the Korean Peninsula. The two species face threats of habitat loss and
   degradation and predation by invasive species among others. We used an
   integrated modeling approach combining ecological niche, connectivity,
   and PVAs in Vortex to determine the likelihood of extinction of each
   species under baseline and protected area designation scenarios.
   Designation scenarios were simulated in Vortex through halting future
   reduction in carrying capacity (halting future degradation to sites
   through protected area status), reducing effects of catastrophes
   (mitigating the effects of drought), and reducing mortality rates
   (controlling invasive predator populations and ex situ raising of
   tadpoles to maturity). We classified the combination of these management
   efforts as ``active management{''} as opposed to ``no management,{''}
   which is currently being practiced. We additionally used a stepwise
   approach to determine designation priority of individual patches. Under
   current conditions (no management), the resulting effective
   metapopulations after 100 years were 167 +/- 325 individuals with an
   86.5\% extinction probability for D. suweonensis and 165 +/- 200
   individuals with a 90.3\% extinction probability for D. flaviventris.
   Under active management of all sites (93 sites covering 426.9 km(2)),
   the extinction probability was 0\% for both species with significantly
   increased metapopulation sizes, 15 910 +/- 2855 for D. suweonensis, and
   4400 +/- 874 for D. flaviventris. Determining designation priority can
   inform the regulatory bodies on which habitat to designate and whether
   active or passive management should be applied. Without intervention,
   these species will be likely to face imminent extinction. In addition to
   being useful for government-imposed conservation management, our study
   can be followed by future studies as a methodology for prioritizing
   sites for protected area designation.},

Title = {Prediction of fitness under different breeding designs in conservation
   programs},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-102},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The expected change in fitness under inbreeding due to deleterious
   recessive alleles depends on the amount of inbreeding load harbored by a
   population, that is, the load of deleterious recessive mutations
   concealed in the heterozygous state, and the opposing effect of genetic
   purging to remove such a load. This change in fitness can be thus
   predicted if an estimate of the inbreeding load and the purging
   coefficient (the parameter that quantifies the amount of purging) are
   available. These two parameters can be estimated in pedigreed
   populations, as has been shown for populations under random mating. A
   question arises whether these parameters can also be estimated under
   other breeding systems as well as whether they allow accurate prediction
   of the corresponding expected change in fitness. In conservation
   programs, it is usually recommended to preserve genetic diversity by
   equalizing contributions from parents to progeny and avoiding inbred
   matings. Regular systems of inbreeding have also been proposed as
   breeding conservation strategies to purge the inbreeding load. Using
   computer simulations, we first test a method to jointly estimate the
   initial inbreeding load and the purging coefficient in populations
   subjected to equalization of parental contributions, circular mating,
   and partial full-sib mating. Then, using the expected values of the
   inbreeding coefficient and the variance of family size, as well as the
   estimates of the inbreeding load and the purging coefficient, we make
   simple predictions of the change in fitness over generations under these
   breeding systems and compare them with simulation results. We discuss
   how these fitness predictions can help undertaking conservation designs
   under different breeding scenarios.},

Abstract = {Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponinae) are essential pollinators of
   numerous native and cultivated plant species, especially in the tropics.
   Knowledge of the distance over which the bee travels in search of food
   is crucial for successful pollination. Less is known about foraging
   ranges of African stingless bee species. This study investigated the
   foraging range of an African stingless bee species, Hypotrigona
   gribodoi, using translocation experiments. The capture-mark-recapture
   method and release at various designated distances were used. This study
   showed >90\% returning success of the bees when released up to 120 m
   from the hive. The distance at which bees attained 50\% returns (typical
   distance) was 250 m, while the distance in which 90\% of bees failed to
   return based on our regression function was 540 m. These results
   indicate that colonies of H. gribodoi placed in a field crop might
   provide good pollination within a radius of up to 250 m. The ability of
   foragers to collect pollen and nectar and the information about the
   distance they use for foraging is vital for managing and conserving
   stingless bees.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Translocations are a widespread approach to conserve threatened
   populations. Given the rapid decline and genetic deterioration of many
   natural populations, translocations are expected to become even more
   common in the future. The success of translocations is, however,
   dependent on multiple context-dependent factors, such as demographic and
   genetic status, habitat quality and animal behaviour. The Scandinavian
   arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) exists in a small, fragmented population
   that is demographically vulnerable and exposed to inbreeding depression.
   In the early 2000 s, releases of arctic foxes from the Norwegian Captive
   Breeding Programme were initiated with the purpose of reintroducing
   populations to formerly inhabited areas and promoting connectivity.
   Since 2008/2009, 61 foxes have been released in Junkeren, Norway to
   re-establish an unoccupied area. We used a combination of field
   observations and microsatellite genotyping from the release site and two
   neighbouring subpopulations to investigate (i) the probability of
   establishment and reproduction for released foxes at the release site
   and in neighbouring subpopulations, and (ii) the impact on litter size
   and genetic composition in the recipient populations. Results showed
   that 18\% of the released foxes were established at the release site, or
   in neighbouring subpopulations and 11.5\% reproduced successfully. The
   extent of post-release dispersal into neighbouring subpopulations was
   also relatively high (11.5\%). During the study period, the number of
   litters more than doubled in the subpopulations with released foxes
   contributing 29.5\% to this increase, but no clear effect of immigration
   on litter size was found. There was a slight increase in genetic
   variation in one of the subpopulations, and a significant decline in
   genetic divergence between subpopulations. We conclude that despite
   extensive releases, demographic and genetic effects were highly
   context-dependent. This study highlights the challenges of reinforcement
   programmes in small populations and reintroductions to unoccupied sites,
   especially for highly mobile species in a fragmented landscape.},

Title = {Estimating arboreality and the effects of forest structure on tropical
   tree-dwelling mesomammals using arboreal camera traps},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {140-153},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tropical forests are the most species-rich biomes in the world but
   suffer high rates of logging and conversion. Tropical tree-dwelling
   (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals reliant on old-growth forest
   structures are especially vulnerable. The degree of behavioral
   arboreality of semi-arboreal mammals can be related to forest structure
   and perceived terrestrial threats. Paired arboreal and terrestrial
   camera traps are a promising new method for estimating the arboreality
   of cryptic and nocturnal species. Our study aimed to (1) model the
   effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on the
   detection and occurrence of arboreal and semi-arboreal mesomammals and
   (2) evaluate differences in occurrence and detection between paired
   arboreal and terrestrial camera trap sites for semi-arboreal mammals
   while estimating the degree of arboreality. We set 20 terrestrial and
   arboreal camera trap pairs in eastern Cat Tien National Park (Nam Cat
   Tien), Vietnam, from June 2019 to September 2020. We evaluated the
   effects of forest structure and proximity to roads on nine arboreal
   mesomammal species using single-season occupancy models. We used
   multi-scale occupancy modeling to estimate the degree of arboreality for
   four semi-arboreal mammals. All models were fit using hierarchical
   Bayesian modeling and compared using WAIC. We detected most arboreal and
   terrestrial mesomammal species currently known to inhabit Nam Cat Tien,
   including rare and cryptic species. Canopy connectivity and other mature
   forest characteristics were important for explaining the detection and
   occurrence of highly arboreal species, while the effect of a tree and
   focal limb characteristics on detection was species-specific. All
   semi-arboreal species had a greater probability of terrestrial station
   use than arboreal, suggesting a greater vulnerability to terrestrial
   threats, though the degree of arboreality varied by species. Using one
   sampling method underestimated occupancy for most semi-arboreal species.
   Multi-method sampling designs with multi-scale occupancy modeling can
   improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use for guiding
   management and conservation decisions.},

Title = {Future land use and climate change escalate connectivity loss for
   Himalayan brown bears},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-215},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate and land use change are among the main drivers affecting
   virtually all species on earth. There were extensive studies projecting
   impacts of climate and land use changes on habitat loss and
   fragmentation but few on connectivity loss, and those that investigated
   connectivity did not disentangle the combined effects between climate
   change and land use change. This study uses the Himalayan brown bear
   (Ursus arctos isabellinus) as a case study to illustrate an approach for
   disentangling the effects of climate change and human land use on
   population connectivity in the future. First, we assessed the current
   spatial pattern of population connectivity by simulating cumulative
   resistant kernels and factorial least-cost paths with empirical field
   data. Then, we simulated the changes in connectivity due to future
   climate change under alternative emission scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP
   8.5) in mid (2041-2060) and late (2061-2080) 21st century, which served
   as baseline scenarios of future connectivity. Finally, we estimated the
   changes in future connectivity due to human land use changes by adding a
   low and a high human land use activity scenario to the baseline climate
   change scenarios in our simulations. Alarmingly, all high emission
   scenarios, with or without human land use change, were projected to
   result in >99\% reduction in current core areas of connectivity by the
   end of 21st century at 50th percentile threshold or above. This study
   demonstrates a spatially explicit scenario modeling approach to examine
   the interplay between future climate change and human land use on
   species connectivity. Our results suggest that regional land use
   regulations may be insufficient to conserve connectivity for HBB if
   nothing is done to reduce climate change at a global scale.},

Abstract = {Extensive bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife conservation
   worldwide, particularly when unselective methods such as wire snares
   kill target and non-target species (by-catch). Animals that escape from
   snares have injuries of varying severity, with effects on performance
   that are largely unknown, as most studies typically focus on immediate
   mortality caused by snaring. Here, we assessed the life-history costs of
   debilitating snare injuries in individually known female spotted hyenas
   Crocuta crocuta in three clans in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.
   This keystone predator is a regular by-catch of illegal bushmeat hunting
   of herbivores in the Serengeti ecosystem. We monitored individuals which
   escaped from snares between May 1987 and March 2020 and survived long
   enough to return to their clan territories from commuting trips in the
   park and surrounding protected areas. Snares that inflicted debilitating
   injuries on females did not reduce longevity but did delay age at first
   reproduction and reduced both litter size and offspring survival to the
   age of 1 year. This long-term decrease in reproductive performance
   likely resulted from increased inflammatory and immune responses to the
   snare injury and/or a decreased ability to travel the long distances
   necessary to feed on migratory herbivores. While our results are based
   on a relatively small sample of females with debilitating injuries, they
   suggest that the total population-level costs of wire snares in
   terrestrial by-catch species may be underestimated and that future
   studies may need to account for the potential reproductive costs of
   sublethal snare injuries.},

Title = {Restoring the orangutan in a Whole- or Half-Earth context},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Various global-scale proposals exist to reduce the loss of biological
   diversity. These include the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth visions that
   respectively seek to set aside half the planet for wildlife conservation
   or to diversify conservation practices fundamentally and change the
   economic systems that determine environmental harm. Here we assess these
   visions in the specific context of Bornean orangutans Pongo pygmaeus and
   their conservation. Using an expert-led process we explored three
   scenarios over a 10-year time frame: continuation of Current Conditions,
   a Half-Earth approach and a Whole-Earth approach. In addition, we
   examined a 100-year population recovery scenario assuming 0\% offtake of
   Bornean orangutans. Current Conditions were predicted to result in a
   population c. 73\% of its current size by 2032. Half-Earth was judged
   comparatively easy to achieve and predicted to result in an orangutan
   population of c. 87\% of its current size by 2032. Whole-Earth was
   anticipated to lead to greater forest loss and ape killing, resulting in
   a prediction of c. 44\% of the current orangutan population for 2032.
   Finally, under the recovery scenario, populations could be c. 148\% of
   their current size by 2122. Although we acknowledge uncertainties in all
   of these predictions, we conclude that the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth
   visions operate along different timelines, with the implementation of
   Whole-Earth requiring too much time to benefit orangutans. None of the
   theorized proposals provided a complete solution, so drawing elements
   from each will be required. We provide recommendations for equitable
   outcomes.},

Title = {Instagram as a data source for sea turtle surveys in shipwrecks in
   Brazil},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Shipwrecks have been accidentally and deliberately deployed worldwide,
   becoming artificial reefs for tourist attractions and habitats for
   marine species. Recreational divers often visit wrecks and post images
   on Instagram - a popular social network for image circulation. Here we
   evaluated if such images could be used as a data source for surveying
   sea turtles in shipwrecks and assessing diver-sea turtle interactions.
   We targeted the coast of Pernambuco in Brazil, which has over 100
   shipwrecks. We inspected public videos and photos posted on Instagram
   from October 2010 to April 2020. We used 20 tags in our search, which
   led to 2353 images (210 videos; 2143 photos). A total of 220 posts
   depicted sea turtles (189 photos and 31 videos; 41 sea turtles in videos
   and 199 in photos) and their enhanced quality-facilitated species
   identification. We detected Caretta caretta (loggerhead sea turtle),
   Chelonia mydas (green sea turtle) and Eretmochelys imbricata (hawksbill
   sea turtle). Turtles were found in 13 shipwrecks, all with bathymetry up
   to 30 m. Photos and videos provided the same proportion of images of
   each turtle species. Nevertheless, from a temporal perspective, this
   scenario changed. All three species were observed in photo posts in 4 of
   the 9 full years considered, whereas all three species were only
   observed in 1 year in the video posts. We registered four types of
   diver-turtle interactions from videos: `abrupt approach, chase, touch
   and pose'. We classified `abrupt approach, chasing and touching'
   behaviours as major disturbances as they altered the turtles'
   behaviours. We classified `pose' as a minor disturbance as it caused no
   apparent change in turtle behaviour. Chasing was the most frequently
   observed interaction. Instagram is a useful complementary tool that can
   aid in the surveillance of sea turtles in shipwrecks. However, the
   limitations of this type of data and adequate data filtering criteria
   must be considered.},

Title = {Where wolves were: setting historical baselines for wolf recovery in
   Spain},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-249},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reference conditions are necessary to assess the conservation status of
   species, understand their declines, and manage their recovery.
   Historical documents offer large amounts of records of a wide variety of
   species, which may be used to generate reference baselines on the
   historical distribution range of species. We collected information on
   the Iberian wolf Canis lupus signatus presence or assumed absence for
   6734 localities in Spain from the geographical dictionary edited by
   Pascual Madoz in the mid-19th century. We used probabilistic
   distribution models to estimate the wolf historical range with
   unprecedented detail, allowing the quantification of the historical
   reduction in occupancy area. Wolf records were widely distributed in
   mid-19th century Spain, being present in all its mainland provinces. The
   probability of occurrence was positively associated with landscape
   roughness and negatively with human population density and the landscape
   suitability for agriculture. The area estimated to be occupied by wolves
   ranged between 212 200 and 317 600 km(2), depending on the approach used
   to set cut-off values from the predictions. Our estimations represented
   an average range reduction of 68\% between the mid-19th century and
   present time, resulting in the current restriction of the species to the
   country's north-western quadrant. The putative recent recovery of the
   wolf in Spain consists mainly of the accumulation of wolf records in
   areas where the species had persisted and the recolonization of some
   peripheral areas, but there is no indication of widespread recovery of
   the historical distribution range. We show that the compilation of
   historical species records allows producing baseline range scenarios
   with much higher resolution than usually available to inform species
   status and set recovery targets, an approach that can be implemented in
   other areas and taxa.},

Title = {Australia's 2019-20 mega-fires are associated with lower occupancy of a
   rainforest-dependent bat},

Abstract = {Mega-fires in the Australian summer of 2019-20 resulted in the largest
   ever documented forest fire extent. These fires impacted many species,
   but individual responses remain poorly known, making assessments of
   their conservation status and ongoing threats uncertain. We assessed the
   influence of the 2019-20 mega-fires on habitat occupancy in the
   golden-tipped bat Phoniscus papuensis, a specialist which roosts in
   suspended birds' nests and occurs in relictual Gondwanan rainforest not
   typically exposed to fire. We used trapping and accounted for nightly
   detection probability (lower detection with increasing rainfall) to
   estimate site occupancy. Occupancy increased with the local (1 km buffer
   surrounding each site) extent of rainforest, gullies and unburnt forest.
   The model predicted a strong negative effect of fire in the surrounding
   buffer, with occupancy reduced from >90\% at sites with suitable habitat
   (extensive rainforest and gully systems) surrounded by unburnt forest to
   20\% when the entire surrounding area was burnt (regardless of
   severity). Gully rainforest sites surrounded by a mixture of burnt and
   unburnt forest were modelled to have intermediate occupancy values. On
   average, fire severity mapping revealed that 22\% of rainforest in the 1
   km buffer surrounding our burnt sites was unburnt, 61\% had a low
   severity burn, while 17\% experienced a high severity burn. The lower
   occupancy of P. papuensis in burnt rainforest was associated with a
   reduction in the abundance of suspended bird nests, a critical resource
   used for day-roosting. Our results quantify the effects of extreme fire
   events on animal populations in rainforest that is normally unaffected
   by fire. The large extent of rainforest burnt during the 2019-20
   Australian season of `mega-fires' and its strong negative effect on
   occupancy highlights the vulnerability of animal species reliant on
   fire-sensitive habitat to a climate-change driven increase in such
   extreme fire events.},

Title = {Personality-dependent responses of elk to predatory pursuits},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Personality in wildlife has been linked to several ecological processes
   including mortality risk, facultative migration, and behavioral
   plasticity. In this paper I examined the relationship between
   personality and antipredator tactics exhibited by 20 wild female elk
   (Cervus canadensis) in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Two observers
   conducted 106 separate chases designed explicitly to resemble predator
   pursuits by wolves, the main predator of elk. We quantified and
   classified elk tactical responses during each chase. Elk with ``shy{''}
   type personalities responded to 84\% of predator-resembling pursuits by
   employing speed-based tactics to outrun pursuers or rejoin conspecifics.
   Elk with ``bold{''} type personalities adopted this tactic just 11\% of
   the time, and instead employed tactics where they stopped and evaluated
   pursuers in 45\% of chases, attempted to hide from pursuers in 19\% of
   chases, and turned aggressively toward pursuers in 17\% of chases. Bold
   animals employed a greater variety of tactics overall and were more
   likely to try multiple tactics within the same 10-min chase. Shyness was
   also positively correlated with flight initiation distance at the start
   of chases. These results are important for wildlife managers who may be
   artificially and unwittingly selecting against certain personalities and
   thereby influencing management and conservation outcomes.},

Title = {Using public surveys to rapidly profile biological invasions in

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Understanding the impact and dynamics of invasive alien species (IAS) is
   essential for tailoring appropriate management plans. This information
   can be difficult to obtain in the short term, and intrinsic difficulties
   of monitoring hard-to-reach areas may hamper prompt estimation of IAS
   distributions. Using the case of the invasive Asian common toad
   (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) in Madagascar, we show how public surveys
   coupled with a multi-analytical approach can promptly provide accurate
   information on invasion dynamics and impacts. On the basis of
   key-informant responses, we built polynomial regressions to investigate
   the spatiotemporal invasion patterns, false-positive occupancy models to
   estimate species occupancy, and mixed-effect models to evaluate the
   public perception and attitudes. The invasion followed a linear
   expansion of approx. 2 km year(-1), with human-mediated dispersal
   facilitating the spread of the species. Toad occupancy decreased towards
   the invasion front and increased in the southern portion of its range.
   Negative perception decreased in urban areas, where people were less
   concerned by toad impacts on ecosystems, and in recently invaded
   localities, suggesting density- or time-dependent effects. We also
   identified 12 potential impacts, with ``loss of domestic apiaries{''},
   ``poisoning of poultry{''} and ``decline of snakes{''} standing out for
   prevalence and potential severity. Our results bring important insights
   into the invasion dynamics and the human-toad interactions in
   Madagascar, highlighting the versatility of public surveys to obtain
   essential information for invasion science and management, which can be
   especially useful in hard-to-monitor regions of the world with a low
   in-country capacity to counter invasive species.},

Title = {Landcover change and habitat quality mediate impacts of temperature and

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {464-476},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate and landcover change can have synergistic impacts on wildlife
   populations, but the pervasiveness of these threats and factors that
   buffer them remain unclear despite important implications for
   conservation. I evaluated the additive and interactive effects of
   spatiotemporal variation in temperature, precipitation, and landcover
   change on annual territory occupancy, colonization, and extinction of a
   threatened top-predator, the ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium
   brasilianum), across a vast binational region of the Sonoran Desert over
   16years. I also assessed how local habitat quality and regional
   population size mediate impacts of these stressors. Despite significant
   bivariate associations between occupancy and temperature, precipitation,
   and landcover change, evidence for interactions was much greater than
   for additive effects. Occupancy of territories imbedded in increasingly
   disturbed landscapes declined at greater rates with warming winter
   temperatures, but the temperature had little effect in intact landscapes
   suggesting they buffer impacts of climate warming. Occupancy increased
   markedly with precipitation due likely to major positive impacts on
   prey, but again, interactive effects were stronger given territories of
   higher quality amplified benefits of precipitation. Impacts of landcover
   change and habitat quality on extinction depended markedly on regional
   population sizes. When populations were small and few potential
   colonists were present, high-quality habitat and low landcover change
   failed to reduce extinction. When populations were large, however,
   high-quality habitat and more intact landscapes, which best foster
   dispersal, reduced extinction. Hence, complex interacting processes
   linked to the effects of precipitation and habitat quality on carrying
   capacity, landcover change on habitat connectivity and vulnerability to
   rising temperatures, and local population sizes simultaneously drove
   dynamics. Efforts to identify and protect high-quality habitat and limit
   landcover change can enhance conservation but will be most efficient in
   intact landscapes. Efforts to enhance local habitat quality and
   quantity, and directly augment populations should consider broader
   landscape contexts linked to habitat connectivity and potential source
   populations.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of sculpins (Cottus, Cottidae) remains one of the last
   major unresolved puzzles in the systematics of North American freshwater
   fishes. We used molecular approaches to identify candidate taxa and
   their distribution across western North America. We crowd-sourced the
   collection of specimens (n = 8272) via outreach to biologists in the
   western United States and Canada. From that collection, we sequenced-at
   up to 2 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear genes-a subset (n = 4009) of
   specimens from most basins in the western United States, added sequences
   from public sequence databases, and applied an array of species
   delimitation and specimen identification methods to assess phylogenetic
   and spatial patterns of diversity. Species delimitation methods,
   primarily relying on a conservative interpretation of the phylogenetic
   species concept, were broadly concordant and indicated that 43 candidate
   species were present. Some named taxa were unsupported, whereas others,
   if recognized, would violate the phylogenetic species concept. Specimen
   assignment was largely unambiguous and geographic distributions were
   consistent with phylo-geographic patterns in other taxa. Our work
   establishes a benchmark for understanding the diversity of sculpin in
   western North America and suggests new species hypotheses both there and
   in eastern North America.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the floral diversity of the Lagos coastal
   environments by sampling 21 points using the quadrat method. The study
   revealed two major aquatic ecosystem types (mangrove and freshwater

   While Alchornea cordifolia and Raphia hookeri were found as the most
   frequent, Acalypha crenata and Acrostichum aureum were the least
   abundant species. The highest and lowest species-rich locations were
   Unilag (n = 125 species) and Abule Osun (n = 2 species), respectively.
   The vegetation structure of the LCE is dominated by herbaceous species.
   Our findings provide insights on the flora diversity of the LCE, and a
   guideline for the effective conservation of near-threatened species such
   as Nauclea diderrichii and Mitragyna stipulosa in this coastal ecosystem

Abstract = {Translocation of elephants is used to mitigate human-elephant conflict
   in Asia and Africa. However, few studies investigate how translocations
   affect the movements and social behaviour of individuals following their
   release, which may have important implications for whether translocated
   animals survive and succeed. Using GPS-tracking data, we explored
   movements of five translocated bull elephants (Loxodonta africana) moved
   to Tsavo, Kenya, and compared them with five resident bull elephants.
   Position data was collected hourly for 1 year (March 2018-March 2019),
   and analysed to investigate home range, displacement rates, problematic
   behaviour and group size. Of the five translocated elephants, three were
   illegally killed and one continued to break fences and raid crops. Only
   one elephant stayed away from human settlement. We found group size and
   composition to be significantly different, with translocated elephants
   observed in smaller groups with no female elephant interactions. All
   elephants showed variation in home ranges and displacement rates, but
   differences were not significant between resident and translocated
   elephant groups. For future translocations, we recommend careful
   consideration of elephant social systems, elephant age, timing, release
   site and proximity to human settlements that might create human-elephant
   conflict. This will improve chance for success of such high-stake and
   expensive translocations.},

Title = {New distributional data for the northern forestfly, Lednia borealis

Abstract = {The northern forestfly, Lednia borealis Baumann and Kondratieff, 2010
   (Plecoptera: Nemouridae), is a rare montane stonefly that until recently
   was thought to be endemic to Washington State. It is one of 4 described
   Lednia species in the western United States and Canada and the only
   member of its genus known to occur in Washington. All 4 Lednia species
   are associated with cold-water habitat in alpine and subalpine habitats;
   because of this, they may be especially vulnerable to threats associated
   with climate change. However, L. borealis is rarely targeted in species
   inventories or survey efforts, and more information is needed about its
   distribution and habitat associations in order to assess its
   conservation status. To address these data gaps, we conducted targeted
   surveys at 94 sites in montane areas of Washington State from 2015 to
   2019. We collected L. borealis at only 8 of these (8.5\%), bringing the
   total number of known sites to 19. In this paper, we update the known
   distribution for the species, report recent COI barcoding results,
   highlight a confirmed habitat association with glacial edge meltwater,
   and provide recommendations for future surveys.},

Title = {Predicting Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse lek occurrence in Grand Teton

Abstract = {Many North American populations of lekking grouse have declined across
   their ranges, and understanding and evaluating population trajectories
   can assist in better managing these iconic species. Columbian
   Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) is a
   subspecies of Sharp-tailed Grouse that has declined across its range in
   the Intermountain West over the past century. Management of this species
   primarily focuses on habitat around leks; therefore, knowing where
   Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse leks occur is key to their conservation.
   We used a resource selection framework to predict lek occurrence in an
   area with multiple known leks in Carbon County, Wyoming. We used this
   model to predict lek occurrence in an area with only one known lek in
   Grand Teton National Park. Our model predicting lek locations in Carbon
   County was a strong predictor of lek occurrence in that area (r(s) =
   0.97), and when this model was projected onto Grand Teton National Park,
   the one known lek in the park was located in an area of very high
   probability for lek occurrence (>90\% probability of lek occurrence). We
   also used this predictive surface to locate 1 unknown lek and 7 other
   locations in Grand Teton National Park used by Columbian Sharp-tailed
   Grouse as detected by fecal droppings, feathers, or birds flushed. Our
   methods demonstrated that a resource selection framework from one area
   can be used to predict lek and other occurrences in another area when
   these areas have similar vegetation compositions.},

Abstract = {The burrow systems (warrens) of whistling rat Parotomys brantsii are
   confined to patches of deep soil (biogenic mounds known as heuweltjies)
   on stony plains in the arid Succulent Karoo region of South Africa.
   Whistling rat warrens were recorded on heuweltjies at the Tierberg
   Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the southern Karoo, Western
   Cape Province, South Africa, on eight occasions between 1988 and 2001.
   Increasing temperatures over the study period combined with a severe
   drought from 2015 to 2021 caused a 36\% dieback in perennial shrub cover
   on the research site. The percentage of heuweltjies occupied by
   whistling rats declined from 44\% occupation to 20\% occupation between
   2005 and 2021 during unusually hot, dry conditions indicated by low
   values in the Standardised Evapotranspiration Index. Around their
   warrens, whistling rats had no influence on species richness of
   perennial plants but reduced vegetation cover.},

Title = {Structural sensitivity in the functional responses of predator-prey
   models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In mathematical modelling, several different functional forms can often
   be used to fit a data set equally well, especially if the data is
   sparse. In such cases, these mathematically different but similar
   looking functional forms are typically considered interchangeable.
   Recent work, however, shows that similar functional responses may
   nonetheless result in significantly different bifurcation points for the
   Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the bifurcation
   behaviours include destabilizing oscillations, predicting the occurrence
   of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different
   bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained
   from the models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to
   the extinction of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions
   is also clearly important for conservationists. Mathematically, this
   difference in bifurcation structure given similar functional responses
   is called structural sensitivity. We extend the existing work to find
   that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey system is also structurally
   sensitive to the functional response. Using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur and
   Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if there is some way
   to obtain a functional description of data so that different functional
   responses yield the same bifurcation structure, i.e., we aim to describe
   data such that our model is not structurally sensitive. We first add
   stochasticity to the functional responses and find that better
   similarity of the resulting bifurcation structures is achieved. Then, we
   analyse the functional responses using two different methods to
   determine which part of each function contributes most to the observed
   bifurcation behaviour. We find that prey densities around the
   coexistence steady state are most important in defining the functional
   response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for ecologists and mathematical
   modellers to increase the accuracy of model predictions in predator-prey
   systems.},

Title = {Identifying human-brown bear conflict hotspots for prioritizing critical

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Multiple studies have used species distribution models to identify
   human-wildlife conflict drivers. An important application of these
   models is spatial conflict resolution by accounting for habitat
   suitability and corridors. We used distribution and connectivity models
   to identify habitats and corridors for brown bear Ursus arctos in
   southwestern Iran with high risk of bear damages, and evaluated the
   effects of landscape composition and configuration on the predicted
   conflict hotspots. We used 154 locations of bear damage incidents along
   with a suit of predictors to develop risk models. To prepare predictive
   variables, we used brown bear occurrence data and a number of covariates
   to develop a suitability model. We then converted the suitability map
   into a resistance surface and used a connectivity model to predict
   corridors. Finally, the bear damages risk map, habitats and corridors
   were overlaid to prioritize conflict hotspots, corridors and habitats,
   and conflict-prone corridors. Proportion of suitable habitats, distance
   to village, density of forest patches, conservation areas and corridor
   bottlenecks were the main predictors contributing to bear damages risk.
   A total of 38.73\% of habitats, and 6.24\% of corridors across the 124
   000-km(2) study area were identified as areas with high risk of bear
   damages. The risk of bear damage was also spatially associated with
   forests fragmentation and patchiness of habitat. Our results highlight
   the importance of landscape configuration and corridors when
   investigating the spatial patterns of bear damages. Our findings showed
   how the combination of distribution models and connectivity analysis can
   guide carnivore conservation planning aiming at reducing the risk of
   carnivore-inflicted damages.},

Title = {Does anthropization affect physiology, behaviour and life-history traits
   of Montagu's harrier chicks?},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {174-188},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The last century has seen a steep decline in biodiversity, and
   anthropization is considered one of the major drivers of this decline.
   Anthropogenic disturbances, due to human presence and/or activities, may
   be perceived as chronic stressors by wildlife and potentially lead to
   deleterious effects on traits related to fitness. The main objective of
   the present study was to highlight the effects of these anthropogenic
   elements on wild birds on sparsely urbanized farmland, far less studied
   than in urbanized areas. We investigated during four successive breeding
   seasons whether the anthropization level, assessed by infrastructure
   density around nests, and the harvesting conditions around nests may
   impact physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of Montagu's
   harrier Circus pygargus chicks. Higher anthropization levels were
   associated with higher basal corticosterone levels in nestlings during
   only one breeding season and a lower body condition at fledging for
   females, probably because they suffered from higher starvation than
   males. Nestlings reared in more anthropized areas or in harvested crops
   before their fledging harboured more fault bars on rectrices than those
   reared in less anthropized areas or in unharvested crops regardless of
   year and sex, which is suggestive of higher stress during development.
   Nestling behaviours were also impacted by anthropization level and
   harvesting conditions: chicks in harvested crops were more aggressive
   and in areas with higher anthropization levels more prone to escape than
   others. Because Montagu's harrier is a protected species, the impacts
   highlighted in the present study are a matter of concern, especially
   regarding farmland landscape modifications, and we advise limiting
   perturbations in areas where Montagu's harriers usually nest.},

Title = {Baseline biodiversity assessment of South Texas small mammals and

Abstract = {Baseline biodiversity surveys are necessary to assess organismal
   diversity across spatial and temporal scales. These surveys can be
   particularly useful for monitoring changes in organismal diversity and
   pathogen spread in response to climate change. Arthropod vectors such as
   ticks are susceptible to geographic range shifts with a warming climate,
   potentially resulting in the expansion of risk areas for vector-borne
   disease. Biodiversity data are deficient from South Texas, which is
   particularly concerning given the abundance of wildlife and livestock
   that may be important in perpetuating tick and pathogen populations. We
   performed a baseline biodiversity assessment of small mammals, ticks,
   and tick-borne pathogens in South Texas using a combination of
   fieldwork, collections-based research, and molecular approaches. We
   recorded 19 species of small mammals and 3 species of ticks, and we
   detected no tick-borne pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia or
   Rickettsia in the ticks or mammals. Given the continued emergence of
   tick-borne disease, we recommend collaborations with natural history
   collections and private landowners interested in land stewardship so
   researchers can develop a better understanding of changing small mammal,
   tick, and pathogen diversity with implications for human and veterinary
   health in this region of Texas.},

Abstract = {For species without parental care, such as sea turtles, nest site
   selection is particularly important for embryo development, hatchling
   survival and, ultimately, reproductive success. We conducted an 8-year
   (2012-2019) capture-mark-recapture study of the re-nesting behaviour of
   loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta to identify both inter- and
   intra-beach patterns of nest site selection. Our study site, Maio Island
   in the archipelago of Cabo Verde, hosts one of the largest loggerhead
   turtle nesting colonies globally. Of 1,060 females analysed, 77\% laid
   repeated clutches within 15 km of their previous nesting sites both
   between and within nesting seasons. This site fidelity was particularly
   high (64-71\%) for turtles nesting on the east coast of Maio Island. In
   two areas of the island (north-west and south-east) individual nesting
   zone consistency was extremely low (10-25\%). In all cases extra-zone
   re-nesting events mainly occurred on the east coast. We also found that
   females avoided re-nesting near the shoreline, which is particularly
   relevant in the context of rising sea levels. Overall, loggerhead
   turtles nesting in Maio Island are philopatric but are using a
   bet-edging strategy to distribute nests amongst several beaches,
   choosing the safest area within each beach to maximize their
   reproductive success. This study highlights the priority sites for
   protection on Maio Island and could help to optimize
   capture-mark-recapture programmes. The data reveal the potential for
   adaptive responses to projected sea level rises.},

Title = {Conservation value of vanilla agroecosystems for vertebrate diversity in
   north-east Madagascar},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-128},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As a result of increasing global demand for food, large areas of natural
   habitat are being converted to agroecosystems to accommodate crop
   cultivation. This agricultural expansion is most prominent in the
   tropics, where many rural communities are dependent solely on farming
   income for their livelihoods. Such agricultural land conversion can have
   severe implications for local fauna. In this study, we compared
   vertebrate species diversity between natural forest habitat and three
   types of vanilla plantations maintained under varying management regimes
   in northeast Madagascar. We used diurnal and nocturnal transects to
   survey vertebrate diversity. Natural forest habitat contained the
   greatest vertebrate species diversity, and had proportionally more
   threatened and endemic species than all vanilla plantation types.
   However, we observed a greater number of species and a higher inverse
   Simpson index in minimally managed vanilla plantations located within or
   near natural forest compared to intensively managed vanilla plantations.
   These findings are important and encouraging for animal conservation and
   sustainable crop cultivation in Madagascar, and suggest that newly
   created vanilla plantations, and already existing plantations, should
   endeavour to follow the more traditional, minimalistic management
   approach to improve sustainability and promote higher faunal diversity.},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {40-47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Snake soup continues to be an iconic tradition in Cantonese culture. Yet
   little is known about the relationship between snake soup consumption in
   Hong Kong, wild snake populations, and the communities depending on this
   tradition for their livelihoods. We applied an interdisciplinary
   approach including interviews with shopkeepers and genetic analyses of
   snake meat samples to determine the species consumed in Hong Kong, their
   source locations, and shopkeepers' views on the future of the industry.
   We genetically identified the common rat snake Ptyas mucosa, widely
   distributed throughout East and Southeast Asia, and the Javan spitting
   cobra Naja sputatrix, endemic to Indonesia, as the species most commonly
   consumed, which was consistent with interview responses. According to
   interviews, snakes had mostly been imported from mainland China in the
   past, but now tend to be sourced from Southeast Asia, particularly
   Indonesia. Interviews also revealed a pessimistic outlook on the
   continuation of this tradition because of various factors, including a
   lasting yet misinformed association of snakes with the 2002-2003
   outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Given the COVID-19
   pandemic and China's ensuing ban on the consumption of terrestrial
   wildlife, Hong Kong's snake soup industry will probably continue to rely
   on Southeast Asian sources to persist. Given the cultural and
   conservation issues surrounding this tradition, further research on the
   economic, ecological and social consequences of snake consumption is
   needed to examine the broader implications of snake soup and similar
   industries in the region.},

Abstract = {The wetlands inhabited by the southern river otter Lontra provocax in
   Chile are subject to anthropogenic disturbances. As a result of the
   modification and destruction of its habitat, caused by loss of riparian
   vegetation, and other threats, the species is categorized as Endangered
   on the IUCN Red List. We monitored the river otter and its diet during
   September 2020-January 2021 in a swamp forest fragment in southern
   Chile. We obtained evidence of river otter presence from the upper part
   of the wetland to the confluence with the Bueno River, suggesting
   inter-population connectivity of the species in an extensive
   hydrographic basin. Faeces and food remains showed a predominance of
   native macrocrustaceans, with introduced fish present at lower levels.
   The detection of the southern river otter in a fragment of threatened
   swamp forest suggests a low abundance in environmentally degraded
   freshwater environments. The identification of subpopulations such as
   the one reported here provides valuable data to support the conservation
   of the species in threatened wetlands.},

Title = {Can cultural values associated with turacos be used to enhance

Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Turacos are birds used as status symbols in certain African cultures.
   Despite this cultural value, turacos are increasingly threatened by
   habitat loss and illegal hunting. We tested the hypothesis that the high
   cultural value associated with turacos means local people are willing to
   conserve them and their habitats. To this end, we examined the
   traditional uses of turacos and how their cultural value could
   facilitate conservation interventions. We administered an open-ended
   questionnaire to 180 households during January 2017-November 2019. We
   found the feathers of three species of turacos to be associated with
   qualities such as social esteem and power: Bannerman's turaco Tauraco
   bannermani (categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List), green
   turaco Tauraco persa (Least Concern) and great blue turaco Corythaeola
   cristata (Least Concern). People were generally supportive of efforts to
   protect turacos because of a strong connection between these birds and
   the local culture, supporting our hypothesis. This particularly applied
   to people of high social standing such as chiefs and village elders who
   use turaco feathers to gain public distinction. Feathers were also used
   by herbalists for traditional medicine, and hunters used the birds'
   calls as a time indicator. Feathers are generally obtained through
   opportunistic collection and a sustainable, traditional hunting system,
   but we also found that some people hunt turacos to sell them as pets. We
   recommend that conservation interventions make use of the cultural
   values associated with these iconic species, together with implementing
   alternative sources of livelihoods, to promote behaviours that help
   achieve conservation objectives in the area.},

Title = {Contrasting levels of hybridization across the two contact zones between

Volume = {129},

Pages = {305-315},

Abstract = {Hybridization and introgression have played important roles in the
   history of various species, including lineage diversification and the
   evolution of adaptive traits. Hybridization can accelerate the
   development of reproductive isolation between diverging species, and
   thus valuable insight into the evolution of reproductive barrier
   formation may be gained by studying secondary contact zones. Hedgehogs
   of the genus Erinaceus, which are insectivores sensitive to changes in
   climate, are a pioneer model in Pleistocene phylogeography. The present
   study provides the first genome-wide SNP data regarding the Erinaceus
   hedgehogs species complex, offering a unique comparison of two secondary
   contact zones between Erinaceus europaeus and E. roumanicus. Results
   confirmed diversification of the genus during the Pleistocene period,
   and detected a new refugial lineage of E. roumanicus outside the
   Mediterranean basin, most likely in the Ponto-Caspian region. In the
   Central European zone, the level of hybridization was low, whereas in
   the Russian-Baltic zone, both species hybridise extensively.
   Asymmetrical gene flow from E. europaeus to E. roumanicus suggests that
   reproductive isolation varies according to the direction of the crosses
   in the hybrid zones. However, no loci with significantly different
   patterns of introgression were detected. Markedly different pre- and
   post-zygotic barriers, and thus diverse modes of species boundary
   maintenance in the two contact zones, likely exist. This pattern is
   probably a consequence of the different age and thus of the different
   stage of evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms in each hybrid
   zone.},

Abstract = {Inference of recent population divergence requires fast evolving markers
   and necessitates to differentiate shared genetic variation caused by
   ancestral polymorphism and gene flow. Theoretical research shows that
   the use of compound marker systems integrating linked polymorphisms with
   different mutational dynamics, such as a microsatellite and its flanking
   sequences, can improve estimation of population structure and inference
   of demographic history, especially in the case of complex population
   dynamics. However, empirical application in natural populations has so
   far been limited by lack of suitable methods for data collection. A
   solution comes from the development of sequence-based microsatellite
   genotyping which we used to study molecular variation at 36 sequenced
   nuclear microsatellites in seven Quercus canariensis and four Q. faginea
   rear-edge populations across Algeria. We aim to decipher their taxonomic
   relationship, past evolutionary history and recent demographic
   trajectory. First, we compare the estimation of population genetics
   parameters and simulation-based inference of demographic history from
   microsatellite sequence alone, flanking sequence alone or the
   combination of linked microsatellite and flanking sequence variation.
   Second, we apply random forest approximate Bayesian computation to
   identify which of these sequence types is most informative. Whereas
   analysing microsatellite variation alone indicates recent interspecific
   gene flow, additional information gained by integrating nucleotide
   variation in flanking sequences, by reducing homoplasy, suggests ancient
   interspecific gene flow followed by drift in isolation instead. The
   weight of each polymorphism in the inference also demonstrates the value
   of linked variations with contrasted mutation dynamic to improve
   estimation of both demographic and mutational parameters.},

Abstract = {Common names allow species diversity to be acknowledged by experts and
   non-specialists alike; they are descriptors with both scientific and
   cultural implications. However, a lack of clarity when using a common
   name could risk altering perceptions of threatened species. This is the
   case for the Critically Endangered wild camel Camelus ferus, which,
   despite extensive evidence of its species status, is frequently referred
   to in English as wild Bactrian camel. However, the wild camel
   (Mongolian: khavtgai; Chinese: ye luo tuo) is not a wild version of the
   domestic Bactrian camel Camelus bactrianus but a separate species near
   extinction, with an estimated population of c. 950. Failure to clearly
   separate Bactrian and wild camels in name risks masking the plight of
   the few remaining wild camels with the visible abundance of the
   domesticated species. Here we advocate the use of the accurate English
   common name wild camel for C. ferus ideally alongside its Indigenous
   names to correctly represent its cultural and conservation importance.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Biodiversity loss is one of the greatest global challenges and requires
   substantial investment in building the capacity of conservation
   professionals to design and implement robust conservation plans. In this
   study, we surveyed 155 past participants of training in facilitating
   species conservation planning processes given by the Conservation
   Planning Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. Based
   on a recently developed theory of change for the training, we examined
   how and to what extent the training contributed to the desired outcome
   of increasing trainees' capacity for leading the design and facilitation
   of species conservation planning processes. Our results indicate that
   recall of training content, self-efficacy (an individual's belief they
   can complete a specific task or behaviour successfully) and peer network
   participation had significant impacts on the outcome of applying
   training content in the workplace. Furthermore, our results suggest that
   self-efficacy played a highly influential role in trainees'
   participation in species conservation planning post-training. The
   implications of this research point to designing conservation training
   that considers not only the skills and knowledge to be gained by
   learners but also the strategies that enhance trainees' self-efficacy in
   applying new skills and knowledge and in establishing peer networks to
   support trainees in turning training objectives into realities.},

Title = {Using citizen science to study a mesocarnivore: the jungle cat Felis

Abstract = {We used citizen science and inexpensive methodology to assess the
   distribution of the jungle cat Felis chaus, a relatively common species
   in Sri Lanka but the least studied of the four wild cat species
   occurring in the country. We obtained three types of records of the
   jungle cat: geo-referenced photographs of the species from the public;
   sightings obtained from print and social media, and provided via an
   online sighting form; and sightings by field biologists. We combined the
   112 unique records obtained in this way with the 21 records from the
   2012 National Red List distribution map of the species, and used MaxEnt
   to predict habitat suitability for the species. The new sightings were
   primarily in drier regions, expanding the known extent of occurrence for
   this species in Sri Lanka. Of the new sightings, 7.1\% were road kills.
   Distance to nearest riverine forest, annual precipitation and distance
   to the nearest reservoir were the most important variables explaining
   habitat suitability. These findings validate our hypotheses that the
   species is more widespread than demonstrated previously and also ranges
   in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. Our study
   provides a model for how ecological and behavioural information for
   common species can be obtained inexpensively and incorporated into
   species distribution models. Studies of species such as the jungle cat,
   which are neither threatened nor charismatic, will help ensure that we
   keep common species common.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide,
   but knowledge of how agriculture modifies animal movement, which is
   crucial for survival, is limited. Here, we examined the effect of
   landscape composition on the movements of the oriental garden lizard
   Calotes versicolor in agricultural landscapes of north-central Pakistan.
   We radio-tracked 32 individuals over 5 months to determine whether land
   cover type (farmland, tree patches, grassland) influences hourly
   movement rate, inter-day distance moved, and activity area size. We
   found that hourly movement rates were higher in tree patches compared to
   grasslands, and higher when animals moved between land cover types
   rather than within individual land cover types. Activity area size and
   movement rates became smaller as the season progressed, but they did not
   differ according to animal sex or body size. Habitat selection analysis
   showed that lizards preferred tree patches, avoided farms, roads, water
   bodies and human dwellings, and used grasslands in proportion to
   availability. When lizards used farmlands, they were found in field
   margins 85\% of the time. Our results emphasize the importance of treed
   areas as reptile habitat in these highly modified agricultural lands.
   Agricultural intensification that reduces the availability of tree
   patches and field margins will likely reduce the extent to which lizards
   can use the landscape by removing preferred habitat. Maintaining tree
   cover and small fields with field margins should promote the coexistence
   of wildlife conservation and food production in agricultural landscapes.},

Title = {Population genetics reveals divergent lineages and ongoing hybridization

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 4},
Abstract = {Deciphering the effects of historical and recent demographic processes
   responsible for the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure
   is a key objective in evolutionary and conservation biology. Using
   population genetic analyses, we investigated the demographic history,
   the contemporary genetic diversity and structure, and the occurrence of
   hybridization and introgression of two species of anadromous fish with
   contrasting life history strategies and which have undergone recent
   demographic declines, the allis shad (Alosa alosa) and the twaite shad
   (Alosa fallax). We genotyped 706 individuals from 20 rivers and 5 sites
   at sea in Southern Europe at thirteen microsatellite markers. Genetic
   structure between populations was lower for the nearly semelparous
   species A. alosa, which disperses greater distances compared to the
   iteroparous species, A. fallax. Individuals caught at sea were assigned
   at the river level for A. fallax and at the region level for A. alosa.
   Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we inferred that
   the most likely long term historical divergence scenario between both
   species and lineages involved historical separation followed by
   secondary contact accompanied by strong population size decline.
   Accordingly, we found evidence for contemporary hybridization and
   bidirectional introgression due to gene flow between both species and
   lineages. Moreover, our results support the existence of at least one
   distinct species in the Mediterrannean sea: A. agone in Golfe du Lion
   area, and another divergent lineage in Corsica. Overall, our results
   shed light on the interplay between historical and recent demographic
   processes and life history strategies in shaping population genetic
   diversity and structure of closely related species. The recent
   demographic decline of these species' populations and their
   hybridization should be carefully considered while implementing
   conservation programs.},

Abstract = {A trophic model was constructed for Lake Ziway, Ethiopia, using EwE
   suite aiming to analyse and evaluate food-web structure, function and
   ecosystem properties. The input parameters were obtained from a survey
   of primary producers, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and fish studies
   and published materials. Various levels of fishing effort were used to
   simulate and produce different scenarios. The biomass flow of the
   ecosystem was restricted between trophic levels I and II contributing
   99.76\%. The mean transfer efficiency was only 4.4\%. The fishery
   catches consumed 2.5\% of the primary production, and most of the
   production remains within the system unutilised (ecotrophic efficiency =
   0.47). Fish groups were highly constrained by a combination of fishing
   and predation mortality as supported by high EE. Ecosim scenario
   analysis indicated that decreasing fishing effort of beach seine by half
   would increase the biomass of carp to six times in 10-year period, which
   might have increased turbidity and competition with tilapia.
   Furthermore, a high abundance of African catfish may escalate predation
   mortality on tilapia. Thus, contrary to what the managerial body
   expects, tilapia may not benefit from beach seine restriction alone. The
   models have captured the increasing fishing yield of carp, which was not
   the case when the model was created.},

Abstract = {Information on breeding habits of grey crowned crane (Balearica
   regulorum) in Kenya is currently lacking. Investigations were therefore
   carried out between 2017 and 2020 to determine its nesting habits in
   Lake Ol' Bolossat basin including nest-site features, number and
   distribution of territorial pairs, clutch size, eggs, and duration of
   breeding cycle. While 103 pairs were observed in the lake marshlands
   (mean density 5.00 pairs/km(2)), only 20 were found in upland wetlands.
   The number of pairs and densities (pairs/km(2)) in each of the lake's
   sections were as follows: north (24; 3.23), middle (47; 5.42), and south
   (32; 6.24). During this study, 61\% (n = 63) of the lake marshland pairs
   attempted to breed compared to 80\% (n = 16) in the upland wetlands. A
   mean of 2.23 eggs/clutch and a modal clutch of three eggs was recorded
   in 33 accessible nests. The range of influential factors in nest-site
   selection were as follows: water depth (50-100 cm), vegetation height
   around the nest (60-90 cm), and an offshore distance of >100 m. Breeding
   cycle showed phenotypic plasticity in response to variations in local
   weather conditions. The number and density of cranes in this study area
   show its importance in the recovery and survival of the species, and
   which should subsequently be accorded effective protection.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Environmental sustainability is a huge challenge in Africa as the region
   is currently struggling to provide sustainable systems to support daily
   human activities. Such activities in many African organisations include
   paper-based information storage and communication which are not
   ecofriendly and place a huge burden on forest resources. This study
   therefore focused on the implication of overusing paper in an African
   university. Fifty offices in the university were surveyed and 59
   questionnaires administered. The questionnaires were transcribed and
   analysed using both textual qualitative and quantitative analyses. The
   results showed that 6888 reams of paper (costing about 8 million Naira)
   are consumed annually by the university, translating to about 413 trees,
   which are enough to occupy a standard-sized football pitch. It was also
   found that administrative staff members were generally Information
   Communication Technology (ICT) certified; however, many of them are
   still not well-informed on the environmental implication of
   overconsuming paper even though they are largely aware of the benefits
   of paperless systems. Recommendations were offered on how to reduce the
   demand for paper by the university. This study is expected to create
   more awareness on the urgent need for African organisations to take
   environmental sustainability issues more seriously.},

Abstract = {This study aims to provide updated information on the myriapodofauna of
   different habitat types in Douala. Data were collected from September
   2018 to February 2019 in four types of vegetation chosen following an
   urban-rural gradient: home gardens, fallow land, agrosystems and
   secondary forest. Sampling took place every 2 weeks using hand
   collection, pitfall and Winkler technique. Analysis of the diversity
   within the communities studied consisted in generating indices of alpha-
   and beta-diversity. A total of 904 individuals of 26 species and three
   classes were collected. Hand collection was more effective in collecting
   myriapods (62.3\% of individuals collected and 26 species) than pitfall
   trapping (28.9\%; 25 species) and Winkler (8.9\%; eight species). The
   class of diplopods was the richest in species (22 species) and the most
   abundant (88.4\% of the total number of individuals collected). It was
   followed by chilopods (three species and 7.0\%) and symphylans (one
   species and 4.6\%). The myriapodofauna of the forest (Shannon-Weaver
   index: H' = 2.93) was more diversified than that of agrosystems (H' =
   2.22), fallow land (H' = 1.56) and home gardens (H' = 0.97). The
   secondary forest and agrosystems had the greatest species turnover,
   while the agrosystems and home gardens had the lowest. This study showed
   that myriapod diversity is affected by habitat type and season.},

Abstract = {Murid rodents are considered globally important invasive species, yet
   they are still sold in the pet trade. Little is known about the genetic
   diversity of traded rodents, and many species are incorrectly identified
   in the pet trade. We used mitochondrial gene regions to assess the
   taxonomy and genetic diversity of 149 rodents sold in pet shops across
   eight South African provinces. We identified a total of 112 specimens as
   Mus musculus, while 31 were Rattus norvegicus, and six were identified
   as the southern African endemic, southern multimammate mouse Mastomys
   coucha. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the three species were
   monophyletic. Mus musculus and R. norvegicus showed higher levels of
   genetic diversity, with 19 unique mtDNA haplotypes recovered for M.
   musculus and eight haplotypes for R. norvegicus. KwaZulu-Natal, Western
   Cape and Gauteng Provinces had the most unique haplotypes than other
   provinces. Our findings showed that non-native species are widely
   distributed in the South African pet trade industry, while M. coucha was
   not widely traded, although recorded in three provinces. This suggests
   that most provinces comply with the trade regulations on native species,
   but the threat of invasive rodents to South Africa's unique biodiversity
   is highlighted.},

Abstract = {Plant species providing Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) are
   economically important across Africa. How this heterogeneous and
   understudied resource will respond to ongoing climate change remains
   understudied. Here, we modelled the impact of end-of-the-century climate
   change on the distribution of 40 NTFP plant species distributed across
   tropical Africa. Occurrence data were extracted from a taxonomically
   verified database and three different ecological niche modelling
   algorithms were used. Species distributions were modelled under two
   end-of-century (2085) climate change models (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and two
   dispersal scenarios (limited and expanded). We show that for the 40 NTFP
   plant species studied here, different responses are modelled with some
   species gaining in suitable habitats (47.5\%-65\% under RCP4.5), whereas
   others will lose in suitable habitats (35\%-52.5\% under RCP4.5).
   Nevertheless, we also show that our results vary between the different
   methods used, such as modelling algorithms, dispersal scenarios and
   general circulation models. Overall, our results suggest that the
   response of NTFP species to climate change depends on their
   distribution, ecology and dispersal ability.},

Abstract = {There is a paucity of studies focusing on how total mercury (THg) and
   total selenium (TSe) concentrations vary in walleye tissues and prey
   organisms from a reservoir that is downstream from a major mining
   district and whose basin consists of Cretaceous sedimentary Se-bearing
   outcroppings. Pueblo Reservoir in Colorado is fed by water from the
   upper Arkansas River, which has been polluted by trace metals and
   metalloids since mining began in 1859. Pueblo Reservoir is the only
   mainstem impoundment on the Upper Arkansas River and is located about
   251 km downstream from the historic Leadville Mining District. Nearly
   all the contaminated colloids and sediment eventually reach Pueblo
   Reservoir and its walleye fishery. We compared THg and TSe
   concentrations among 15 walleye tissues clustered within ``functional
   tissue groups,{''} and with walleye stomach contents and the walleye's
   primary forage fish (gizzard shad). We found that THg concentration in
   epaxial muscle and cardiac muscle ranked first and second, respectively,
   and results indicated a significant difference in THg between the 2
   muscle types. Unlike THg, TSe levels were highest for liver, spleen,
   kidney, ovary/egg, and gill tissues, and TSe levels in all but 2 tissue
   pairings were significantly different. Significant differences occurred
   when THg and TSe in gizzard shad and stomach contents were compared to
   levels in each tissue. Our THg concentrations at the Pueblo Reservoir
   were generally lower than at other sites in western North America;
   however, TSe concentrations were higher and markedly different. The data
   indicate that THg tissue levels appear to be lower than established fish
   health benchmarks, yet many TSe tissue concentrations were above
   critical thresholds.},

Title = {Predictors of taxonomic splitting and its role in primate conservation},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {355-364},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Species are the main unit used to measure biodiversity, but different
   preferred operational criteria can lead to very different delineations.
   For instance, named primate species have more than doubled in number
   since 1982. Such increases have been partly attributed to a shift away
   from the ``biological species concept{''} (BSC) in favor of less
   inclusive species criteria. Critics of recent changes in primate
   taxonomy have suggested taxonomic splitting may be biased toward certain
   clades and have unfavorable consequences for conservation. Here, we
   explore predictors of taxonomic splitting across primate taxa since the
   initial shift away from the BSC nearly 40 years ago. We do not find
   evidence that net diversification rate, the rate of lineage formation
   over evolutionary time, is significantly linked to splitting, contrary
   to expectations if new species concepts and taxonomic methods identify
   incipient species. We also do not find evidence that research effort in
   fields where work has been suggested to motivate splitting is associated
   with increases in species numbers among genera. To test the suggestion
   that splitting groups is likely to increase their perceived risk of
   extinction, we test whether genera that have undergone more splitting
   have also observed a greater increase in their proportion of threatened
   species since the initial shift away from older taxonomic methods. We
   find no cohesive signal of taxonomic splitting leading to higher threat
   probabilities across primate genera. Thus, our analysis suggests that
   the threat statuses of primate species are not being overwhelmingly
   driven by splitting. Regardless, we echo warnings that it is unwise for
   conservation to be reliant on taxonomic stability. Species (however
   defined) are not independent from one another, thus, monitoring and
   managing them as such may not meet the overarching goal of conserving
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Integrated spatial models foster complementarity between monitoring
   programmes in producing large-scale bottlenose dolphin indicators},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Over the last decades, large-scale ecological projects have emerged that
   require collecting ecological data over broad spatial and temporal
   coverage. Yet, obtaining relevant information about large-scale
   population dynamics from a single monitoring programme is challenging,
   and often several sources of data, possibly heterogeneous, need to be
   integrated. In this context, integrated models combine multiple data
   types into a single analysis to quantify the population dynamics of a
   targeted population. When working at large geographical scales,
   integrated spatial models have the potential to produce spatialized
   ecological estimates that would be difficult to obtain if data were
   analysed separately. In this study, we illustrate how spatial integrated
   modelling offers a relevant framework for conducting ecological
   inference at large scales. Focusing on the Mediterranean bottlenose
   dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), we combined 21,464 km of
   photo-identification boat surveys collecting spatial capture-recapture
   data with 24,624 km of aerial line transect following a distance
   sampling protocol. We analysed spatial capture-recapture data together
   with distance sampling data to estimate the abundance and density of
   bottlenose dolphins. We compared the performances of the distance
   sampling model and the spatial capture-recapture model fitted
   independently to our integrated spatial model. The outputs of our
   spatial integrated models inform bottlenose dolphin ecological status in
   the French Mediterranean Sea and provide ecological indicators that are
   required for regional-scale ecological assessments like the EU Marine
   Strategy Framework Directive. We argue that integrated spatial models
   are widely applicable and relevant to conservation research and
   biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales.},

Title = {Field-based selenium partitioning coefficients and trophic transfer
   factors for cutthroat trout fisheries from four montane lakes, Colorado,
   USA},

Abstract = {Most studies of selenium (Se) bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in
   freshwater habitats have focused primarily on lotic and lentic sites in
   regions of elevated selenium. In contrast to previous reports, we
   proposed investigating Se partitioning from water to subsequent trophic
   levels in oligotrophic montane lakes using concentrations in water,
   sediment, periphyton, and filamentous algae, and also in the stomach
   contents and tissues of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) analyzed
   by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The indicator
   values for the level-one (water to particulate) partitioning
   coefficients (K-d values) or enrichment factors (EFs) were as high as
   1,641,000 L/kg dry weight and as low as 14,843. Values of Upper Sand
   Creek Lake partitioning coefficients in Great Sand Dunes National Park
   and Preserve were 36,529 using sediment, 28,000 using filamentous algae,
   and 1,641,000 using periphyton. For Lower Sand Creek Lake the
   partitioning coefficients were 14,843 for sediment, 17,250 for
   filamentous algae, and 32,415 for periphyton. The level-two metric
   (particulates to invertebrate trout stomach contents) was 1.18 for the
   mean trophic transfer factor for invertebrates of Upper Sand Creek Lake,
   1.31 for Lower Sand Creek Lake, and 1.77 for Lake Louise. The
   level-three indicator (invertebrates to trout tissues) values for Lake
   Louise, Lower and Upper Sand Creek Lakes, and Trappers Lake varied by
   tissue type. For the 4 Colorado sites, the range of trophic transfer
   factors was 2.31-5.25 for trout liver, 1.30-2.64 for ovary/egg, and
   0.28-1.08 for epaxial muscle. We proposed nonlinear food web exposure
   scenarios for 3 subalpine lakes. We compared Colorado trophic transfer
   factors for trout to those for cutthroat trout from Se-richer lentic
   sites in British Columbia, Canada. We concluded that historical (50
   years or less) surficial sediment concentrations could be used to
   generate appropriate partitioning coefficients in oligotrophic montane
   lakes. Selenium concentrations in stomach contents appeared
   representative of a range of trout dietborne invertebrates.},

Title = {Controversies and hidden risks in biodiversity offsets in critically
   threatened Canga (ironstone) ecosystems in Brazil},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Canga, or ironstone, ecosystems are hotspots of old-growth plant
   diversity and highly specialized cave invertebrates. These ancient
   metalliferous habitats are amongst the most threatened ecosystems
   because of the destruction caused by large-scale iron ore mining.
   International debate on biodiversity offsets is increasing because these
   mechanisms are seen as tools for potentially balancing economic
   development with conservation biodiversity. Leading mining companies
   worldwide, including some of the largest iron ore producers in Brazil,
   are signatories to offset principles and best practices that aim to
   achieve no net loss of habitats, species or ecosystem functions. We
   aimed to analyse whether Brazilian legal requirements for biodiversity
   offsets result in the achievement of conservation outcomes or in
   elevated threat of extinction in canga ecosystems. We evaluated
   technical reports that support decision-making related to environmental
   licensing for iron ore mining and specific offset proposals linked to
   the Atlantic Forest Act. We found a relevant net loss in canga
   ecosystems and observed shortcomings related to the equivalency and
   transparency of offset principles. These deficiencies are mainly related
   to lax norms and regulations and the absence of an integrated database
   for accessing information on environmental licensing processes. We argue
   that both policy flaws and low engagement by the Brazilian mining
   industry in implementing offset principles have increased the threat of
   extinction in canga ecosystems.},

Title = {Donor perspectives on strengthening capacity development for
   conservation},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {740-743},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Global perspectives on the pathways for developing capacity for
   conservation remain limited. Hindering the robustness of solutions is a
   dearth of opportunities to foster discussion and dialogue among capacity
   development practitioners, academics, partners, beneficiaries and
   donors. Additionally, little is known about donor perspectives on
   capacity development, and about pathways to developing a more
   sustainable investment in capacity development for conservation. The
   2019 Capacity Building for Conservation Conference in London, UK,
   provided a unique opportunity to convene more than 150 capacity
   development practitioners from the global conservation community. The
   Conference included structured opportunities to hear donor perspectives
   on strengthening capacity development. Session leaders took detailed
   notes to document donor perspectives and the discussions around them. A
   thematic analysis of this empirical evidence resulted in the
   identification of four key themes with corresponding recommendations,
   consisting of (1) collaborative design of capacity development
   initiatives, (2) monitoring and evaluation, (3) longer-term and flexible
   investments, and (4) building strong relationships between donors and
   grantees. Given the Convention on Biological Diversity is currently
   drafting the long-term strategic framework for capacity development
   post-2020, and global calls to protect significant portions of our land-
   and seascapes, our recommendations are timely and may inform a way
   forward.},

Abstract = {Sarawak is the largest state in the megadiverse country of Malaysia. Its
   rich biodiversity is threatened by land-use change and hunting, with
   mammalian carnivores particularly affected. Data on the ecology,
   occurrence and distribution of small carnivores are crucial to inform
   their effective conservation, but no large-scale assessments have
   previously been conducted in Sarawak. Here we examine the status of the
   five species of felids in Sarawak based on data from camera-trap studies
   over 17 years (May 2003-February 2021) across 31 study areas, including
   protected areas of various sizes, production forests and forest matrix
   within oil palm plantations. Felids were detected at 39\% of 845 camera
   stations. The marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata and Sunda clouded leopard
   Neofelis diardi had higher probabilities of occurrence in protected than
   unprotected areas, and vice versa for the leopard cat Prionailurus
   bengalensis and bay cat Catopuma badia. The marbled and bay cats were
   mostly diurnal, and the leopard cat was predominantly nocturnal;
   activity patterns did not substantively differ between protected and
   unprotected sites. The probabilities of occurrence of marbled and bay
   cats increased with greater distance from roads. The leopard cat and
   flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps were more likely, and the clouded
   leopard less likely, to occur near rivers. Flat-headed cats preferred
   peat swamp forest, bay cats lowland forest, and marbled cats and clouded
   leopards occurred in both lowland and montane forest. Felids may
   tolerate higher elevations to avoid anthropogenic disturbance;
   therefore, it is critical to preserve lowland and mid-elevation habitats
   that provide refugia from climate change and the destruction of lowland
   habitat.},

Abstract = {Urbanization of natural landscapes and increasing human populations have
   brought people and our companion animals into closer contact with
   wildlife, even within protected areas. To provide guidance for
   human-wildlife coexistence, it is therefore critical to understand the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbances and how well native wildlife
   species survive in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the
   spatio-temporal responses of 10 vertebrate taxa, with an emphasis on the
   Endangered Eld's deer Rucervus eldii thamin, to anthropogenic
   disturbances in Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar. We quantified
   anthropogenic disturbances as distance from human settlements, distance
   from a highway, and the presence of people and free-ranging dogs Canis
   familiaris. Anthropogenic disturbances had stronger negative impacts on
   the detection of native wildlife species than on occupancy. Eld's deer
   avoided areas close to human settlements and showed low diel activity
   overlap with both people and dogs, although we found a positive
   association with human presence at the camera-trap sites. Five species
   exhibited lower diel activity overlap with people in the rainy season
   when human activity is the highest in our study area. All studied
   wildlife species shifted to nocturnal activity or did not show any clear
   activity pattern during the cool-dry season when the presence of dogs
   increased. The ecological and conservation impacts of dogs are
   underestimated in South-east Asia, particularly in Myanmar, and this
   case study highlights the impacts of dogs on the temporal use of habitat
   by wildlife and the need for better practices in the management of dogs
   within protected areas.},

Abstract = {North Africa's megafauna has developed behavioural adaptations to reduce
   energetic and fitness costs under harsh arid land conditions. Animal
   behaviour and activity patterns are difficult to study in the wild, but
   remote camera traps provide a solution to collecting data without the
   presence of a researcher influencing outcomes. Here, we report results
   from a study comprising over 20,382 camera-trap days during a 34-month
   period in Dghoumes National Park, Tunisia. We aimed to evaluate temporal
   activity patterns and their overlap and explore opportunities for niche
   partitioning. Our focal species were the reintroduced scimitar-horned
   oryx, north-African ostrich, dorcas gazelles and extant regional
   top-order predators, African wolf and red fox. We found differences in
   activity patterns between seasons across the focal species, with the
   most noticeable change being an increase in dawn activity from 1\% to
   33\% between winter and summer for the red fox. Consequently, higher
   summer temperatures limit opportunities for temporal niche partitioning
   and push focal species towards dawn-time activity peaks resulting in
   higher intra-guild overlap values at dawn. Arid antelopes have
   physiological adaptations that enable them to better exploit ecological
   resources in hotter time periods than the carnivores, and this reduces
   inter-guild overlap during summer days.},

Abstract = {It is important to assess whether anthropogenic activity affects
   wildlife distribution and resource use to appraise the efficacy of
   multi-use protected areas. Habitat degradation and vegetation damage as
   indicators of competitive and facilitative livestock-wildlife
   interactions were the focus of this study. Foot transects were conducted
   in the dry season of 2011, wet season of 2012, and dry season of 2012 in
   five wildlife sanctuaries in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya, to determine
   whether habitat degradation and vegetation damage affected wildlife
   distribution and wildlife-livestock interactions. Simpson's and
   Jaccard's biodiversity indices and Pianka's niche overlap index were
   used to assess wildlife-livestock interactions across a gradient of
   habitat degradation. In the dry season, Jaccard's, Pianka's, and
   Simpson's indices (0.50, 0.84, and 0.99, respectively) peaked at the
   highest level of degradation. In the wet season, Jaccard's index (0.42)
   peaked at a fairly high level of habitat degradation, Pianka's index
   (0.82) at a fairly low level, and Simpson's (0.80) at the lowest level.
   Two-way ANOVA revealed that there was no effect of degradation or
   vegetation damage on wildlife distribution irrespective of the feeding
   guild. Therefore, it appears that continued shared use of the Amboseli
   landscape by wildlife and livestock is feasible.},

Title = {An assessment of avian species sold in the South African pet trade},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {980-995},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Non-native species have been translocated from their native to new
   geographic ranges through the pet trade. Consequently, some become
   threatened with extinction, while some establish and become invasive. We
   surveyed 117 physical pet stores across South Africa between September
   2018 and September 2019 to determine avian species composition,
   availability, price and IUCN status. We reviewed the literature to
   determine which avian species have established populations outside
   captivity, including their impacts and clutch sizes. We recorded 169
   avian species from 26 families, of which 147 were non-natives.
   Psittacidae (23\%) and Estrildidae (20\%) were the most available
   families. The budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus, zebra finch
   Taeniopygia guttata, and Fischer's lovebird Agapornis fischeri were the
   most available species recorded in all the provinces. Most species were
   listed as least concern (78\%) and sold at lower prices, while
   threatened species were rarely available and sold at higher prices. Only
   14 avian species have established populations outside captivity, with
   most associated with agricultural impact. In addition, six of these 14
   species were among the top 20 most traded and have been observed outside
   captivity in South Africa. Assessing the trade of avian species is
   essential for conservation and invasive species management. The results
   from this study may help improve early surveillance for detecting the
   establishment of potential invasive avian species.},

Abstract = {Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi) and Paiute
   cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii seleniris) are rare taxa of
   conservation concern. Their generally low population densities and
   remote distribution make traditional sampling difficult, but they
   primarily exist in small streams, a habitat type where environmental DNA
   (eDNA) sampling has proven extremely effective. We developed a single
   eDNA assay that allows sensitive detection of both taxa, which occur
   separate from each other in different regions of the Lahontan Basin.
   Performance of the assay was evaluated using most lineages of Lahontan
   cutthroat trout and Paiute cutthroat trout as well as tissues of other
   cutthroat trout and rainbow trout that have been introduced within the
   Lahontan Basin. The assay amplified DNA only from the target taxa, and
   only from eDNA samples collected where those taxa were known to be
   present. This assay should enhance the ability of managers to more
   precisely and efficiently describe the distribution of these taxa.},

Title = {Trace elements in walleye tissues and dietary components from an

Abstract = {Trace elements in 15 walleye (Sander vitreus) tissues taken from the
   Pueblo Reservoir in Colorado corresponded to many metals of worldwide
   concern and were the same as those released into the Arkansas River from
   decades of mining at Leadville, Colorado. Therefore, analyses of walleye
   stomach contents, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum; a dietary prey item
   for walleye), and tissues of walleye were compared for an increase in,
   or a deficiency of, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb. Tissues were compared as
   couplets but also evaluated with tissues clustered into 6 functional
   groups. The trace elements were found to be tissue distinctive and
   functional-group specific. An interesting finding was that muscle,
   liver, gill, or whole bodies of fish-often indicators of trace
   elements-may not be as illustrative as adipose, skin, heart, bone, or
   stomach contents of the walleye. Results showed no significant
   differences in amounts of Pb among tissues within any of the 6
   functional groups. We suggest that only 6 of 15 tissues might be
   necessary to indicate the uptake or lack of elements: heart, adipose,
   skin, bone, liver, and muscle, the latter of value for human
   consumption. Elements in gizzard shad, walleye stomach contents, livers,
   and muscle reflected historical element-rich colloidal sediments in the
   Arkansas River above the Pueblo Reservoir inlet. Despite the presence of
   trace elements in walleye tissues, this study suggests that a robust
   fishery of walleye in the Pueblo Reservoir exists and is likely to
   increase in the future.},

Title = {Community-based monitoring of wild felid hunting in Central Amazonia},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-198},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Hunting is a critical issue in wild felid conservation, contributing to
   the decline of these species worldwide. Here, we present 18 years of a
   community-based monitoring program, quantifying and characterizing wild
   felid hunting in two sustainable development reserves in Central
   Amazonia. We investigated how felid hunting was affected by the flood
   pulse and whether local human population size, habitat type, and total
   hunting events influenced felid hunting. We recorded 71 adult felids
   being killed, most of them in opportunistic events (88.7\%), usually
   during hunting expeditions aimed at other game species. Four felid
   species were recorded in the hunts (Panthera onca, Leopardus pardalis,
   Puma concolor, and Leopardus wiedii) with jaguars accounting for almost
   half of all hunting events (N = 35). We found that more felid hunting
   events occurred during the flooded season, in more populated
   communities, and in varzea habitats. Most felids were hunted
   opportunistically, demonstrating the complexity of human-felid
   interactions. Stories of attacks on humans are widespread in the study
   area, which may strengthen an instinctive fear of felids, driving their
   persecution. The increase of hunting events during the flooded season
   seems to be related to a higher probability of encounters between humans
   and wild felids. High waters make fishing difficult, therefore, locals
   hunt more, entering deep into the forest through flooded habitats. Since
   jaguars have an arboreal lifestyle during the flooded season in varzea
   forests, they are easily spotted by locals and have less of a chance to
   escape since they are slower and more exposed when swimming, which
   increases the probability of being killed. It is generally acknowledged
   that involving local stakeholders in conservation projects is essential
   for their success. In our case, collaboration among researchers and
   community members was fundamental to access hunting information. We show
   that community-based monitoring empowers the local communities and
   facilitates data collection on sensitive topics.},

Title = {The effects of maternal penning on the movement ecology of mountain
   caribou},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Translocation and captivity are important tools for conservation biology
   and wildlife management. Understanding the movement ecology of animals
   following their release in novel terrain is critical to predicting the
   success of wildlife restoration efforts. Mountain caribou have high
   conservation value - efforts to restore their populations across western
   Canada involve hundreds of millions of dollars in science, monitoring,
   and management activity. Here, we examined the movements of adult female
   caribou (N = 36) following their translocation to, and release from, a
   maternity pen ('penned caribou') and compared these movements to animals
   that were not translocated ('unpenned caribou', N = 22). A maternity pen
   is a temporary holding facility, within the animals' existing range,
   that enables them to bear and raise their young in the absence of
   predators and with augmented resources. Penned and unpenned animals had
   similar home range sizes (1052.2 and 1314.6 km(2), respectively, P =
   0.46) though penned animals moved through the landscape in a faster yet
   less directed manner. We found some evidence that memory may improve the
   efficiency of space use. Home ranges with higher quality habitats tended
   to be smaller than home ranges with poorer quality habitats irrespective
   of penning status. Penned animals ranged at lower elevation (similar to
   150 m) than unpenned animals, particularly in spring and early winter.
   For penned animals, we did not detect evidence of homing back to the
   original capture site. The best predictor of how caribou will use the
   landscape appears to be proximity to the location of the release site.
   To maximize the fitness of released caribou, future plans for maternity
   pens and captive breeding programs need to consider the management of
   food, predators, and habitat across the 1000-2000 km(2) that will form
   the home range near the release site.},

Abstract = {Elephants face diverse threats from human activities and use temporal
   and social strategies to reduce human-induced mortality risk. We used
   data from camera trap surveys in 2018-2019 (n = 1625 independent
   detection events from 11,751 sampling days) to investigate elephant
   responses to anthropogenic risk in the Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem, Tanzania.
   The study was conducted in one low-risk and three high-risk sites using
   26-40 paired camera trap stations per site. Risk influenced the active
   periods, use of roads and water sources, social associations and
   behaviour of elephants. Elephants demonstrated significantly more
   night-time and reduced daytime activity in the high-risk sites relative
   to the low-risk site. This higher night-time activity in the high-risk
   sites was observed for both males and females, though it was more
   pronounced for cow-calf groups than lone males. Foraging events and use
   of water sources were more frequent at night in the high-risk sites.
   Elephants used roads as movement routes in the low-risk site but avoided
   roads in the high-risk sites. Males were significantly more likely to
   associate with other males and cow-calf groups in the high-risk sites.
   Fewer occurrences of relaxed behaviours were observed in the high-risk
   sites compared to the low-risk site. We discuss the potential
   implications of our findings for elephant survival and reproduction.},

Abstract = {Vegetation in salt playas-iconic landforms in the Great Basin of the
   western United States-exhibits a striking topographical zonation that
   has remained unexplained. In particular, a distinctive pattern is
   exhibited by salt-succulent species in the Amaranthaceae wherein
   Allenrolfea occidentalis occurs in monospecific stands at the highest
   topographic position in the playa, Sarcocornia utahensis occurs in
   monospecific stands in the middle position, and Salicornia rubra occurs
   in monospecific stands at the lowest topographic position. Because salt
   playas feature a shallow, temporary winter lake that recedes as it
   evaporates throughout the summer and because vegetation zones closely
   follow the contours of the temporary lake, we hypothesized that factors
   relating to the hydrology of the system could be used to predict
   vegetation zonation. Indeed, we found multiple environmental gradients
   associated with hydrology that could contribute to the topographical
   zonation of the 3 plant species, including gradients in soil salinity,
   pH, redox potential, and water content, but not soil texture. A
   multinomial logistic regression model incorporating soil pH, redox
   potential, and water content was able to predict the correct vegetation
   zone with 100\% accuracy. Surprisingly, the gradient in soil NaCl
   concentration did not contribute significantly to the regression model.
   These results suggest that soil pH, redox potential, and water content
   are factors that could be further explored as niche axes that
   distinguish members of salt playa vegetation.},

Abstract = {Mite prevalence and load can vary among populations and species of
   lizards. We report on chigger mite (Eutrombicula alfreddugesi)
   prevalence and load in a temperate population of Xenosaurus fractus and
   a subtropical population of Xenosaurus rectocollaris. Mites were more
   prevalent and found in greater numbers (i.e., higher load) on X.
   rectocollaris than on X. fractus. Mite load in both species did not
   differ between July/August and October/November. Differences in mite
   load and prevalence among populations and species of Xenosaurus from
   different types of environment suggest that more study is needed to
   understand how environmental factors affect mite infestation in
   crevice-dwelling Xenosaurus.},

Abstract = {Most of the rivers in the Afrotropics emerge from forested uplands that
   are prime for human activities, including crop farming, grazing and
   settlement. However, streams draining these areas have a low diversity
   of fishes, which limits their use as indicators of water quality and
   ecological status. Here, we developed macroinvertebrate- and fish-based
   indices of biotic integrity and evaluated their responses to human
   activities in the Sondu-Miriu River, Kenya. Overall, water quality
   declined downstream because of the cumulative effects of human
   activities. The upper reaches had poor fish diversity with at most three
   species, but macroinvertebrate communities were diverse on the entire
   gradient of the river. Metrics that have been used to develop indices of
   biotic integrity in the Lake Victoria basin were selected and evaluated
   for responsiveness to various forms of human disturbance along the
   river. The poor diversity of fishes in the upper reaches limited the
   number of metrics that could be developed and evaluated. The fish index
   was only successfully applied in the middle and lower reaches where fish
   diversity was high. However, macroinvertebrates were diverse and
   sensitive to human activities on the entire gradient of the river. This
   study shows that for biomonitoring, macroinvertebrate communities offer
   a better alternative to fishes in high elevation Afromontane streams
   that harbour poor fish assemblages.},

Abstract = {Evaluating translocation success is essential for wildlife management
   and conservation; short-term success can be evaluated by analysing
   settlement behaviour after release. We analysed GPS collar data from 47
   white (Ceratotherimum simum simum, Burchell, 1817) and 25 black (Diceros
   bicornis minor, Drummond, 1876) rhinoceros translocated to the Okavango
   Delta in Botswana between 2014 and 2018. We tested for effects of age
   and sex on site fidelity and compared movement ranges after
   translocations between different release sites and between newly
   released and established individuals. White rhinoceros adults displayed
   higher site fidelity than subadults and males higher than females.
   Adults may therefore be better translocation candidates. Site fidelity
   of black rhinoceros did not differ between sexes or ages. Established
   rhinoceros movement ranges were smaller than those of newly released
   ones, pointing towards extended post-translocation exploratory movements
   and later settlement in smaller home ranges. Movement ranges of white
   rhinoceros released on an island were significantly smaller than others,
   which shows together with annual home range sizes compared with the
   literature that reserve size and rhinoceros density affect home range
   size. All rhinoceros in this study survived for more than 1-year
   post-translocation, so these translocations can be deemed successful in
   the short term.},

Abstract = {In the largely deforested areas of Madagascar, small forest fragments
   remain as last refuges for amphibian diversity. Isolated populations of
   the Critically Endangered Anodonthyla vallani and Anilany helenae
   persist in the fragmented forest of Ambohitantely but little information
   is available to inform their management and any conservation
   interventions. We generated estimates of population size and occupancy
   for both species in the largest fragment of Ambohitantely Special
   Reserve using acoustic survey data collected from 84 sites along 12
   transects in December 2018. We used a single-season occupancy model to
   estimate detection and occupancy and a Royal-Nichols model to estimate
   abundance and population size. Anilany helenae and A. vallani had high
   occupancy rates (80 and 93\%, respectively) whereas their detection
   rates differed (34 and 55\%, respectively). Abundance and occupancy were
   best explained by vegetation structure whereas detection was influenced
   by time of survey and rainfall. For our sampled sites the estimated
   population sizes of males were 855 for A. vallani, with an estimated
   density of 52 individuals/ha, and 388 for A. helenae, with an estimated
   population density of 23 individuals/ha. Given their relatively low
   densities, small population sizes and restricted ranges, any further
   habitat loss could have drastic consequences for these populations. Our
   results provide guidance for future species-focused studies, and can
   inform conservation management at the local scale. Our work will help to
   improve species monitoring in Madagascar and elsewhere, especially for
   range-restricted non-charismatic amphibians.},

Title = {Using population surveys and models to reassess the conservation status

Abstract = {Assessing the conservation status of species is essential for
   implementing appropriate conservation measures. A lack of evidence of
   threats, rather than showing an absence of impacts, could reflect a lack
   of studies on how human activities could result in species population
   declines. The range of Prince Bernhard's titi monkey Plecturocebus
   bernhardi is restricted to the Arc of Deforestation, a deforestation
   hotspot in south-eastern Amazonia. Despite this, it is categorized as
   Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. To reassess the conservation status
   of P. bernhardi, we carried out surveys during 2015-2017 to delimit the
   geographical distribution of the species and estimate its population
   density and abundance. We then used spatial predictive modelling to
   examine future habitat and population loss within its range.
   Plecturocebus bernhardi occurs over an area of 131,295 km(2). Its mean
   group size was 2.8 individuals/group and its density 10.8
   individuals/km(2) and 3.8 groups/km(2). Habitat loss was estimated to be
   58,365 km(2) (32.3\% of its current range) over the next 24 years (three
   P. bernhardi generations) under a conservative governance model of
   deforestation and 105,289 km(2) (58.3\%) under a business-as-usual
   model. These numbers indicate that P. bernhardi is threatened and should
   be categorized as Vulnerable, at least, using the IUCN Red List
   criteria. We recommend the reassessment of other Least Concern primate
   species from the Arc of Deforestation using a similar approach.},

Title = {Socio-ecological contagion in Veganville},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement for 1.5 C global warming, per
   capita emissions need to come down to 2.9 tonnes by 2030. Food systems
   are known to be a significant source of an individual's carbon footprint
   and demand attention in sustainability management. The objective of this
   research is to conceptualise and define an intersection between
   contagion theory and socio-ecological systems models. This is achieved
   using a population dynamics model between two groups characterised by a
   distinct food regime: omnivores and vegans. The greenhouse gas emissions
   of each food regime is used to estimate the city's changing carbon
   foodprint as the food regimes shift by social contagion. Social
   contagion is identified as a catalyst for social tipping points, and
   emission pathways are explored with a variety of different contagion
   variables to test sensitivity towards a tipping point. The main finding
   is that the urban carbon foodprint can be reduced significantly with
   widespread adoption of veganism, but that the foodprint reaches a
   minimum at 1.97 tonnes CO2-equivalent per capita. This demonstrates the
   need to embed food demand in urban climate governance such as nudging
   towards plant-based food alternatives. Nudging is discussed as a lever
   of ecological importance to social contagion. Lastly, socio-ecological
   contagion is defined as the interactions between social contagion and
   damage done to ecological systems to measure peer-to-peer spread of
   environmental stewardship agendas, such as the journey to Veganville.},

Abstract = {Fifty years of deforestation in the Arc of Deforestation have put at
   risk species survival, ecosystem services and the stability of
   biogeochemical cycles in Amazonia, with global repercussions. In
   response, we need to understand the diversity, distribution and
   abundance of flagship species groups, such as primates, which can serve
   as umbrella species for broad biodiversity conservation strategies and
   help mitigate climate change. Here we identify the range, suitable
   habitat areas and population size of Vieira's titi monkey Plecturocebus
   vieirai and use it as an emblematic example to discuss biodiversity
   conservation and climate change mitigation in one of the largest
   deforestation frontiers. Our findings show that deforestation for
   agriculture and cattle-ranching expansion is the major threat to P.
   vieirai and is responsible for present (56\%) and projected (14\%)
   reductions in habitat area and population size. We also found that
   human-driven climate change affects the P. vieirai niche negatively,
   triggering habitat degradation and further population decline even
   inside protected areas. Primate watching can be a profitable alternative
   to forest exploitation on private, public or Indigenous lands in the Arc
   of Deforestation and is a way to shift the traditional, predatory
   extraction of natural resources from Amazonia towards sustainable land
   use based on biodiversity conservation at local, regional and global
   scales, local people's welfare and climate change mitigation. New models
   of land use and income generation are required to protect the unique
   natural and human heritages of the Arc of Deforestation and the
   life-supporting ecosystem services and products provided by Amazonia.},

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 28},
Abstract = {Effective transboundary corridors play a crucial role in jaguar Panthera
   onca conservation. Local residents reported jaguar sightings along the
   Baritu-Tariquia Biological Corridor, which prompted us to carry out this
   camera-trap survey. We surveyed an area of 1,243 km(2) across the
   corridor to confirm jaguar presence. We used 50 single camera stations,
   with cameras placed c. 5 km apart. We placed the cameras along trails,
   streams and mountain ridges. We recorded jaguars at seven sites across
   the Corridor; at least three different individuals were identified.
   These records confirm the presence of the jaguar in the Baritu-Tariquia
   Biological Corridor between Argentina and Bolivia, a trans-frontier area
   of the Austral Yungas facing multiple threats but hosting one of the
   southernmost jaguar populations. Conservation efforts in border regions
   can promote collaboration and synergies between agencies and other
   conservation stakeholders, with important implications for wide-ranging
   predators such as jaguars and their habitats.},

Abstract = {Capacity development is essential for the effective management of
   protected areas and for achieving successful biodiversity conservation.
   European Natura 2000 sites form an extensive network of protected areas
   and developing the capacity of staff at all levels is a priority that
   will positively influence the appropriate implementation of conservation
   actions. In this study we identify the main challenges and potential
   solutions to developing the skills, knowledge and tools required for
   effective Natura 2000 site management. Our findings are based on a case
   study of the European project LIFE e-Natura2000.edu, which focuses on
   capacity development in practical biodiversity conservation and
   management through integrated and blended learning experiences (i.e. a
   combination of face-to-face and virtual teaching). We illustrate the
   main elements for successfully building capacity within a variety of
   knowledge and experience backgrounds and operating levels related to the
   management of Natura 2000 sites. Multifaceted, blended learning
   approaches are key to tackling the various needs of Natura 2000 managers
   in terms of skills, knowledge and tools.},

Abstract = {Great apes are threatened by many factors including habitat loss, forest
   degradation and disease. Despite the improved understanding of the
   distribution of gorillas in Cameroon, there is a lack of fine-scale
   knowledge about their habitat use. We used the Kernel Density Estimate
   method combined with grid cell counting to assess gorilla distribution,
   habitat use and human disturbance on one of the least studied gorilla
   populations in Cameroon. Proportions of different habitat types in the
   landscape were quantified using classification and regression tree
   approach applied to Landsat-8 and digital elevation model data. We found
   that the distribution of gorillas was restricted to the central band of
   the site (similar to 22 km(2)). Although the area was dominated by
   mature forest, the goodness-of-fit test showed that gorillas used
   grassland areas more frequently. Intensive human activities were noted
   across the gorilla range, with used cartridge shells being the most
   evidence hunting sign. Our results can be used to guide conservation and
   sustainable development stakeholder decisions in the area. With
   increasing anthropogenic threats throughout the landscape, we recommend
   the implementation of noninvasive research activities focusing on threat
   monitoring, nesting and dietary ecology, and the promotion of
   community-led conservation initiatives to reduce pressure on the gorilla
   habitat.},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {340-354},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease caused mostly by the pathogen
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has caused massive amphibian population
   declines and extinctions worldwide. The ecology of this disease is
   mainly explained by the interaction of environmental factors, pathogen
   biology, and host traits including development. For paedomorphic
   salamanders, differences in B. dendrobatidis infection may be explained
   by metamorphosis and water physicochemical conditions. In this study, we
   aimed to determine the influence of environmental and host factors on B.
   dendrobatidis prevalence and infection intensity in the facultative
   paedomorphic salamander Ambystoma altamirani. We determined B.
   dendrobatidis prevalence and infection load in four populations of A.
   altamirani along 1 year (four seasons) and assessed their relationship
   with environmental factors and host metamorphic status (gilled or
   non-gilled). We found that B. dendrobatidis prevalence and infection
   load are largely explained by metamorphic status and environmental
   factors such as elevation, seasonality, water temperature, pH,
   conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. To our knowledge, this is the first
   study to empirically show the effect of metamorphosis on B.
   dendrobatidis infection status across locations and seasons. This
   information may be used to understand the temporal dynamics of B.
   dendrobatidis-host interactions and to identify potential disease
   outbreaks that may cause cryptic sublethal effects on salamander
   populations. Our results will help in the development of conservation
   strategies for paedomorphic salamanders that are already considered
   threatened by anthropogenic factors such as habitat loss and climate
   change.},

Title = {Windfarm collisions in medium-sized raptors: even increasing populations
   can suffer strong demographic impacts},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The impact of bird mortality by collision on windfarms has often been
   evaluated at the individual level, but rarely at the population level.
   The Lesser kestrel Falco naumanni is an endangered short-lived migratory
   raptor, susceptible to collision with wind turbines. We evaluated the
   impacts of windfarm turbine collisions on the demography of the largest
   lesser kestrel population in France. Using data from local monitoring of
   reproduction and windfarm mortality surveys, combined with
   capture-recapture ringing data at a nearby population, we quantified
   vital parameters of fecundity and survival in order to parameterize a
   matrix population model to study the viability of this population. The
   breeding success was high and varied in synchrony with survival
   probabilities. Between 2013 and 2020, 43 carcasses were found below wind
   turbines, and when accounting for carcass detection and persistence
   rates, the true mortality should approach 154 individuals in that
   period, i.e. 3\% of the studied population was affected by collisions
   each year. The matrix model showed that the population growth observed
   was only possible if there was a constant recruitment of 26 immigrant
   individuals each year into the population. Without the excess mortality
   by the windfarm, we predict that this population would have 22\% more
   breeding pairs than what was observed in 2020. Simulations over 30 years
   showed that, under the current immigration rate, the population should
   decline if the excess mortality exceeds 11\%. If immigration ceases, the
   population would decline above 5\% excess mortality per year. It is
   urgent to monitor and reduce the excess mortality by windfarm collisions
   that threatens this lesser kestrel population. More generally, we
   advocate the use of population matrix demographic models in impact
   assessment studies to avoid placing new windfarms close to rare species
   that could not sustain additional mortality by collisions.},

Title = {The influence of YouTube videos on human tolerance of sharks},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively
   seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human
   tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to
   identify strategies that counteract these negative representations.
   Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform
   for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In
   this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in
   Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos
   impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal
   state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study
   employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which
   information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions
   that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
   video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each
   video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their
   framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70\%
   more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130\% increase in acceptance of
   sharks and a 46\% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors),
   and negative framing influenced negative changes (25\% more negative
   attitudes toward sharks, a 18\% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a
   3\% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings
   suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance
   of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one
   form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for
   encouraging tolerance for sharks.},

Title = {Distinct effects of three Wolbachia strains on fitness and immune traits
   in Homona magnanima},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia occasionally increases host
   fitness or manipulates host reproductions to enhance vertical
   transmission. Multiple Wolbachia strains can coinfect the same host
   individual, which alters the density as well as phenotypes of the
   bacteria. However, the effects of Wolbachia coinfection on host fitness
   remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the effects of three
   phylogenetically distinct Wolbachia strains, wHm-a, wHm-b, and wHm-c, on
   host fitness by comparing non-infected, singly infected, and triply
   infected Homona magnanima lines within a fixed genetic background. By
   examining the effects of Wolbachia on host longevity, survivorship, and
   reproduction, we demonstrated that single infection with either wHm-b or
   wHm-c reduced host reproduction, but the triple infection led to the
   highest intrinsic growth rate. Susceptibility to the natural pathogens
   such as viruses and fungi was not different among the lines regardless
   of Wolbachia infection status. Cellular and humoral immunities were not
   affected by Wolbachia in females, whereas phenoloxidase activity was
   suppressed in males of all Wolbachia-infected lines, implying that it
   was a result of the mother's curse hypothesis or a strategy of Wolbachia
   to increase their horizontal transmission efficiency. Although how the
   host's genetic diversity affects the Wolbachia fitness effects is yet
   unknown, our findings indicated that the effects of Wolbachia are deeply
   influenced by infection status and that Wolbachia could change symbiotic
   strategy depending on host sex and transmission route.},

Title = {Validating trends in olive ridley sea turtle nesting track counts in
   Guatemala in light of a national hatchery protection strategy},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-54},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea is the most abundant
   marine turtle species in Guatemala, representing > 99\% of all nests.
   Along with other marine turtles, they are important both culturally and
   ecologically. Conservation efforts rely almost exclusively on an
   informal system whereby local residents can harvest olive ridley sea
   turtle nests on the condition they donate 20\% of each nest to a
   hatchery, where the eggs are incubated and hatchlings later released.
   This system was initiated in the 1970s and, until recently, no effort
   has been made to determine its sustainability. In a 2020 publication
   based on tracks on a single beach in Guatemala and 15 years of egg
   incubation data from Guatemalan hatcheries, it was concluded that the
   population had increased. Several weaknesses were detected in this
   research. To verify the validity of the conclusion, we analysed data
   from 22 years (2 years are missing) and 11 beaches using several
   statistical models. We used an intraseasonal model of nesting phenology
   to fill in missing data for monitored periods during a nesting season,
   and a new method of spatial and temporal aggregation of nesting seasons.
   Based on our findings, we reject the hypothesis that olive ridley sea
   turtle nesting activity is increasing. The total nesting activity for
   these 12 beaches was stable over the 22-year period. Because of
   inconsistent hatchery management and the financial dependency of local
   communities on the sale of turtle eggs, the number of incubated eggs
   cannot be used as an indicator of the population trend of olive ridley
   sea turtles in Guatemala.},

Journal = {ORYX},

Volume = {57},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Vulnerable marsh deer Blastocerus dichotomus, the largest native
   cervid in South America, is declining throughout its range as a result
   of the conversion of wetlands and overhunting. Estimated densities in
   open wetlands of several types are 0.1-6.8 individuals per km(2). We
   undertook the first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey of the marsh
   deer to estimate the density of this species in a 113.6 km(2) area under
   forestry management in the lower delta of the Parana River, Argentina.
   During 6-8 August 2019, at a time of year when canopy cover is minimal,
   we surveyed marsh deer using Phantom 4 Pro UAVs along 94 transects
   totalling 127.8 km and 8.6 km(2) (8.1\% of the study area). The 5,506
   photographs obtained were manually checked by us and by a group of 39
   trained volunteers, following a standardized protocol. We detected a
   total of 58 marsh deer, giving an estimated density of 6.90 individuals
   per km(2) (95\% CI 5.26-8.54), which extrapolates to 559-908 individuals
   in our 113.6 km(2) study area. As it has generally been assumed that
   marsh deer prefer open habitats, this relatively high estimate of
   density within a forestry plantation matrix is unexpected. We discuss
   the advantages of using UAVs to survey marsh deer and other related
   ungulates.},

Abstract = {In the last decade the tiger Panthera tigris population in the Terai Arc
   Landscape and Himalayas has increased, while populations in other
   countries have remained below their conservation targets. Although there
   has been some research on tiger conservation in the Terai Arc Landscape
   and the Himalayas, scientists and managers have not catalogued and
   characterized tiger research in the region, with empirical findings
   scattered among disparate document types, journals and countries.
   Without a review of the tiger research in the Terai Arc Landscape and
   Himalayan region, it is difficult to analyse or change conservation
   policies, develop adaptation strategies, prioritize research, allocate
   resources or develop conservation strategies potentially employable
   elsewhere. We therefore conducted a systematic scoping review to
   identify focal research areas, the spatial and temporal distribution of
   study sites, general publication trends, the extent of empirical
   studies, and gaps in tiger conservation research in this region (which
   spans Bhutan, India and Nepal). Since 2000, 216 studies have been
   published on issues associated with tiger conservation in the Terai Arc
   Landscape and Himalayas, with an increasing number over time. Most
   empirical studies have focused on tiger habitat, ecology and conflicts
   in protected areas in the region's foothills. There are research gaps in
   high-altitude landscapes, social science investigations, conservation
   economics, and policy and institutional analyses.},

Title = {Community-based fish sanctuaries: untapped potential for freshwater fish
   conservation},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 2},
Abstract = {Riverine systems and associated fish populations worldwide are
   threatened by human impacts, especially in tropical countries with
   emerging economies. In India, community-based fish sanctuaries are a key
   mechanism for the conservation of freshwater fish populations, but there
   are few peer-reviewed studies on this subject. Here we integrate over 35
   combined years of field experience with a literature synthesis to define
   and classify community-based fish sanctuaries. We present a novel,
   critical analysis of fish sanctuaries as social-ecological systems with
   a functional characterization based on natural capital, ecosystem
   services, human well-being, and policy and governance. We find that such
   sanctuaries are shaped by complex social-ecological processes, including
   coevolution of religious practices and ecological change, feedback
   processes created by retaliatory conflicts between river users, and
   diverse and dynamic governance strategies. These sanctuaries hold great
   potential for the conservation of rare fish species in India, but are
   subject to myriad threats at local, regional and global scales. Given
   the complexity of these social-ecological systems, we outline their
   conservation potential and highlight directions for future research.},

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 4},
Abstract = {Pangolins are some of the most overexploited but least studied mammals.
   The giant pangolin Smutsia gigantea is the largest of the eight pangolin
   species, measuring up to 180 cm in length and weighing up to 40 kg. It
   is a nocturnal, solitary species that occurs at low densities and little
   is known regarding its biology and ecology. It is distributed widely
   across the rainforests and forest savannah mosaics of equatorial Africa
   but its exact range extent is unknown. Apart from a single record in
   Kenya predating 1971, the eastern limit of its range was thought only to
   extend to central Uganda and western Tanzania. Here we present three
   spatially separate records confirming the presence of this species in
   Kenyan Afromontane forests. The three records are c. 120 km apart and c.
   500 km east of the nearest confirmed giant pangolin population in
   Uganda. These records represent a significant range extension for the
   species and highlight the biodiversity and conservation importance of
   the Afromontane forests of western Kenya.},

Title = {Analysis of a long-term dataset of Antillean manatee strandings in
   Belize: implications for conservation},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We analysed 23 years of data on strandings of the Antillean manatee
   Trichechus manatus manatus in Belize, documented by the Belize Marine
   Mammal Stranding Network, to examine the threats to this population. A
   total of 451 stranding incidents were reported, of which 376 (83.4\%)
   cases were verified. A total of 286 (63.4\%) of the incidents occurred
   within Belize District, where the number of strandings has almost
   tripled since 2009. Watercraft collisions accounted for the highest
   number of strandings, with 131 confirmed cases, and is the leading cause
   of anthropogenic mortality for this population. Collision with
   watercraft is an emerging and major threat to manatees in Belize, and is
   correlated with increases in human activity, in particular associated
   with tourism. This finding of high levels of manatee deaths in Belize is
   consistent with trends previously reported for manatees in Florida and
   Puerto Rico. This work can provide guidance to detect and address
   similar patterns of mortality in other Antillean manatee populations
   across the species' range. There is a need for greater awareness of the
   threats facing the species and its habitat, for stakeholder partnerships
   to address these threats, implementation of legislation for the
   protection of manatees, and consistent enforcement of regulations to
   protect this population. Boating regulations, such as no-wake zones
   within areas of high manatee presence, as well as regulation of tourism
   boating activities, need to be implemented to reduce the threats to the
   species.},

Abstract = {Microbes that protect against infection inhabit hosts across the tree of
   life. It is unclear whether and how the host immune system may affect
   the formation of new protective symbioses. We investigated the
   transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans following novel
   interactions with a protective microbe (Enterococcus faecalis) able to
   defend against infection by pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. We have
   previously shown that E. faecalis can directly limit pathogen growth
   within hosts. In this study, we show that colonisation by protective E.
   faecalis caused the differential expression of 1,557 genes in pathogen
   infected hosts, including the upregulation of immune genes such as
   lysozymes and C-type lectins. The most significantly upregulated host
   lysozyme gene, lys-7, impacted the competitive abilities of E. faecalis
   and S. aureus when knocked out. E. faecalis has an increased ability to
   resist lysozyme activity compared to S. aureus, suggesting that the
   protective microbe could gain a competitive advantage from this host
   response. Our finding that protective microbes can benefit from
   immune-mediated competition after introduction opens up new
   possibilities for biocontrol design and our understanding of symbiosis
   evolution. Crosstalk between the host immune response and
   microbe-mediated protection should favour the continued investment in
   host immunity and avoid the potentially risky evolution of host
   dependence.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at investigating the dietary composition of rodents in
   the Ukaguru Mountains, Tanzania. Micro-histological analysis of the
   stomach contents of rodents collected from various habitats was carried
   out. In the diet of Mastomys natalensis, Lemniscomys rosalia and Mus
   triton, seed/grain showed greater importance (>35\%, >55\% and 60\%
   respectively), whereas for Lophuromys kilonzoi, plant materials were
   more important (>55\%) than other categories. Seed/grains were more
   important (>20\%) in the diet of Praomys delectorum, while plant
   materials were more important (>45\%) in the diet of forest-dwelling L.
   kilonzoi. Food diversity for rodents in farmland was relatively low
   compared with forest-dwelling rodents. Our results indicated that the
   relatively low niche breadth observed in rodents caught in farms could
   be attributed to the major contribution of seed/grains to their diet
   while forest-dwelling rodents showed greater food diversity owing to the
   more heterogeneous and stable nature of forests compared with farms. The
   abundance of food resources in both habitats would have permitted
   coexistence of rodent species.},

Abstract = {Pastoralists and wildlife co-exist in the Somali Regional State
   competing for habitat, food and water resources. A questionnaire survey
   conducted among 198 pastoralists, captured information on their
   perception of wildlife against the backdrop of wildlife population
   decrease, illegal wildlife trade and lack of quantitative and
   qualitative data in the area. The top perceived threats to livestock
   were drought (46\%), wildlife attacks (33.8\%) and diseases (20.2\%).
   Daily encounters between wildlife and livestock were reported by 61.1\%
   of respondents. Herbivores, including warthogs, accounted for the
   majority of these encounters (88.4\%), whereas carnivores were rarely
   observed with livestock, except for jackals. The majority (92.9\%) of
   the respondents did not think that wildlife could transmit diseases to
   livestock. Jackals were reported by 7.1\% to transmit rabies. A strong
   dislike for wildlife was recorded in 99\% of all respondents. All stated
   that wildlife should not be protected. Half of the respondents did not
   see any benefits in wildlife. Wildlife populations have decreased over
   the last 10 years, particularly lions and cheetahs. Pastoralist's
   attitudes and perceptions towards wildlife in the study area were
   negative, potentially affecting conservation efforts. There is an urgent
   need to improve awareness of the benefits of wildlife and to include
   wildlife in integrated human-livestock-environment surveillance systems.},

Title = {Five small antelope species diets indicate different levels of

Abstract = {The Overberg area, Western Cape, South Africa is highly suitable for
   agricultural practices and has subsequently been severely transformed
   over the last four centuries. This has created a novel habitat for many
   wildlife species. The objective of this study was to determine the
   forage use of five antelope species and thereby assess their level of
   anthrodependence in terms of diet. The five species were bushbuck
   (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), Cape grysbok (Rhaphicerus melanotis), common
   duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) and steenbok
   (Rhaphicerus campestris). To do this, we performed a histological
   analysis on dung samples collected. Our study indicated a high ratio of
   anthropogenic to natural vegetation in the diets of bushbuck, grey
   rhebok and steenbok, as anthropogenic vegetation presented a high
   nutrient food resource, which is easily accessible. However, Cape
   grysbok and common duiker indicated a higher use of natural vegetation.
   The results indicated that all the species benefit from the resources
   offered by the altered landscape and that some species may be dependent
   on these resources while others appear to be more dependent on the
   pockets of natural vegetation in the landscape.},

Abstract = {House mice (Mus musculus) have spread globally as a result of their
   commensal relationship with humans. In the form of laboratory strains,
   both inbred and outbred, they are also among the most widely used model
   organisms in biomedical research. Although the general outlines of house
   mouse dispersal and population structure are well known, details have
   been obscured by either limited sample size or small numbers of markers.
   Here we examine ancestry, population structure, and inbreeding using SNP
   microarray genotypes in a cohort of 814 wild mice spanning five
   continents and all major subspecies of Mus, with a focus on M. m.
   domesticus. We find that the major axis of genetic variation in M. m.
   domesticus is a south-to-north gradient within Europe and the
   Mediterranean. The dominant ancestry component in North America,
   Australia, New Zealand, and various small offshore islands are of
   northern European origin. Next we show that inbreeding is surprisingly
   pervasive and highly variable, even between nearby populations. By
   inspecting the length distribution of homozygous segments in individual
   genomes, we find that inbreeding in commensal populations is mostly due
   to consanguinity. Our results offer new insight into the natural history
   of an important model organism for medicine and evolutionary biology.},

Abstract = {Mendel's First Law requires explanation because of the possibility of
   `meiotic drivers', genes that distort fair segregation for selfish gain.
   The suppression of drive, and the restoration of fair segregation, is
   often attributed to genes at loci unlinked to the drive locus-such genes
   cannot benefit from drive but do suffer its associated fitness costs.
   However, selection can also favour suppressors at loci linked to the
   drive locus, raising the question of whether suppression of drive
   usually comes from linked or unlinked loci. Here, I study linked and
   unlinked suppression in a two-locus model with initial stable
   polymorphism at the drive locus. I find that the invasion rate of
   suppressors is a decreasing function of the recombination fraction
   between the drive and suppressor loci. Surprisingly, the relative
   likelihood of unlinked vs. linked suppression increases with the
   strength of drive and is insensitive to the fitness costs of the driver
   allele. I find that the chromosomal position of the driver influences
   how rapidly it is suppressed, with a driver in the middle of a
   chromosome suppressed more rapidly than a driver near the tip. When
   drive is strong, only a small number of chromosomes are required for
   suppression usually to derive from unlinked loci. In contrast, when
   drive is weak, and especially when suppressor alleles are associated
   with fitness costs, suppression will usually come from linked loci
   unless the genome comprises many chromosomes.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The complex dynamics of a contagious disease in which populations
   experience horizontal and vertical transmissions, size variation, and
   virus mutations are of considerable practical and theoretical interest.
   We model such a system by dividing a population into three distinct
   groups: susceptibles (S), C-infected (C) and F-infected (F), based on
   the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model. Once the individuals
   in the C-infected group recover from the disease, they gain no permanent
   immunity. The virus can mutate in the group C. When it does, the
   individuals become members of the F-infected group. The mutated virus
   causes a lethal and incurable disease with a high mortality rate. We
   discuss the model for two cases. For the first case, all the newborns
   from infected mothers develop the disease shortly after their birth. For
   the second case, there exist equal transmission rates and the C-infected
   population is lifelong infectious. Our analysis shows that both systems
   have positive solutions, and the first model possesses four equilibrium
   points, the trivial one (extinction of the species), C-free equilibrium
   (extinction of the ancestor virus) and two endemic equilibria of
   different properties. We identify the net population growth rates of the
   susceptible and C-infected groups for the existence of the equilibria of
   the first model. We define the conditions of parameters for which
   species extinction and endemic equilibria are locally asymptotically
   stable. We observe that bifurcation occurs at the C-free equilibrium.
   For the second model, we find that there is only one endemic equilibrium
   and it is always locally asymptotically stable. We also determine the
   region for the net population growth rates of the susceptible and
   F-infected groups for the existence of the endemic equilibrium.},

Title = {Present but not detected: new records increase the jaguar's area of
   occupancy in the coastal Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},

Pages = {72-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The jaguar Panthera onca has lost 85\% of its habitat in the Atlantic
   Forest, where it persists in small and isolated populations in the
   largest fragments. In the absence of recent records, the jaguar had
   previously been presumed extinct in the large Atlantic Forest fragments
   of the Serra do Mar in southern Brazil. However, as this region is
   mountainous, densely forested and difficult to access, the jaguar could
   still be present, but undetected. We carried out an intensive survey
   using camera traps and interviews with local people in a large (c. 6,500
   km(2)) forest block. During 2011-2019, 98 camera-trap stations were
   established (14,239 trap-days), and 249 interviews were conducted in 102
   grid cells of 5 x 5 km. We obtained the first images of the jaguar in
   the region, from which five individuals were identified, and
   interviewees provided records of the jaguar in 24 grid cells. Our
   findings increase the range of this species in the Atlantic Forest by
   9\%, and we recommend that the area should be classified as a jaguar
   conservation unit. As the area we surveyed is adjacent to the Serra do
   Mar jaguar conservation unit, the combined area of 19,262 km(2) is the
   largest priority area for jaguar conservation in the Atlantic Forest.
   This proposed jaguar conservation unit could serve as a vital source of
   jaguar individuals for the coastal forests further south. We recommend
   that surveys are extended southwards to Santa Catarina state to
   determine whether the presumed extinction of jaguars in this state is
   another case of a false absence.},

Abstract = {Wolbachia is an insect endosymbiont being used for biological control in
   the mosquito Aedes aegypti because it causes cytoplasmic incompatibility
   (CI) and limits viral replication of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika
   viruses. While the genetic mechanism of pathogen blocking (PB) is not
   fully understood, the strength of both CI and PB are positively
   correlated with Wolbachia densities in the host. Wolbachia densities are
   determined by a combination of Wolbachia strain and insect genotype, as
   well as interactions with the environment. We employed both artificial
   selection and inbreeding with the goal of creating lines of Ae. aegypti
   with heritable and distinct Wolbachia densities so that we might better
   dissect the mechanism underlying PB. We were unable to shift the mean
   relative Wolbachia density in Ae. aegypti lines by either strategy, with
   relative densities instead tending to cycle over a narrow range. In lieu
   of this, we used Wolbachia densities in mosquito legs as predictors of
   relative densities in the remaining individual's carcass. Because we
   worked with outbred mosquitoes, our findings indicate either a lack of
   genetic variation in the mosquito for controlling relative density,
   natural selection against extreme densities, or a predominance of
   environmental factors affecting densities. Our study reveals that there
   are moderating forces acting on relative Wolbachia densities that may
   help to stabilize density phenotypes post field release. We also show a
   means to accurately bin vector carcasses into high and low categories
   for non-DNA omics-based studies of Wolbachia-mediated traits.},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {15-22},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The internet has expanded opportunities for wildlife traders to conduct
   business globally, but monitoring this activity is often challenging. As
   monitoring techniques frequently employ language-based searches for
   particular words, it is important to understand the language traders
   use, particularly the nomenclature used to refer to traded species. We
   recorded advert data from four UK websites, focusing on reptiles, which
   constitute a large proportion of the international pet trade. We
   analysed whether the language types used by advertisers to refer to
   individual reptiles were associated with certain trader characteristics.
   We found English common names were the most frequent name type used to
   refer to species, regardless of the geographical location of the seller
   and the CITES Appendix listing of the species. However, scientific names
   were recorded in twice as many adverts for threatened and Near
   Threatened species as in adverts for non-threatened species, and only
   scientific names were used for three families: Anguidae, Pseudaspididae
   and Sphaerodactylidae. These findings could inform the creation of
   tailored keyword detection tools, which must account for the numerous
   language types in use within online wildlife trade communities. Future
   studies should examine the nuances of language used by other online
   wildlife trader communities in other contexts, such as different online
   platforms or different languages. The ultimate aim of these language
   detection tools will be to track in detail trends in the online reptile
   trade, offering a better understanding of potentially unsustainable
   trade patterns and helping authorities to enforce laws against illegal
   online reptile trade.},

Abstract = {Conservation action plans need to be devised and implemented if we are
   to reduce the extinction risk faced by globally threatened plants.
   However, most plant species categorized as threatened globally on the
   IUCN Red List lack conservation action plans. In West Africa, Guinea is
   one of the most diverse countries in terms of botanical species. In
   total, 273 plant species in Guinea have been assessed as being
   threatened globally, reflecting increasing pressure from the extractive
   industry and a growing population requiring food and fuel. In parallel
   with the implementation of an Important Plant Area programme in Guinea,
   we developed conservation action plans for 20 threatened plant species
   through a pilot study. We outline the methods we used and demonstrate
   the importance of adopting a collaborative approach and having
   up-to-date field information. The need for such plans is urgent, with
   recent estimates suggesting that one-third of African plants are
   threatened with extinction. Based on our experience with the first 20
   conservation action plans for Guinea species, we suggest that the
   preparation of multi-species conservation action plans would be an
   efficient use of the limited resources available for species
   conservation.},

Abstract = {We surveyed the urial Ovis vignei and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica in
   the Hindu Kush mountain range of Wakhan National Park in north-eastern
   Afghanistan to determine their population status and identify potential
   drivers of population change. We conducted two double-observer ground
   surveys, in April-May 2015 and 2018, in 10 areas (total = 288 km(2)).
   Urial herds were mostly composed of both sexes (78\% of observed herds),
   the mean adult sex ratio (females:males) was 100:70, and the mean
   female:juvenile ratio was 100:53. In 2018 we calculated a urial density
   of 35/100 km(2), compared to 72/100 km(2) in 2015. Ibex herds were
   mostly (79\%) composed of both sexes, the mean adult sex ratio
   (females:males) was 100:103, and the mean female:juvenile ratio was
   100:58. Ibex density estimates were similar in 2015 and 2018 (c. 250/100
   km(2)). We discuss the usefulness of the double-observer methods for
   ungulate surveys, highlight the value of viewshed calculations and
   discuss the possible causes of urial population decline. To ensure the
   conservation of these ungulate populations, we recommend continued
   regular monitoring, measures to address poaching and research to clarify
   the taxonomical status of urials in Wakhan.},

Title = {Assessing national-level provision of conservation capacity building:
   lessons learnt from a case study of Kenya},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {753-759},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As global environmental pressures grow, the need for delivering relevant
   and sustainable capacity building in conservation has never been
   greater. Individuals, organizations and communities need the skills,
   knowledge and information that allow them to address environmental
   issues at a variety of spatial scales and in diverse contexts. Capacity
   is currently built through a range of activities, including tertiary
   education, training courses, online learning, mentoring and continuing
   professional development. However, a significant proportion of the
   current capacity-building provision is non-strategic, project-based and
   reactive. The conservation sector still lacks a coordinated approach to
   capacity building linked to broader conservation goals. Without an
   assessment of current capacity-building provision and future capacity
   needs, the delivery of capacity building in conservation will remain
   fundamentally ad hoc. The need for strategic conservation capacity
   building in sub-Saharan Africa has been identified and here we report on
   the first collation of online material to assess current conservation
   capacity provision in Kenya (the country with the greatest online
   capacity-building presence). We reviewed a total of 177
   capacity-building initiatives delivered during 2014-2019 and recorded 55
   separate metrics for each initiative. We present: (1) a broad overview
   of the data collation methods developed, (2) examples of data that will
   support strategic capacity-building strategies, and (3) the lessons
   learnt from this assessment.},

Journal = {HEREDITY},

Volume = {129},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-201},

Abstract = {Interspecific hybridization has varied consequences for offspring
   fitness, with implications for the maintenance of species integrity.
   Hybrid vigour, when it occurs, can peak in first-generation (F1) hybrids
   and then decline in advanced-generation (F2+) hybrids. This hybrid
   breakdown, together with the processes affecting patterns of
   hybridization and hybrid fitness, determine the evolutionary stability
   of hybrid zones. An extensive hybrid zone in North America involving the
   cattails Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia, and their invasive hybrid T.
   x glauca is characterized by hybrid vigour among F1s, but the fitness of
   advanced-generation hybrids has not been studied. We compared seed
   germination and plant growth of T. latifolia (parental L), F1 T. x
   glauca (F1), hybrid backcrosses to T. angustifolia (bcA) and T.
   latifolia (bcL), and advanced-generation (F2) hybrids. Consistent with
   expectations under hybrid breakdown, we found reduced plant growth for
   F2 hybrids in comparison with F1s (plant height and above-ground
   biomass) and parental Ls (above-ground biomass). Backcrossed hybrids had
   intermediate measures of plant growth and bcLs were characterized by
   reduced seed germination in comparison with parental Ls. Hybrid
   breakdown could make the formation of F1s in North America finite
   because (1) hybridization among cattails is asymmetric, with T.
   angustifolia but not T. latifolia subject to genetic swamping, and (2)
   T. angustifolia is less common and subject to competitive displacement
   by F1s. Hybrid breakdown is therefore expected to reduce hybrid
   frequencies over time, contributing to the long-term maintenance of T.

Title = {Landscape genetics of a sub-alpine toad: climate change predicted to
   induce upward range shifts via asymmetrical migration corridors},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to have a major hydrological impact on the
   core breeding habitat and migration corridors of many amphibians in the
   twenty-first century. The Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus) is a species
   of meadow-specializing amphibian endemic to the high-elevation Sierra
   Nevada Mountains of California. Despite living entirely on federal
   lands, it has recently faced severe extirpations, yet our understanding
   of climatic influences on population connectivity is limited. In this
   study, we used a previously published double-digest RADseq dataset along
   with numerous remotely sensed habitat features in a landscape genetics
   framework to answer two primary questions in Yosemite National Park: (1)
   Which fine-scale climate, topographic, soil, and vegetation features
   most facilitate meadow connectivity? (2) How is climate change predicted
   to influence both the magnitude and net asymmetry of genetic migration?
   We developed an approach for simultaneously modeling multiple toad
   migration paths, akin to circuit theory, except raw environmental
   features can be separately considered. Our workflow identified the most
   likely migration corridors between meadows and used the unique cubist
   machine learning approach to fit and forecast environmental models of
   connectivity. We identified the permuted modeling importance of numerous
   snowpack-related features, such as runoff and groundwater recharge. Our
   results highlight the importance of considering phylogeographic
   structure, and asymmetrical migration in landscape genetics. We predict
   an upward elevational shift for this already high-elevation species, as
   measured by the net vector of anticipated genetic movement, and a
   north-eastward shift in species distribution via the network of genetic
   migration corridors across the park.},

Title = {Good predictors for the fixation probability on complex networks of
   multi-player games using territorial interactions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In 2012 Broom and Rychtar developed a new framework to consider the
   evolution of a population over a non-homogeneous underlying structure,
   where fitness depends upon multiplayer interactions amongst the
   individuals within the population played in groups of various sizes
   (including one). This included the independent model, and as a special
   case the territorial raider model, which has been considered in a series
   of subsequent papers. Here individuals are based upon the vertex of a
   graph but move to interact with their neighbours, sometimes meeting in
   large groups. The most important single property of such populations is
   the fixation probability, the probability of a single mutant completely
   replacing the existing population. In a recent paper we considered the
   fixation probability for the Birth Death Birth (BDB) dynamics for three
   games, a Public Goods game, the Hawk-Dove game and for fixed fitnesses
   for a large number of randomly generated graphs, in particular seeing if
   important underlying graph properties could be used as predictors. We
   found two good predictors, temperature and mean group size, but some
   interesting and unusual features for one type of graph, Barabasi-Albert
   graphs. In this paper we use a regression analysis to investigate (the
   usual) three alternative evolutionary dynamics (BDD, DBB, DBD) in
   addition to the original BDB. In particular, we find that the dynamics
   split into two pairs, BDB/DBD and BDD/DBB, each of which give
   essentially the same results and found a good fit to the data using a
   quadratic regression involving the above two variables. Further we find
   that temperature is the most important predictor for the Hawk-Dove game,
   whilst for the Public Goods game the group size also plays a key role,
   and is more important than the temperature for the BDD/DBB dynamics.},

Abstract = {We present the Late Pleistocene extinct shrub-ox, Euceratherium collinum
   (Bovidae), dung pellets recovered from Pontatoc Ridge Shelter, a dry
   alcove in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona. The shelter
   is at the current upper edge of the ArizonaUpland subdivision (the
   highest and coldest part) of the Sonoran Desert. Packrat (Neotoma)
   middens with macrobotanical fossils and a floor deposit consisting of
   midden debris and dung pellets were sampled and are described here. Six
   packrat middens radiocarbon date to 15,690-22,874 cal yr B.P.
   (calibrated years before present); dung pellets from the floor deposit
   date to 14,990 cal yr B.P. Macrobotanical fossils primarily from the
   middens but also from the floor deposit indicate that a woodland
   composed of Arizona cypress (Hesperocyparis {[}Cupressus] arizonica),
   Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a
   hybrid singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla var. fallax), border
   pinyon (Pinus discolor), juniper (Juniperus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos
   pungens), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) grew outside the
   shelter. Dung pellets were measured, compared with other extant and
   extinct species, and sampled for phytoliths and pollen. Based on size,
   morphology, DNA, and physiographic setting (cliff face), our assumption
   is that only a single taxon of slickrockclimbing ruminant used the
   small, extremely inaccessible Pontatoc Ridge Shelter and that all large
   pellets belong to the extinct shrub-ox. The distribution of Late
   Pleistocene shrub-ox is reviewed; the stocky, rather short ruminant is
   recovered mainly in mountainous and canyon-county terrains of western
   United States and northern Mexico.},

Title = {The threat of an indigenous medicinal plant encroacher: Artemisia afra
   in Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve, Johannesburg, South Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Artemisia afra was identified as an encroaching shrub in the
   Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve (KNR). Ecological factors that influence
   the encroachment of A. afra and its population structure were unknown,
   making it difficult to monitor and control the spread of the plant. This
   study assessed the density and size-class distributions (SCD) of A. afra
   across the main habitats in the KNR (streamside, plains and ridges, with
   ridges divided into crest, mid-slope and bottom slope), as well as the
   relationship between A. afra density and certain ecological factors.
   Results showed that there was a significant difference (p < 0.05)
   between plant density on the different habitats with the ridge and
   bottom slope having by far the highest density (>900 plants/ha). Canopy
   volume was considered the best measure for the SCD of A. afra. Overall,
   the population structure of A. afra displayed an inverse J-shaped curve,
   indicating that despite clearing efforts and the drought of 2015-2016,
   it is effectively a recruiting population. Over 71\% of the A. afra
   population were flowering, suggesting relatively rapid attainment of
   reproductive maturity, and high seed production. Hence, the high levels
   of encroachment are likely to continue. Further research on controlling
   A. afra with the integrated use of more intense winter fires, herbicides
   and the feasibility of sustainable harvesting of this medicinal plant
   should be undertaken. We also need a much better understanding of the
   regeneration ecology of A. afra in order to better control it.},

Abstract = {The Boe region in the south-east of Guinea-Bissau has remained untouched
   by large-scale human influence and development due to its isolated
   location. The region consists mainly of savannah interspersed with
   gallery forests and hosts a unique and valuable biodiversity though very
   little is known of small terrestrial mammal diversity. In 2013, a
   terrestrial small mammal live trapping survey was conducted around Beli,
   a small village in the South of the Boe region. Five survey locations of
   three ecotypes were selected, and a combination of pitfall traps and
   live traps was used to capture and release small mammals. A selection of
   mammals that could not be identified as well as accidental mortalities
   in the traps were collected as voucher specimens and sent to Naturalis
   Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. Over 96 survey days, a total of
   331 small terrestrial mammals were trapped from 21 unique species, which
   include two new species records for the country: shrew species Crocidura
   lamottei and Crocidura crossei. Extrapolation from species accumulation
   curves suggested an overall species richness of 22 species for the
   region, with substantial differences in community composition among
   sampled habitats. The results of this study are an important part of the
   scientific record for small terrestrial mammals in the Boe region and
   set a baseline reference for future conservation efforts.},

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},
Number = {4},
Pages = {244-256},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The genome-wide association study is an elementary tool to assess the
   genetic contribution to complex human traits. However, such association
   tests are mainly proposed for autosomes, and less attention has been
   given to methods for identifying loci on the X chromosome due to their
   distinct biological features. In addition, the existing association
   tests for quantitative traits on the X chromosome either fail to
   incorporate the information of males or only detect variance
   heterogeneity. Therefore, we propose four novel methods, which are
   denoted as QX(cat), QZ(max), QMVX(cat) and QMVZ(max). When using these
   methods, it is assumed that the risk alleles for females and males are
   the same and that the locus being studied satisfies the generalized
   genetic model for females. The first two methods are based on comparing
   the means of the trait value across different genotypes, while the
   latter two methods test for the difference of both means and variances.
   All four methods effectively incorporate the information of X chromosome
   inactivation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods
   control the type I error rates well. Under the simulated scenarios, the
   proposed methods are generally more powerful than the existing methods.
   We also apply our proposed methods to data from the Minnesota Center for
   Twin and Family Research and find 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms
   that are statistically significantly associated with at least two traits
   at the significance level of 1 x 10(-3).},

Title = {Hybridization is strongly constrained by salinity during secondary

Abstract = {This study investigates a contact zone between two silverside fish
   species (marine Odontesthes argentinensis and freshwater O. bonariensis)
   in the estuarine Mar Chiquita lagoon along the Atlantic coast in
   Argentina (MChL), in which intermediate morphs had been reported. It has
   been suggested that admixture and introgression occur in MChL between
   these two species, but direct genetic evidence is lacking. Leveraging
   samples collected over several years (n = 676), we document the spatial
   distribution of both species and intermediate morphs within this habitat
   and collect landmark-based morphometric and multilocus genetic data
   (9876 loci for n = 110 individuals) to test the hypothesis of
   hybridization. Our analysis unambiguously characterizes intermediate
   morphs as F1 or F2 hybrids. We show that the low frequency of hybrid
   individuals in MChL may be explained by uneven abundance of parental
   species, which in turn are strongly affected by water salinity, limiting
   the size of the contact zone. Although hybrids seem to be fertile, their
   fitness may be reduced by external and intrinsic factors that may limit
   their success and suggest that this is an unstable hybrid zone. Genetic
   distinctiveness of both parental species is strongly supported by
   genome-wide data, explaining a known pattern of mitonuclear discordance
   as a consequence of hybridization followed by mitochondrial
   introgression. A clear signature of population genetic structure was
   detected in O. argentinensis, distinguishing MChL residents from marine
   populations of this species, that also was supported by distinctive
   morphometric features among these groups. Previous hypotheses of
   speciation in these fishes are discussed in the light of the new
   findings.},

Abstract = {Cat domestication likely initiated as a symbiotic relationship between
   wildcats (Felis silvestris subspecies) and the peoples of developing
   agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent. As humans transitioned from
   hunter-gatherers to farmers similar to 12,000 years ago, bold wildcats
   likely capitalized on increased prey density (i.e., rodents). Humans
   benefited from the cats' predation on these vermin. To refine the
   site(s) of cat domestication, over 1000 random-bred cats of primarily
   Eurasian descent were genotyped for single-nucleotide variants and short
   tandem repeats. The overall cat population structure suggested a single
   worldwide population with significant isolation by the distance of
   peripheral subpopulations. The cat population heterozygosity decreased
   as genetic distance from the proposed cat progenitor's (F.s. lybica)
   natural habitat increased. Domestic cat origins are focused in the
   eastern Mediterranean Basin, spreading to nearby islands, and southernly
   via the Levantine coast into the Nile Valley. Cat population diversity
   supports the migration patterns of humans and other symbiotic species.},

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of insecticide resistance genes in mosquito
   populations is pivotal for a sustainable use of insecticides. Dieldrin
   resistance in Aedes albopictus is conferred by the alanine to serine
   substitution (A3025 or Rdl(R) allele) in the gamma-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA) receptor encoded by the Rdl gene. On Reunion Island, dieldrin
   resistance was initially reported in natural Ae. albopictus populations
   sampled in 2008 despite the ban of dieldrin since 1994. To monitor
   insecticide resistance in Ae. albopictus on the island and to identify
   its drivers, we measured (i) the frequency of resistance alleles in 19
   distinct natural populations collected between 2016 and 2017, (ii)
   fitness costs associated with dieldrin resistance in
   laboratory-controlled experiments, and (iii) the resistance conferred by
   Rdl(R) to fipronil, an insecticide widely used on the island and
   reported to cross-react with Rdl(R). The results show a persistence of
   Rdl(R) in Ae. albopictus natural populations at low frequencies. Among
   the measured life history traits, mortality in preimaginal stages,
   adults' survival as well as the proportion of egg-laying females were
   significantly affected in resistant mosquitoes. Finally, bioassays
   revealed resistance of Rdl(R) mosquitoes to fipronil, suggesting that
   the use of fipronil in natura could select for the Rdl(R) allele. This
   study shows that dieldrin resistance is persistent in natural mosquito
   populations likely as a result of combined effects between fitness costs
   associated with Rdl(R) and selection exerted by cross-reacting
   environmental insecticides such as fipronil.},

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 28},
Abstract = {The terrestrial and marine biotypes of Madagascar are critical
   priorities for conservation, with almost unparalleled levels of
   endemism, species diversity and human threat for a land area of its
   size. Field inventories and molecular-based research conducted from the
   mid 1980s to present have greatly expanded knowledge of the country's
   biota, for some groups with nearly exponential growth in measures of
   species diversity. I provide updated measures of estimated species
   diversity between a book with 289 contributors, published in 2003 (The
   Natural History of Madagascar), and a full-scale update with 539
   contributors, published in 2022 (The New Natural History of Madagascar).
   I compare biodiversity information presented in the new book with data
   from the earlier book, providing insight into scientific advancements,
   and revised estimates of species richness and endemism of a range of
   taxonomic groups.},

Title = {The bushmeat trade in northern Ghana: market dynamics, drivers of trade
   and implications for conservation},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Data on species trade profiles and volumes of wild animals on sale in
   local markets can provide useful insights into the bushmeat trade,
   enabling identification of priorities for management and conservation
   planning. We monitored bushmeat traded in three markets (Sandema, Chiana
   and Fumbisi) in the Upper East Region of Ghana during October
   2018-October 2019. More than 80\% of carcasses sold were amphibians
   (frogs). Species composition and volumes of bushmeat traded varied
   significantly across markets. Bushmeat sales were highest during the dry
   season (75\% of total biomass traded). The bulk (60\% of total biomass)
   traded in the local markets was transported long distances for resale in
   major urban markets in southern Ghana. Large-bodied species were
   comparatively low in number and sold almost exclusively for resale in
   southern markets. This study highlights the importance of frog meat as
   an affordable protein source for consumers and as income for traders in
   an economically deprived region. Seasonal fluctuations of bushmeat sales
   demonstrated the importance of bushmeat as part of a diversified
   livelihood strategy for hunters and traders. Furthermore, this study
   underscores the significant role that long-distance trade networks play
   as key drivers of the bushmeat trade in these parts of northern Ghana,
   and highlights the risks posed by current extraction levels for species
   conservation in this understudied region. Our recommendations include
   investigating the potential of sustainable amphibian production,
   improving protection of particular vulnerable species and of the
   protected areas in the region and exploring alternative livelihoods
   during the peak hunting season.},

Abstract = {Wildfires are a significant threat to environmental, social, economic
   and agricultural systems. This study investigated the spatiotemporal
   trends in wildfire activity and its interactions with climate and
   environmental factors in Cote d'Ivoire through remotely sensed MODIS
   data associated with climate, biophysical and anthropogenic data. We
   analysed relationships between wildfire occurrence and climate drivers
   using cross-correlations, while Pearson chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis
   tests were selected to identify linkages between qualitative and
   quantitative environmental data, respectively. Seasonal Kendall and
   Sen's slope approaches were applied for trend analysis. During the
   period 2001-2019, 8150 wildfires were recorded annually, burning 2.69
   million hectares per year, representing about 8.34\% of Cote d'Ivoire.
   Fire detections and burnt areas highlighted a downward trend in all
   ecoregions with a predominance in the Sudanian zone. Wildfire occurrence
   showed a significant and strongly negative link with relative humidity
   and visibility, as well as a significant and positive correlation with
   maximum temperature, thermal amplitude and vapour-pressure deficit.
   Also, the spatial distribution of wildfires was significantly
   conditioned by environmental factors. The findings of this study will
   help decision makers and managers to make decisions to reduce the
   vulnerability of local populations to current and future wildfire
   hazards.},

Title = {Rural-urban mobility influences wildmeat access and consumption in the
   Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Research demonstrates substantial urban consumption of wildmeat and the
   existence of trade networks in the Brazilian Amazon. Yet rural-urban
   mobility persists in this urbanized region, with the circulation of
   people, goods and ideas, blurring boundaries between rural and urban
   lives. Here we examined the relationships between rural-urban mobility
   and wildmeat access in highly forested areas of central Brazilian
   Amazonia. We surveyed 798 urban households in four towns and 311 rural
   households in 63 riverine communities. Rural-urban mobility was common
   amongst urban households: 49.7\% maintained rural livelihoods and 57.3\%
   were headed by rural in-migrants. Although many urban consumers
   purchased wildmeat, gifting was equally important. Urban households with
   greater rural-urban mobility consumed more wildmeat and were less likely
   to purchase it. Buying wildmeat was rare in rural areas but emergent in
   larger rural communities. Rural consumption was greater in remote areas,
   non-floodplain communities and during the high-water season. Urban
   populations placed particular pressure on three preferred species: the
   lowland paca Cuniculus paca, tapir Tapirus terrestris and white-lipped
   peccary Tayassu pecari. Rural consumption was more diverse, and
   per-capita wildmeat consumption was four times greater in rural than
   urban households (21 vs 5 kg/person/year). Total estimated annual
   wildmeat consumption was 3,732 t across 43 riverine urban centres
   compared to 11,351 t in surrounding rural areas. Because of poverty in
   these towns and socially mediated wildmeat acquisition, it is debatable
   whether urban consumers should or could be denied access to wildmeat.
   Nonetheless, the probable future increase in urban demand and related
   risks to sustainable, equitable resource use necessitate the monitoring
   and management of rural-urban wildmeat flows.},

Abstract = {Conservation professionals face cognitively and emotionally demanding
   tasks and a wide range of working conditions, including high levels of
   uncertainty (e.g. the socio-political contexts in which they must
   function, possible long hours and isolation from friends and family).
   Resilience (i.e. positive adaptation to professional challenges) can
   help individuals thrive in their roles. We interviewed 22
   conservationists with professional experience working in low-income
   countries with high biodiversity and explored what helped and what
   hindered them in their work. We used thematic analysis to identify
   factors related to positive and negative psychological states and
   strategies to promote resilience at work. The results revealed factors
   that were associated with positive psychological states, including
   achievements and recognition for work. Organizational policies and
   administration, especially perceived unfairness regarding salaries,
   recruitment policies and promotion, were associated with negative
   psychological states, as were other factors related to the job context.
   Respondents shared their professional resilience strategies such as
   aligning work with one's values, and personal reflection and goal
   setting. We recommend that organizations support their employees in the
   process of building resilience by addressing basic needs and
   motivational factors.},

Abstract = {How do nascent species evolve reproductive isolation during speciation
   with on-going gene flow? How do hybrid lineages become stabilised hybrid
   species? While commonly used genomic approaches provide an indirect way
   to identify species incompatibility factors, synthetic hybrids generated
   from interspecific crosses allow direct pinpointing of phenotypic traits
   involved in incompatibilities and the traits that are potentially
   adaptive in hybrid species. Here we report the analysis of phenotypic
   variation and hybrid breakdown in crosses between closely-related
   Senecio aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius, and their homoploid hybrid
   species, S. squalidus. The two former species represent a likely case of
   recent (< 200 ky) speciation with gene flow driven by adaptation to
   contrasting conditions of high- and low-elevations on Mount Etna,
   Sicily. As these species form viable and fertile hybrids, it remains
   unclear whether they have started to evolve reproductive
   incompatibility. Our analysis represents the first study of phenotypic
   variation and hybrid breakdown involving multiple Senecio hybrid
   families. It revealed wide range of variation in multiple traits,
   including the traits previously unrecorded in synthetic hybrids. Leaf
   shape, highly distinct between S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius,
   was extremely variable in F-2 hybrids, but more consistent in S.
   squalidus. Our study demonstrates that interspecific incompatibilities
   can evolve rapidly despite on-going gene flow between the species.
   Further work is necessary to understand the genetic bases of these
   incompatibilities and their role in speciation with gene flow.},

Abstract = {The feeding ecology of the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) was investigated
   for the first time in north-western Sahara, Djebel Antar (Bechar
   province, Algeria), from autumn 2015 to summer 2016. Microhistological
   analyses of faeces revealed an annual diet composed of 23 identified
   taxa belonging to 16 plant families. The highest species diversity was
   recorded in spring and summer (23 species), despite a marked consumption
   of two species: Vachellia tortilis (17.7\%) and Avena sterilis (14.0\%);
   diet diversity was lower in autumn and winter (16 species), including
   mainly Teucrium polium (14.7\%, 21.0\%) and Gymnocarpos decander
   (19.7\%, 10.0\%). The main plant parts consumed during these seasons
   were stems (77.7\%, 65.3\%), while leaves and inflorescences were mostly
   consumed during spring and summer (54.7\%, 52.3\%). Forbs dominated the
   aoudad's diet, with 46.3\% average relative abundance, including mainly
   T. polium, Limoniastrum feei, and Chrysanthemum macrocarpum. Woody
   plants including mainly V. tortilis and G. decander accounted for 33.3\%
   (50.0\% in autumn), and grasses including A. sterilis and H. murinum for
   20.4\% (32.0\% in summer). Based on this diet, A. lervia can be
   classified as a ``generalist mixed-feeder.{''}},

Title = {Does tenure influence sustainable use? The ecological impacts of
   harvesting baobab (Adansonia digitata)},

Abstract = {Using the lens of the baobab tree, this paper explores the ecological
   outcomes of different tenurial arrangements and implications for
   resource sustainability. With the emergence of markets for baobab
   products, a central concern is to confirm whether use patterns differ
   across different tenure regimes and, if so, their ecological outcomes.
   The study is based on an ecological survey in Zimbabwe of 244 baobab
   trees located across three tenure regimes - communal, private and state
   - and also draws on interviews with key informants. The results suggest
   that tenure has a strong influence on the sustainability of baobab
   harvesting. Based on identified parameters of ecological sustainability,
   trees under state tenure were shown to be harvested unsustainably, and
   showed excessive bark harvesting, while those under private and communal
   tenure had fewer signs of debarking and produced more fruits, suggesting
   their use was more sustainable. Excessive bark harvesting was found to
   negatively affect fruit and bark production and, to a lesser extent, the
   overall health of the tree. The research illustrates that in order to
   understand ecologically sustainable use, an understanding of resource
   use patterns across different tenure regimes is crucial, suggesting the
   design of bespoke interventions to manage the use of natural resources
   in different tenure systems.},

Abstract = {Striga species are highly invasive annual parasitic plants posing
   significant economic losses to the production of cereal grains and
   legumes in Africa. There is no explicit knowledge about the potential
   distribution of some important Striga species in Africa. In this study,
   we used the Maximum Entropy modelling algorithm (MaxEnt 3.4) to identify
   the bioclimatic variables that best explain the current geographic
   distribution of the three most aggressive Striga species in Africa.
   Present-day climatically suitable areas were estimated at 14.53 million
   km(2) (S. asiatica), 14.89 million km(2) (S. hermonthica) and 12.13
   million km(2) (S. generioides), amounting to about 48\%, 49\% and 60\%
   of the climatic space in Africa, respectively. Approximately, 11 million
   km(2) were identified as stable and suitable across present and future
   periods for S. hermonthica, compared with 9 and 6 million km(2) for S.
   asiatica and S. gesnerioides, respectively. Model projections showed
   that none of the study species would be able to disperse across much of
   northern and southern Africa. Striga hermonthica had the highest
   proportion (3.4\%-9.3\%) of colonised areas after dispersal simulations.
   The three Strigas predicted to be invasive in the tropical rainforest
   and tropical savannah of Africa. Breeding of polyploid Striga which
   causes sterility is considered as an alternative biological control to
   its spread.},

Abstract = {Laboratory experiments in which blood-borne parasitic microbes evolve in
   their animal hosts offer an opportunity to study parasite evolution and
   adaptation in real time and under natural settings. The main challenge
   of these experiments is to establish a protocol that is both practical
   over multiple passages and accurately reflects natural transmission
   scenarios and mechanisms. We provide a guide to the steps that should be
   considered when designing such a protocol, and we demonstrate its use
   via a case study. We highlight the importance of choosing suitable
   ancestral genotypes, treatments, number of replicates per treatment,
   types of negative controls, dependent variables, covariates, and the
   timing of checkpoints for the experimental design. We also recommend
   specific preliminary experiments to determine effective methods for
   parasite quantification, transmission, and preservation. Although these
   methodological considerations are technical, they also often have
   conceptual implications. To this end, we encourage other researchers to
   design and conduct in vivo evolution experiments with blood-borne
   parasitic microbes, despite the challenges that the work entails.},

Abstract = {Sulphur compounds are used in a variety of biological processes
   including respiration and photosynthesis. Sulphide and sulphur compounds
   of intermediary oxidation state can serve as electron donors for
   lithotrophic growth while sulphate, thiosulphate and sulphur are used as
   electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration. The biochemistry underlying
   the manifold transformations of inorganic sulphur compounds occurring in
   sulphur metabolizing prokaryotes is astonishingly complex and knowledge
   about it has immensely increased over the last years. The advent of
   next-generation sequencing approaches as well as the significant
   increase of data availability in public databases has driven focus of
   environmental microbiology to probing the metabolic capacity of
   microbial communities by analysis of this sequence data. To facilitate
   these analyses, we created HMS-S-S, a comprehensive equivalogous hidden
   Markov model (HMM)-supported tool. Protein sequences related to sulphur
   compound oxidation, reduction, transport and intracellular transfer are
   efficiently detected and related enzymes involved in dissimilatory
   sulphur oxidation as opposed to sulphur compound reduction can be
   confidently distinguished. HMM search results are coupled to
   corresponding genes, which allows analysis of co-occurrence, synteny and
   genomic neighbourhood. The HMMs were validated on an annotated test data
   set and by cross-validation. We also proved its performance by exploring
   meta-assembled genomes isolated from samples from environments with
   active sulphur cycling, including members of the cable bacteria, novel
   Acidobacteria and assemblies from a sulphur-rich glacier, and were able
   to replicate and extend previous reports.},

Abstract = {Drought and salt stress are important factors that affect plant growth
   and development and cause crop yield reductions worldwide. Phospholipase
   C is a class of enzymes that can hydrolyze phospholipids, and it has
   been shown to play an important role in plant growth regulation and
   stress response. We used rice as a model to investigate the function of
   the wheat TaPI-PLC1-2B gene in salt and drought tolerance. For this
   purpose, we heterologously expressed the TaPI-PLC1-2B gene in rice and
   studied the transcriptional differences in transgenic and wide-type rice
   plants in the presence and absence of drought and salt stress. Our
   results showed that 2130 and 1759 genes expressed differentially in the
   TaPI-PLC1-2B overexpression rice line under salt and drought stress,
   respectively. Gene ontology enrichment results showed that
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in
   cellular process, metabolic process, stimulus-response, cell, organelle,
   catalytic activity, and other functional processes under salt and
   drought stress. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
   pathway analysis showed DEG enrichment in plant-pathogen interaction,
   phosphoinositol, plant hormones, and other signaling pathways under the
   two stress treatments. Furthermore, the chromosomal localization of salt
   and drought stress-responsive DEGs showed a clear distribution pattern
   on specific rice chromosomes. For instance, the greatest number of
   drought stress-responsive genes mapped to rice chromosomes 1 and 6. The
   current analysis has built the basis for future explorations to decipher
   the TaPI-PLC1-2B-mediated plant stress response mechanism in the
   relatively challenging wheat system.},

Abstract = {Cymbidium is an orchid genus that has undergone rapid radiation and has
   high ornamental, economic, ecological and cultural importance, but its
   classification based on morphology is controversial. The plastid genome
   (plastome), as an extension of plant standard DNA barcodes, has been
   widely used as a potential molecular marker for identifying recently
   diverged species or complicated plant groups. In this study, we newly
   generated 237 plastomes of 50 species (at least two individuals per
   species) by genome skimming, covering 71.4\% of members of the genus
   Cymbidium. Sequence-based analyses (barcoding gaps and automatic barcode
   gap discovery) and tree-based analyses (maximum likelihood, Bayesian
   inference and multirate Poisson tree processes model) were conducted for
   species identification of Cymbidium. Our work provides a comprehensive
   DNA barcode reference library for Cymbidium species identification. The
   results show that compared with standard DNA barcodes (rbcL + matK) as
   well as the plastid trnH-psbA, the species identification rate of the
   plastome increased moderately from 58\% to 68\%. At the same time, we
   propose an optimized identification strategy for Cymbidium species. The
   plastome cannot completely resolve the species identification of
   Cymbidium, the main reasons being incomplete lineage sorting, artificial
   cultivation, natural hybridization and chloroplast capture. To further
   explore the potential use of nuclear data in identifying species, the
   Skmer method was adopted and the identification rate increased to 72\%.
   It appears that nuclear genome data have a vital role in species
   identification and are expected to be used as next-generation nuclear
   barcodes.},

Abstract = {Locoweeds are perennial forbs poisonous to livestock and cause extreme
   losses to animal husbandry. Locoweed toxicity is attributed to the
   symbiotic endophytes in Alternaria sect. Undifilum, which produce a
   mycotoxin swainsonine (SW). We performed a de novo whole genome
   sequencing of the most common locoweed in China, Oxytropis ochrocephala
   (2n = 16), and assembled a high-quality, chromosome-level reference
   genome. Its genome size is 958.83 Mb with 930.94 Mb (97.09\%) anchored
   and oriented onto eight chromosomes, and 31,700 protein-coding genes
   were annotated. Phylogenetic and collinearity analysis showed it is
   closely related to Medicago truncatula with a pair of large
   interchromosomal rearrangements, and both species underwent a
   whole-genome duplication event. We also derived the genome of A.
   oxytropis at 74.48 Mb with a contig N50 of 8.87 Mb and 10,657
   protein-coding genes, and refined the genes of SW biosynthesis. Multiple
   Alternaria species containing the swnK gene were grouped into a single
   clade, but in other genera, swnK's homologues are diverse. Resequencing
   of 41 A. oxytropis strains revealed one SNP in the SWN cluster causing
   changes in SW concentration. Comparing the transcriptomes of symbiotic
   and nonsymbiotic interactions identified differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) linked to defence and secondary metabolism in the host. Within
   the endophyte DEGs were linked to cell wall degradation, fatty acids and
   nitrogen metabolism. Symbiosis induced the upregulation of most of the
   SW biosynthetic genes. These two genomes and relevant sequencing data
   should provide valuable genetic resources for the study of the
   evolution, interaction, and SW biosynthesis in the symbiont.},

Title = {Impact of mitotype diversity on metabarcoding biodiversity estimations

Abstract = {DNA barcoding and metabarcoding have been increasingly used in species
   delimitation and species diversity assessment, respectively, and the
   molecular markers used in animals are mainly derived from mitochondrial
   DNA. It is well known that the phenomenon of multiple mitochondrial
   haplotypes within the same specimen (hereafter referred to as ``mitotype
   diversity{''}) may have a negative impact on the proper assessment of
   biodiversity by metabarcoding. However, few studies have focused on the
   incidence of this phenomenon and its effects on metabarcoding results
   using different sample preparation strategies, such as mock community
   construction using pooled high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data,
   DNA-pooling and Tissue-pooling. In this study, we investigated mitotype
   diversity and its influence on metabarcoding based on 398 specimens from
   66 species of Insecta and 82 specimens from 16 species of Arachnida by
   HTS of the mitochondrial cox1 gene fragment. The results revealed that
   mitotype diversity was common in the studied taxa and significantly
   increased the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the
   three sample preparation strategies. The results also showed that the
   bioinformatics pipeline based on authentic amplicon sequence variants
   was more reliable than the pipeline based on OTUs. Regarding the sample
   preparation strategies of DNA-pooling and Tissue-pooling commonly used
   in metabarcoding, our results revealed that their results of
   metabarcoding were quite similar, and the Tissue-pooling strategy was
   therefore preferred because of its simplicity. Our study calls for
   additional attention to the interference of mitotype diversity on the
   results of DNA metabarcoding in biodiversity assessment.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Honey bee subspecies originate from specific geographical areas in
   Africa, Europe and the Middle East, and beekeepers interested in
   specific phenotypes have imported genetic material to regions outside of
   the bees' original range for use either in pure lines or controlled
   crosses. Moreover, imported drones are present in the environment and
   mate naturally with queens from the local subspecies. The resulting
   admixture complicates population genetics analyses, and population
   stratification can be a major problem for association studies. To better
   understand Western European honey bee populations, we produced a whole
   genome sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data
   set from 870 haploid drones and demonstrate its utility for the
   identification of nine genetic backgrounds and various degrees of
   admixture in a subset of 629 samples. Five backgrounds identified
   correspond to subspecies, two to isolated populations on islands and two
   to managed populations. We also highlight several large haplotype
   blocks, some of which coincide with the position of centromeres. The
   largest is 3.6 Mb long and represents 21\% of chromosome 11, with two
   major haplotypes corresponding to the two dominant genetic backgrounds
   identified. This large naturally phased data set is available as a
   single vcf file that can now serve as a reference for subsequent
   populations genomics studies in the honey bee, such as (i) selecting
   individuals of verified homogeneous genetic backgrounds as references,
   (ii) imputing genotypes from a lower-density data set generated by an
   SNP-chip or by low-pass sequencing, or (iii) selecting SNPs compatible
   with the requirements of genotyping chips.},

Abstract = {Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) plays a vital role in colonizing newly
   disturbed areas, providing shade for other tree species to germinate,
   and supplying food for a variety of birds and mammals, such as Clark's
   Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos
   horribilis). Decline of whitebark pine populations has been attributed
   to several factors, including white pine blister rust (Cronartium
   ribicola), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, and
   fire exclusion. In 2009, the U.S. Forest Service began to install
   permanent plots in whitebark pine stands in Washington and Oregon as
   part of a Pacific Northwest restoration strategy to track blister rust
   and mountain pine beetle mortality. Forest Service crews conducted
   surveys on these plots that included standard tree inventory
   measurements and assessments of blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and
   fire activity. During summer 2020/2021, we remeasured 12 of these plots
   located in 3 areas of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (Mission
   Ridge, Clover Springs, and Lake Ann) and 1 area within the Ahtanum State
   Forest (Darland Mountain). On average, 15\% of trees were newly infected
   by blister rust, 5\% of trees died from blister rust, and 12.6\% died
   from all causes combined in the 11-12 years between surveys. Despite
   this, the density of live whitebark pine trees experienced a
   nonsignificant increase due to regeneration, while the density of
   whitebark pine snags increased significantly and the density of
   whitebark pine seedlings decreased significantly. The percentages of
   trees with blister rust infection, seedlings with blister rust
   infection, and live trees with mountain pine beetle damage were
   heterogeneous over space and time. Our results help quantify parameters
   that are central to understanding the population dynamics of whitebark
   pine in the Pacific Northwest and informing management decisions, but
   the findings should be interpreted in light of the limited sample size
   and spatial extent of our data. Regular monitoring of a wider array of
   permanent whitebark pine plots will be critical to management of this
   tree species.},

Title = {Genetic, maternal, and environmental influences on sociality in a

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},

Abstract = {Various aspects of sociality in mammals (e.g., dyadic connectedness) are
   linked with measures of biological fitness (e.g., longevity). How
   within- and between-individual variation in relevant social traits
   arises in uncontrolled wild populations is challenging to determine but
   is crucial for understanding constraints on the evolution of sociality.
   We use an advanced statistical method, known as the `animal model',
   which incorporates pedigree information, to look at social, genetic, and
   environmental influences on sociality in a long-lived wild primate. We
   leverage a longitudinal database spanning 20 years of observation on
   individually recognized white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus
   imitator), with a multi-generational pedigree. We analyze two measures
   of spatial association, using repeat sampling of 376 individuals (mean:
   53.5 months per subject, range: 6-185 months per subject). Conditioned
   on the effects of age, sex, group size, seasonality, and El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation phases, we show low to moderate long-term
   repeatability (across years) of the proportion of time spent social
   (posterior mode {[}95\% Highest Posterior Density interval]: 0.207
   {[}0.169, 0.265]) and of average number of partners (0.144 {[}0.113,

   explained by modest heritability (h(social)(2): 0.152 {[}0.094, 0.207];
   h(partners)(2): 0.113 {[}0.076, 0.149]) with small long-term maternal

   behavioral traits, with much of the variance explained by temporally
   changing factors, such as group of residence, highlighting potential
   limits to the evolvability of our trait due to social and environmental
   constraints.},

Abstract = {The covariance between relatives is a tenet in quantitative genetics,
   but the covariance between nonrelatives in crops has not been studied.
   My objective was to determine if a covariance between nonrelatives is
   present in maize (Zea mays L.). The germplasm comprised 272 maize lines
   that were previously genotyped with 28,626 single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) markers. Pairs of unrelated lines were identified on
   the basis of their membership probabilities in five subpopulations. The
   covariance between nonrelatives was assessed as the regression of
   phenotypic similarity on SNP similarity between unrelated lines. Out of
   77 regressions, seven were significant at a 5\% false discovery rate:
   anthesis and silking dates in unrelated B73 and Oh43 lines; plant height
   and ear height in unrelated Oh43 and PH207 lines; oil in unrelated A321
   and Mo17 lines; starch in unrelated B73 and PH207 lines; and protein in
   unrelated B73 and Mo17 lines. The latter covariance was negative, and
   this negative covariance between nonrelatives was attributed to the
   subpopulations having different linkage phases between the markers and
   underlying causal variants. Overall, the results indicated that a
   covariance between nonrelatives in maize is not ubiquitous but is
   sometimes present for specific traits and for certain groups of
   unrelated individuals. I propose that the covariance between
   nonrelatives and the covariance between relatives be combined into a
   generalized covariance between individuals, thus giving a unified
   framework for expressing the resemblance regardless of the degree of
   relatedness.},

Title = {VARIATION IN THE DIET OF GREATER ROADRUNNERS (GEOCOCCYX CALIFORNIANUS)

Abstract = {Greater roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) are conspicuous and
   well-recognized members of the southwestern fauna. Conventional wisdom
   suggests that roadrunners prey heavily upon vertebrates, particularly
   lizards and snakes, but detailed studies are lacking. We investigated
   roadrunner diet at a site in southern Texas inhabited by four
   state-threatened reptiles to better characterize seasonal variation in
   diet and speculate on the relative impact of these predators on
   state-threatened species. We examined gizzards from 144 greater
   roadrunners collected across four seasons (Summer 1997, Spring 1998,
   Summer 1998, Winter 2002) and enumerated the number of food items for
   each taxa identified. We compared dietary richness, diversity, evenness,
   number of food items, and similarity among the four seasons. We also
   evaluated the relationship between roadrunner body size and diet, and we
   estimated annual consumption rates for each taxa found in the diet.
   Roadrunner diet was rich and highly variable, but 95.9\% of 6,834
   identifiable food items were invertebrates. Overall, grasshoppers and
   beetles dominated all samples. Total number of food items consumed,
   particularly weevils, birds, and fruit, increased during the winter
   sampling period. There was a significant, but weakly predictive, inverse
   relationship between wing chord length and dietary richness. Our
   calculations suggested the average roadrunner would minimally consume
   34,639 prey items per year on this site. Snake consumption was less
   common than the popular perception of greater roadrunners would suggest.
   The consumption of vertebrates seemed to coincide with general abundance
   or when weather patterns decreased abundance of invertebrates.
   Consumption of two state-threatened species (Texas horned lizard
   {[}Phrynosoma cornutum] and Texas indigo snake {[}Drymarchon melanurus])
   occurred, but not at a level to suggest that greater roadrunners
   negatively impacted populations of these species. Thus, the diet of this
   species appears to be driven by availability, and greater roadrunners
   act as exceptional generalist omnivores.},

Abstract = {Biological ageing is connected to life history variation across
   ecological scales and informs a basic understanding of age-related
   declines in organismal function. Altered DNA methylation dynamics are a
   conserved aspect of biological ageing and have recently been modelled to
   predict chronological age among vertebrate species. In addition to their
   utility in estimating individual age, differences between chronological
   and predicted ages arise due to acceleration or deceleration of
   epigenetic ageing, and these discrepancies are linked to disease risk
   and multiple life history traits. Although evidence suggests that
   patterns of DNA methylation can describe ageing in plants, predictions
   with epigenetic clocks have yet to be performed. Here, we resolve the
   DNA methylome across CpG, CHG, and CHH-methylation contexts in the
   loblolly pine tree (Pinus taeda) and construct epigenetic clocks capable
   of predicting ages in this species within 6\% of its maximum lifespan.
   Although patterns of CHH-methylation showed little association with age,
   both CpG and CHG-methylation contexts were strongly associated with
   ageing, largely becoming hypomethylated with age. Among age-associated
   loci were those in close proximity to malate dehydrogenase, NADH
   dehydrogenase, and 18S and 26S ribosomal RNA genes. This study reports
   one of the first epigenetic clocks in plants and demonstrates the
   universality of age-associated DNA methylation dynamics which can inform
   conservation and management practices, as well as our ecological and
   evolutionary understanding of biological ageing in plants.},

Abstract = {Freshwater is a critical resource for human survival but severely
   threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change. These changes
   strongly impact the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities
   which are key players in the functioning of these aquatic ecosystems.
   Although widely documented since the emergence of high-throughput
   sequencing approaches, the information on these natural microbial
   communities is scattered among thousands of publications and it is
   therefore difficult to investigate the temporal dynamics and the spatial
   distribution of microbial taxa within or across ecosystems. To fill this
   gap and in the FAIR principles context we built a manually curated and
   standardized microbial freshwater -omics database (FreshOmics). Based on
   recognized ontologies (ENVO, MIMICS, GO, ISO), FreshOmics describes 29
   different types of freshwater ecosystems and uses standardized
   attributes to depict biological samples, sequencing protocols and
   article attributes for more than 2487 geographical locations across 71
   countries around the world. The database contains 24,808 sequence
   identifiers (i.e., Run\_Id / Exp\_ID, mainly from SRA/DDBJ SRA/ENA, GSA
   and MG-RAST repositories) covering all sequence-based -omics approaches
   used to investigate bacteria, archaea, microbial eukaryotes, and
   viruses. Therefore, FreshOmics allows accurate and comprehensive
   analyses of microbial communities to answer questions related to their
   roles in freshwater ecosystems functioning and resilience, especially
   through meta-analysis studies. This collection also highlights different
   sort of errors in published works (e.g., wrong coordinates, sample type,
   material, spelling).},

Abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of humans caused by
   blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, the only dioecious parasitic
   flatworm. Although aspects of sex determination, differentiation and
   reproduction have been studied in some Schistosoma species, almost
   nothing is known for Schistosoma japonicum, the causative agent of
   schistosomiasis japonica. This mainly reflects the lack of high-quality
   genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species. As current
   genomes for S. japonicum are highly fragmented, we assembled and report
   a chromosome-level reference genome (seven autosomes, the Z-chromosome
   and partial W-chromosome), achieving a substantially enhanced gene
   annotation. Utilizing this genome, we discovered that the sex
   chromosomes of S. japonicum and its congener S. mansoni independently
   suppressed recombination during evolution, forming five and two
   evolutionary strata, respectively. By exploring the W-chromosome and
   sex-specific transcriptomes, we identified 35 W-linked genes and 257
   female-preferentially transcribed genes (FTGs) from our chromosomal
   assembly and uncovered a signature for sex determination and
   differentiation in S. japonicum. These FTGs clustering within autosomes
   or the Z-chromosome exhibit a highly dynamic transcription profile
   during the pairing of female and male schistosomula, thereby
   representing a critical phase for the maturation of the female worms and
   suggesting distinct layers of regulatory control of gene transcription
   at this development stage. Collectively, these data provide a valuable
   resource for further functional genomic characterization of S.
   japonicum, shed light on the evolution of sex chromosomes in this highly
   virulent human blood fluke, and provide a pathway to identify novel
   targets for development of intervention tools against schistosomiasis.},

Abstract = {Although the use and development of molecular biomonitoring tools based
   on environmental nucleic acids (eDNA and eRNA; collectively known as
   eNAs) have gained broad interest for the quantification of biodiversity
   in natural ecosystems, studies investigating the impact of site-specific
   physicochemical parameters on eNA-based detection methods (particularly
   eRNA) remain scarce. Here, we used a controlled laboratory microcosm
   experiment to comparatively assess the environmental degradation of eDNA
   and eRNA across an acid-base gradient following complete removal of the
   progenitor organism (Daphnia pulex). Using water samples collected over
   a 30-day period, eDNA and eRNA copy numbers were quantified using a
   droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome
   c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of D. pulex. We found that eRNA decayed
   more rapidly than eDNA at all pH conditions tested, with
   detectability-predicted by an exponential decay model-for up to 57 h
   (eRNA; neutral pH) and 143 days (eDNA; acidic pH) post organismal
   removal. Decay rates for eDNA were significantly higher in neutral and
   alkaline conditions than in acidic conditions, while decay rates for
   eRNA did not differ significantly among pH levels. Collectively, our
   findings provide the basis for a predictive framework assessing the
   persistence and degradation dynamics of eRNA and eDNA across a range of
   ecologically relevant pH conditions, establish the potential for eRNA to
   be used in spatially and temporally sensitive biomonitoring studies (as
   it is detectable across a range of pH levels), and may be used to inform
   future sampling strategies in aquatic habitats.},

Abstract = {Fishes of the genus Seriola are widely farmed and highly valued in
   global aquaculture production. To further understand their economically
   important traits and help improve aquaculture product quality and
   sustainability, we performed a chromosome-level genome construction for
   Seriola aureovittata. Combining two technologies, PacBio and BGISEQ-500,
   we assembled 649.86 Mb S. aureovittata genome sequences with a contig
   N50 of 22.21 Mb, and 98\% of BUSCO genes were detected in total. The
   initial assembly was then further scaffolded into 24 pseudochromosomes
   using Hi-C data, indicating the high quality of the genome. Genome
   evolution analysis showed that many genes related to fatty acid
   metabolism and oxygen binding, or transport were expanded, which
   provided insights into the metabolic characteristics of fatty acids and
   efficient oxygen transport. Based on the genome data, we confirmed the
   evolutionary relationship of S. aureovittata, S. dorsalis and S. lalandi
   and identified chr12 as the putative sex chromosome of S. aureovittata.
   Our chromosome-level genome assembly provides a genetic foundation for
   the phylogenetic and taxonomic investigation of different Seriola
   species. Moreover, the genome will provide an important genomic resource
   for further biological and aquaculture studies of S. aureovittata.},

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Submerged aquatic macrophytes (SAMs) have been studied extensively in
   lotic ecosystems at low elevations, but few studies have been conducted
   in high-elevation systems, and factors controlling SAM distribution at
   high elevation are not well understood. After anecdotal and published
   documentation of abundant SAMs in high-elevation streams in the Jemez
   Mountains, northern New Mexico, USA, we wanted to determine what
   combination of physical factors are controlling the presence or absence
   of SAMs in the Jemez River watershed. We surveyed several sites on the
   three major river systems in the watershed along a gradient of elevation
   for physical factors, presence-absence, and percent cover of each taxa.
   Our results showed that SAMs were observed in 60\% of surveyed sites
   that were associated with deeper, narrower, lower-velocity streams with
   low gradients. This evidence suggests that SAMs at high elevations are
   subject to similar abiotic controls found for SAM presence at lower
   elevations.},

Title = {Testing assertions of widespread introgressive hybridization in a clade
   of neotropical toads with low mate selectivity (Rhinella granulosa
   species group)},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Discordance between different genomic regions, often identified through
   multilocus sequencing of selected markers, presents particular
   difficulties in identifying historical processes which drive species
   diversity and boundaries. Mechanisms causing discordance, such as
   incomplete lineage sorting or introgression due to interspecific
   hybridization, are better identified based on population-level genomic
   datasets. In the toads of the Rhinella granulosa species group, patterns
   of mito-nuclear discordance and potential hybridization have been
   reported by several studies. However, these patterns were proposed based
   on few loci, such that alternative mechanisms behind gene-tree
   heterogeneity cannot be ruled out. Using genome-wide ddRADseq loci from
   a subset of species within this clade, we found only partial concordance
   between currently recognized species-level taxon boundaries and patterns
   of genetic structure. While most taxa within the R. granulosa group
   correspond to clades, genetic clustering analyses sometimes grouped
   distinct taxonomic units into a single cluster. Moreover, levels of
   admixture between inferred clusters were limited and restricted to a
   single taxon pair which is best explained by incomplete lineage sorting
   as opposed to introgressive hybridization, according to D-statistics
   results. These findings contradict previous assertions of widespread
   cryptic diversity and gene flow within the R. granulosa clade. Lastly,
   our analyses suggest that diversification events within the Rhinella
   granulosa group mostly dated back to the early Pliocene, being generally
   younger than species divergences in other closely related clades that
   present high levels of cross-species gene flow. This finding uniquely
   contradicts common assertions that this young clade of toads exhibits
   interspecific hybridization.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world because
   more than 70\% of the area worldwide has been lost since 1900. Wetland
   plant species rely greatly on water for seeds and propagules, which may
   lead to a downstream unidirectional dispersal and accumulation of
   genetic diversity downstream. However, several species show no support
   for unidirectional genetic diversity, revealing the complexity of
   population dynamics and gene flow in wetlands. Here, we used
   microsatellite loci to address how the past demographic dynamics shaped
   the contemporary spatial pattern in genetic diversity and population
   structure of Cyperus papyrus in wetlands of Southeast Africa. Using
   spatially explicit analysis and coalescent modelling, we found no
   support for unidirectional dispersal. Instead, we found higher genetic
   diversity in populations upstream than downstream in the river basin. We
   also found high admixture among populations, most likely due to
   connections between adjacent river basins during sporadic floods, and
   ongoing gene flow due to bird-mediated seed dispersal. Our results
   suggest stepping-stone migration due to strong isolation-by-distance,
   but not necessarily unidirectional. Moreover, the past demographic
   dynamics in the Holocene shaped the current pattern of genetic diversity
   and structure, leading to higher genetic diversity in populations
   upstream the Zambezi river basin. Our results also point to the very low
   genetic diversity of C. papyrus populations in Southeast Africa and the
   need for management and conservation strategies to guarantee the
   long-term persistence of the species in the region.},

Abstract = {The eco-evolutionary history of penguins is characterised by shifting
   from temperate to cold environments. Breeding in Antarctica, the Emperor
   penguin appears as an extreme outcome of this process, with unique
   features related to insulation, heat production and energy management.
   However, whether this species actually diverged from a less cold-adapted
   ancestor, more ecologically similar to its sister species, the King
   penguin, is still an open question. As the Antarctic colonisation likely
   resulted in vast changes in selective pressure experienced by the
   Emperor penguin, the relative quantification of the genomic signatures
   of selection, unique to each sister species, could answer this question.
   Applying phylogeny-based selection tests on 7651 orthologous genes, we
   identified a more pervasive selection shift in the Emperor penguin than
   in the King penguin, supporting the hypothesis that its extreme cold
   adaptation is a derived state. Furthermore, among candidate genes under
   selection, four (TRPM8, LEPR, CRB1, and SFI1) were identified before in
   other cold-adapted homeotherms, like the woolly Mammoth, while other 161
   genes can be assigned to biological functions relevant to cold
   adaptation identified in previous studies. Location and structural
   effects of TRPM8 substitutions in Emperor and King penguin lineages
   support their functional role with putative divergent effects on thermal
   adaptation. We conclude that extreme cold adaptation in the Emperor
   penguin largely involved unique genetic options which, however, affect
   metabolic and physiological traits common to other cold-adapted
   homeotherms.},

Abstract = {The detection of distribution patterns of genetic diversity of plant and
   animal species has contributed to the understanding of biodiversity and
   evolutionary history of the Atlantic Forest. We used microsatellite
   markers to access the genetic diversity and structure of 26 populations
   and 527 adult individuals of Euterpe edulis, a native palm which is an
   important food resource for fauna and is intensively exploited due to
   economic reasons. We found high genetic diversity and inbreeding in all
   populations analyzed. We report highest rates of inbreeding for this
   species, which could reflect the anthropic impacts of selective cutting,
   fragmentation, and change in foraging behavior from pollinators and less
   availability and mobility of large dispersers. We detected by STRUCTURE,
   two genetic groups, Northern and Southern, which divide the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest geographically. These groups have low genetic
   admixtures, but we found a region of lineage hybridization in the
   contact zone with low recent gene flow. Distribution pattern of this
   species corroborates results from previous studies reporting the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM) have shaped the structuring of the species through
   movements of forests' expansion and contraction. The STRUCTURE analysis
   of each group revealed the presence of genetic subgroups with low rates
   of recurrent gene flow. Southern subgroups have higher rates of
   admixtures than the Northern subgroups, revealing greater historical
   connectivity of forests in this region.},

Abstract = {Coastal urbanization, plastic pollution and climate change are
   increasingly affecting marine turtles' nesting habitats. In addition to
   facing risks of mortality due to saltwater inundation or predation,
   their eggs and hatchlings' might also be affected by plastic debris
   accumulation on beaches, but no studies to date have analysed such
   impact. To analyse whether plastic pollution on nests' surfaces affects
   the embryos' and hatchlings' survival odds, we designed a field
   experiment in a turtle hatchery on a nesting beach of the loggerhead
   turtle (Caretta caretta) in Boa Vista Island (Cabo Verde). We applied
   three treatments with distinct plastic levels (18 nests per treatment):
   control (no added plastics), low density (64 plastic fragments with 24.5
   g of plastic weight per nest) and high density (128 plastic fragments
   with 49.0 g of plastic weight per nest). Then, we tested 16 variables
   related to the incubation period, emergence period and hatchlings'
   fitness. Our results suggest that nests with high plastic density have a
   significantly lower probability of successful emergence. Moreover,
   plastics also affected the synchronized emergence of hatchlings, with
   more scattered and smaller emergent groups, which might increase the
   predation risk. Considering that turtle nesting habitats are becoming
   increasingly threatened, this additional threat might compromise the
   survival of turtle hatchlings on beaches.},

Title = {Diet disparity and diversity predict extinction risk in primates},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-339},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Species vary in their vulnerability to extinction according to their
   biology, ecology, environmental factors and threats to which they are
   exposed. Diet is an important ecological trait that affects many aspects
   of a species' biology, including its vulnerability to extinction.
   Despite the importance of diet as a species' trait, its influence on
   extinction risk has only been studied in a coarse way, in part due to a
   lack of detailed diet data covering a large breadth of species or
   geographic areas. We examined the association between diet and
   extinction risk in primates, using a high-resolution dataset covering
   all major primate lineages and habitats on a global scale. The
   resolution of the dataset allowed us to calculate multiple biologically
   informative metrics for diet composition and diversity, allowing us to
   tease apart what aspects of diet were most important for predicting the
   risk of extinction, whilst accounting for phylogeny, body mass and
   geographic range size. Our results showed that both diet disparity and
   diet diversity predict primate extinction risk, showing that primates
   that are able to consume more types of items, and items that are more
   disparate from one another, are less prone to extinction. Furthermore,
   we found that although closely related species tend to have similar
   dietary diversity and disparity, these metrics vary widely amongst
   primate families. Primates with a high diet diversity and disparity may
   be able to cope better with fluctuations in food availability than
   species with homogeneous diet items, through a portfolio effect.
   Understanding the degree of dietary specialization of the species may
   help guide new studies relating to extinction risk and threats and be
   useful in future species assessments.},

Title = {Squirrel and tree-shrew responses along an urbanisation gradient in a

   Callosciurus squirrels, and effects of habitat quality},

Abstract = {Urbanisation is rapidly transforming terrestrial environments,
   especially in the tropics. Many squirrel species tolerate urbanisation,
   but studies are biased towards temperate regions. We quantify the
   distribution and abundance of squirrels and (ecologically similar)
   tree-shrews along an urbanisation gradient in a rapidly urbanising
   tropical mega-city (Bangkok, Thailand) located within the Indo-Burma
   biodiversity hotspot. We used repeated point counts in 150 1 km cells,
   selected using random stratification across the urbanisation gradient.
   We quantified species responses to (i) urbanisation intensity (measured
   using impervious surface cover), (ii) environmental conditions (woodland
   quantity and quality, human disturbance and predation pressure from
   free-ranging cats and dogs) and (iii) urbanisation impacts on
   hybridisation between congeneric Callosciurus squirrels. Three of the
   six species from the regional species pool were extremely rare or absent
   within our study region (Tamiops macclellandi, Callosciurus caniceps and
   Menetes berdmorei). Of the three more widespread species (Tupaia
   belangeri, Callosciurus finlaysonii and Callosciurus erythraeus) only C.
   finlaysonii had a higher abundance in more urban locations. The
   increasing intensity of urbanisation has thus markedly reduced squirrel
   diversity and abundance, contrasting with the perception from temperate
   regions that squirrels typically tolerate urbanisation. Urbanisation is
   thus likely to have reduced important ecological functions provided by
   squirrels, such as seed dispersal. Models of species responses to
   environmental conditions suggest that improving habitat quality by
   increasing tree cover and diversity at local and landscape scales and
   reducing human disturbance and numbers of feral dogs would partially
   mitigating adverse impacts of urbanisation on tropical squirrels and
   tree-shrews. Urban infrastructure (bridge construction across the
   Chao-Praya River) appears to have increased the permeability of a
   geographic barrier that previously separated C. finlaysonii and C.
   erythraeus distributions, increasing hybridisation rates. Our study
   enhances understanding of the ecological impacts of urbanisation in
   biodiverse tropical regions and the action required to mitigate these
   impacts.},

Abstract = {The concentration of nine heavy metals in Oreochromis niloticus
   inhabiting Agodi reservoir, Nigeria, was investigated. Samples were
   collected at the inlet, centre and outlet of the reservoir. The
   concentration of the metals was determined with Atomic Absorption
   Spectrophotometer. Ecological Risk Quotient (ERQ) was used to
   numerically quantify the ecological risks associated with the mineral,
   while Box Plot was used to evaluate the tolerance of the fish to heavy
   metals. The ERQ, which was in the order of Mn > Fe > Zn > Cu > Cd > Pb >
   Cr > Co > Ni, showed that Ni, Co, Cr and Pb had values of less than one,
   implying that they did not constitute an ecological threat to the
   environment, while Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu and Cd were of ecological risk.
   Results revealed that the concentration of Cd, Co and Ni exceeded the
   bio-tolerance of the fish at the inlet, while Cd, Pb, Cu and Ni were
   beyond the tolerability of the fish at the centre. Similarly, the
   concentration of Co, Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Ni was above the tolerance limit
   of the fish. This showed that Fe and Mn were within the tolerance range
   of the fish and that the tolerability of the fish in relation to the
   location was inlet < Centre < Outlet.},

Abstract = {Whole-genome alignment allows researchers to understand the genomic
   structure and variation among genomes. Approaches based on direct
   pairwise comparisons of DNA sequences require large computational
   capacities. As a consequence, pipelines combining tools for orthologous
   gene identification and synteny have been developed. In this manuscript,
   we present the latest functionalities implemented in NGSEP 4, to
   identify orthogroups and perform whole genome alignments. NGSEP
   implements functionalities for identification of clusters of homologus
   genes, synteny analysis and whole genome alignment. Our results showed
   that the NGSEP algorithm for orthogroups identification has competitive
   accuracy and efficiency in comparison to commonly used tools. The
   implementation also includes a visualization of the whole genome
   alignment based on synteny of the orthogroups that were identified, and
   a reconstruction of the pangenome based on frequencies of the
   orthogroups among the genomes. NGSEP 4 also includes a new graphical
   user interface based on the JavaFX technology. We expect that these new
   developments will be very useful for several studies in evolutionary
   biology and population genomics.},

Abstract = {DNA barcoding and metabarcoding are revolutionizing the study and survey
   of biodiversity. In order to assign taxonomic labels to the DNA sequence
   data retrieved, these methods are strongly dependent on comprehensive
   and accurate reference databases. Producing reliable databases linking
   biological sequences and taxonomic data can be-and often has been-done
   using mainstream tools such as spreadsheet software. However,
   spreadsheets quickly become insufficient when the amount of data
   increases to thousands of taxa and sequences to be matched, and
   validation operations become more complex and are error prone if done in
   a manual way. Thus, there is a clear need for providing scientists with
   user-friendly, reliable and powerful tools to manipulate and manage DNA
   reference databases in tractable, sound and efficient ways. Here, we
   introduce the R package refdb as an environment for semi-automatic and
   assisted construction of DNA reference libraries. The refdb package is a
   reference database manager offering a set of powerful functions to
   import, organize, clean, filter, audit and export the data. It is
   broadly applicable in metabarcoding data generally obtained in
   biodiversity and biomonitoring studies. We present the main features of
   the package and outline how refdb can speed up reference database
   generation, management and handling, and thus contribute to
   standardization and repeatability in barcoding and metabarcoding
   studies.},

Abstract = {The analysis of target enrichment data in phylogenetics lacks
   optimization toward using paralogues for phylogenetic reconstruction. We
   developed a novel approach of detecting paralogues and utilizing them
   for phylogenetic tree inference, by retrieving both ortho- and
   paralogous copies and creating orthologous alignments, from which the
   gene trees are built. We implemented this approach in ParalogWizard and
   demonstrate its performance in plant groups that underwent a whole
   genome duplication relatively recently: the subtribe Malinae (family
   Rosaceae), using Angiosperms353 as well as Malinae481 probes, the genus
   Oritrophium (family Asteraceae), using Compositae1061 probes, and the
   genus Amomum (family Zingiberaceae), using Zingiberaceae1180 probes.
   Discriminating between orthologues and paralogues reduced gene tree
   discordance and increased the species tree support in the case of the
   Malinae, but not for Oritrophium and Amomum. This may relate to the
   difference in the proportion of paralogous loci between the data sets,
   which was highest for the Malinae. Overall, retrieving paralogues for
   phylogenetic reconstruction following ParalogWizard has the potential to
   increase the species tree support and reduce gene tree discordance in
   target enrichment data, particularly if the proportion of paralogous
   loci is high.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling uses genetic material in the
   environment to infer species presence sight-unseen. The method has
   rapidly become a powerful tool for monitoring biodiversity. However,
   biological diversity, as per the Convention on Biological Diversity
   definition of ``diversity within species, between species and of
   ecosystems{''} is more inclusive than most eDNA studies cover: The vast
   majority focus only on between-species and ecosystem-level biodiversity.
   However, a tantalizing prospect, as illustrated by Farrell et al. (2022)
   in this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, is that we might also be
   able to unlock information about individual and population-level
   diversity via population genomic analysis of these environmental
   samples. Farrell et al. (2022) found that targeted samples of beach sand
   contained genetic material not just informative about sea turtle
   presence, but also indicated the presence of pathogens and genome-wide
   mitochondrial and nuclear sequences that could accurately infer
   individual turtle source population. Moving from proof-of-concept to
   robust, population genomic inference will require a growth of genomic
   resources for nonmodel organisms and careful study design
   considerations, some of which have already been pioneered by related
   fields.},

Title = {Estimating contemporary migration numbers of adults based on kinship

Abstract = {This paper describes the development of estimators for the contemporary
   migration number and rate of adults between two populations in
   iteroparous species. The proposed estimators are based on known
   half-sibling (HS) and/or parent-offspring (PO) relationships observed
   between populations across breeding seasons. The rationale is that HS
   and PO pairs exhibit information about the occurrence frequency of
   parental movements during the breeding interval. The proposed method
   allows for variance in the average number of offspring per parent within
   and between populations. In addition, coupled with the PO pairs found
   within the population, the estimators can be obtained using only genetic
   data. Generally, a sample size representing the square root of the
   population size is required to obtain meaningful migration information.
   We describe a detailed evaluation of the performance of the proposed
   estimators by running an individual-based model, and the results provide
   guidance regarding sample sizes to ensure the required accuracy and
   precision. In addition, given that there are few effective methods to
   estimate adult movement (especially when populations cannot be
   genetically distinct), we discuss the usefulness of the proposed kinship
   assignment method in terms of conservation biology and wildlife
   management.},

Abstract = {Genealogical relationships are fundamental components of genetic
   studies. However, it is often challenging to infer correct and complete
   pedigrees even when genome-wide information is available. For example,
   inbreeding can obscure genetic differences between individuals, making
   it difficult to even distinguish first-degree relatives such as
   parent-offspring from full siblings. Similarly, genotyping errors can
   interfere with the detection of genetic similarity between parents and
   their offspring. Inbreeding is common in natural, domesticated, and
   experimental populations and genotyping of these populations often has
   more errors than in human data sets, so efficient methods for building
   pedigrees under these conditions are necessary. Here, we present a new
   method for parent-offspring inference in inbred pedigrees called
   specific parent-offspring relationship estimation (spore). spore is
   vastly superior to existing pedigree-inference methods at detecting
   parent-offspring relationships, in particular when inbreeding is high or
   in the presence of genotyping errors, or both. spore therefore fills an
   important void in the arsenal of pedigree inference tools.},

Abstract = {Nucleic acids released by organisms and isolated from environmental
   substrates are increasingly being used for molecular biomonitoring.
   While environmental DNA (eDNA) has received much attention, the
   potential of environmental RNA as a biomonitoring tool remains
   under-explored. Several recent studies using paired DNA and RNA
   metabarcoding of bulk samples suggest that RNA might better reflect
   ``metabolically active{''} parts of the community. However, such studies
   mainly capture organismal eDNA and eRNA. For larger eukaryotes,
   isolation of extra-organismal RNA will be important, but viability needs
   to be examined in a field-based setting. In this study we evaluate (a)
   whether extra-organismal eRNA release from macroeukaryotes can be
   detected given its supposedly rapid degradation, and (b) if the same
   field collection methods for eDNA can be applied to eRNA. We collected
   eDNA and eRNA from water in lakes where fish community composition is
   well documented, enabling a comparison between the two nucleic acids in
   two different seasons with monitoring using conventional methods. We
   found that eRNA is released from macroeukaryotes and can be filtered
   from water and metabarcoded in a similar manner as eDNA to reliably
   provide species composition information. eRNA had a small but
   significantly greater true positive rate than eDNA, indicating that it
   correctly detects more species known to exist in the lakes. Given
   relatively small differences between the two molecules in describing
   fish community composition, we conclude that if eRNA provides
   significant advantages in terms of lability, it is a strong candidate to
   add to the suite of molecular monitoring tools.},

Title = {RNA allows identifying the consumption of carrion prey},

Abstract = {Facultative scavenging by predatory carnivores is a prevalent but
   frequently underestimated feeding strategy. DNA-based methods for diet
   analysis, however, do not allow to distinguish between scavenging and
   predation, thus, the significance of scavenging on population dynamics
   and resource partitioning is widely unknown. Here, we present a
   methodological innovation to differentiate between scavenging and fresh
   prey consumption using prey RNA as a target molecule. We hypothesized
   that the rapid post-mortem breakdown of RNA in prey tissue should lead
   to a significantly lower detection probability of prey RNA than DNA when
   carrion rather than fresh prey is consumed. To test this hypothesis,
   ground beetles (Pseudoophonus rufipes {[}De Geer]) were offered either
   fresh or 1-day-old dead Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies (carrion).
   The detectability of prey RNA and DNA in the beetles' regurgitates was
   assessed with diagnostic Drosophila-specific RT-PCR and PCR assays at 0,
   6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-feeding. After fresh fly consumption, prey RNA
   and DNA were detectable equally well at all times. When carrion prey was
   consumed, the detection strength of prey RNA immediately after feeding
   was significantly lower than that of prey DNA and reached zero in most
   samples within 6 h of digestion. Our findings provide evidence that prey
   RNA allows distinguishing between the consumption of fresh and scavenged
   prey, thereby overcoming a long-known weakness of molecular diet
   analysis. The assessment of prey RNA offers a generally applicable
   approach for examining the importance of scavenging in food webs to
   unravel its functional consequences for populations, communities, and
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Growth rate estimation is important to understand the flow of energy and
   nutrient elements in an ecosystem, but it has remained challenging,
   especially on microscopic organisms. In this study, we propose four
   growth rate indices that use mRNA abundance ratios between nuclear and
   mitochondrial genes: (1) total nuclear and mitochondrial mRNA ratio
   (Nuc:Mito-TmRNA); (2) nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal protein mRNA
   ratio (Nuc:Mito-RPmRNA); (3) gene ontology (GO) terms and total
   mitochondrial mRNA ratios; and (4) nuclear and mitochondrial specific
   gene mRNA ratio. We examine these proposed ratios using RNA-Seq datasets
   of Daphnia magna, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae retrieved from the NCBI
   Short Read Archive. The results showed that both Nuc:Mito-TmRNA and
   Nuc:Mito-RPmRNA ratio indices showed significant correlations with the
   growth rate for both species. A large number of GO terms mRNA ratios
   showed significant correlations with the growth rate of S. cerevisiae.
   Lastly, we identified mRNA ratios of several specific nuclear and
   mitochondrial gene pairs that showed significant correlations. We
   foresee future implications for the proposed mRNA ratios used in
   metatranscriptome analyses to estimate the growth rate of communities
   and species.},

Abstract = {Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has been widely used in quantifying
   bacterial and fungal populations in various ecosystems, as well as the
   fungi to bacteria ratio (F:B ratio). Recently, researchers have begun to
   apply droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to this area; however, no study has
   systematically compared qPCR and ddPCR for quantitating both bacteria
   and fungi in environmental samples at the same time. Here, we designed
   probe-primer pair combinations targeting the 16S rRNA gene and internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) for the detection of bacteria and fungi,
   respectively, and tested both SYBR Green and TaqMan approaches in qPCR
   and ddPCR methods for mock communities and in real environmental
   samples. In mock communities, the quantification results of ddPCR were
   significantly closer to expected values (p < .05), and had smaller
   coefficients of variations (p < .05) than qPCR, suggesting ddPCR was
   more accurate and repeatable. In environmental samples, ddPCR
   consistently quantified ITS and 16S rRNA gene concentrations in all four
   habitats without abnormal overestimation or underestimation, and the F:B
   ratio obtained by ddPCR was consistent with phospholipid fatty acid
   analysis. Our results indicated that ddPCR had better precision,
   repeatability, sensitivity, and stability in bacterial and fungal
   quantitation than qPCR. Although ddPCR has high cost, complicated
   processes and restricted detection range, it shows insensitivity to PCR
   inhibitors and the potential of quantifying long target fragments. We
   expect that ddPCR, which is complementary to qPCR, will contribute to
   microbial quantification in environmental monitoring and evaluation.},

Abstract = {Islands, and the particular organisms that populate them, have long
   fascinated biologists. Due to their isolation, islands offer unique
   opportunities to study the effect of neutral and adaptive mechanisms in
   determining genomic and phenotypical divergence. In the Canary Islands,
   an archipelago rich in endemics, the barn owl (Tyto alba), present in
   all the islands, is thought to have diverged into a subspecies (T. a.
   gracilirostris) on the eastern ones, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Taking
   advantage of 40 whole-genomes and modern population genomics tools, we
   provide the first look at the origin and genetic makeup of barn owls of
   this archipelago. We show that the Canaries hold diverse, long-standing
   and monophyletic populations with a neat distinction of gene pools from
   the different islands. Using a new method, less sensitive to structure
   than classical F-ST, to detect regions involved in local adaptation to
   insular environments, we identified a haplotype-like region likely under
   selection in all Canaries individuals and genes in this region suggest
   morphological adaptations to insularity. In the eastern islands, where
   the subspecies is present, genomic traces of selection pinpoint signs of
   adapted body proportions and blood pressure, consistent with the smaller
   size of this population living in a hot arid climate. In turn, genomic
   regions under selection in the western barn owls from Tenerife showed an
   enrichment in genes linked to hypoxia, a potential response to
   inhabiting a small island with a marked altitudinal gradient. Our
   results illustrate the interplay of neutral and adaptive forces in
   shaping divergence and early onset speciation.},

Abstract = {The sex ratio is a key ecological demographic parameter crucial for
   population viability. However, the epigenetic mechanisms operating
   during gonadal development regulating gene expression and the sex ratio
   remain poorly understood. Moreover, there is interest in the development
   of epigenetic markers associated with a particular phenotype or as
   sentinels of environmental effects. Here, we profiled DNA methylation
   and gene expression of 10 key genes related to sex development and
   stress, including steroidogenic enzymes, and growth and transcription
   factors. We provide novel information on the sex-related differences and
   on the influence of elevated temperature on these genes in zebrafish, a
   species with mixed genetic and environmental influences on sex ratios.
   We identified both positive (e.g., amh, cyp11c and hsd11b2) and negative
   (e.g., cyp11a1 and dmrt1) correlations in unexposed males, and negative
   correlation (amh) in exposed females between DNA methylation and gene
   expression levels. Further, we combined DNA methylation analysis with
   machine learning procedures and found a series of informative CpGs
   capable not only of correctly identifying sex (based on cyp19a1a DNA
   methylation levels) but also of identifying whether males and females
   had been exposed to abnormally elevated temperature when young (based on
   amh and foxl2a DNA methylation levels, respectively). This was achieved
   in the absence of conspicuous morphological alterations of the gonads.
   These DNA methylation-based epigenetic biomarkers represent molecular
   resources that can correctly recapitulate past thermal history and pave
   the way for similar findings in other species to assess potential
   ecological effects of environmental disturbances in the context of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is widely used to determine wild animal diets, but
   whether this technique provides accurate, quantitative measurements is
   still under debate. To test our ability to accurately estimate the
   abundance of dietary items using metabarcoding, we fed wild-caught
   desert woodrats (Neotoma lepida) diets consisting of constant amounts of
   juniper (Juniperus osteosperma, 15\%) and varying amounts of creosote
   (Larrea tridentata, 1\%-60\%), cactus (Opuntia sp., 0\%-100\%) and
   commercial chow (0\%-85\%). Using metabarcoding, we compared the
   representation of items in the original diet samples to that in the
   faecal samples to test the sensitivity and accuracy of diet
   metabarcoding, the performance of different bioinformatic pipelines and
   our ability to correct sequence counts. Metabarcoding, using standard
   trnL primers, detected creosote, juniper and chow. Different pipelines
   for assigning taxonomy performed similarly. While creosote was
   detectable at dietary proportions as low as 1\%, we failed to detect
   cactus in most samples, probably due to a primer mismatch. Creosote read
   counts increased as its proportion in the diet increased, and we could
   differentiate when creosote was a minor and major component of the diet.
   However, we found that estimates of juniper and creosote varied. Using
   previously suggested methods to correct these errors did not improve
   accuracy estimates of creosote, but did reduce error for juniper and
   chow. Our results indicate that metabarcoding can provide quantitative
   information on dietary composition, but may be limited. We suggest that
   researchers use caution when quantitatively interpreting diet
   metabarcoding results unless they first experimentally determine the
   extent of possible biases.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been used in a variety of ecological
   studies and management applications. The rate at which eDNA decays has
   been widely studied but at present it is difficult to disentangle
   study-specific effects from factors that universally affect eDNA
   degradation. To address this, a systematic review and meta-analysis was
   conducted on aquatic eDNA studies. Analysis revealed eDNA decayed faster
   at higher temperatures and in marine environments (as opposed to
   freshwater). DNA type (mitochondrial or nuclear) and fragment length did
   not affect eDNA decay rate, although a preference for <200 bp sequences
   in the available literature means this relationship was not assessed
   with longer sequences (e.g. >800 bp). At present, factors such as
   ultraviolet light, pH, and microbial load lacked sufficient studies to
   feature in the meta-analysis. Moving forward, we advocate researching
   these factors to further refine our understanding of eDNA decay in
   aquatic environments.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing,
   obtaining high-quality genomic data on non-model organisms without
   proximate well-assembled and annotated genomes remains challenging.
   Here, we describe a workflow that takes advantage of distant genomic
   resources and ingroup transcriptomes to select and jointly enrich long
   open reading frames (ORFs) and ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from
   genomic samples for integrative studies of microevolutionary and
   macroevolutionary dynamics. This workflow is applied to samples of the
   African unionid bivalve tribe Coelaturini (Parreysiinae) at basin and
   continent-wide scales. Our results indicate that ORFs are efficiently
   captured without prior identification of intron-exon boundaries. The
   enrichment of UCEs was less successful, but nevertheless produced
   substantial data sets. Exploratory continent-wide phylogenetic analyses
   with ORF supercontigs (>515,000 parsimony informative sites) resulted in
   a fully resolved phylogeny, the backbone of which was also retrieved
   with UCEs (>11,000 informative sites). Variant calling on ORFs and UCEs
   of Coelaturini from the Malawi Basin produced similar to 2000 SNPs per
   population pair. Estimates of nucleotide diversity and population
   differentiation were similar for ORFs and UCEs. They were low compared
   to previous estimates in molluscs, but comparable to those in recently
   diversifying Malawi cichlids and other taxa at an early stage of
   speciation. Skimming off-target sequence data from the same enriched
   libraries of Coelaturini from the Malawi Basin, we reconstructed the
   maternally-inherited mitogenome, which displays the gene order inferred
   for the most recent common ancestor of Unionidae. Overall, our workflow
   and results provide exciting perspectives for integrative genomic
   studies of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary dynamics in non-model
   organisms.},

Abstract = {Konopinski (2022) suggests that when averaging nucleotide diversity over
   a sequence, ignoring per-site sample size variation (i.e., using an
   unweighted mean) offers an improvement in precision (lower variation)
   and accuracy (reduced bias). Here, I argue that preserving uncertainty
   due to variation in sample size is in line with best statistical
   practices, and that the increase in accuracy observed is not a general
   feature of the unweighted mean proposed by Konopinski (2022). As such, I
   conclude that the use of a weighted mean, as employed by (Korunes \&
   Samuk, 2020), remains the preferred method for averaging nucleotide
   diversity over multiple sites.},

Abstract = {Metatranscriptomics allows profiling of community mRNA and rRNA
   transcript abundance under certain environmental conditions. However,
   variations in the proportion of RNA transcripts across different
   community size structures remain less explained, thus limiting the
   possible applications of metatranscriptomics in community studies. Here,
   we extended the assumptions of the growth-rate hypothesis (GRH) and the
   metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to validate the allometric scaling of
   interspecific RNA transcript (mRNA and rRNA) abundance through
   metatranscriptomic analysis of mock communities consisting of model
   organisms. The results suggest that body size imposes significant
   constraints on RNA transcript abundance. Interestingly, the relationship
   between the total mitochondrial transcript abundance (mRNA and rRNA
   slopes were -0.30 and -0.28, respectively) and body size aligned with
   the MTE assumptions with slopes close to -1/4, while the nuclear
   transcripts displayed much steeper slopes (mRNA and rRNA slopes were
   -0.33 and -0.40, respectively). The assumed temperature dependence was
   not observed in this study. At the gene level, the allometric slopes
   range from 0 to -1. Overall, the above results showed that larger
   individuals have lesser RNA transcript abundance per tissue mass than
   smaller ones regardless of temperature. Analyses of field-collected
   microcrustacean zooplankton samples demonstrated that the correction of
   size effect, using the allometric exponents derived from the model
   organism mock community, explains better the patterns of interspecific
   RNA transcripts abundance within the metatranscriptome. Integrating
   allometry with metatranscriptomics can extend the use of RNA transcript
   reads in estimating ecological processes within complex communities.},

Abstract = {In this study, we used the phenotype simulation package naturalgwas to
   test the performance of Zhao's Random Forest method in comparison to an
   uncorrected Random Forest test, latent factor mixed models (LFMM),
   genome-wide efficient mixed models (GEMMA), and confounder adjusted
   linear regression (CATE). We created 400 sets of phenotypes,
   corresponding to five effect sizes and two, five, 15, or 30 causal loci,
   simulated from two empirical data sets containing SNPs from Striped Bass
   representing three and 13 populations. All association methods were
   evaluated for their ability to detect genotype-phenotype associations
   based on power, false discovery rates, and number of false positives.
   Genomic inflation was highest for uncorrected Random Forest and LFMM
   tests and lowest for Gemma and Zhao's Random Forest. All association
   tests had similar power to detect causal loci, and Zhao's Random Forest
   had the lowest false discovery rate in all scenarios. To measure the
   performance of association tests in small data sets with few loci
   surrounding a causal gene we also ran analyses again after removing
   causal loci from each data set. All association tests were only able to
   find true positives, defined as loci located within 30 kbp of a causal
   locus, in 3\%-18\% of simulations. In contrast, at least one false
   positive was found in 17\%-44\% of simulations. Zhao's Random Forest
   again identified the fewest false positives of all association tests
   studied. The ability to test the power of association tests for
   individual empirical data sets can be an extremely useful first step
   when designing a GWAS study.},

Title = {Comparison of destructive and nondestructive DNA extraction methods for
   the metabarcoding of arthropod bulk samples},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is routinely used for biodiversity assessment, in
   particular targeting highly diverse groups for which limited taxonomic
   expertise is available. Various protocols are currently in use, although
   standardization is key to its application in large-scale monitoring. DNA
   metabarcoding of arthropod bulk samples can be conducted either
   destructively from sample tissue, or nondestructively from sample
   fixative or lysis buffer. Nondestructive methods are highly desirable
   for the preservation of sample integrity but have yet to be
   experimentally evaluated in detail. Here, we compare diversity estimates
   from 14 size-sorted Malaise trap samples processed consecutively with
   three nondestructive approaches (one using fixative ethanol and two
   using lysis buffers) and one destructive approach (using homogenized
   tissue). Extraction from commercial lysis buffer yielded comparable
   species richness and high overlap in species composition to the ground
   tissue extracts. A significantly divergent community was detected from
   preservative ethanol-based DNA extraction. No consistent trend in
   species richness was found with increasing incubation time in lysis
   buffer. These results indicate that nondestructive DNA extraction from
   incubation in lysis buffer could provide a comparable alternative to
   destructive approaches with the added advantage of preserving the
   specimens for postmetabarcoding taxonomic work but at a higher cost per
   sample.},

Title = {The complete and closed genome of the facultative generalist Candidatus
   Endoriftia persephone from deep-sea hydrothermal vents},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The mutualistic interactions between Riftia pachyptila and its
   endosymbiont Candidatus Endoriftia persephone (short Endoriftia) have
   been extensively researched. However, the closed Endoriftia genome is
   still lacking. Here, by employing single-molecule real-time sequencing
   we present the closed chromosomal sequence of Endoriftia. In contrast to
   theoretical predictions of enlarged and mobile genetic element-rich
   genomes related to facultative endosymbionts, the closed Endoriftia
   genome is streamlined with fewer than expected coding sequence regions,
   insertion-, prophage-sequences and transposase-coding sequences.
   Automated and manually curated functional analyses indicated that
   Endoriftia is more versatile regarding sulphur metabolism than
   previously reported. We identified the presence of two identical rRNA
   operons and two long CRISPR regions in the closed genome. Additionally,
   pangenome analyses revealed the presence of three types of secretion
   systems (II, IV and VI) in the different Endoriftia populations
   indicating lineage-specific adaptations. The in depth mobilome
   characterization identified the presence of shared genomic islands in
   the different Endoriftia drafts and in the closed genome, suggesting
   that the acquisition of foreign DNA predates the geographical dispersal
   of the different endosymbiont populations. Finally, we found no evidence
   of epigenetic regulation in Endoriftia, as revealed by gene screenings
   and absence of methylated modified base motifs in the genome. As a
   matter of fact, the restriction-modification system seems to be
   dysfunctional in Endoriftia, pointing to a higher importance of
   molecular memory-based immunity against phages via spacer incorporation
   into CRISPR system. The Endoriftia genome is the first closed tubeworm
   endosymbiont to date and will be valuable for future gene oriented and
   evolutionary comparative studies.},

Title = {Genomic insights into evolution and control of Wohlfahrtia magnifica, a
   widely distributed myiasis-causing fly of warm-blooded vertebrates},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Wohlfahrtia magnifica is a pest fly species, invading livestock in many
   European, African and Asian countries, and causing heavy agroeconomic
   losses. In the life cycle of this obligatory parasite, adult flies
   infect the host by depositing the first-stage larvae into body cavities
   or open wounds. The feeding larvae cause severe (skin) tissue damage and
   potentially fatal infections if untreated. Despite serious health
   detriments and agroeconomic concerns, genomic resources for
   understanding the biology of W. magnifica have so far been lacking.
   Here, we present a complete genome assembly from a single adult female
   W. magnifica using a Low-DNA Input workflow for PacBio HiFi library
   preparation. The de novo assembled genome is 753.99 Mb in length, with a
   scaffold N50 of 5.00 Mb, consisting of 16,718 predicted protein-encoding
   genes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that W. magnifica has the
   closest phylogenetic relationship to Sarcophaga bullata followed by
   Lucilia cuprina. Evolutionary analysis of gene families showed
   expansions of 173 gene families in W. magnifica that were enriched for
   gene ontology (GO) categories related to immunity,
   insecticide-resistance mechanisms, heat stress response and cuticle
   development. In addition, 45 positively selected genes displaying
   various functions were identified. This new genomic resource contributes
   to the evolutionary and comparative analysis of dipterous flies and an
   in-depth understanding of many aspects of W. magnifica biology.
   Furthermore, it will facilitate the development of novel tools for
   controlling W. magnifica infection in livestock.},

Title = {Comparing genome-based estimates of relatedness for use in
   pedigree-based conservation management},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 27},
Abstract = {Researchers have long debated which estimator of relatedness best
   captures the degree of relationship between two individuals. In the
   genomics era, this debate continues, with relatedness estimates being
   sensitive to the methods used to generate markers, marker quality, and
   levels of diversity in sampled individuals. Here, we compare six
   commonly used genome-based relatedness estimators (kinship genetic
   distance {[}KGD], Wang maximum likelihood {[}TrioML], Queller and
   Goodnight {[}R-xy], Kinship INference for Genome-wide association
   studies {[}KING-robust), and pairwise relatedness {[}R-AB],
   allele-sharing coancestry {[}AS]) across five species bred in
   captivity-including three birds and two mammals-with varying degrees of
   reliable pedigree data, using reduced-representation and whole genome
   resequencing data. Genome-based relatedness estimates varied widely
   across estimators, sequencing methods, and species, yet the most
   consistent results for known first order relationships were found using
   R-xy, R-AB, and AS. However, AS was found to be less consistently
   correlated with known pedigree relatedness than either R-xy or R-AB. Our
   combined results indicate there is not a single genome-based estimator
   that is ideal across different species and data types. To determine the
   most appropriate genome-based relatedness estimator for each new data
   set, we recommend assessing the relative: (1) correlation of candidate
   estimators with known relationships in the pedigree and (2) precision of
   candidate estimators with known first-order relationships. These
   recommendations are broadly applicable to conservation breeding
   programmes, particularly where genome-based estimates of relatedness can
   complement and complete poorly pedigreed populations. Given a growing
   interest in the application of wild pedigrees, our results are also
   applicable to in situ wildlife management.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary direction of gonochorism and hermaphroditism is an
   intriguing mystery to be solved. The special transient hermaphroditic
   stage makes the little yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) an
   appealing model for studying hermaphrodite formation. However, the
   origin and evolutionary relationship between of L. polyactis and
   Larimichthys crocea, the most famous commercial fish species in East
   Asia, remain unclear. Here, we report the sequence of the L. polyactis
   genome, which we found is similar to 706Mb long (contig N50 = 1.21 Mb
   and scaffold N50 = 4.52Mb) and contains 25,233 protein-coding genes.
   Phylogenomic analysis suggested that L. polyactis diverged from the
   common ancestor, L. crocea, approximately 25.4 million years ago. Our
   high-quality genome assembly enabled comparative genomic analysis, which
   revealed several within-chromosome rearrangements and translocations,
   without major chromosome fission or fusion events between the two
   species. The dmrt1 gene was identified as the male-specific gene in L.
   polyactis. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of dmrt1
   and its upstream regulatory gene (rnf183) were both sexually dimorphic.
   Rnf183, unlike its two paralogues rnf223 and rnf225, is only present in
   Larimichthys and Lates but not in other teleost species, suggesting that
   it originated from lineage-specific duplication or was lost in other
   teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the hermaphrodite stage in
   male L. polyactis may be explained by the sequence evolution of dmrtl.
   Decoding the L. polyactis genome not only provides insight into the
   genetic underpinnings of hermaphrodite evolution, but also provides
   valuable information for enhancing fish aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Quantifying species trophic interaction strengths is crucial for
   understanding community dynamics and has significant implications for
   pest management and species conservation. DNA-based methods to identify
   species interactions have revolutionized these efforts, but a
   significant limitation is the poor ability to quantify the strength of
   trophic interactions, that is the biomass or number of prey consumed. We
   present an improved pipeline, called Lazaro, to map unassembled shotgun
   reads to a comprehensive arthropod mitogenome database and show that the
   number of prey reads detected is quantitatively predicted from the prey
   biomass consumed, even for indirect predation. Two feeding bioassays
   were performed: starved coccinellid larvae consuming different numbers
   of aphids (Prey Quantity bioassay), and starved coccinellid larvae
   consuming a chrysopid larvae that had consumed aphids (Direct and
   Indirect Predation bioassay). Prey taxonomic assignment against a
   mitochondrial genome database had high accuracy (99.8\% positive
   predictive value) and the number of prey reads was directly related to
   the number of prey consumed and inversely related to the elapsed time
   since consumption with high significance (r(2) = .932, p = 4.92E-6).
   Aphids were detected up to 6 h after direct predation plus 3 h after
   indirect predation (9 h in total) and detection was related to the
   predator-specific decay rates. Lazaro enabled quantitative predictions
   of prey consumption across multiple trophic levels with high taxonomic
   resolution while eliminating all false positives, except for a few
   confirmed contaminants, and may be valuable for characterizing prey
   consumed by field-sampled predators. Moreover, Lazaro is readily
   applicable for species diversity determination from any degraded
   environmental DNA.},

Abstract = {Inulin is an important reserve polysaccharide in Asteraceae plants, and
   is also widely used as a sweetener, a source of dietary fibre and
   prebiotic. Nevertheless, a lack of genomic resources for
   inulin-producing plants has hindered extensive studies on inulin
   metabolism and regulation. Here, we present chromosome-level reference
   genomes for four inulin-producing plants: chicory (Cichorium intybus),
   endive (Cichorium endivia), great burdock (Arctium lappa) and yacon
   (Smallanthus sonchifolius), with assembled genome sizes of 1.28, 0.89,
   1.73 and 2.72 Gb, respectively. We found that the chicory, endive and
   great burdock genomes were shaped by whole genome triplication (WGT-1),
   and the yacon genome was shaped by WGT-1 and two subsequent whole genome
   duplications (WGD-2 and WGD-3). A yacon unique whole genome duplication
   (WGD-3) occurred 5.6-5.8 million years ago. Our results also showed the
   genome size difference between chicory and endive is largely due to LTR
   retrotransposons, and rejected a previous hypothesis that chicory is an
   ancestor of endive. Furthermore, we identified fructan-active-enzyme and
   transcription-factor genes, and found there is one copy in chicory,
   endive and great burdock but two copies in yacon for most of these
   genes, except for the 1-FEH II gene which is significantly expanded in
   chicory. Interestingly, inulin synthesis genes 1-SST and 1-FFT are
   located close to each other, as are the degradation genes 1-FEH I and
   1-FEH II. Finally, we predicted protein structures for 1-FFT genes to
   explore the mechanism determining inulin chain length.},

Abstract = {Highly multiplexed approaches have become common in genomic studies.
   They have improved the cost-effectiveness of genotyping hundreds of
   individuals using combinatorially barcoded adapters. These strategies,
   however, can potentially misassigned reads to incorrect samples. Here,
   we used a modified quaddRAD protocol to analyse the occurrence of index
   hopping and PCR chimeras in a series of experiments with up to 100
   multiplexed samples per sequencing lane (639 samples in total). We
   created two types of sequencing libraries: four libraries of type A,
   where PCRs were run on individual samples before multiplexing, and three
   libraries of type B, where PCRs were run on pooled samples. We used
   fixed pairs of inner barcodes to identify chimeric reads. Type B
   libraries show a higher percentage of misassigned reads (1.15\%) than
   type A libraries (0.65\%). We also quantify the commonly undetectable
   chimeric sequences that occur whenever multiplexed groups of samples
   with different outer barcodes are sequenced together on a single flow
   cell. Our results suggest that these types of chimeric sequences
   represent up to 1.56\% and 1.29\% of reads in type A and B libraries,
   respectively. We also show that increasing the number of mismatches
   allowed for barcode rescue to above 2 dramatically increases the number
   of recovered chimeric reads. We provide recommendations for developing
   highly multiplexed RAD-seq protocols and analysing the resulting data to
   minimize the generation of chimeric sequences, allowing their
   quantification and a finer control on the number of PCR cycles necessary
   to generate enough input DNA for library preparation.},

Title = {Shallow shotgun sequencing of the microbiome recapitulates 16S amplicon

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Prevailing 16S rRNA gene-amplicon methods for characterizing the
   bacterial microbiome of wildlife are economical, but result in coarse
   taxonomic classifications, are subject to primer and 16S copy number
   biases, and do not allow for direct estimation of microbiome functional
   potential. While deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing can overcome many
   of these limitations, it is prohibitively expensive for large sample
   sets. Here we evaluated the ability of shallow shotgun metagenomic
   sequencing to characterize taxonomic and functional patterns in the
   faecal microbiome of a model population of feral horses (Sable Island,
   Canada). Since 2007, this unmanaged population has been the subject of
   an individual-based, long-term ecological study. Using deep shotgun
   metagenomic sequencing, we determined the sequencing depth required to
   accurately characterize the horse microbiome. In comparing conventional
   vs. high-throughput shotgun metagenomic library preparation techniques,
   we validate the use of more cost-effective laboratory methods. Finally,
   we characterize similarities between 16S amplicon and shallow shotgun
   characterization of the microbiome, and demonstrate that the latter
   recapitulates biological patterns first described in a published
   amplicon data set. Unlike for amplicon data, we further demonstrate how
   shallow shotgun metagenomic data provide useful insights regarding
   microbiome functional potential which support previously hypothesized
   diet effects in this study system.},

Abstract = {Dietary metabarcoding has vastly improved our ability to analyse the
   diets of animals, but it is hampered by a plethora of technical
   limitations including potentially reduced data output due to the
   disproportionate amplification of the DNA of the focal predator, here
   termed ``the predator problem{''}. We review the various methods
   commonly used to overcome this problem, from deeper sequencing to
   exclusion of predator DNA during PCR, and how they may interfere with
   increasingly common multipredator-taxon studies. We suggest that
   multiprimer approaches with an emphasis on achieving both depth and
   breadth of prey detections may overcome the issue to some extent,
   although multitaxon studies require further consideration, as
   highlighted by an empirical example. We also review several alternative
   methods for reducing the prevalence of predator DNA that are
   conceptually promising but require additional empirical examination. The
   predator problem is a key constraint on molecular dietary analyses but,
   through this synthesis, we hope to guide researchers in overcoming this
   in an effective and pragmatic way.},

Abstract = {The accurate extraction of species-abundance information from DNA-based
   data (metabarcoding, metagenomics) could contribute usefully to diet
   analysis and food-web reconstruction, the inference of species
   interactions, the modelling of population dynamics and species
   distributions, the biomonitoring of environmental state and change, and
   the inference of false positives and negatives. However, multiple
   sources of bias and noise in sampling and processing combine to inject
   error into DNA-based data sets. To understand how to extract abundance
   information, it is useful to distinguish two concepts. (i) Within-sample
   across-species quantification describes relative species abundances in
   one sample. (ii) Across-sample within-species quantification describes
   how the abundance of each individual species varies from sample to
   sample, such as over a time series, an environmental gradient or
   different experimental treatments. First, we review the literature on
   methods to recover across-species abundance information (by removing
   what we call ``species pipeline biases{''}) and within-species abundance
   information (by removing what we call ``pipeline noise{''}). We argue
   that many ecological questions can be answered with just within-species
   quantification, and we therefore demonstrate how to use a ``DNA
   spike-in{''} to correct for pipeline noise and recover within-species
   abundance information. We also introduce a model-based estimator that
   can be used on data sets without a physical spike-in to approximate and
   correct for pipeline noise.},

Abstract = {Accurate identification of plants remains a significant challenge for
   taxonomists and is the basis for plant diversity conservation. Although
   DNA barcoding methods are commonly used for plant identification, these
   are limited by the low amplification success and low discriminative
   power of selected genomic regions. In this study, we developed a
   k-mer-based approach, the DNA signature sequence (DSS), to accurately
   identify plant taxon-specific markers, especially at the species level.
   DSS is a constant-length nucleotide sequence capable of identifying a
   taxon and distinguishing it from other taxa. In this study, we performed
   the first large-scale study of DSS markers in plants. DSS candidates of
   3899 angiosperm plant species were calculated based on a chloroplast
   data set with 4356 assemblies. Using Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons
   and high-throughput sequencing, DSSs were validated in four and 165
   species, respectively. Based on this, the universality of the DSSs was
   over 79.38\%. Several indicators influencing DSS marker identification
   and detection have also been evaluated, and common criteria for DSS
   application in plant identification have been proposed.},

Abstract = {Species recovery programs are increasingly using genomic data to measure
   neutral genetic diversity and calculate metrics like relatedness. While
   these measures can inform conservation management, determining the
   mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression requires information about
   functional genes associated with adaptive or maladaptive traits.
   Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one family of functional genes, which
   play a crucial role in recognition of pathogens and activation of the
   immune system. Previously, these genes have been analysed using
   species-specific primers and PCR. Here, we leverage an existing
   short-read reference genome, whole-genome resequencing population data
   set, and bioinformatic tools to characterize TLR gene diversity in
   captive and wild tchuriwat'/tuturuatu/shore plover (Thinornis
   novaeseelandiae), a threatened bird endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. Our
   results show that TLR gene diversity in tchuriwat'/tuturuatu is low, and
   forms two distinct captive and wild genetic clusters. The bioinformatic
   approach presented here has broad applicability to other threatened
   species with existing genomic resources in Aotearoa New Zealand and
   beyond.},

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},
Number = {4},
Pages = {225-232},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mitochondria are organelles that produce cellular energy in the form of
   ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, and this primary function is
   conserved among many taxa. Locomotion is a trait that is highly reliant
   on metabolic function and expected to be greatly affected by disruptions
   to mitochondrial performance. To this end, we aimed to examine how
   activity and sleep vary between Drosophila melanogaster strains with
   different geographic origins, how these patterns are affected by
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation, and how breaking up co-evolved
   mito-nuclear gene combinations affect the studied activity traits. Our
   results demonstrate that Drosophila strains from different locations
   differ in sleep and activity, and that females are generally more active
   than males. By comparing activity and sleep of mtDNA variants
   introgressed onto a common nuclear background in cytoplasmic hybrid
   (cybrid) strains, we were able to quantify the among-line variance
   attributable to mitochondrial DNA, and we establish that mtDNA variation
   affects both activity and sleep, in a sex-specific manner. Altogether
   our study highlights the important role that mitochondrial genome
   variation plays on organismal physiology and behaviour.},

Title = {Diet preferences based on sequence read count: The role of species
   interaction in tissue bias correction},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {159-173},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques provide a unique
   opportunity to study predator-prey relationships. However, in animal
   dietary preference studies, how to properly correct tissue bias within
   the sequence read count and the role of interactions between
   co-occurring species in metabarcoding mixtures remain largely unknown.
   In this study, we propose two categories of tissue bias correction
   indices: sequence read count number per unit tissue (SCN) and its ratio
   form (SCN ratio). By constructing plant mock communities with different
   numbers of co-occurring species in metabarcoding mixtures and conducting
   feeding trails on captive sika deer (Cervus nippon), we demonstrate the
   features of the SCN and SCN ratio, evaluate their correction effects and
   assess the role of species interactions during tissue bias correction.
   Tissue differences between species are defined as the differential
   ability to generate sequence counts. Our study suggests that pure tissue
   differences among species without a species interaction is not an
   optimal correction index for many biomes with limited tissue differences
   among species. Species interactions in mixtures may amplify tissue
   differences, which is beneficial for tissue bias correction. However,
   caution must be taken because varied species interactions among
   communities may increase the risk of worse correction. Correction
   effects based on the SCN and SCN ratio are comparable, but the SCN is
   less influenced by control species than the SCN ratio. Based on our
   study, several suggestions are provided for future animal diet studies
   or other high-throughput sequencing studies containing tissue bias.},

Abstract = {Clustering approaches are pivotal to handle the many sequence variants
   obtained in DNA metabarcoding data sets, and therefore they have become
   a key step of metabarcoding analysis pipelines. Clustering often relies
   on a sequence similarity threshold to gather sequences into molecular

   homogeneous taxonomic entity (e.g., a species or a genus). However, the
   choice of the clustering threshold is rarely justified, and its impact
   on MOTU over-splitting or over-merging even less tested. Here, we
   evaluated clustering threshold values for several metabarcoding markers
   under different criteria: limitation of MOTU over-merging, limitation of
   MOTU over-splitting, and trade-off between over-merging and
   over-splitting. We extracted sequences from a public database for nine
   markers, ranging from generalist markers targeting Bacteria or
   Eukaryota, to more specific markers targeting a class or a subclass
   (e.g., Insecta, Oligochaeta). Based on the distributions of pairwise
   sequence similarities within species and within genera, and on the rates
   of over-splitting and over-merging across different clustering
   thresholds, we were able to propose threshold values minimizing the risk
   of over-splitting, that of over-merging, or offering a trade-off between
   the two risks. For generalist markers, high similarity thresholds
   (0.96-0.99) are generally appropriate, while more specific markers
   require lower values (0.85-0.96). These results do not support the use
   of a fixed clustering threshold. Instead, we advocate careful
   examination of the most appropriate threshold based on the research
   objectives, the potential costs of over-splitting and over-merging, and
   the features of the studied markers.},

Abstract = {Characterizing the role of different mutational effect sizes in the
   evolution of fitness-related traits has been a major goal in
   evolutionary biology for a century. Such characterization in a diversity
   of systems, both model and non-model, will help to understand the
   genetic processes underlying fitness variation. However,
   well-characterized genetic architectures of such traits in wild
   populations remain uncommon. In this study, we used haplotype-based and
   multi-SNP Bayesian association methods with sequencing data for 313
   individuals from wild populations to test the mutational composition of
   known candidate regions for sea age at maturation in Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar). We detected an association at five loci out of 116
   candidates previously identified in an aquaculture strain with
   maturation timing in wild Atlantic salmon. We found that at four of
   these five loci, variation explained by the locus was predominantly
   driven by a single SNP suggesting the genetic architecture of this trait
   includes multiple loci with simple, non-clustered alleles and a locus
   with potentially more complex alleles. This highlights the diversity of
   genetic architectures that can exist for fitness-related traits.
   Furthermore, this study provides a useful multi-SNP framework for future
   work using sequencing data to characterize genetic variation underlying
   phenotypes in wild populations.},

Abstract = {Critically endangered species are usually restricted to small and
   isolated populations. High inbreeding without gene flow among
   populations further aggravates their threatened condition and reduces
   the likelihood of their long-term survival. Chinese alligator (Alligator
   sinensis) is one of the most endangered crocodiles in the world and has
   experienced a continuous decline over the past c. 1 million years. In
   order to identify the genetic status of the remaining populations and
   aid conservation efforts, we assembled the first high-quality
   chromosome-level genome of Chinese alligator and explored the genomic
   characteristics of three extant breeding populations. Our analyses
   revealed the existence of at least three genetically distinct
   populations, comprising two breeding populations in China (Changxing and
   Xuancheng) and one breeding population in an American wildlife refuge.
   The American population does not belong to the last two populations of
   its native range (Xuancheng and Changxing), thus representing genetic
   diversity extinct in the wild and provides future opportunities for
   genetic rescue. Moreover, the effective population size of these three
   populations has been continuously declining over the past 20 ka.
   Consistent with this decline, the species shows extremely low genetic
   diversity, a large proportion of long runs of homozygous fragments, and
   mutational load across the genome. Finally, to provide genomic insights
   for future breeding management and conservation, we assessed the
   feasibility of mixing extant populations based on the likelihood of
   introducing new deleterious alleles and signatures of local adaptation.
   Overall, this study provides a valuable genomic resource and important
   genomic insights into the ecology, evolution, and conservation of
   critically endangered alligators.},

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-81},

Abstract = {The inheritance of epigenetic marks induced by environmental variation
   in a previous generation is broadly accepted as a mediator of phenotypic
   plasticity. Transgenerational effects linking maternal experiences to
   changes in morphology, gene expression, and life history of successive
   generations are known across many taxa. While the number of studies
   linking epigenetic variation to ecological maternal effects is
   increasing rapidly, few if any attempts have been made to investigate
   molecular mechanisms governing epigenetic functions in the context of
   ecologically relevant maternal effects. Daphnia make an ideal model for
   investigating molecular epigenetic mechanisms and ecological maternal
   effects because they will reproduce asexually in the lab. Daphnia are
   also known to have strong maternal effects, involving a variety of
   traits and environmental variables. Using two clones of Daphnia pulex,
   we investigated the plasticity of life history and DNA methyltransferase
   (Dnmt) gene expression with respect to food limitation within and across
   generations. We found strong evidence of genotypic variation of
   responses of life history and Dnmt expression to low food diets, both
   within and across generations. In general, effects of offspring diet
   were larger than either the direct maternal effect or offspring-maternal
   environment interactions, but the direction of the maternal effect was
   usually in the opposite direction of the within-generation effect. For
   both life history and Dnmt expression, we also found that when offspring
   had low food, effects of the maternal environment were stronger than
   when offspring had high food.},

Abstract = {Identification of population structure is a common goal for a variety of
   applications, including conservation, wildlife management, and medical
   genetics. The outcome of these analyses can have far reaching
   implications; therefore, it is important to ensure an understanding of
   the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies used. Increasing in
   popularity, the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)
   method incorporates combinations of genetic variables (alleles) into a
   model that differentiates individuals into genetic clusters. However,
   users may not have a full understanding of how to best parameterize the
   model. In this issue of Thia (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2022) looks
   under the hood of the DAPC. Using simulated data, he demonstrates the
   importance of careful parameter selection in developing a DAPC model,
   what the implications are for over-fitting the model, and finally, how
   best to evaluate the results of DAPC models. This work highlights the
   issues that can arise when over-parameterizing the DAPC model when gene
   flow is high among clusters and provides important guidelines to ensure
   researchers are making conclusions that are biologically relevant.},

   cryptic genetic diversity between strains from various geographical
   origins. In this study, we obtained two high-quality chromosome-level
   genomes of F. candida, for a parthenogenetic strain (named FCDK, 219.08
   Mb, 25,139 protein-coding genes) and a sexual strain (named FCSH, 153.09
   Mb, 21,609 protein-coding genes), reannotated the genome of the
   parthenogenetic strain reported by Faddeeva-Vakhrusheva et al. in 2017
   (named FCBL, 221.7 Mb, 25,980 protein-coding genes) and conducted
   comparative genomic analyses of the three strains. High genome
   similarities between FCDK and FCBL based on synteny, genome
   architecture, mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences suggest that they
   are conspecific. The seven chromosomes of FCDK are each 25\%-54\% larger
   than the corresponding chromosomes of FCSH, showing obvious repetitive
   element expansions and large-scale inversions and translocations but no
   whole-genome duplication. The strain-specific genes, expanded gene
   families and genes in nonsyntenic chromosomal regions identified in FCDK
   are highly related to the broader environmental adaptation of
   parthenogenetic strains. In addition, FCDK has fewer strain-specific
   microRNAs than FCSH, and their mitochondrial and nuclear genes have
   diverged greatly. In conclusion, FCDK/FCBL and FCSH have accumulated
   independent genetic changes and evolved into distinct species after 10
   million years ago. Our work provides important genomic resources for
   studying the mechanisms of rapidly cryptic speciation and soil arthropod
   adaptation to soil ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Patterns of genetic diversity within species contain information the
   history of that species, including how they have responded to historical
   climate change and how easily the organism is able to disperse across
   its habitat. More than 40,000 phylogeographic and population genetic
   investigations have been published to date, each collecting genetic data
   from hundreds of samples. Despite these millions of data points,
   meta-analyses are challenging because the synthesis of results across
   hundreds of studies, each using different methods and forms of analysis,
   is a daunting and time-consuming task. It is more efficient to proceed
   by repurposing existing data and using automated data analysis. To
   facilitate data repurposing, we created a database (phylogatR) that
   aggregates data from different sources and conducts automated multiple
   sequence alignments and data curation to provide users with nearly
   ready-to-analyse sets of data for thousands of species. Two types of
   scientific research will be made easier by phylogatR: large
   meta-analyses of thousands of species that can address classic questions
   in evolutionary biology and ecology, and student- or citizen- science
   based investigations that will introduce a broad range of people to the
   analysis of genetic data. phylogatR enhances the value of existing data
   via the creation of software and web-based tools that enable these data
   to be recycled and reanalysed and increase accessibility to big data for
   research laboratories and classroom instructors with limited
   computational expertise and resources.},

Title = {Genome architecture used to supplement species delineation in two

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine which taxonomic methods can
   elucidate clear and quantifiable differences between two cryptic ciliate
   species, and to test the utility of genome architecture as a new
   diagnostic character in the discrimination of otherwise
   indistinguishable taxa. Two cryptic tintinnid ciliates, Schmidingerella
   arcuata and Schmidingerella meunieri, are compared via traditional
   taxonomic characters including lorica morphometrics, ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) gene barcodes and ecophysiological traits. In addition,
   single-cell `omics analyses (single-cell transcriptomics and genomics)
   are used to elucidate and compare patterns of micronuclear genome
   architecture between the congeners. The results include a highly similar
   lorica that is larger in S. meunieri, a 0\%-0.5\% difference in rRNA
   gene barcodes, two different and nine indistinguishable growth responses
   among 11 prey treatments, and distinct patterns of micronuclear genomic
   architecture for genes detected in both ciliates. Together, these
   results indicate that while minor differences exist between S. arcuata
   and S. meunieri in common indices of taxonomic identification (i.e.,
   lorica morphology, DNA barcode sequences and ecophysiology), differences
   exist in their genomic architecture, which suggests potential genetic
   incompatibility. Different patterns of micronuclear architecture in
   genes shared by both isolates also enable the design of species-specific
   primers, which are used in this study as unique ``architectural
   barcodes{''} to demonstrate the co-occurrence of both ciliates in
   samples collected from a NW Atlantic estuary. These results support the
   utility of genomic architecture as a tool in species delineation,
   especially in ciliates that are cryptic or otherwise difficult to
   differentiate using traditional methods of identification.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses are powerful for describing marine
   biodiversity but must be optimized for their effective use in routine
   monitoring. To maximize eDNA detection probabilities of sparsely
   distributed populations, water samples are usually concentrated from
   larger volumes and filtered using fine-pore membranes, often a
   significant cost-time bottleneck in the workflow. This study aimed to
   streamline eDNA sampling by investigating plankton net versus bucket
   sampling, direct versus sequential filtration including self-preserving
   filters. Biodiversity was assessed using metabarcoding of the small
   ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I
   (COI) genes. Multispecies detection probabilities were estimated for
   each workflow using a probabilistic occupancy modelling approach.
   Significant workflow-related differences in biodiversity metrics were
   reported. Highest amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness was attained
   by the bucket sampling combined with self-preserving filters, comprising
   a large portion of microplankton. Less diversity but more metazoan taxa
   were captured in the net samples combined with 5 mu m pore size filters.
   Prefiltered 1.2 mu m samples yielded few or no unique ASVs. The highest
   average (similar to 32\%) metazoan detection probabilities in the 5 mu m
   pore size net samples confirmed the effectiveness of preconcentration
   plankton for biodiversity screening. These results contribute to
   streamlining eDNA sampling protocols for uptake and implementation in
   marine biodiversity research and surveillance.},

Abstract = {The accuracy and precision of fungal molecular identification and
   classification are challenging, particularly in environmental
   metabarcoding approaches as these often trade accuracy for efficiency
   given the large data volumes at hand. In most ecological studies, only a
   single similarity cutoff value is used for sequence identification. This
   is not sufficient since the most commonly used DNA markers are known to
   vary widely in terms of inter- and intraspecific variability. We address
   this problem by presenting a new tool, dnabarcoder, to predict local
   similarity cutoffs and measure the resolving powers of a biomarker for
   sequence identification for different clades of fungi. It was shown that
   the predicted similarity cutoffs varied significantly between the clades
   of a recently released ITS DNA barcode data set from the CBS culture
   collection of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. When
   classifying a large public fungal ITS data set-the UNITE
   database-against the barcode data set, the local similarity cutoffs
   assigned fewer sequences than the traditional cutoffs used in
   metabarcoding studies. However, the obtained accuracy and precision were
   significantly improved. Our study showed that it might be better to
   extract the ITS region from the ITS barcodes to optimize taxonomic
   assignment accuracy. Furthermore, 15.3, 25.6, and 26.3\% of the fungal
   species of the barcode data set were indistinguishable by full-length
   ITS, ITS1, and ITS2, respectively. Except for these indistinguishable
   species, the resolving powers of full-length ITS, ITS1, and ITS2
   sequences were similar at the species level. Nevertheless, the complete
   ITS region had a better resolving power at higher taxonomic levels.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based methods of species detection are enabling
   various applications in ecology and conservation including large-scale
   biomonitoring efforts. qPCR is widely used as the standard approach for
   species-specific detection, often targeting a fish species of interest
   from aquatic eDNA. However, DNA metabarcoding has the potential to
   displace qPCR in certain eDNA applications. In this study, we compare
   the sensitivity of the latest Illumina NovaSeq 6000 NGS platform to qPCR
   TaqMan assays by measuring limits of detection and by analysing eDNA
   from water samples collected from Churchill River and Lake Melville, NL,
   Canada. Species-specific, targeted next generation sequencing (NGS)
   assays had significantly higher sensitivity than qPCR, with limits of
   detection 14- to 29-fold lower. For example, when analysing eDNA, qPCR
   detected Gadus ogac (Greenland cod) in 21\% of samples, but targeted NGS
   detected this species in 29\% of samples. General NGS assays were as
   sensitive as qPCR, while simultaneously detecting 15 fish species from
   eDNA samples. With over 34,000 fish species on the planet, parallel and
   sensitive methods such as NGS will be required to support effective
   biomonitoring at both regional and global scales.},

Abstract = {In model-based inference of population structure from individual-level
   genetic data, individuals are assigned membership coefficients in a
   series of statistical clusters generated by clustering algorithms.
   Distinct patterns of variability in membership coefficients can be
   produced for different groups of individuals, for example, representing
   different predefined populations, sampling sites or time periods. Such
   variability can be difficult to capture in a single numerical value;
   membership coefficient vectors are multivariate and potentially
   incommensurable across predefined groups, as the number of clusters over
   which individuals are distributed can vary among groups of interest.
   Further, two groups might share few clusters in common, so that
   membership coefficient vectors are concentrated on different clusters.
   We introduce a method for measuring the variability of membership
   coefficients of individuals in a predefined group, making use of an
   analogy between variability across individuals in membership coefficient
   vectors and variation across populations in allele frequency vectors. We
   show that in a model in which membership coefficient vectors in a
   population follow a Dirichlet distribution, the measure increases
   linearly with a parameter describing the variance of a specified
   component of the membership vector and does not depend on its mean. We
   apply the approach, which makes use of a normalized F-ST statistic, to
   data on inferred population structure in three example scenarios. We
   also introduce a bootstrap test for equivalence of two or more
   predefined groups in their level of membership coefficient variability.
   Our methods are implemented in the r package FSTruct.},

Abstract = {Plastid genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) arrays, proposed
   recently as ``super-barcodes,{''} might provide additional
   discriminatory power and overcome the limitations of traditional
   barcoding loci, yet super-barcodes need to be tested for their
   effectiveness in more plant groups. Morphological homoplasy among Schima
   species makes the genus a model for testing the efficacy of
   super-barcodes. In this study, we generated multiple data sets
   comprising standard DNA barcodes (matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA, nrITS) and
   super-barcodes (plastid genome, nrDNA arrays) across 58 individuals from
   12 out of 13 species of Schima from China. No samples were correctly
   assigned to species using standard DNA barcodes and nrDNA arrays, while
   only 27.27\% of species with multiple accessions were distinguished
   using the plastid genome and its partitioned data sets-the lowest
   estimated rate of super-barcode success in the literature so far. For
   Schima and other taxa with similarly recently divergence and low levels
   of genetic variation, incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization or
   taxonomic oversplitting are all possible causes of the failure. Taken
   together, our study suggests that by no means are super-barcodes immune
   to the challenges imposed by evolutionary complexity. We therefore call
   for developing multilocus nuclear markers for species discrimination in
   plant groups.},

Abstract = {Spatially explicit population genetic models have long been developed,
   yet have rarely been used to test hypotheses about the spatial
   distribution of genetic diversity or the genetic divergence between
   populations. Here, we use spatially explicit coalescence simulations to
   explore the properties of the island and the two-dimensional stepping
   stone models under a wide range of scenarios with spatio-temporal
   variation in deme size. We avoid the simulation of genetic data, using
   the fact that under the studied models, summary statistics of genetic
   diversity and divergence can be approximated from coalescence times. We
   perform the simulations using gridCoal, a flexible spatial wrapper for
   the software msprime (Kelleher et al., 2016, Theoretical Population
   Biology, 95, 13) developed herein. In gridCoal, deme sizes can change
   arbitrarily across space and time, as well as migration rates between
   individual demes. We identify different factors that can cause a
   deviation from theoretical expectations, such as the simulation time in
   comparison to the effective deme size and the spatio-temporal
   autocorrelation across the grid. Our results highlight that F-ST, a
   measure of the strength of population structure, principally depends on
   recent demography, which makes it robust to temporal variation in deme
   size. In contrast, the amount of genetic diversity is dependent on the
   distant past when N-e is large, therefore longer run times are needed to
   estimate N-e than F-ST. Finally, we illustrate the use of gridCoal on a
   real-world example, the range expansion of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.)
   since the last glacial maximum, using different degrees of
   spatio-temporal variation in deme size.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of climatic habitat suitable for biomes of
   the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, under the contemporary climate
   (1961-1990) and projected to the decade centered on the year 2030. This
   was achieved through previous modeling of the climatic habitat using
   random forest of the program R and six different climatic model
   scenarios. By the year 2030, there will be a reduction in the area
   occupied by a climatic habitat suitable for temperate biomes: conifer
   forests (-100\% change relative to the area currently occupied), San
   Lucas pine-oak woodland (-100\%), and Madrean-Transvolcanic pine-oak
   woodland (-34\%). In contrast, climatic habitats suitable for dry biomes
   will expand and some will appear that do not currently exist in
   Tamaulipas, such as the Sinaloa-Guerrero thornscrub (+38\% of the state
   area occupied). In the area occupied by the Biosphere Reserve ``El
   Cielo,'' suitable climatic habitat will diminish for the Gulf Coast
   thornscrub (-100\%), tropical semievergreen forest (-100\%), and cloud
   forest (-99\%); however, suitable climatic habitat will increase inside
   that Reserve for the biomes chaparral (+1,703\%) and
   MadreanTransvolcanic pine-oak woodland (+33\%). In addition, habitat
   suitable for the dry deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (+22\% of
   the area of the Reserve, previously nonexistent). For the Biosphere
   Reserve ``Sierra de Tamaulipas,'' suitable climatic habitat will be lost
   mainly for the biomes chaparral (-92\%) and MadreanTransvolcanic
   pine-oak woodland (-89\%). However, habitat suitable to the dry
   deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (66\% of the area of the
   Reserve, which does not currently exist). Modification of the climatic
   habitat could imply serious challenges for the conservation and
   management of contemporary vegetation and may provide evidence that the
   in situ measures of conservation in place for these biome types in the
   state are insufficient, even within the Biosphere Reserves.},

Abstract = {An accumulation of Pleistocene owl pellets (strigilites) containing 30
   arvicoline rodent teeth was found at the Little Dell Dam fossil site
   outside of Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah, in 1992. The
   accumulation was recovered in a single block of matrix with partially
   exposed teeth. We used high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) to
   segment, digitally prepare, and describe teeth belonging to Allophaiomys
   pliocaenicus, Mictomys kansasensis, or Mictomys meltoni, and a
   previously recognized but unnamed morphotype of Phenacomys. Digital
   preparation revealed 10 associated upper or lower dentitions of those
   taxa. A reinterpretation of the age of the site (similar to 150 thousand
   years ago) using arvicoline rodent biochronology was made based on
   recent research at Cathedral Cave, Nevada. The new estimate is a much
   younger age for the Little Dell Dam fauna from Locality 2 than was
   previously reported.},

Abstract = {Rapid and repeatable polymorphism analyses have become a necessity with
   the current amount of genomic data that can be collected in many
   organisms. Traditionally, such analyses are conducted using a variety of
   tools in combination, often requiring numerous format translation and
   manipulation. Here, we present a massively updated version of our
   previous software package egglib, intended to alleviate such costly and
   error-prone tinkering with the data. egglib has been streamlined into a
   python package and thoroughly updated and optimized to accommodate
   modern-day sized dataset. We show the main characteristics of the
   package making it a tool of choice to perform population genetics
   analyses. Once the data are imported (whatever their encoding), they can
   be filtered, edited, analysed and compared to coalescent simulations
   very easily and efficiently. Furthermore, the list of diversity and
   polymorphism statistics that can now be calculated has been greatly
   expanded. The software and its full documentation are available at .},

Abstract = {Pistia stratiotes (Araceae), commonly referred to as water lettuce, is
   one of the most notorious weeds that cause severe damage to the economy
   and natural ecosystems of infested areas. In order to explore the
   mechanism of its rapid invasion, here, we assembled a high-quality
   chromosome-level genome for P. stratiotes based on the Illumina
   sequencing, PacBio sequencing, and Hi-C scaffolding technology. The
   assembled genome is 311.87 Mb in size with a contig N50 of 1.08 Mb. The
   contigs were further anchored on 14 pseudochromosomes with a scaffold
   N50 of 21.21 Mb. A total of 20,356 protein-coding genes were predicted,
   of which 79.35\% were functionally annotated here. Evolutionary analysis
   showed that P. stratiotes and Colocasia esculenta were clustered
   together as sister lineages that diverged approximately 61 Ma. The
   synteny analyses indicated that two whole-genome duplication (WGD)
   events occurred within a short period in P. stratiotes. Moreover,
   comparative genome analysis indicated that the expansion of gene
   families corresponding to disease resistance might contribute to rapid
   invasion in P. stratiotes. Also, we analysed the disease-resistance gene
   family (NBS-LRR) involved in plant defence. A genome-wide search in P.
   stratiotes genome identified 85 NBS-LRR genes in this study. In
   conclusion, this study provides some new insights into the evolution of
   the invasive aquatic plant P. stratiotes. Our reference genome will also
   provide valuable resources for future invasion genomic research
   programmes.},

Abstract = {Molecular methods are increasingly used to identify species that lack
   conspicuous macro- or micromorphological characters. Taxonomic and
   ecological research teams barcode large numbers of collected voucher
   specimens annually. In this study we assessed the efficiency of
   long-read high throughput sequencing (HTS) as opposed to the
   traditionally used Sanger method for taxonomic identification of
   multiple vouchered fungal specimens. We also evaluated whether this
   method can provide reference information about intraindividual gene
   polymorphism. We developed a workflow based on a test set of 423
   basidiomycete specimens (representing 195 species), the PacBio HTS
   method, and ribosomal rRNA operon internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and
   28S rRNA gene (LSU) markers. The PacBio HTS had a higher success rate
   than Sanger sequencing at a comparable cost. Species identification
   based on PacBio reads was usually straightforward, because the dominant
   operational taxonomic unit (OTU) typically represented the targeted
   organism. The PacBio HTS also enabled us to detect widespread
   polymorphism within the ITS marker. We conclude that multiplex DNA
   barcoding of the fungal ITS and LSU markers using PacBio HTS is a useful
   tool for taxonomic identification of large amounts of collected voucher
   specimens at a competitive price. Furthermore, PacBio HTS accurately
   recovers various alleles and paralogues, which can provide crucial
   information for species delimitation and population-level studies.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an effective method for
   studying fish communities but allows only an estimation of relative
   species abundance (density/biomass). Here, we combine metabarcoding with
   an estimation of the total abundance of eDNA amplified by our universal
   marker (teleo) using a quantitative (q)PCR approach to infer the
   absolute abundance of fish species. We carried out a 2850-km eDNA survey
   within the Danube catchment using a spatial integrative sampling
   protocol coupled with traditional electrofishing for fish biomass and
   density estimation. Total fish eDNA concentrations and total fish
   abundance were highly correlated. The correlation between eDNA
   concentrations per taxon and absolute specific abundance was of
   comparable strength when all sites were pooled and remained significant
   when the sites were considered separately. Furthermore, a nonlinear
   mixed model showed that species richness was underestimated when the
   amount of teleo-DNA extracted from a sample was below a threshold of
   0.65 x 10(6) copies of eDNA. This result, combined with the decrease in
   teleo-DNA concentration by several orders of magnitude with river size,
   highlights the need to increase sampling effort in large rivers. Our
   results provide a comprehensive description of longitudinal changes in
   fish communities and underline our combined metabarcoding/qPCR approach
   for biomonitoring and bioassessment surveys when a rough estimate of
   absolute species abundance is sufficient.},

   assembled bases were located on 3 chromosomes. A total of 19,399
   protein-coding genes were predicted. Many gene families were expanded in
   the genome of Cx. pipiens f. molestus, particularly those of the
   chemosensory protein (CSP) and gustatory receptor (GR) gene families. In
   addition, utilizing Hi-C data, we improved the previously assembled
   draft genome of Cx. pipiens f. pallens, with scaffold N50 of 186.195 Mb
   and contig N50 of 0.749 Mb, and more than 97.02\% of the assembled bases

Abstract = {Understanding the genetic changes associated with the evolution of
   biological diversity is of fundamental interest to molecular ecologists.
   The assessment of genetic variation at hundreds or thousands of unlinked
   genetic loci forms a sound basis to address questions ranging from
   micro- to macroevolutionary timescales, and is now possible thanks to
   advances in sequencing technology. Major difficulties are associated
   with (i) the lack of genomic resources for many taxa, especially from
   tropical biodiversity hotspots; (ii) scaling the numbers of individuals
   analysed and loci sequenced; and (iii) building tools for reproducible
   bioinformatic analyses of such data sets. To address these challenges,
   we developed target capture probes for genomic studies of the highly
   diverse, pantropically distributed and economically significant
   rosewoods (Dalbergia spp.), explored the performance of an overlapping
   probe set for target capture across the legume family (Fabaceae), and
   built the general purpose bioinformatic pipeline CaptureAl. Phylogenomic
   analyses of Malagasy Dalbergia species yielded highly resolved and well
   supported hypotheses of evolutionary relationships. Population genomic
   analyses identified differences between closely related species and
   revealed the existence of a potentially new species, suggesting that the
   diversity of Malagasy Dalbergia species has been underestimated.
   Analyses at the family level corroborated previous findings by the
   recovery of monophyletic subfamilies and many well-known clades, as well
   as high levels of gene tree discordance, especially near the root of the
   family. The new genomic and bioinformatic resources, including the
   Fabaceae1005 and Dalbergia2396 probe sets, will hopefully advance
   systematics and ecological genetics research in legumes, and promote
   conservation of the highly diverse and endangered Dalbergia rosewoods.},

Abstract = {Genome introgression is one of the driving forces that can increase
   species and genetic diversity and facilitate the adaptive evolution of
   organisms and biodiversity conservation. However, the genomic
   introgression and its contribution to biodiversity of macrofungi are
   still unclear. The genus Ganoderma is a typical macrofungal group that
   plays crucial roles in forest ecosystem as saprophytic organisms and
   plant pathogens, and is also involved in human health as medicinal
   mushrooms. Most public Ganoderma genomes are fragmented, and reference
   genomes and whole-genome information of diverse germplasm resources for
   many Ganoderma species are lacking, thus hindering functional and
   evolutionary genomic investigations among Ganoderma species. In this
   study, we provide high-quality genomes of 10 Ganoderma species and
   whole-genome variants data of 224 individuals from various ecoregions,
   enabling us to infer the phylogeny of Ganoderma species and their
   historical population dynamics. Based on whole-genome variants,
   widespread and genome-wide introgression among Ganoderma species is
   revealed. Genes with significant introgression signals were related to
   stress response, digestive absorption, and secondary metabolite
   synthesis, factors that may contribute to environmental adaptation and
   important biocomponent metabolism. CYP512U6, an essential functional
   gene in the CYP450 family related to Ganoderma triterpene synthesis, was
   detected with significant introgression and selection signals combined
   with Ganoderma metabolomic analysis, indicating that both ancient gene
   exchange and recent domestication have contributed to the categories and
   content of secondary metabolites of Ganoderma. The reference genomes,
   whole-genome variants, and metabolite profiles could serve as abundant
   and valuable genetic resources for evolution, ecology, and conservation
   investigations of Ganoderma species and other macrofungi.},

Abstract = {Emerging and endemic mosquito-borne viruses can be difficult to detect
   and monitor because they often cause asymptomatic infections in human or
   vertebrate animals or cause nonspecific febrile illness with a short
   recovery waiting period. Some of these pathogens circulate into complex
   cryptic cycles involving several animal species as reservoir or
   amplifying hosts. Detection of cases in vertebrate hosts can be
   complemented by entomological surveillance, but this method is not
   adapted to low infection rates in mosquito populations that typically
   occur in low or nonendemic areas. We identified West Nile virus
   circulation in Camargue, a wetland area in South of France, using a
   cost-effective xenomonitoring method based on the molecular detection of
   virus in excreta from trapped mosquitoes. We also succeeded at
   identifying the mosquito species community on several sampling sites,
   together with the vertebrate hosts on which they fed prior to being
   captured using amplicon-based metabarcoding on mosquito excreta without
   processing any mosquitoes. Mosquito excreta-based virus surveillance can
   complement standard surveillance methods because it is cost-effective
   and does not require personnel with a strong background in entomology.
   This strategy can also be used to noninvasively explore the ecological
   network underlying arbovirus circulation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, metabarcoding has become the method of choice for
   investigating the composition and assembly of microbial eukaryotic
   communities. The number of environmental data sets published has
   increased very rapidly. Although unprocessed sequence files are often
   publicly available, processed data, in particular clustered sequences,
   are rarely available in a usable format. Clustered sequences are
   reported as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with different similarity
   levels or more recently as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). This
   hampers comparative studies between different environments and data
   sets, for example examining the biogeographical patterns of specific
   groups/species, as well analysing the genetic microdiversity within
   these groups. Here, we present a newly-assembled database of processed
   18S rRNA metabarcodes that are annotated with the PR2 reference sequence
   database. This database, called metaPR(2), contains 41 data sets
   corresponding to more than 4000 samples and 90,000 ASVs. The database,
   which is accessible through both a web-based interface () and an R
   package, should prove very useful to all researchers working on protist
   diversity in a variety of systems.},

Abstract = {Natural history museums hold vast collections of biomaterials. The
   collections in museums, often painstakingly sampled, are largely
   unexplored treasures that may help us better understand biodiversity on
   the planet. Museum collections can provide a unique window into the past
   of species long gone or currently declining due to human activity. From
   a molecular perspective, however, many museum samples are stored under
   conditions that hasten the damage of DNA, RNA and proteins. For example,
   samples in wet collections are those stored in liquid preservatives,
   typically ethanol. These ethanol-preserved tissues are often, although
   not always, formalin-fixed prior to storage, which may damage DNA. In
   this and recent issues of Molecular Ecology Resources, Straube et al
   (2021), O'Connell et al (2021) and Hahn et al (2022) explore different
   types of specimens from museum wet collections as new sources of DNA for
   scientific studies. All three articles found that for wet museum
   collections, overall specimen condition mattered most for recovering
   high-quality genomic DNA.},

Abstract = {Revegetation projects face the major challenge of sourcing optimal plant
   material. This is often done with limited information about plant
   performance and increasingly requires factoring resilience to climate
   change. Functional traits can be used as quantitative indices of plant
   performance and guide seed provenancing, but trait values expected under
   novel conditions are often unknown. To support climate-resilient
   provenancing efforts, we develop a trait prediction model that
   integrates the effect of genetic variation with fine-scale temperature
   variation. We train our model on multiple field plantings of Arabidopsis
   thaliana and predict two relevant fitness traits-days-to-bolting and
   fecundity-across the species' European range. Prediction accuracy was
   high for days-to-bolting and moderate for fecundity, with the majority
   of trait variation explained by temperature differences between
   plantings. Projection under future climate predicted a decline in
   fecundity, although this response was heterogeneous across the range. In
   response, we identified novel genotypes that could be introduced to
   genetically offset the fitness decay. Our study highlights the value of
   predictive models to aid seed provenancing and improve the success of
   revegetation projects.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, there has been a huge increase in our
   understanding of microbial diversity, structure and composition enabled
   by high-throughput sequencing technologies. Yet, it is unclear how the
   number of sequences translates to the number of cells or species within
   the community. In some cases, additional observational data may be
   required to ensure relative abundance patterns from sequence reads are
   biologically meaningful. The goal of DNA-based methods for biodiversity
   assessments is to obtain robust community abundance data,
   simultaneously, from environmental samples. In this issue of Molecular
   Ecology Resources, Pierella Karlusich et al. (2022) describe a new
   method for quantifying phytoplankton cell abundance. Using Tara Oceans
   data sets, the authors propose the photosynthetic gene psbO for
   reporting accurate relative abundance of the entire phytoplankton
   community from metagenomic data. The authors demonstrate higher
   correlations with traditional optical methods (including microscopy and
   flow cytometry), using their new method, improving upon molecular
   abundance assessments using multicopy marker genes. Furthermore, to
   facilitate application of their approach, the authors curated a psbO
   gene database for accessible taxonomic queries. This is an important
   step towards improving species abundance estimates from molecular data
   and eventually reporting of absolute species abundance, enhancing our
   understanding of community dynamics.},

Title = {Chromosomal-level assembly of Bactericera cockerelli reveals rampant

Abstract = {Lineage specific expansions and gene duplications are some of the most
   important sources of evolutionary novelty in eukaryotes. Although not as
   prevalent in eukaryotes compared to bacteria, horizontal gene transfer
   events can also result in key adaptations for insects, especially for
   those involved in insect-microbe interactions. In this study we assemble
   the first chromosomal assembly of the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli and
   reveal that the B. cockerelli genome has experienced significantly more
   gene expansion events compared to other Hemipteran representatives with
   fully sequenced genomes. We also reveal that B. cockerelli's genome is
   the largest psyllid genome (567 Mb) sequenced to date and is similar to
   15\% larger than the other two psyllid species genomes sequenced
   (Pachypsylla venusta and Diaphorina citri). Structurally, B. cockerelli
   appears to have an additional chromosome compared to the distantly
   related psyllid species P. venusta due to a previous chromosomal fission
   or fusion event. The increase in genome size and dynamic nature of the
   B. cockerelli genome may largely be contributed to the widespread
   expansion of type I and II repeat elements that are rampant across all
   of B. cockerellirs. chromosomes. These repeat elements are distributed
   near equally in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions.
   Furthermore, significant gene family expansions and gene duplications
   were uncovered for genes that are expected to be important in its
   adaptation to insect-plant and microbe interactions, which include
   transcription factors, proteases, odorant receptors, and horizontally
   transferred genes that are involved in the nutritional symbioses with
   their long-term nutritional endosymbiont Carsonella.},

Title = {Chromosome-level genome of Entada phaseoloides provides insights into
   genome evolution and biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins},

Volume = {22},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As a medicinal herbal plant, Entada phaseoloides has high levels of
   secondary metabolites, particularly triterpenoid saponins, which are
   important resources for scientific research and medical applications.
   However, the lack of a reference genome for this genus has limited
   research on its evolution and utilization of its medicinal potential. In
   this study, we report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for E.
   phaseoloides using Illumina, Nanopore long reads and high-throughput
   chromosome conformation capture technology. The assembled reference
   genome is 456.18 Mb (scaffold N50 = 30.9 Mb; contig N50 = 6.34 Mb) with
   95.71\% of the sequences anchored onto 14 pseudochromosomes. E.
   phaseoloides was estimated to have diverged from the Leguminosae lineage
   at similar to 72.0 million years ago. With the integration of
   transcriptomic and metabolomic data, gene expression patterns and
   metabolite profiling of E. phaseoloides were determined in different
   tissues. The pattern of gene expression and metabolic profile of the
   kernel were distinct from those of other tissues. Furthermore, the
   evolution of certain gene families involved in the biosynthesis of
   triterpenoid saponins and terpenes was analysed and offers new insights
   into the formation of these two metabolites. Four CYP genes, one UGT
   gene and related transcription factors were identified as candidate
   genes contributing to regulation of triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis.
   As the first high-quality assembled reference genome in the genus
   Entada, it will not only provide new information for the evolutionary
   study of this genus and conservation biology of E. phaseoloides but also
   lay a foundation for the formation and utilization of secondary
   metabolites in medicinal plants.},

Abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a central role in the
   vertebrate adaptive immune system and has been of long-term interest in
   evolutionary biology. While several protocols have been developed for
   MHC genotyping, there is a lack of transparent and standardized tools
   for downstream analysis of MHC data. Here, we present the r package
   mhctools and demonstrate the use of its functions to (i) assist accurate
   MHC genotyping from high-throughput amplicon-sequencing data, (ii) infer
   functional MHC supertypes using bootstrapped clustering analysis, (iii)
   identify segregating MHC haplotypes from family data, and (iv) analyse
   functional and genetic distances between MHC sequences. We employed
   mhctools to analyse MHC class I (MHC-I) amplicon data of 559 great reed
   warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). We identified 390 MHC-I alleles
   which clustered into 14 functional supertypes. A phylogenetic analysis
   and analyses of positive selection suggested that the MHC-I alleles
   belong to several distinct functional groups. We furthermore identified
   107 segregating haplotypes among 116 families, and found substantial
   variation in diversity with 4-21 MHC-I alleles and 3-13 MHC-I supertypes
   per haplotype. Finally, we show that the great reed warbler haplotypes
   harboured combinations of MHC-I supertypes with greater functional
   divergence than observed in simulated populations of possible
   haplotypes, a result that is in accordance with the divergent allele
   advantage hypothesis. Our study demonstrates the power of mhctools to
   support genotyping and analysis of MHC in non-model species, which we
   hope will encourage broad implementation among researchers in MHC
   genetics and evolution.},

Abstract = {The genomic architecture underlying the origins and maintenance of
   biodiversity is an increasingly accessible feature of species, due in
   large part to third-generation sequencing and novel analytical toolsets.
   Applying these techniques to woodrats (Neotoma spp.) provides a unique
   opportunity to study how herbivores respond to environmental change.
   Neotoma bryanti and N. lepida independently achieved a major dietary
   feat in the aftermath of a natural climate change event: switching to
   the novel, toxic food source creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). To
   better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying this ability, we
   employed a trio binning sequencing approach with a N. bryanti x N.
   lepida F-1 hybrid, allowing the simultaneous assembly of genomes
   representing each parental species. The resulting phased,
   chromosome-level, highly complete haploid references enabled us to
   explore the genomic architecture of several gene families-cytochromes
   P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and ATP-binding cassette
   (ABC) transporters-known to play key roles in the metabolism of
   naturally occurring toxic dietary compounds. In addition to duplication
   events in the ABCG and UGT2B subfamilies, we found expansions in three
   P450 gene families (2A, 2B, 3A), including the evolution of multiple
   novel gene islands within the 2B and 3A subfamilies, which may have
   provided the crucial substrate for dietary adaptation. Our assemblies
   demonstrate that trio binning from an F-1 hybrid rodent effectively
   recovers parental genomes from species that diverged more than a million
   years ago.},

Abstract = {The Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is a key species in the
   North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea ecosystems, where it also supports
   important fisheries. However, the lack of genomic resources limits our
   understanding of evolutionary, environmental and anthropogenic forces
   affecting key life history characteristics of Pacific halibut and
   prevents the application of genomic tools in fisheries management and
   conservation efforts. In the present study, we report on the first
   generation of a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the Pacific
   halibut genome, with an estimated size of 602 Mb, 24 chromosome-length
   scaffolds that contain 99.8\% of the assembly and a N-50 scaffold length
   of 27.3 Mb. In the first application of this important resource, we
   conducted genome-wide analyses of sex-specific genetic variation by pool
   sequencing and characterized a potential sex-determining region in
   chromosome 9 with a high density of female-specific SNPs. Within this
   region, we identified the bmpr1ba gene as a potential candidate for
   master sex-determining (MSD) gene. bmpr1ba is a member of the TGF-beta
   family that in teleosts has provided the largest number of MSD genes,
   including a paralogue of this gene in Atlantic herring. The genome
   assembly constitutes an essential resource for future studies on Pacific
   halibut population structure and dynamics, evolutionary history and
   responses to environmental and anthropogenic influences. Furthermore,
   the genomic location of the sex-determining region in Pacific halibut
   has been identified and a putative candidate MSD gene has been proposed,
   providing further support for the rapid evolution of sex-determining
   mechanisms in teleost fish.},

Abstract = {Flowering phenology can be one of the most important factors mediating
   the temporal dynamics of plant-pollinator networks. However, most
   studies do not explicitly incorporate the effect of flowering phenology,
   which may bias conclusions about the structuring of plant-pollinator
   networks, obscuring our understanding of factors that explain the
   temporal variation of these networks. By analyzing co-flowering
   networks, floral traits similarity and pollinator sharing, in this study
   we aim to uncover the temporal dynamics of plant-pollinator network
   structure in two coastal communities. We recorded the flowering
   phenology of each plant species to construct co-flowering networks and
   the identity and frequency of floral visitors. We estimated and tested
   for differences in floral trait similarity and pollinator sharing across
   co-flowering modules. To disentangle the phenological effect of
   flowering on the structure of plant-pollinator networks, we constructed
   plant-pollinator subnetworks for each co-flowering modules and analyzed
   the role of the pollinators in each subnetwork. Floral trait similarity
   and pollinator sharing were related to changes in the structure of
   plant-pollinator networks, but these changes were community-dependent.
   The modular structure and network specialization index of
   plant-pollinator subnetworks were statistically persistent in both
   communities, suggesting the prevalence of specialized interactions
   throughout the flowering season. This result was consistent with the
   predominant peripheral role of most pollinator species across
   co-flowering modules in both communities. Our results highlight the
   importance of explicitly considering flowering phenology to advance our
   understanding of the mechanisms that explain temporal changes in the
   structure of plant-pollinator networks.},

Abstract = {Species identification is pivotal in biodiversity assessments and
   proteomic fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has already been
   shown to reliably identify calanoid copepods to species level. However,
   MALDI-TOF data may contain more information beyond mere species
   identification. In this study, we investigated different ontogenetic
   stages (copepodids C1-C6 females) of three co-occurring Calanus species
   from the Arctic Fram Strait, which cannot be identified to species level
   based on morphological characters alone. Differentiation of the three
   species based on mass spectrometry data was without any error. In
   addition, a clear stage-specific signal was detected in all species,
   supported by clustering approaches as well as machine learning using
   Random Forest. More complex mass spectra in later ontogenetic stages as
   well as relative intensities of certain mass peaks were found as the
   main drivers of stage distinction in these species. Through a dilution
   series, we were able to show that this did not result from the higher
   amount of biomass that was used in tissue processing of the larger
   stages. Finally, the data were tested in a simulation for application in
   a real biodiversity assessment by using Random Forest for stage
   classification of specimens absent from the training data. This resulted
   in a successful stage-identification rate of almost 90\%, making
   proteomic fingerprinting a promising tool to investigate polewards
   shifts of Atlantic Calanus species and, in general, to assess stage
   compositions in biodiversity assessments of Calanoida, which can be
   notoriously difficult using conventional identification methods.},

Abstract = {Reduced representation sequencing (RRS) is a widely used method to assay
   the diversity of genetic loci across the genome of an organism. The
   dominant class of RRS approaches assay loci associated with restriction
   sites within the genome (restriction site associated DNA sequencing, or
   RADseq). RADseq is frequently applied to non-model organisms since it
   enables population genetic studies without relying on well-characterized
   reference genomes. However, RADseq requires the use of many
   bioinformatic filters to ensure the quality of genotyping calls. These
   filters can have direct impacts on population genetic inference, and
   therefore require careful consideration. One widely used filtering
   approach is the removal of loci that do not conform to expectations of
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Despite being widely used, we show
   that this filtering approach is rarely described in sufficient detail to
   enable replication. Furthermore, through analyses of in silico and
   empirical data sets we show that some of the most widely used HWE
   filtering approaches dramatically impact inference of population
   structure. In particular, the removal of loci exhibiting departures from
   HWE after pooling across samples significantly reduces the degree of
   inferred population structure within a data set (despite this approach
   being widely used). Based on these results, we provide recommendations
   for best practice regarding the implementation of HWE filtering for
   RADseq data sets.},

Abstract = {The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) is revolutionizing the
   monitoring of biodiversity as it allows to assess organismic diversity
   at large scale and unprecedented taxonomic detail. However, eDNA
   consists of an extracellular and intracellular fraction, each
   characterized by particular properties that determine the retrievable
   information on when and where organisms live or have been living. Here,
   we review the fractions of eDNA, describe how to obtain them from
   environmental samples and present a four-scenario concept that aims at
   enhancing spatial and temporal resolution of eDNA-based monitoring.
   Importantly, we highlight how the appropriate choice of eDNA fractions
   precludes misinterpretation of eDNA-based biodiversity data. Finally,
   future avenues of research towards eDNA fraction-specific analyses are
   outlined to unravel the full potential of eDNA-based studies targeting
   micro- and macro-organisms.},

Abstract = {Passive collection is an emerging sampling method for environmental DNA
   (eDNA) in aquatic systems. Passive eDNA collection is inexpensive and
   efficient, and requires minimal equipment, making it suited to
   high-density sampling and remote deployment. Here, we compare the
   effectiveness of nine membrane materials for passively collecting fish
   eDNA from a 3-million-litre marine mesocosm. We submerged materials
   (cellulose, cellulose with 1\% and 3\% chitosan, cellulose overlayed
   with electrospun nanofibres and 1\% chitosan, cotton fibres, hemp
   fibres, and sponge with either zeolite or active carbon) for intervals
   between 5 and 1080 min. We show that for most materials, with as little
   as 5 min of submersion, mitochondrial fish eDNA measured with qPCR, and
   fish species richness measured with metabarcoding, was comparable to
   that collected by conventional filtering. Furthermore, PCR template DNA
   concentrations and species richness were generally not improved
   significantly by longer submersion. Species richness detected for all
   materials ranged between 11 and 37 species, with a median of 27, which
   was comparable to the range for filtered eDNA (19-32). Using scanning
   electron microscopy, we visualized biological matter adhering to the
   surface of materials, rather than entrapped, with images also revealing
   a diversity in size and structure of putative eDNA particles. eDNA can
   be collected rapidly from seawater with a passive approach and using a
   variety of materials. This will suit cost- and time-sensitive biological
   surveys, and where access to equipment is limited.},

Abstract = {The analysis of genomic data can be an intimidating process,
   particularly for researchers who are not experienced programmers.
   Commonly used analyses are spread across many programs, each requiring
   their own specific input formats, and so data must often be repeatedly
   reorganized and transformed into new formats. Analyses often require
   splitting data according to metadata variables such as population or
   family, which can be challenging to manage in large data sets. Here, we
   introduce snpR, a user-friendly data analysis package in R for
   processing SNP genomic data. snpR is designed to automate data
   subsetting and analyses across categorical metadata while also
   streamlining repeated analyses by integrating approaches contained in
   many different packages in a single ecosystem. snpR facilitates
   iterative and efficient analyses centred on a single R object for an
   entire analysis pipeline.},

Abstract = {Tigers are endangered apex predators. They typify endangered species
   because they are elusive, rare, and face numerous threats across their
   range. Tigers also symbolize conservation. However, it is very difficult
   to study tigers because of their stated nature. Also, tiger conservation
   is a geopolitically sensitive topic, making it difficult to use the
   studies to propose evidence-based management that allows their recovery,
   especially in the context of conservation genetics. Zhang et al. (Mol.
   Ecol. Resour., 2022) have created very valuable and rare resources to
   aid the community in conserving tigers. First, they present chromosome
   level genome assemblies of a South China tiger and an Amur tiger.
   Second, they present whole genome sequences of 16 captive South China
   tigers. Additionally, by using the assemblies they model the demographic
   history of these populations, estimate inbreeding and the potential
   threats they face in captivity. This approach is particularly important
   because genetic management is now the only remaining option for South
   China tigers, because they are extinct in the wild. In other words,
   captive individuals are our only hope for some day restoring the wild
   populations of South China tigers.},

Abstract = {Biological specimens in natural history collections constitute a massive
   repository of genetic information. Many specimens have been collected in
   areas in which they no longer exist or in areas where present-day
   collecting is not possible. There are also specimens in collections
   representing populations or species that have gone extinct. Furthermore,
   species or populations may have been sampled throughout an extensive
   time period, which is particularly valuable for studies of genetic
   change through time. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing,
   natural history museum resources have become accessible for genomic
   research. Consequently, these unique resources are increasingly being
   used across many fields of natural history. In this paper, we summarize
   our experiences of resequencing hundreds of genomes from historical
   avian museum specimens. We publish the protocols we have used and
   discuss the entire workflow from sampling and laboratory procedures, to
   the bioinformatic processing of historical specimen data.},

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Distributions of species are frequently treated as responding to current
   environmental conditions across areas that have been accessible to them.
   Although that paradigm has been quite successful in describing
   distributional areas, the effects of land use history have been
   neglected in most studies to date. In this study, we analyzed effects of
   historical land use (i.e., 1850s to present) on distributions of four
   reptile and amphibian species in eastern Kansas. We fit typical species
   distribution models using a broad diversity of descriptors of landscape
   and environmental conditions, and detailed model selection exercises in
   all cases identified a combination of current land use and topographic
   features as the best defining dimensions for species' distributions.
   However, within the areas identified as suitable in these modeling
   exercises, known occurrences of each species were concentrated in areas
   that had been forested in the 1850s, and that remain forested. That is,
   although current land use was crucial, land use history was an important
   modifier, such that distributional ecology must look to more than just
   current environmental conditions in efforts to characterize species'
   geographic distributions comprehensively.},

Abstract = {Extensive efforts to reduce the population of invasive channel catfish

   300 mm) channel catfish in the San Juan River were collected in the
   summer and fall of 2018 and 2019 to quantify ontogenetic change in diet.
   Juveniles primarily consumed aquatic insects and terrestrial plants,
   whereas adults primarily consumed fewer aquatic insects and
   significantly more plants and fish. Logistic regression confirmed these
   diet shifts as a function of total length and suggest the nature of
   interactions between channel catfish and native fishes can change with
   life stage: from potential competitor for aquatic invertebrates, to

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},

Abstract = {Floral morphology can determine the type of animal that can be an
   effective pollinator. In flowers with nocturnal anthesis long-tubed
   flowers may attract long-tongued insects such as hawkmoths. However,
   flowers with more open morphology have nectar that can be more easily
   accessed by bats and short-tongued moths. These contrasting conditions
   may have consequences on nectar characteristics, since bats can mediate
   the selection of copious nectar with low to medium sugar concentration
   values, contrary to what occurs in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers that show
   comparatively lower nectar volumes with medium sugar concentrations.
   Here we describe an overview of the nectar features, secretion patterns
   and removal effects in a guild of plants with crepuscular-nocturnal
   anthesis in the Atlantic Forest, Northeastern Brazil. Such a plant set
   encompassed both species with restricted and easy access to nectar,
   i.e., long-tube flowers and brush-type flowers, respectively. We found a
   marked difference between attributes of nectar between both groups.
   Long-tube flowers offer nectar of higher sugar concentration at specific
   periods of the night that can be reabsorbed later if it has not been
   removed, the brush-type flowers provide nectar of low sugar
   concentrations, throughout the night, and may increase their production
   in response to consumption. These differences can play an important role
   in mechanisms related to the sharing of resources in the community,
   ensuring an even more intimate relationship between long-tube flowers
   and hawkmoths, and allowing brush-type flowers to deal with consumption
   by different nocturnal pollinators.},

Title = {Burn severity in Araucaria araucana forests of northern Patagonia: tree
   mortality scales up to burn severity at plot scale, mediated by

Abstract = {Climate change is forcing shifts in wildfire regimes, altering post-fire
   processes, and threatening the persistence of species and ecosystems.
   Key to assessing the potential for post-fire conversion to an alternate
   vegetation type is understanding drivers of burn severity, which in turn
   influence the material legacies that determine post-fire recovery. In
   Andean Patagonia, pyrophytic (fire promoting) shrublands juxtaposed with
   pyrophobic (fire inhibiting) forests of fire-sensitive species are well
   documented as drivers of fire spread and burn severity. However, the
   capacity of the highly fire- resistant Araucaria araucana to either
   promote or dampen burn severity has not previously been examined. This
   study uses field and remotely sensed data to examine which variables
   control burn severity at tree-, plot- and fire event-scales in large
   fires that burned A. araucana-dominated vegetation in four large fire
   events from 1987 to 2014. Logistic models were developed for each of the
   three scales to test for the factors influencing burn severity. Our
   results show that at the level of the individual tree, crown
   connectivity, tree size, and species strongly affect probability of
   death of individual trees. At a plot level, stand stocking parameters
   are less strongly predictive of burn severity. At a landscape-scale,
   vegetation type and topography, along with climatic and weather
   conditions are strong drivers of burn severity. These findings quantify
   the importance of greater tree size in the survival of the
   fire-resistant A. araucana and reinforce the regional pattern of greater
   fire severity being associated with tall shrubland vegetation in
   comparison to forests.},

Title = {Crimp: An efficient tool for summarizing multiple clusterings in
   population structure analysis and beyond},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {705-711},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {When a data set is repeatedly clustered using unsupervised techniques,
   the resulting clusterings, even if highly similar, may list their
   clusters in different orders. This so-called `label-switching'
   phenomenon obscures meaningful differences between clusterings,
   complicating their comparison and summary. The problem often arises in
   the context of population structure analysis based on multilocus
   genotype data. In this field, a variety of popular tools apply
   model-based clustering, assigning individuals to a prespecified number
   of ancestral populations. Since such methods often involve stochastic
   components, it is a common practice to perform multiple replicate
   analyses based on the same input data and parameter settings. Available
   postprocessing tools allow to mitigate label switching, but leave room
   for improvements, in particular, regarding large input data sets. In
   this work, I present Crimp, a lightweight command-line tool, which
   offers a relatively fast and scalable heuristic to align clusters across
   replicate clusterings consisting of the same number of clusters. For
   small problem sizes, an exact algorithm can be used as an alternative.
   Additional features include row-specific weights, input and output files
   similar to those of CLUMPP (Jakobsson \& Rosenberg, 2007) and the
   evaluation of a given solution in terms of CLUMPP as well as its own
   objective functions. Benchmark analyses show that Crimp, especially when
   applied to larger data sets, tends to outperform alternative tools
   considering runtime requirements and various quality measures. While
   primarily targeting population structure analysis, Crimp can be used as
   a generic tool to correct multiple clusterings for label switching. This
   facilitates their comparison and allows to generate an averaged
   clustering. Crimp's computational efficiency makes it even applicable to
   relatively large data sets while offering competitive solution quality.},

Title = {Fast-tracking bespoke DNA reference database generation from museum
   collections for biomonitoring and conservation},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {Despite recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies,
   a lack of locally relevant DNA reference databases limits the potential
   for DNA-based monitoring of biodiversity for conservation and
   biosecurity applications. Museums and national collections represent a
   compelling source of authoritatively identified genetic material for DNA
   database development, yet obtaining DNA barcodes from long-stored
   specimens may be difficult due to sample degradation. Here we
   demonstrate a sensitive and efficient laboratory and bioinformatic
   process for generating DNA barcodes from hundreds of invertebrate
   specimens simultaneously via the Illumina MiSeq system. Using this
   process, we recovered full-length (334) or partial (105) COI barcodes
   from 439 of 450 (98\%) national collection-held invertebrate specimens.
   This included full-length barcodes from 146 specimens which produced
   low-yield DNA and no visible PCR bands, and which produced as little as
   a single sequence per specimen, demonstrating high sensitivity of the
   process. In many cases, the identity of the most abundant sequences per
   specimen were not the correct barcodes, necessitating the development of
   a taxonomy-informed process for identifying correct sequences among the
   sequencing output. The recovery of only partial barcodes for some taxa
   indicates a need to refine certain PCR primers. Nonetheless, our
   approach represents a highly sensitive, accurate and efficient method
   for targeted reference database generation, providing a foundation for
   DNA-based assessments and monitoring of biodiversity.},

Title = {Guidelines for standardizing the application of discriminant analysis of
   principal components to genotype data},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {523-538},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the popularity of discriminant analysis of principal components
   (DAPC) for studying population structure, there has been little
   discussion of best practice for this method. In this work, I provide
   guidelines for standardizing the application of DAPC to genotype data
   sets. An often overlooked fact is that DAPC generates a model describing
   genetic differences among a set of populations defined by a researcher.
   Appropriate parameterization of this model is critical for obtaining
   biologically meaningful results. I show that the number of leading PC
   axes used as predictors of among-population differences, p(axes), should
   not exceed the k-1 biologically informative PC axes that are expected
   for k effective populations in a genotype data set. This k-1 criterion
   for p(axes) specification is more appropriate compared to the widely
   used proportional variance criterion, which often results in a choice of
   p(axes) >> k-1. DAPC parameterized with no more than the leading k-1 PC
   axes: (i) is more parsimonious; (ii) captures maximal among-population
   variation on biologically relevant predictors; (iii) is less sensitive
   to unintended interpretations of population structure; and (iv) is more
   generally applicable to independent sample sets. Assessing model fit
   should be routine practice and aids interpretation of population
   structure. It is imperative that researchers articulate their study
   goals, that is, testing a priori expectations vs. studying de novo
   inferred populations, because this has implications on how their DAPC
   results should be interpreted. The discussion and practical
   recommendations in this work provide the molecular ecology community
   with a roadmap for using DAPC in population genetic investigations.},

Title = {Application of palaeogenetic techniques to historic mollusc shells

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Natural history collections worldwide contain a plethora of mollusc
   shells. Recent studies have detailed the sequencing of DNA extracted
   from shells up to thousands of years old and from various taphonomic and
   preservational contexts. However, previous approaches have largely
   addressed methodological rather than evolutionary research questions.
   Here, we report the generation of DNA sequence data from mollusc shells
   using such techniques, applied to Haliotis virginea Gmelin, 1791, a New
   Zealand abalone, in which morphological variation has led to the
   recognition of several forms and subspecies. We successfully recovered
   near-complete mitogenomes from 22 specimens including 12 dry-preserved
   shells up to 60 years old. We used a combination of palaeogenetic
   techniques that have not previously been applied to shell, including DNA
   extraction optimized for ultra-short fragments and hybridization-capture
   of single-stranded DNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three
   major, well-supported clades comprising samples from: (1) The Three
   Kings Islands; (2) the Auckland, Chatham and Antipodes Islands; and (3)
   mainland New Zealand and Campbell Island. This phylogeographic structure
   does not correspond to the currently recognized forms. Critically, our
   nonreliance on freshly collected or ethanol-preserved samples enabled
   inclusion of topotypes of all recognized subspecies as well as
   additional difficult-to-sample populations. Broader application of these
   comparatively cost-effective and reliable methods to modern, historical,
   archaeological and palaeontological shell samples has the potential to
   revolutionize invertebrate genetic research.},

Abstract = {Many emerging infectious diseases originate from wild animals, so there
   is a profound need for surveillance and monitoring of their pathogens.
   However, the practical difficulty of sample acquisition from wild
   animals tends to limit the feasibility and effectiveness of such
   surveys. Xenosurveillance, using blood-feeding invertebrates to obtain
   tissue samples from wild animals and then detect their pathogens, is a
   promising method to do so. Here, we describe the use of tsetse fly blood
   meals to determine (directly through molecular diagnostic and indirectly
   through serology), the diversity of circulating blood-borne pathogens
   (including bacteria, viruses and protozoa) in a natural mammalian
   community of Tanzania. Molecular analyses of captured tsetse flies (182
   pools of flies totalizing 1728 flies) revealed that the blood meals
   obtained came from 18 different vertebrate species including 16
   non-human mammals, representing approximately 25\% of the large mammal
   species present in the study area. Molecular diagnostic demonstrated the
   presence of different protozoa parasites and bacteria of medical and/or
   veterinary interest. None of the six virus species searched for by
   molecular methods were detected but an ELISA test detected antibodies
   against African swine fever virus among warthogs, indicating that the
   virus had been circulating in the area. Sampling of blood-feeding
   insects represents an efficient and practical approach to tracking a
   diversity of pathogens from multiple mammalian species, directly through
   molecular diagnostic or indirectly through serology, which could readily
   expand and enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of
   infectious agents and their interactions with their hosts in wild animal
   communities.},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is a highly sensitive and
   cost-effective technique for wildlife monitoring, notably through the
   use of qPCR assays. However, it can be difficult to ensure assay
   specificity when many closely related species co-occur. In theory,
   specificity may be assessed in silico by determining whether assay
   oligonucleotides have enough base-pair mismatches with nontarget
   sequences to preclude amplification. However, the mismatch qualities
   required are poorly understood, making in silico assessments difficult
   and often necessitating extensive in vitro testing-typically the
   greatest bottleneck in assay development. Increasing the accuracy of in
   silico assessments would therefore streamline the assay development
   process. In this study, we paired 10 qPCR assays with 82 synthetic gene
   fragments for 530 specificity tests using SYBR Green intercalating dye
   (n = 262) and TaqMan hydrolysis probes (n = 268). Test results were used
   to train random forest classifiers to predict amplification. The
   primer-only model (SYBR Green results) and full-assay model (TaqMan
   probe-based results) were 99.6\% and 100\% accurate, respectively, in
   cross-validation. We further assessed model performance using six
   independent assays not used in model training. In these tests the
   primer-only model was 92.4\% accurate (n = 119) and the full-assay model
   was 96.5\% accurate (n = 144). The high performance achieved by these
   models makes it possible for eDNA practitioners to more quickly and
   confidently develop assays specific to the intended target.
   Practitioners can access the full-assay model online via eDNAssay (), a
   user-friendly tool for predicting qPCR cross-amplification.},

Title = {Do pseudogenes pose a problem for metabarcoding marine animal
   communities?},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2897-2914},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Because DNA metabarcoding typically employs sequence diversity among
   mitochondrial amplicons to estimate species composition, nuclear
   mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs) can inflate diversity. This study
   quantifies the incidence and attributes of NUMTs derived from the 658-bp
   barcode region of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) in 156 marine animal
   genomes. NUMTs were examined to ascertain if they could be recognized by
   their possession of indels or stop codons. In total, 309 NUMTs >= 150 bp
   were detected, with an average of 1.98 per species (range = 0-33) and a
   mean length of 391 +/- 200 bp. Among this total, 75 (24.3\%) lacked
   indels or stop codons. NUMTs appear to pose the greatest
   interpretational risk when short (<313 bp) amplicons are used, such as
   in environmental DNA studies, dietary analyses or processed fish
   identification. Employing the standard amplicon length (313 bp) for
   marine metabarcoding, NUMTs could potentially inflate the operational
   taxonomic unit (OTU) count by 21\% above the true species count while
   also raising intraspecific variation at COI by 15\%. However, when both
   amplicon length and position are considered, inflation in OTU counts and
   in barcode variation were just 9\% and 10\%, respectively, suggesting
   NUMTs will not seriously distort biodiversity assessments. There was a
   weak positive correlation between genome size and NUMT count but no
   variation among phyla or trophic groups. Until bioinformatic advances
   improve NUMT detection, the best defence involves targeting long
   amplicons and developing reference databases that include both
   mitochondrial sequences and their NUMT derivatives.},

Abstract = {The environmental DNA (eDNA) method, which is widely applied in
   biomonitoring, is limited to laboratory analysis and processing. In this
   study, we developed a filtration/extraction component using a
   microfluidic channel, the Biryu-Chip (BC), and a filtration/extraction
   method, the BC method, to minimize the volume of the sample necessary
   for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification. We tested the
   performance of the BC method and compared it with that of the Sterivex
   filtration/extraction method using aquarium and river water samples. We
   observed that using the BC method, the same concentration of extracted
   DNA was obtained with 1/20-1/40 of the filtration volume of the Sterivex
   method, suggesting that the BC method can be widely used for eDNA
   measurement. In addition, we performed on-site measurements of eDNA
   within 30 min using a mobile PCR device, demonstrating that filtration
   and extraction can be performed easily and quickly using the BC method.
   The PCR results obtained using the BC method were similar to those
   obtained using the Sterivex method. The BC method requires fewer steps;
   therefore, the risk of DNA contamination can be reduced. When combined
   with mobile PCR, the BC method can be applied to easily detect eDNA
   within 30 min from the collection of water sample, even on-site.},

Abstract = {Nucleotide diversity remains an important statistic in population
   genetic/genomic studies. Although recent advances in massive sequencing
   make generating sequence data sets cheaper and faster, currently used
   technologies often introduce substantial amounts of missing nucleotides
   in their output. A novel method of estimating pi from data sets
   containing missing data - pixy - has also recently been proposed. In
   this study, the pixy estimator, pi(pixy), was compared to average
   weighted nucleotide diversity, pi(W). The estimators were tested both on
   sequences simulated in fastsimcoal and real sequence sets. Both sets
   were modified by random insertion of missing nucleotides. Weighted
   nucleotide diversity performed better in all pairwise comparisons. It
   was characterized by a smaller error and a narrower distribution of the
   results. pi(pixy) tends to overestimate the nucleotide diversity when
   both the proportion of missing data and the level of variation is low.
   Of the two estimators, only pi(W) estimated the true nucleotide
   diversity in a part of the simulations. A simple formula for estimating
   pi(W) allows for easy integration of the estimator in packages such as
   pixy, which would allow obtaining more precise estimates of nucleotide
   diversity either in a sliding window or for discrete genomic regions.},

Abstract = {Mercury (Hg) methylation genes (hgcAB) mediate the formation of the
   toxic methylmercury and have been identified from diverse environments,
   including freshwater and marine ecosystems, Arctic permafrost, forest
   and paddy soils, coal-ash amended sediments, chlor-alkali plants
   discharges and geothermal springs. Here we present the first attempt at
   a standardized protocol for the detection, identification and
   quantification of hgc genes from metagenomes. Our Hg-cycling
   microorganisms in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Hg-MATE) database,
   a catalogue of hgc genes, provides the most accurate information to date
   on the taxonomic identity and functional/metabolic attributes of
   microorganisms responsible for Hg methylation in the environment.
   Furthermore, we introduce ``marky-coco{''}, a ready-to-use bioinformatic
   pipeline based on de novo single-metagenome assembly, for easy and
   accurate characterization of hgc genes from environmental samples. We
   compared the recovery of hgc genes from environmental metagenomes using
   the marky-coco pipeline with an approach based on coassembly of multiple
   metagenomes. Our data show similar efficiency in both approaches for
   most environments except those with high diversity (i.e., paddy soils)
   for which a coassembly approach was preferred. Finally, we discuss the
   definition of true hgc genes and methods to normalize hgc gene counts
   from metagenomes.},

Abstract = {It was not known that phylogenetic analysis of population genetic data
   would show geographic structure when Avise et al. (1979) introduced the
   unnamed field of phylogeography. Since then, the field has grown from
   using single gene fragments to whole genomes resulting in more than
   22,000 publications. This seemingly simple relationship between
   geography and genetic variation has provided the foundation for studying
   speciation, species delimitation, hybrid zone dynamics, adaptation,
   conservation genetics, community assembly, and historical demography to
   name a few (see Burbrink \& Ruane, 2021; Edwards et al., 2016). As with
   many burgeoning fields, there is often little consideration of how to
   make data sets accessible for future researchers addressing more
   comprehensive questions under a common framework. For example, it is
   important in biogeography to examine how shared environments or barriers
   affect population structure across communities of species, or test if
   range size or latitude are correlated with genetic diversity across taxa
   (Myers et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2017). However, addressing these
   types of questions using existing data requires researchers to assemble
   large databases manually. Genetic and geographic databases used to store
   this information like NCBI Genbank (National Center for Biotechnology
   Information) and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) are
   disconnected, and often of limited general use for conducting multitaxon
   studies. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Pelletier et al.
   (2022) have automated the process of connecting geography to DNA
   sequences via the phylogatR (phylogeographic data aggregation and
   repurposing) database.},

Volume = {22},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Large and hyperdiverse marine ecosystems pose significant challenges to
   biodiversity monitoring. While environmental DNA (eDNA) promises to meet
   many of these challenges, recent studies suggested that sponges, as
   ``natural samplers{''} of eDNA, could further streamline the workflow
   for detecting marine vertebrates. However, beyond pilot studies
   demonstrating the ability of sponges to capture eDNA, little is known
   about the dynamics of eDNA particles in sponge tissue, and the
   effectiveness of the latter compared to water samples. Here, we present
   the results of a controlled aquarium experiment to examine the
   persistence and detectability of eDNA captured by three encrusting
   sponge species and compare the sponge's eDNA capturing ability with
   established water filtration techniques. Our results indicate that
   sponges and water samples have highly similar detectability for fish of
   different sizes and abundances, but different sponge species exhibit
   considerable variance in performance. Interestingly, one sponge appeared
   to mirror the eDNA degradation profile of water samples, while another
   sponge retained eDNA throughout the experiment. A third sponge yielded
   virtually no DNA sequences at all. Overall, our study suggests that some
   sponges will be suitable as natural samplers, while others will
   introduce significant problems for laboratory processing. We suggest
   that an initial optimization phase will be required in any future
   studies aiming to employ sponges for biodiversity assessment. With time,
   factoring in technical and natural accessibility, it is expected that
   specific sponge taxa may become the ``chosen{''} natural samplers in
   certain habitats and regions.},

Title = {Detecting clonemate pairs in multicellular diploid clonal species based
   on a shared heterozygosity index},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Clonal reproduction, the formation of nearly identical individuals via
   mitosis in the absence of genetic recombination, is a very common
   reproductive mode across plants, fungi and animals. To detect clonal
   genetic structure, genetic similarity indices based on shared alleles
   are widely used, such as the Jaccard index, or identity by state. Here
   we propose a new pairwise genetic similarity index, the SH index, based
   on segregating genetic marker loci (typically single nucleotide
   polymorphisms) that are identically heterozygous for pairs of samples
   (N-SH). To test our method, we analyse two old seagrass clones
   (Posidonia australis, estimated to be around 8500 years old; Zostera
   marina, >750 years old) along with two young Z. marina clones of known
   age (17 years old). We show that focusing on shared heterozygosity
   amplifies the power to distinguish sample pairs belonging to different
   clones compared to methods focusing on all shared alleles. Our proposed
   workflow can successfully detect clonemates at a location dominated by a
   single clone. When the collected samples involve two or more clones, the
   SH index shows a clear gap between clonemate pairs and interclone sample
   pairs. Ideally N-SH should be on the order of approximately >= 3000, a
   number easily achievable via restriction-site associated DNA (RAD)
   sequencing or whole-genome resequencing. Another potential application
   of the SH index is to detect possible parent-descendant pairs under
   selfing. Our proposed workflow takes advantage of the availability of
   the larger number of genetic markers in the genomic era, and improves
   the ability to distinguish clonemates from nonclonemates in
   multicellular diploid clonal species.},

Abstract = {Allometric scaling, that is scaling patterns in physiological processes
   relative to body size, can be used to overcome the current limitations

   transcripts to characterize a complex community. In contrast to
   metagenomics, metatranscriptomics allows one to simultaneously address
   community composition and functionality through the characterization of
   the community transcriptome. Hence, insights into metabolic processes
   and molecular pathways can also be obtained. Despite its increasing use
   in community ecology, a major limitation and source of error is the
   variation in RNA transcript abundance across organisms varying in body
   size. Hence, this may lead to incorrect estimations of the community
   structure and functioning as larger RNA quantities from larger
   individuals may overestimate their community contribution.},

Title = {ploidyfrost: Reference-free estimation of ploidy level from whole genome
   sequencing data based on de Bruijn graphs},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Polyploidy is ubiquitous and its consequences are complex and variable.
   A change of ploidy level generally influences genetic diversity and
   results in morphological, physiological and ecological differences
   between cells or organisms with different ploidy levels. To avoid
   cumbersome experiments and take advantage of the less biased information
   provided by the vast amounts of genome sequencing data, computational
   tools for ploidy estimation are urgently needed. Until now, although a
   few such tools have been developed, many aspects of this estimation,
   such as the requirement of a reference genome, the lack of informative
   results and objective inferences, and the influence of false positives
   from errors and repeats, need further improvement. We have developed
   ploidyfrost, a de Bruijn graph-based method, to estimate ploidy levels
   from whole genome sequencing data sets without a reference genome.
   ploidyfrost provides a visual representation of allele frequency
   distribution generated using the ggplot2 package as well as quantitative
   results using the Gaussian mixture model. In addition, it takes
   advantage of colouring information encoded in coloured de Bruijn graphs
   to analyse multiple samples simultaneously and to flexibly filter
   putative false positives. We evaluated the performance of ploidyfrost by
   analysing highly heterozygous or repetitive samples of Cyclocarya
   paliurus and a complex allooctoploid sample of Fragaria x ananassa.
   Moreover, we demonstrated that the accuracy of analysis results can be
   improved by constraining a threshold such as Cramer's V coefficient on
   variant features, which may significantly reduce the side effects of
   sequencing errors and annoying repeats on the graphical structure
   constructed.},

Abstract = {Microbiome studies are often limited by a lack of statistical power due
   to small sample sizes and a large number of features. This problem is
   exacerbated in correlative studies of multi-omic datasets. Statistical
   power can be increased by finding and summarizing modules of correlated
   observations, which is one dimensionality reduction method.
   Additionally, modules provide biological insight as correlated groups of
   microbes can have relationships among themselves. To address these
   challenges, we developed SCNIC: Sparse Cooccurrence Network
   Investigation for compositional data. SCNIC is open-source software that
   can generate correlation networks and detect and summarize modules of
   highly correlated features. Modules can be formed using either the
   Louvain Modularity Maximization (LMM) algorithm or a Shared Minimum
   Distance algorithm (SMD) that we newly describe here and relate to LMM
   using simulated data. We applied SCNIC to two published datasets and we
   achieved increased statistical power and identified microbes that not
   only differed across groups, but also correlated strongly with each
   other, suggesting shared environmental drivers or cooperative
   relationships among them. SCNIC provides an easy way to generate
   correlation networks, identify modules of correlated features and
   summarize them for downstream statistical analysis. Although SCNIC was
   designed considering properties of microbiome data, such as
   compositionality and sparsity, it can be applied to a variety of data
   types including metabolomics data and used to integrate multiple data
   types. SCNIC allows for the identification of functional microbial
   relationships at scale while increasing statistical power through
   feature reduction.},

Title = {Reconstructing queen genotypes by pool sequencing colonies in eusocial

Abstract = {Eusocial insects are crucial to many ecosystems, and particularly the
   honeybee (Apis mellifera). One approach to facilitate their study in
   molecular genetics, is to consider whole-colony genotyping by combining
   DNA of multiple individuals in a single pool sequencing experiment.
   Cheap and fast, this technique comes with the drawback of producing data
   requiring dedicated methods to be fully exploited. Despite this
   limitation, pool sequencing data have been shown to be informative and
   cost-effective when working on random mating populations. Here, we
   present new statistical methods for exploiting pool sequencing of
   eusocial colonies in order to reconstruct the genotypes of the queen of
   such colony. This leverages the possibility to monitor genetic
   diversity, perform genomic-based studies or implement selective
   breeding. Using simulations and honeybee real data, we show that the new
   methods allow for a fast and accurate estimation of the queen's genetic
   ancestry, with correlations of about 0.9 to that obtained from
   individual genotyping. Also, it allows for an accurate reconstruction of
   the queen genotypes, with about 2\% genotyping error. We further
   validate these inferences using experimental data on colonies with both
   pool sequencing and individual genotyping of drones. In brief, in this
   study we present statistical models to accurately estimate the genetic
   ancestry and reconstruct the genotypes of the queen from pool sequencing
   data from workers of an eusocial colony. Such information allows to
   exploit pool sequencing for traditional population genetics analyses,
   association studies and for selective breeding. While validated in Apis
   mellifera, these methods are applicable to other eusocial hymenopterans.},

Abstract = {The European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, is an ecologically significant,
   globally invasive avian species that is also suffering from a major
   decline in its native range. Here, we present the genome assembly and
   long-read transcriptome of an Australian-sourced European starling (S.
   vulgaris vAU), and a second, North American, short-read genome assembly
   (S. vulgaris vNA), as complementary reference genomes for population
   genetic and evolutionary characterization. S. vulgaris vAU combined 10x
   genomics linked-reads, low-coverage Nanopore sequencing, and PacBio
   Iso-Seq full-length transcript scaffolding to generate a 1050 Mb
   assembly on 6222 scaffolds (7.6 Mb scaffold N50, 94.6\% busco
   completeness). Further scaffolding against the high-quality zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata) genome assigned 98.6\% of the assembly to 32
   putative nuclear chromosome scaffolds. Species-specific transcript
   mapping and gene annotation revealed good gene-level assembly and high
   functional completeness. Using S. vulgaris vAU, we demonstrate how the
   multifunctional use of PacBio Iso-Seq transcript data and complementary
   homology-based annotation of sequential assembly steps (assessed using a
   new tool, saaga) can be used to assess, inform, and validate assembly
   workflow decisions. We also highlight some counterintuitive behaviour in
   traditional busco metrics, and present buscomp, a complementary tool for
   assembly comparison designed to be robust to differences in assembly
   size and base-calling quality. This work expands our knowledge of avian
   genomes and the available toolkit for assessing and improving genome
   quality. The new genomic resources presented will facilitate further
   global genomic and transcriptomic analysis on this ecologically
   important species.},

Abstract = {Climate is one of the most important elements affecting the distribution
   of species, and it is expected that the distribution of species will be
   widely influenced by climate change. In plants, edaphic factors also
   play a special role along with climate in determining the distribution
   range. The current study aimed to predict the future distribution of the
   Persian manna (Astragalus adscendens), an endemic perennial shrub in
   Zagros Mountains of Western Iran. For this purpose, two sets of static
   (i.e. edaphic and physiographic) and dynamic (i.e. climatic) data and an
   ensemble approach were used to develop two edaphic-physiographic and
   climatic models. Current and future suitability maps are representative
   of the climatic and the edaphic-physiographic niches of A. Adscendens
   that were obtained based on climatic suitable areas filtered by
   edaphic-physiographic model. The filtered map has less suitable habitats
   compared to the climatic model. Three dynamic variables (mean
   temperature of wettest quarter, temperature seasonality, temperature
   annual range) and two static variables (altitude and volumetric fraction
   of coarse fragments) were identified as the most important factors in
   determining the habitat of A. Adscendens. The importance of altitude was
   greater than latitude in maintaining or losing suitable habitats under
   different climate change scenarios, suggesting that the species will not
   have range expansion or northward shift due to no significant shift in
   latitude and longitude. Results revealed a sharp decline in the suitable
   habitats in such that 67\% and 91\% of the current habitat may be lost
   by the year 2050 and 2070, respectively. Area reduction was more extreme
   in future scenarios with the higher level of CO2 emission. Range
   contraction of A. Adscendens will increases the risk of extinction. This
   study provides insights into the response of mountain plants, especially
   range restricted species, to climate change, revealing major dimensions
   of plant niche. Therefore, developing habitat management and
   conservation plans to preserve the predicted habitats of such species
   are required to preserve the predicted sustainable habitats.},

Abstract = {The synergistic impact of climate change and biological invasions poses
   major threats to biodiversity. Although previous studies have revealed
   that climate warming enhances the invasiveness of non-native plants,
   little is known about the eco-physiological mechanisms underlying the
   changes in invasiveness promoted by a changing climate. In this study,
   we aimed to determine the effects of warming on the phenology and
   eco-physiological background of the invasive annual weed Bidens pilosa
   var. pilosa in temperate regions. We compared the timing of germination,
   seedling growth, and flowering phenology at two study sites that
   differed in the mean annual temperature by 2.8 degrees C. From winter to
   early spring, germination commenced earlier; seedling growth was more
   rapid at the warmer site than at the cooler site. In the warmer site,
   some seedlings bore flowers from winter to early spring (spring
   flowering), whereas spring flowering was rarely recorded at the cooler
   site. The results of laboratory experiments indicated that spring
   flowering occurred when the daylength was sufficiently short for
   induction of flowering and when the growth stage exceeded a threshold
   size. To assess the impact of phenological shifts on invasiveness, we
   constructed a simple model for estimating the number of seeds produced
   annually (propagule pressure). Model estimates indicated that even
   partial spring flowering resulted in an exponential increase in
   propagule pressure. These findings indicate that phenological shifts
   caused by warmer temperature resulted in a substantial increase in
   invasiveness, which is more pronounced than that caused by growth
   promotion alone.},

Abstract = {Mangrove species are undergoing environmental changes from nutrient-poor
   to enrichment due to the large nutrient input. The potential difference
   in adaptive strategies between the slow- and fast-growing species may
   lead to great changes in species interaction and ecosystem stability.
   This study aims to test whether the slow-growing species Aegiceras
   corniculatum (L.) Blanco and Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu \& Yong sp.
   nov. are distinctly different from a fast-growing species Laguncularia
   racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. in response to soil nutrient enrichment. With
   the increase of soil nutrients, L. racemosa shifted from a more
   conservative to a more acquisitive strategy. The potential causes
   included the increases in specific leaf area, nutrient resorption
   efficiency, and photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the increase of
   leaf delta C-13 and unchanged leaf succulence, as well as the relocation
   of photosynthetic products as indicated by the shift toward fast-growing
   at the cost of constructive and defense compounds. In contrast, A.
   corniculatum and K. obovata maintained conservative strategies at any
   soil nutrient levels with only a slight increase in growth. These
   findings implied that L. racemosa will be more competitive over the
   slow-growing species in nutrient-rich soils through altering adaptive
   strategies.},

Title = {Phenotypic variation along urban-to-rural gradients: an attempt to
   disentangle the mechanisms at play using the alien species Matricaria
   discoidea (Asteraceae)},

Abstract = {Cities often exhibit higher temperatures, drier soils and greater
   habitat fragmentation than rural areas, and may thus represent
   constraining growing environments for plants. This variety of
   environmental conditions along urban-to-rural gradients might lead to
   plasticity in plant traits. Urban conditions could affect plant traits
   such as germination or flower number - key variables for organismal
   fitness. These proxies of fitness could then potentially experience
   strong selection in urban environments. Trait variations among
   individuals are not only due to genotype or the environmental
   conditions: they can also result from the conditions in which the mother
   individual developed, i.e. environmental maternal effects. Understanding
   the impact of city environments on phenotypes might be especially
   important for alien plant species, as these are often showing
   exceptionally high density and diversity in cities. However, studies of
   the sources of alien plant trait variations in urban environments are
   rare. We conducted a simulated reciprocal common garden experiment using
   seeds of populations of M. discoidea along urbanization gradients in
   Belgium. These seeds were sown in growth chambers to study how
   germination, growth, and flowering traits of the alien species
   Matricaria discoidea vary in response to temperature (rural or urban)
   and soil (rural or urban) treatments and the urbanity (percentage of
   impervious surfaces) of its source population. We found predominant
   effects of seed mass and germination delay which materialized important
   environmental maternal effects. We observed a higher germination success
   and delay for heavier seeds, and a greater number of capitula and dry
   biomass for plants that germinated earlier. Climate and soil treatments
   led to plasticity in the majority of the measured traits, with a faster
   germination and heavier plants in the urban temperature treatment but
   lighter plants in the urban soil treatment. Our results therefore
   support the existence of predominant environmental maternal effects and
   phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature and soil treatments,
   but no visible evidence of local adaptation.},

Abstract = {Allometric scaling of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) provides
   information on species adaptation to resource availability and nutrient
   limitation of primary production. Studies examining how plant functional
   traits vary spatially have historically used global datasets, which may
   blur variation at local scale and thus some of the key drivers. Global
   studies have observed leaf N-P scaling exponents varied across different
   functional groups, latitudinal zones, ecoregions, and sites. However,
   whether these trends are consistent in a local habitat is still unclear.
   Here, we capitalized on a soil P availability gradient in subtropical
   China to examine scaling exponents of leaf N-P. We investigated 21 woody
   species at P-rich and P-poor sites for two consecutive years and
   estimated scaling exponents of leaf N-P across P-type sites, leaf ages,
   plant functional types, and phylogeny. The exponents varied across the
   abovementioned levels from 0.356 to 0.699. Averaged across all plant
   species, the exponent of 0.612 was a departure from the global average
   of (2)/(3) (0.66) and (3)/(4) (0.75). Two types of P-sites did not
   affect N-P exponents of deciduous-broadleaved trees and evergreen
   conifers. Our findings indicated that leaf N-P scaling exponents
   significantly differed within plant functional types and highlighted the
   resource availability in shaping nutrient cycling and evolutionary
   processes at local scales.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has
   stimulated considerable research efforts into their potential
   ecotoxicological consequences. There are a number of pharmaceuticals
   targeting adrenergic receptors; however, relatively few studies have
   explored the effects of adrenergic alpha-antagonists (or alpha-blockers)
   on fish. In this study, moxisylyte was selected as a representative
   alpha-blocker, and Japanese medaka embryos were exposed to moxisylyte
   (1-625 mu g/L) for 44 days. Moxisylyte caused no significant or only
   marginal effects on the mortality, development, and growth; however,
   most genes involved in detoxification and antioxidant were
   transcriptionally upregulated, and antioxidant enzymes activities were
   induced as well. Moxisylyte exposure resulted in transcriptional
   downregulation of most of the steroidogenesis genes, and accordingly,
   the mRNA levels of steroid hormone receptors and vitellogenin decreased,
   particularly in males, indicating that moxisylyte disrupts the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in a gender-specific manner.
   Therefore, the risk of a-blockers on fish should not be overlooked and
   deserves further investigation.},

Abstract = {Glyphosate herbicide is widely used in worldwide crop production.
   Consequently, its active ingredient, surfactants, and adjuvants commonly
   reach the aquatic ecosystem, thereby harming the biota. An investigation
   into how this herbicide affects aquatic species is important, especially
   in fish, as they have the ability to absorb and concentrate toxins. We
   aimed to evaluate the effects of glyphosate on the embryonic, larval and
   adult stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio), an appreciable organismal
   model. In this sense, we performed a meta-analysis using published
   articles from online databases (PubMed and ScienceDirect), which covered
   studies published until 2022. From a massive compilation of studies
   evaluating the effects of active substance glyphosate and
   Glyphosate-Based Herbicides (GBH) on zebrafish, we selected 36 studies
   used in downstream analyses. Overall, we report that glyphosate affects
   developmental stages and demonstrates toxicity and damage in zebrafish.
   We observed that embryos exposed to glyphosate exhibit increased
   mortality. There was also an increase in the number of morphological
   abnormalities related to yolk sac oedema, pericardial oedema, spinal
   curvature and body malformations, and a decrease in body size was
   observed. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of beats. The
   biochemical results demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species
   and antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals in the gills. The
   literature shows that glyphosate decreased the distance covered and the
   mean speed of the animals and increased the number of rotations. We
   concluded that glyphosate causes damage in the embryonic, larval and
   adult stages of this species. These results are valid for zebrafish and
   can be applied to other freshwater fish species.},

Abstract = {Bisphenol S (BP-S) is one of the most important substitutes of bisphenol
   A (BP-A), and its environmental occurrence is predicted to intensify in
   the future. Both BP-A and BP-S were tested for adverse effects on early
   life stages of Arbacia lixula sea urchins at 0.1 up to 100 mu M test
   concentrations, by evaluating cytogenetic and developmental toxicity
   endpoints. Embryonic malformations and/or mortality were scored to
   determine embryotoxicity (72 h post-fertilization). It has been reported
   in academic dataset that bisphenols concentration reached mu g/L in
   aquatic environment of heavily polluted areas. We have chosen
   concentrations ranging from 0.1-100 mu M in order to highlight, in
   particular, BP-S effects. Attention should be paid to this range of
   concentrations in the context of the evaluation of the toxicity and the
   ecological risk of BP-S as emerging pollutant. Cytogenetic toxicity was
   measured, using mitotic activity and chromosome aberrations score in
   embryos (6 h post-fertilization). Both BP-A and BP-S exposures induced
   embryotoxic effects from 2.5 to 100 mu M test concentrations as compared
   to controls. Malformed embryo percentages following BP-A exposure were
   significantly higher than in BP-Sexposed embryos from 0.25 to 100 mu M
   (with a similar to 5-fold difference). BP-A, not BP-S exhibited
   cytogenetic toxicity at 25 and 100 mu M. Our results indicate an
   embryotoxic potential of bisphenols during critical periods of
   development with a potent rank order to BP-A vs. BP-S. Thus, we show
   that BP-A alternative induce similar toxic effects to BP-A with lower
   severity.},

Abstract = {Unveiling the ecological processes driving diversity and its
   relationship to the environment remains a central goal in ecological
   studies. Here, we investigated the elevation effect on plant beta-,
   phylogenetic and alpha-diversity patterns in the coastal Atlantic
   Forest, considering two scenarios: excluding one basal clade (tree
   ferns), which are usually neglected in diversity analysis, and depicting
   the patterns of the five richest families. To do so, we compiled a
   forest dataset with 22,236 individuals (trees, palms, and tree ferns)
   from 17 plots in southeastern Brazil. We found significant phylogenetic
   and species rates of turnover along the elevational gradient; however,
   species dissimilarities were higher than phylogenetic dissimilarities
   between communities. Alpha phylodiversity showed a monotonic decrease
   with increasing elevation, including or not tree ferns, while the
   phylogenetic structure was highly affected by the inclusion of tree
   ferns. We found that the unimodal species diversity pattern of the whole
   community emerged from differences among the species distributions of
   the richest families (e.g., Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, and Fabaceae), while
   phylogenetic diversity seemed to be gradually filtered by elevation. The
   higher species diversification within families and their different
   diversity patterns might support the idea of different ecological
   strategies leading to a high species co-occurrence in Tropical Forests.
   Thus, we show that the intricated effects of elevation on species
   assemblages can be better assessed using both ecological and
   evolutionary approaches, stressing the importance of species selection
   in diversity analyses. These results should be considered in
   conservation planning, since focusing only on greater diversity for the
   whole community may not encompass the high diversity of all Tropical
   Forest families.},

Abstract = {The well-studied interactions between ants and plants range from
   antagonistic relationships to mutualisms, but ant pollination studies
   are still overlooked. Here, we studied ant interactions with
   Microstachys serrulata shrubs in a tropical savanna, in Uberlandia,
   Brazil, highlighting the central role of ants in plant pollination.
   Additionally, we described the phenology and the main aspects of its
   floral biology. We evaluated the importance of ants for pollination,
   comparing the number of fruits produced between the treatments: control
   (all pollinator access), ant exclusion, flying insect exclusion, and
   exclusion of all visitors. We also evaluated floral visitors, pollen
   viability, and conducted experiments to test for apomixis. Furthermore,
   we described its phenology using observations throughout 1 year. We
   found an unspecialized guild of insects visiting the flowers, with ants
   being the most common visitors. Visitation by ants only was as effective
   as controls for producing fruit. Although other insects can act as
   pollinators, the high abundance of ants suggests they are the most
   effective pollinators. Minor fruit production occurred by apomixis, but
   the low number of fruits produced and the pollen-ovule ratio reinforce
   the need for a biotic pollinator. Our study shows that ants can act as
   pollinators in simplified systems and could thus be more important for
   pollination than previously expected. The Brazilian savanna has high ant
   diversity and many plants with low floral specialization, which may make
   it a favorable environment for ant pollination. We suggest that
   pollination by ants in dry or arid Neotropical environments is
   underestimated, but likely a critical interaction for many plant
   species.},

Abstract = {Myrtaceae family presents high species richness in the Atlantic Forest
   Domain (AFD) of South America, which is considered a world biodiversity
   hotspot. Evidence indicates that the vegetation composition of the AFD
   changes from the northern to the southern portion of its territory. We
   aimed at understanding patterns of Myrtaceae species richness and
   composition throughout the AFD, underlying geoclimatic variables
   responsible for Myrtaceae biodiversity distribution. Thus, our study
   intends to shed light on the relationship between landscape and climate
   variation to Myrtaceae species richness and composition. We created a
   matrix of Myrtaceae species occurrence across 57 sites throughout the
   AFD and extracted geoclimatic co-variables for these sites to predict
   Myrtaceae diversity and distribution. We explored Myrtaceae composition
   descriptively through richness and Jaccard dissimilarity index. We
   employed a generalized linear model and a redundancy analysis (RDA)
   approach depicting the variations of Myrtaceae richness and distribution
   related to co-variables. We found 977 Myrtaceae occurrences representing
   299 species belonging to 16 genera. The average dissimilarity between
   locations was 94.5\%. Elevation, distance from the ocean, duration of
   water excess period in days, mean diurnal temperature range,
   precipitation of wettest month, severity of the water deficit period,
   and temperature seasonality were the main co-variables that predict the
   variation in Myrtaceae richness and composition. Our study contributes
   to understanding biogeographic and evolutionary patterns of Myrtaceae in
   the Neotropics, providing valuable information for conservation
   decisions against an overwhelming conjuncture of threats across AFD.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are part of the global environmental changes that
   characterize the Anthropocene. Invasive trees can reduce native species
   cover and richness in plant communities. The mechanisms that cause such
   changes may be related to the presence (direct factors) or functional
   traits of introduced species (indirect factors), in addition to changes
   in abiotic factors. In this study, joint species distribution models
   were built based on a Bayesian framework to assess direct and indirect
   effects of the presence of the invasive tree Terminalia catappa on
   different structural levels of plant communities, including species
   diversity and composition, along with functional traits and
   co-occurrence patterns of native species. Plants were sampled in areas
   underneath the crown of T. catappa trees (n = 30), paired with areas
   without the invasive tree (n = 30). Height and crown area of each T.
   catappa tree as well as litter thickness and percentage of bare soil
   were measured/estimated in all plots. The presence of T. catappa changed
   the composition of plant communities, facilitated the development of
   shade-tolerant species, and led to the loss of positive and negative
   associations between native species. The coastal ecosystem assessed in
   our study tends to be converted from a herb-shrub heliophyte assembly to
   vegetation dominated by trees and vines that develop better in shady or
   diffused light habitats. We highlight the relevance of collecting data
   on structural and functional characteristics of the plant community to
   allow for a detailed understanding of the direct and indirect effects of
   plant invasions on coastal ecosystems.},

Title = {Leaf-cutting ants facilitation to non-native plants is passed from one

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},

Abstract = {In arid environments where soil resources are limiting factors, the
   presence of soil ecosystem engineers that create new enriched soil
   habitats can improve the performance of non-native plants growing there.
   Moreover, these enriched areas may be considered key sources of
   high-quality seeds, which would favor the spread and invasion success of
   non-native plant. In Northwestern Patagonian steppe, the non-native
   grass Bromus tectorum is one of the most frequent species that takes
   advantage of the soil engineering effect of the leaf-cutting ant
   Acromyrmex lobicornis. Here, we evaluated if the facilitative effect of
   the enriched nest sites of A. lobicornis on B. tectorum individuals is
   also transferred to their offspring. We compared the influence of B.
   tectorum's seed source (i.e., from plants growing on nest sites vs
   steppe soil) on seed mass, seed germination, and performance of new
   individuals growing under the same conditions (i.e., growing in steppe
   soil, under the same water and temperature conditions). We showed that
   individuals of B. tectorum growing on nest sites produced bigger seeds,
   with germination rate and germination percentage similar to those of
   individuals from soil seeds; however, they produced 53\% larger
   seedlings, with 30\% less root:shoot ratio and higher probability of
   having shoots with spikelets. This evidences that the benefits of
   growing on nest sites pass on to the offspring of B. tectorum. Moreover,
   our results highlight the importance of environmental maternal effects
   on plant growth and development even after germination and show that
   soil ecosystem engineers can represent a crucial contribution to the
   invasion of non-native plants.},

Title = {Are liana communities in linear canopy openings subject to edge effects?},

Abstract = {Studies have revealed a significant increase in liana abundance due to
   intense fragmentation and consequent edge effects in tropical forests.
   This study evaluated whether liana communities adjacent to linear canopy
   openings experience edge effects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For
   vegetation sampling, 12 sampling units (20 x 50 m) were distributed
   among forest fragments with four sampling units in each of three
   treatments: old-growth forest, power line edge (40 years old and 100 m
   wide), and gas pipeline edge (20 years old and 25 m wide). All lianas
   with Diameter at Ground Height (DGH) >= 2.5 cm were measured. Subplots
   (20 x 20 m) were also allocated to measure individuals with DGH between
   0.5 and 2.49 cm. Edge effects were determined using the parameters:
   abundance, basal area, species richness, and species composition. Edge
   and interior lianas were similar for all measured parameters for both
   diameters classes. There was a higher rate of infestation by lianas in
   larger trees both on the edges and interior. These linear openings
   resulted in only few alterations to liana community dynamics along
   edges, indicating that fragmentation from linear openings may result in
   a softer edge effect or that edge effects may even attenuate over time
   due to linear openings. Finally, liana infestation on larger trees
   suggests that tree structure plays an important role in structural
   patterns of liana communities.},

Abstract = {The genus Muricea, a highly speciose gorgonian coral group in the
   Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), is commonly found on shallow rocky reefs
   including Machalilla National Park (MNP), El Pelado Marine Reserve

   presence of M. hebes, M. echinata and M. robusta, which have been not
   previously reported at the REMAPE area and along the Ecuadorian region.
   These new records for Muricea hebes (Verril, 1864) in Ecuador broaden
   the known geographical distribution of these species across the tempered
   waters of California and Mexico, and the Tropical Eastern Pacific,
   belonging to Panama and Ecuador. Muricea robusta (Verril, 1864) was
   previously recorded in Mexico and Colombia, whereas M. echinata (Verril,
   1866) was only found in Panama. This report contributes to increasing
   the knowledge of marine diversity in Ecuador, and broadens the
   previously recorded geographic distribution of the genus Muricea
   throughout the TEP.},

Abstract = {Nothotrioza is a small genus of jumping plant lice comprising three
   described species in Brazil and one in the USA (Florida) that induce
   galls on the leaves of their myrtaceous hosts. The galls of the
   Brazilian species are globoid and associated with Psidium spp.; those
   from Florida are pouch galls on Mosiera. Here we describe two new
   species from Brazil, Nothotrioza acuminata Burckhardt sp. nov. from
   Psidium laruotteanum and N. camptyla Burckhardt sp. nov. from P. rufum.
   Both species induce globoid galls similar to those of the other
   Brazilian species. The new taxa are diagnosed and illustrated, and
   identification keys for adults and the last-instar immatures are
   provided for all known species. The presence of mummies in the material
   of the new species suggests that they are as heavily parasitised as
   reported for the Brazilian species N. cattleiani Burckhardt and N.
   myrtoidis Burckhardt. Our data suggest that Nothotrioza species are
   monophagous with narrow geographical ranges.},

Title = {Re-discovery of the type series of the Indian freshwater mussel

Abstract = {India represents a tropical biodiversity hotspot, harbouring a unique
   and largely endemic fauna of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae).
   Unfortunately, the type series of many freshwater mussel taxa
   historically described from this country are thought to be lost. Here,
   we report on the rediscovery of the type series of Parreysia corrugata
   (O.F Muller, 1774) (Parreysiinae: Parreysiini) in the Natural History
   Museum of Denmark (NHMD), Copenhagen. It contains four syntypes
   (complete shells), which were examined by means of morphological and
   geometric morphometric techniques. We show that the nominal taxon
   Parreysia corrugata was established based on a composite type series,
   because one of the syntypes belongs to another species, Potomida
   semirugata (Lamarck, 1819) (Gonideinae: Lamprotulini), originating from
   the Middle East. To fix the taxonomic identity of the Indian species, a
   syntype (lot NHMD 916309) that was most likely illustrated by O.F.
   Willer in 1779 is designated here as the lectotype of Parreysia
   corrugata. The lectotype, pa ralectotypes and corresponding labels are
   illustrated in detail. Our new findings clarify the taxonomic concept of
   Parreysia corrugata and contribute to the further development of the
   Indian Unionidae taxonomy.},

Abstract = {Fire-killed serotinous trees are often dominant species in fire-prone
   regions with contrasting wet and dry seasons. We studied a serotinous
   fire-killed conifer (Callitris preissii, Cupressaceae) to identify the
   influence of fire regime and climate on geographic variation in level of
   serotiny, recruitment and population structure. We measured population
   size distributions, seedling recruitment and level of serotiny for
   sample stands across a climatic gradient from mesic coastal (including
   two islands) to semi-arid inland sites in SW Australia. Trees on islands
   were mostly non-serotinous and were only weakly serotinous on the
   adjacent mainland in the higher rainfall West coast region. In the
   semi-arid Goldfields and South inland, and the higher rainfall South
   coast region, trees were more strongly serotinous with up to six cohorts
   of closed cones retained on trees. Level of serotiny was stronger at the
   drier end of the climatic gradient where severe to extreme fire danger
   weather occurs most frequently, and where vegetation type (e.g.,
   shrublands) supports frequent crown-type, stand-replacing fires.
   Recruitment was most abundant post-fire in all regions, but seedlings
   also established inter-fire where there was regular seed fall due to low
   level of serotiny or spontaneous release of seeds from old cones on
   trees with a high cone load. Population structures for mainland stands
   shifted from approximately reverse-J (indicating continuous recruitment)
   in mesic regions to mainly unimodal (establishment mostly after fire) in
   drier, inland regions, although some long-unburned inland stands showed
   occasional inter-fire recruitment, likely linked to high rainfall years.
   Unimodal population structures characterized islands, where previous
   studies have identified herbivory on seedlings by refugial populations
   of native macropods as a limiting factor on inter-fire establishment.
   Understanding landscape context, response to disturbance, biotic
   interactions and reproductive traits of dominant species is essential in
   conservation planning in a rapidly changing global environment.},

Title = {Shoot herbivory by grasshoppers has stronger effects on root morphology
   than clipping},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {223},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1069-1078},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Studies investigating the effect of aboveground herbivory on plants
   often use clipping to simulate the effects of herbivores, for practical
   reasons. However, herbivore movements and transfer of oral secretions
   during herbivory may cause a different response in plant physiology and
   morphology compared to clipping. While studies have compared effects of
   real herbivory vs. clipping on biomass production, plant physiology, and
   shoot morphology, no study has compared such effects on root morphology.
   Therefore, we investigated the effect of herbivory by grasshoppers,
   herbivory simulated by clipping, and no herbivory on root morphological
   traits of ten grassland plant species. Root morphological traits were
   differently affected by the two herbivory treatments. Grasshopper
   herbivory significantly changed root morphology toward thinner roots
   with increased specific root length and root area, and decreased root
   tissue density compared to untreated control plants. Clipping had mostly
   similar, but weaker effects on root morphology than grasshopper
   herbivory. On the species level, grasshopper herbivory led to strongest
   changes in root morphology in almost all cases. In contrast, depending
   on the species, clipping resulted in varying root morphological trait
   values similar to grasshopper-damaged plants, or in some cases, more
   closely aligned with control plants. Though clipping was partly able to
   mimic the effects of herbivory by grasshoppers, results also indicate
   that, depending on the species, grasshopper herbivory had different but
   mostly stronger effects. We, therefore, recommend that future studies
   apply herbivory with real herbivores to better reflect natural responses
   in plants and related processes that root morphological traits mediate.},

Title = {Spatial analysis reveals facilitation in young clonal trees and

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Spatial analysis has revealed interesting patterns of woody plant
   encroachment that were not previously revealed by conventional analyses.
   We examined the spatial patterns of regeneration 23 years after a
   long-term tree removal experiment was performed near Magudu (northern
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) by the Agricultural Research Council of
   South Africa. We performed spatial analyses of trees using
   nearest-neighbour analysis from 12 plots differing in degree of clearing
   as well as point-pattern analyses from a pair of complete-removal plots
   and a pair of complete controls (unmanipulated). After 23 years, the
   same dominant encroaching tree species (Dichrostachys cinerea) had
   re-invaded all the removal plots despite the fact that several
   additional encroaching species occurred in the vicinity.
   Nearest-neighbour analyses showed that there was a positive correlation
   between the sizes of the trees and their nearest-neighbour distances,
   indicating that competition was acting. The spatial distribution of
   subordinate to dominant species from point-pattern analysis ranged
   between random to aggregated. We also found that there appeared to be
   facilitation of young trees by adult trees in both the control plots and
   the completely cleared plots based on point-pattern analyses. This is
   likely an effect of the root-suckering habit of the predominant
   encroaching species, D. cinerea, and not the statistical definition of
   facilitation per se, borne out by the clustering of juvenile trees of
   this species. We conclude that facilitation of young trees is an
   artefact and that intraspecific competition is the over-riding effect on
   the distribution of trees.},

Title = {Wildfires did not ignite boreal forest range expansion into tundra
   ecosystems in subarctic Yukon, Canada},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {223},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {829-847},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The resilience of northern ecosystems is being tested as the temporal
   and spatial distribution of wildfires change. Wildfires at treeline are
   predicted to facilitate a northward advance of boreal tree species, as
   the tundra is in close proximity to fire-adapted species climatically
   primed for range expansion. To study the effects of wildfire at
   treeline, we asked (1) how does wildfire change the environmental
   characteristics of treeline microsites, and (2) in the absence of viable
   seed limitation, do burned treelines increase the likelihood of tree
   seedling emergence? We measured numerous biotic and abiotic factors at
   three treelines in Yukon, Canada, each consisting of a burned and
   unburned treatment. Our observational study was paired with a
   manipulative seeding experiment of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill)
   B.S.P.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) to determine what
   environmental characteristics facilitated seedling emergence potential
   across site treatments. When comparing site treatments, results
   indicated that within the first two decades after wildfire, soil
   temperatures (GDD) were more extreme at burned treelines during the
   summer and winter. An examination of plot data in ordination space
   showed clear differences in organic layer depth and vegetation cover
   between treatments. While some of these changes would seem to benefit
   germination potential, spruce seedling emergence was extremely limited
   over the study period. Model results indicated little association
   between seedling emergence and recent fire; however, seedling emergence
   was positively associated with moss substrate found across treatments
   and reduced cover of tall multi-stemmed shrubs. We conclude that
   wildfire can create seedbed conditions that benefit seedling emergence,
   but low-severity wildfires create a variety of microsite conditions that
   limit overall availability of these seedbeds. Furthermore, emerging
   seedlings may experience new barriers to establishment, as burned
   treelines exhibited changes in soil temperature extremes and snow depth.},

Abstract = {The impact of ongoing climate change on plant communities varies
   according to vegetation type and location across the globe. Snowbed
   flora count among the most sensitive vegetation due to their dependence
   on long-lasting snow patches. This is especially the case toward their
   rear distribution edge, where warming has already induced a marked
   decrease in snow deposition. Thus, analysing the dynamics of snowbed
   plant communities is crucial for understanding the ecological processes
   that condition their persistence under new environmental conditions. The
   Pyrenees represent the southern distribution limit of several
   eurosiberian snowbed species. We surveyed eight snowbeds based on
   permanent plots, where the presence of each taxon was recorded annually
   between 2012 and 2019. We analysed vegetation patterns between sites and
   plots, related them to environmental gradients, and assessed temporal
   trends of community dynamics. We detected important between-site
   differences regarding species composition. However, these differences
   were not supported by species' biogeographical patterns, which suggests
   that local abiotic factors filter species with distinct autecology. In
   parallel, temporal community turnover was observed through the expansion
   of widespread grassland species, which supports the hypothesis of
   colonisation of snowbeds by common alpine taxa. Such changes could be
   related to a decrease in snow cover over recent times, which releases
   extreme environmental constraints to plant growth. Therefore, it is
   crucial to characterise fine-scale ecological conditions to forecast
   plant community dynamics and provide reliable information for conserving
   snowbed vegetation across the Palearctic.},

Abstract = {Root branching and mycorrhizal symbioses are two major mechanisms for
   soil resource acquisition by trees. Understanding the relationship
   between these two mechanisms and their responses to varied environmental
   conditions is crucial for predicting the responses of foraging
   strategies of roots to environmental changes. This study was conducted
   in 11 Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations distributed in
   different environmental conditions in Subtropical China to assess the
   relationship between root tip traits related to nutrient foraging
   (branching ratio of 1st-order roots to 2nd-order roots, arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) colonization) and their environmental variables,
   including mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature
   (MAT), soil C, soil N, soil P, and soil pH. Root branching was more
   sensitive to environmental conditions than mycorrhizal symbioses. The
   branching ratio and AM colonization of Chinese fir were significantly
   related to several environmental variables. The branching ratios were
   positively correlated with MAT, but negatively correlated with soil C,
   soil N, and soil pH (P < 0.05), suggesting that harsh environmental
   conditions can promote absorptive root branching. To our surprise, the
   AM colonization of absorptive roots was not as sensitive to
   environmental factors as branching ratio. However, the AM colonization
   of absorptive roots was positively correlated with soil pH (P < 0.1),
   indicating that soil acidity controls mycorrhizal symbioses. Moreover,
   the branching ratio was significantly negatively correlated with AM
   colonization (P < 0.05). Our results confirmed that environmental
   conditions significantly regulate fine root branching and its
   mycorrhizal symbioses, but with different controlling variables. The
   negatively correlated relationship of branching ratio and AM
   colonization shows that environmental factors regulate absorptive root
   traits in different ways.},

Title = {Lethal and sublethal effects of five common herbicides on the wolf
   spider, Pardosa milvina (Araneae: Lycosidae)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 3},
Abstract = {We tested lethal and sublethal effects of five commonly applied
   herbicides on the agrobiont wolf spider Pardosa milvina. Pardosa were
   collected from two agricultural fields; one kept under continuous crop
   rotation and sprayed for over twenty years, the other had no pesticide
   application for the last twelve years. Male and female Pardosa from each
   site were exposed to one of seven herbicide treatments (atrazine,
   glyphosate, mesotrione, S-metolachlor, rimsulfuron, a combination of all
   five herbicides, or a distilled water control; N = 1201) and maintained
   for 52 days on the treated soil substrate. We recorded mortality, prey
   capture behavior, weight change, courtship behavior, and egg sac
   production across treatments. Mesotrione and the five-herbicide
   combination showed significantly higher mortality than control
   substrates while atrazine, glyphosate and S-metolachlor showed
   significantly higher survival than the control. Both male spiders and
   spiders collected from the conventional field had reduced survival under
   some herbicide treatments. Prey capture behavior varied significantly by
   herbicide treatment, sex, and site. We observed significant weight
   change differences in males and differences in egg sac production in
   females, with, compared to the control, significant male weight loss in
   the rimsulfuron treatment collected from the no herbicide field, and a
   decrease in egg sac production in rimsulfuron and S-metolachlor
   treatments among females collected from the no herbicide field. Our
   results show some herbicides may have modest but significant fitness
   benefits (atrazine, glyphosate, and S-metolachlor) while others strongly
   increase the mortality of a generalist predator (mesotrione and the
   combination herbicide treatment).},

Title = {Fertility control options for management of free-roaming horse
   populations},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-38},
Abstract = {The management of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus) and burros (E.
   asinus) in the United States has been referred to as a ``wicked problem
   `` because, although there are population control options, societal
   values will ultimately determine what is acceptable and what is not. In
   the United States, free-roaming equids are managed by different types of
   organizations and agencies, and the landscapes that these animals
   inhabit vary widely in terms of access, size, topography, climate,
   natural resources, flora, and fauna. This landscape diversity, coupled
   with contemporary socioeconomic and political environments, means that
   adaptive management practices are needed to regulate these free-roaming
   populations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently manages
   free-roaming equids on 177 herd management areas in the United States by
   applying fertility control measures in situ and/or removing horses,
   which are either adopted by private individuals or sent to long-term
   holding facilities. The BLM off-range population currently includes >
   50,000 animals and costs approximately \$50 million USD per year to
   maintain; on-range equid numbers were estimated in March 2022 to be
   approximately 82,384. On-range populations can grow at 15-20\% annually,
   and current estimates far exceed the designated appropriate management
   level of 26,715. To reduce population recruitment, managers need better
   information about effective, long-lasting or permanent fertility control
   measures. Because mares breed only once a year, fertility control
   studies take years to complete. Some contraceptive approaches have been
   studied for decades, and results from various trials can collectively
   inform future research directions and actions. Employing 1 or more
   fertility control tools in concert with removals offers the best
   potential for success. Active, iterative, cooperative, and thoughtful
   management practices can protect free-roaming horses while
   simultaneously protecting the habitat. Herein, we review contraceptive
   vaccines, intrauterine devices, and surgical sterilization options for
   controlling fertility of free-roaming horses. This review provides
   managers with a ``fertility control toolbox `` and guides future
   research.},

Abstract = {The lack of seeds represents one of the highest difficulties to overcome
   for the ecological restoration of areas that have been deforested. This
   study evaluates the effectiveness of artificial perches in increasing
   the abundance and species richness of bird-dispersed seeds and the
   similarity of seed rain composition of deforested areas with and without
   artificial perches in relation to woodland remnants that serve as seeds
   source. We also tested for differences in seed abundance and species
   richness with different origins (native or non-native) as well as
   different type of habits (woody and non-woody). The experiment took
   place in two sites of the Espinal ecoregion, Argentina. We found that in
   deforested areas, perches increased seed abundance and species richness
   in the seed rain in comparison with deforested areas without artificial
   perches. The species composition under artificial perches was similar to
   the seed rain dispersed in the woodland. However, there was a decrease
   in the abundance and richness of native species under artificial
   perches, probably due to behavioral differences between opportunistic
   and obligate frugivorous. Seed of trees and shrubs species that can act
   as natural perches and nurses were well represented in the seed rain
   under artificial perches. We recommend using artificial perches in
   deforested areas with potential for recovery because it is an efficient
   technique to promote the entry of birds and increase seed rain,
   preserving features of the original environment. In places where native
   and non-native species show different fructification peaks, artificial
   perches could be used in certain periods of the year.},

Title = {Fire effects on diversity patterns of the understory communities of
   Araucaria-Nothofagus forests},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {883-906},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Short-interval and high-severity fires combined are emerging as a
   catalyst of major reorganization of understory plant communities. In
   temperate forests of south-central Chile, concern exists about the
   resilience of threatened Araucaria-Nothofagus forests, including its
   understory community following extensive and severe fires. In this study
   we use an array of diversity indices and functional traits as proxies of
   community resilience. We ask if the species and communities are affected
   by wildfires, and how these responses are mediated by burn severity and
   frequency, and other biophysical variables. First, we explore the
   hypothesis that fire is the major driver of community changes, and that
   burn severity is the main factor that shifts compositional attributes of
   communities. Secondly, we hypothesize that a reburn will lead to a
   greater shift than a single burn in understory compositional attributes,
   where resprouting species replace obligate seeders, reducing local
   diversity. We established 120 field plots across a burn severity
   gradient in two study sites: one affected by a single (burned 2015), and
   the second by two fires (burned 2002 and 2015), where vascular plant
   species abundance, among other biotic, abiotic, and topographic
   variables were estimated. We found that burn (high) severity is the main
   driver of post-fire understory assemblages, resulting in communities
   less competitive and heterogeneous, with an increasing number of exotic
   species. Also, post-fire responses are resulting in communities in which
   the high abundance of flammable taxa and post-fire resprouter species at
   the early-seral stage may lead to large-scale transitions from mesic
   forest ecosystems to dry, open forest and fire-prone shrublands in
   reburned areas. Our results highlight the ecological importance of
   short-interval and severe wildfires as leading factors in the transition
   of post-fire understory communities of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests to a
   system dominated by post-fire obligate resprouters, where tree species
   are less represented compromising the recovery of these ecosystems.
   These findings improve the understanding of the current post-fire
   processes that affect flammability feedbacks and contribute to a
   baseline of the current patterns in a world of altered fire regimes.},

Title = {Environmental impacts due to the use of sunscreen products: a

Abstract = {Sunscreen use has increased in recent years, as sunscreen products
   minimize the damaging effects of solar radiation. Active ingredients
   called ultraviolet (UV) filters or UV agents, either organic or
   inorganic, responsible for defending skin tissue against harmful UV
   rays, are incorporated in sunscreen formulations. UV agents have a
   serious impact on many members of bio communities, and they are
   transferred to the environment either directly or indirectly. Many
   organic UV filters are found to be accumulated in marine environments
   because of high values of the octanol/water partition coefficient.
   However, due to the fact that UV agents are not stable in water,
   unwanted by-products may be formed. Experimental studies or field
   observations have shown that organic UV filters tend to bioaccumulate in
   various aquatic animals, such as corals, algae, arthropods, mollusks,
   echinoderms, marine vertebrates. This review was conducted in order to
   understand the effects of UV agents on both the environment and marine
   biota. In vivo and in vitro studies of UV filters show a wide range of
   adverse effects on the environment and exposed organisms. Coral
   bleaching receives considerable attention, but the scientific data
   identify potential toxicities of endocrine, neurologic, neoplastic and
   developmental pathways. However, more controlled environmental studies
   and long-term human use data are limited. Several jurisdictions have
   prohibited specific UV filters, but this does not adequately address the
   dichotomy of the benefits of photoprotection vs lack of eco-friendly,
   safe, and approved alternatives.},

Abstract = {Climate change can enhance or hinder the spread of invasive plant
   species, as climatic conditions influence the population dynamics of
   invaders in their new range. Pines are one of the most widely
   distributed and problematic invasive tree species globally. Here we
   experimentally evaluated how two invasive pine species (Pinus ponderosa
   and Pinus contorta) respond to simulated climate change conditions in
   northwestern Patagonia. We conducted a full factorial manipulative field
   experiment with 3-year-old pine saplings growing in warmed (Open Top
   Chamber), watered, warmed + watered, and control treatments. In the
   warmed treatments P. contorta saplings showed lower survival and tended
   to grow taller while maintaining their root growth. In contrast, P.
   ponderosa saplings, which did not show differences in survival among
   treatments, did not vary their aerial growth under warmed conditions,
   but tended to increase their root-to-shoot ratio. Both species showed
   similar survival and growth in the watered treatments compared to the
   control, indicating that the implemented difference in water (ca. 30\%
   during the growing season) had no significant effect. Our findings
   suggest that a decrease in the invasive capacity (initial stages) of P.
   contorta may occur under climate change but no significant changes are
   expected for P. ponderosa. This observed differential response may
   modify the current relative abundance of invading pine species in
   northwestern Patagonia and has implications for the response of invasive
   species to climate change elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Leafhoppers (family: Cicadellidae) are among the most common plant
   sap-sucking pests, causing damage to wild and agronomic plants
   worldwide. The current paper aims to assess the zoogeography, diversity
   and population dynamics of the leafhopper species in an agricultural
   land converted ecosystem. Twenty species (two identified only to the
   genus level) belonging to 17 genera, 10 tribes, and three subfamilies
   were collected from Toshka Region, Aswan Governorate, Egypt, in 2020.
   The most common cicadellid species was Orosius albicinctus, representing
   46.7\% of the total catch. Low values of species richness and diversity
   were measured for leafhopper species as compared with those reported in
   our recent study carried out in Alexandria and Qena governorates. In
   sum, conversion of any natural ecosystem to agricultural land uses may
   cause declines in insect diversity. However, desert conversion may
   increase the diversity pattern of some insect pests. Analysis of the
   zoogeographic affinities of the leafhopper species from Toshka Region
   indicated a closer affiliation to the Palaearctic Region (35\%) than any
   other region. Most leafhopper populations exhibited a unimodal seasonal
   pattern and were abundant in hot and dry months (May-September). The
   abundance of some leafhopper species correlated positively with
   temperature (seven species) and negatively with relative humidity (nine
   species). Six of these species correlated with both variables. This
   study is the first to investigate leafhopper communities in a converted
   ecosystem of Toshka Depression, Western Desert.},

Abstract = {The Yucatan Peninsula is a vast karst platform that hosts superficial
   ecosystems such as sinkholes or underground cave systems. This study
   aims to give the first nematode species list for and explain their
   distribution at the Po ` ol Tunich cave system. Samplings were carried
   out from September 2015 to February 2016, at five sampling sites along
   the cavern system. At each site, two sediment samples were collected
   with a polyvinylchloride pipe (PVC) corer; sediments were processed by
   decantation, and meiofauna was collected with a 45 mu m sieve. Nematodes
   were picked manually, mounted on glass slides and identified. At three
   sites (1, 3 and 5), water temperature and electric conductivity were
   measured with HOBO data loggers. The nematode fauna was represented by
   six orders, nine families and 12 genera. Enoplida and Chromadorida have
   the highest number of species (three each), while Rhabditida and
   Plectida have two species each. There was only one species of
   Dorylaimida. Sites with the highest abundance were: 1 (25 organisms) and
   2 (24 organisms), with Atrochromadora sp. as the most abundant species,
   followed by Ironus paludicola, Hoplolaimus tylenchiformis and
   Dichromadora sp., at five organisms each. The four types of nematode
   feeding were present, with a predominance of epistrate and deposit
   feeders, followed by chewers and then suction feeders, and this fact is
   an indicator of the food resources available in the cave. Our results
   reveal that nematodes are an important component in the cave fauna, and
   they exploit the resources available based in detritus. Further efforts
   are needed to understand the nematode communities associated with
   subterranean environments.},

Title = {Understorey light environment impacts on seedling establishment and
   growth in a typhoon-disturbed tropical forest},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Some studies suggest that canopy gaps are not crucial for woody species
   recruitment in typhoon-disturbed forests because of frequently
   defoliated forest crowns and invariant high-light levels under the
   forest canopy. Here we examined this speculation focusing on seedling
   establishment stages and forest floor light in a forest with annual
   return frequencies of typhoons. We monitored light (photosynthetically
   active radiation; PAR) and seedling dynamics in 75 seedling quadrats
   (each 1 x 1 m(2)) for eight years in Nanjenshan tropical lowland forest,
   Taiwan (2043 newly recruited seedlings; 199 advance regeneration
   seedlings). Due to attenuation by the understorey vegetation, only 24\%
   of the PAR that penetrated the forest canopy reached the forest floor.
   We found that PAR transmittance on the forest floor was heterogeneous
   temporally, ranging from 0.01 to 15.6\%. Nonetheless, shade-intolerant
   species established at relatively high median values of light
   transmittance, compared to species of the moderate and tolerant groups,
   indicating that light is a crucial resource at the establishment stage.
   However, many seedlings died in relatively high-light conditions,
   suggesting that factors other than low light were more critical for
   survival. The generally low-light environment on the forest floor also
   resulted in similar composition and slow growth of seedlings across
   quadrats, except for a few in extraordinary high-light quadrats. In
   conclusion, the temporal light environment below the understorey layer
   was heterogeneous and was critical for differentiated establishment and
   growth patterns of newly recruited seedlings. Thus, besides canopy gaps,
   the light attenuation effect caused by understorey vegetation plays an
   essential role in the early establishment stage of seedlings in a forest
   frequently disturbed by typhoons.},

Title = {Biotic interactions prior to seed dispersal determine recruitment

Abstract = {Seedlings recruitment is key to maintaining populations and depends on
   diverse biotic interactions and abiotic factors before and after seed
   dispersal. Cacti recruitment is infrequent and occurs at sporadic pulses
   associated with rainy years. Furthermore, biotic interactions can limit
   seeds availability due to scarce or inefficient pollinators, dispersers
   or to antagonistic interactions with florivores and seed predators, as
   cactus depend on animals for pollination and dispersal. We identified
   interactions and traits involved in the regeneration process of
   Lophophora diffusa, during seven years (2015-21). We assessed floral
   rewards, pollination rates, intensity of florivory, and seed removal, to
   estimate the probability of recruitment through seeds, as well as
   survival and establishment of seedlings in a population located in
   Queretaro, Mexico. We found that pre-dispersal events reduced
   recruitment as flower-fruit transition has a low probability. High
   florivory and low pollinator visitation rate due to low nectar
   availability decreased seed formation in all years. Seed predation was
   not limiting recruitment, since most seeds escaped predation. Even so, a
   low proportion of seeds established as seedlings, possibly due to water
   limitation or seed dormancy. The interactions with pollinators and
   florivores decreased ovule-seed transition; once the seeds are formed,
   there is a high probability of evade predation. Hence, pre-dispersal
   interactions during flowering determine the availability of seeds, and
   reduce recruitment in peyote, rather than post-dispersal interactions.},

Title = {Changes in the resilience of resprouting juvenile tree populations in

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {907-923},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Elevated tree mortality and reduced recruitment of new trees linked to
   drought and fires has been reported across a range of forests over the
   last few decades. Forests that resprout new foliage epicormically from
   buds beneath the bark are considered highly resilient to disturbance,
   but are potentially at risk of elevated mortality, demographic shifts
   and changes to species composition due to synergistic effects of drought
   and fire. Despite this, the effects of drought-fire interactions on such
   forests remain largely unknown. We assessed the effects of drought
   severity and fire frequency on juvenile mortality, post-fire seedling
   recruitment and replacement of juvenile trees (balance of recruitment
   minus mortality) following fire. We compared dry ridgetops and wet
   gullies (i.e. two forest types that inhabit different topographic
   positions in the landscape) across a temperate forest in southern
   Australia. Both forest types experienced higher rates of fire-induced
   juvenile mortality in areas that had experienced severe drought compared
   to moderate drought, though mortality rates were generally low across
   all drought and fire combinations (e.g. < 15\%). This result indicated
   that topographic position did little to reduce juvenile mortality when
   exposed to severe drought plus fire. In wet forest, severe drought also
   reduced recruitment and replacement of dead juveniles by post-fire
   seedlings compared to moderate drought. In dry forest net-negative
   replacement increased with the severity of drought. Across both forest
   types, the total pool of juveniles was reduced under severe drought (by
   16-79 in DSF; 5-11 in WSF). Future increases in the frequency of coupled
   severe drought and fire could potentially increase the susceptibility of
   resilient temperate forests to major changes in structure and function.},

Title = {Patterns in climate and seedling establishment at a dry tropical

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {223},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1047-1068},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In some internal valleys of the northern Andes, precipitation at
   treeline elevation is seasonal, with one or two dry periods that could
   exert a strong control on tree seedling survival. However, little is
   known about (1) the severity of the dry periods, due to a lack of
   climate data, or (2) the effect of drought on tree seedling demographic
   dynamics and how this is modulated by local plant interactions in these
   tropical-alpine ecosystems. We studied annual precipitation variation
   and seedling demography and ecophysiology in relation to microclimate
   and neighboring plants in a dry treeline ecotone at 3100 m a.s.l in the
   Venezuelan Andes. We selected seedlings of the dominant tree species
   Cybianthus marginatus and Clusia multiflora at three sites, each with
   three adjacent 10 x 10-m plots within the forest, forest border, and
   paramo. For both species, seedling density was zero in the paramo and
   did not differ between border and forest. Growth rates were low for both
   species, but higher for Cybianthus in the border than in the forest.
   Survival rates were high in both environments. Low assimilation and
   transpiration rates were found in both species regardless of the
   environment. The spatial association of seedlings with
   moisture-regulating elements such as mosses, ferns and basal rosettes
   may indicate a benefit of better hydric conditions in their
   neighborhood. Our study shows a strong limitation for tree establishment
   in the paramo, but high rates of survival at the edge of the forest.
   This suggests a scenario of slow potential forest expansion at this
   tropical treeline, tree cover advancing in a closed front by the
   successive formation of forest-edge vegetation allowing tree seedling
   establishment outside of the forest.},

Title = {The contribution of the spatial hydrological niche to species diversity

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {223},
Number = {6},
Pages = {599-612},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The hydrological niche is one of the few below ground spatial
   environmental niches, which has been shown to structure English
   floodplain meadows and other European and African herbaceous ecosystems.
   However, both the relative contribution of hydrological heterogeneity to
   the structure of English floodplain meadows across spatial scales and
   the forms of the individual species' responses to hydrological
   heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Here, we use a survey database of
   2440 evaluation units sampled in 15 English floodplain meadows to
   dissect the spatial architecture of this metacommunity and describe the
   relationship between the abundance of individual species and
   hydrological heterogeneity. Of the tested species, 65\% responded to
   spatial hydrological heterogeneity, with both monotonic and hump-shaped
   responses. We found that between-site beta-diversity is much stronger
   than within-site beta-diversity, with between-site scale hydrological
   variation explaining twice as much variation in community structure as
   within-site scale. This leads to the conclusion that a conservation
   strategy of rare plant communities should include not only the
   preservation of the diversity of local hydrological regimes, but also,
   specially, the inclusion in the conservation system of as many and
   environmentally varied local plant communities as possible.},

Abstract = {This paper describes germination and cytological variability in two
   popular ornamental and potentially invasive species, lamb's ear Stachys
   byzantina and rose campion Lychnis coronaria. Both xerophytic species
   have the potential to invade natural habitats across Europe and create
   viable naturalised populations, with subsequent impacts on native
   vegetation. To assess the species' invasiveness, seeds were collected
   from naturalised populations and germination was recorded under
   different temperature regimes. Flow cytometry, used to record
   cytological variability, indicated that all populations of both species
   were cytologically homogeneous. Germination success, an important means
   of distribution factor in both species, was significantly influenced by
   temperature, with final germination of L. coronaria being extremely high
   at temperatures > 15/10 degrees C (98.5\%) and extremely low at
   temperatures < 10/5 degrees C (2.9\%). The final germination in S.
   byzantina is the highest at 22/15 degrees C (55.6\% germinated seeds),
   reduced to 40.3\% at 15/10 degrees C and to 0.3\% at temperatures lower
   than 10/5 degrees C. No significant differences in final germination
   were observed between escaping and non-escaping populations, although
   there were some differences between particular populations. Our results
   indicate germination temperature limits of two species whose non-native
   areas include Central Europe. The observed germination allows for
   successful generative reproduction of both species over their non-native
   ranges, suggesting that these species are likely to become invasive
   species of European grasslands soon.},

Title = {Commercial pesticides for urban applications induced population growth

Abstract = {Information regarding the safety and environmental risks of pesticides
   intended for urban use remains limited. This study aimed to assess the
   effects of four common pesticides on the microalga Raphidocelis
   subcapitata: DIAZINON (R) 25\% C. E., Roundup (R), URBACIN (R) 20C. E.,
   and VAPODEL (R) 20\% C. E., which are commercial formulations of
   diazinon, glyphosate, dichlorvos, and cypermethrin, respectively.
   According to 96-h inhibition of population growth bioassays, the four
   pesticide toxicities exemplified the following order: DIAZINON (R)
   (diazinon) > Roundup (R) (glyphosate) > VAPODEL (R) (dichlorvos) >
   URBACIN (R) (cypermethrin). Increasing pesticide concentrations elicited
   alterations in the specific growth rates (mu max). The macromolecule
   contents and photosynthetic pigments increased in groups exposed to the
   highest concentrations of DIAZINON (R) 25\%, Roundup (R), and URBACIN
   (R) 20 compared to the control group, despite these treatments inducing
   lower population growth rates. VAPODEL (R) 20\% induced higher growth
   rates and lower macromolecule content compared to the control. Since
   active ingredients were not quantified, certain comparisons may prove
   limiting, but it is important to assess the effects of the whole
   mixtures in the form that they enter the environment, especially for
   urban-intended applications or generic formulations with higher additive
   contents. Finally, this study demonstrated that commercial pesticide
   formulations designed for urban applications might pose a threat to
   freshwater microalgae due to their underestimated toxic potential, but
   further studies are required.},

Title = {Endogenous AhR agonist FICZ accumulates in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus

Abstract = {Multiple studies have reported synergized toxicity of PAH mixtures in
   developing fish larvae relative to the additive effect of the
   components. From a toxicological perspective, multiple mechanisms are
   known to contribute to synergism, such as altered toxicodynamics and
   kinetics, as well as increased oxidative stress. An understudied
   contributor to synergism is the accumulation of endogenous metabolites,
   for example: the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AhR2) agonist and
   tryptophan metabolite 6-Formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ). Fish larvae
   exposed to FICZ, alongside knock-down of cytochrome p450 (cyp1a), has
   been reported to induced symptoms of toxicity similar to those observed
   following exposure to PAHs or the dioxin
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Here, we explored if FICZ
   accumulates in newly hatched rainbow trout alevins (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
   exposed to two PAHs with different properties: retene (potent AhR2
   agonist) and fluoranthene (weak AhR2 agonist and Cyp1a inhibitor),
   either alone or as a binary mixture for 3 and 7 days. We found that
   exposure to the mixture resulted in accumulation of endogenous FICZ,
   synergized the blue sac disease index (BSD), and altered the body burden
   profiles of the PAHs, when compared to the alevins exposed to the
   individual components. It is thus very plausible that accumulation of
   endogenously derived FICZ contributed to the synergized BSD index and
   toxicity in exposed alevins. Accumulation of endogenously derived FICZ
   is a novel finding that extends our general understanding on PAHs
   toxicity in developing fish larvae, while at the same time highlighting
   why environmental risk assessment of PAHs should not be based solely
   results from the assessment of individual compounds.},

Abstract = {Unconventional natural gas development (fracking) has been a rapidly
   expanding technique used for the extraction of natural gas from the
   Marcellus Shale formation in Pennsylvania. There remains a knowledge gap
   regarding the ecological impacts of fracking, especially regarding the
   long-term health of native Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   populations. During the summer of 2015, Brook trout were sampled from
   twelve streams located in forested, northwestern Pennsylvania in order
   to evaluate the impacts of fracking on Brook trout. Four stream sites
   were undisturbed (no fracking activity), three had a developed well pad
   without fracking activity, and five had active fracking with natural gas
   production. Liver tissue was isolated from two to five fish per stream
   and underwent RNA-Seq analysis to identify differentially expressed
   genes between ecosystems with differing fracking status. Data were
   analyzed individually and with samples pooled within-stream to account
   for hierarchical data structure and variation in sample coverage within
   streams. Differentially expressed and differentially alternatively
   spliced genes had functions related to lipid and steroid metabolism,
   mRNA processing, RNA polymerase and protein regulation. Unique to our
   study, genes related to xenobiotic and stress responses were found as
   well as potential markers for endocrine disruption and saline adaptation
   that were identified in watersheds with active fracking activity. These
   results support the utility of RNA-Seq to assess trout health and
   suggest detrimental impacts of fracking on sensitive trout populations.},

Title = {Bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects of nano-TiO2 in the aquatic
   food chain},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The increasing production of nano-TiO2 has attracted extensive concerns
   about the ecological consequence and health risk of these compounds in
   natural ecosystem. However, little is known about its toxicity on
   zooplankton, especially its possibility to access to the food chain via
   dietary exposure. To address this concern, the toxic and cumulative
   effects of nano-TiO2 on an aquatic food chain were explored through two
   trophic levels independently or jointly including producer and consumer.
   The results revealed that exposure to suspensions of nanomaterials had
   negative effects on both producers and consumers. Specifically,
   nanoparticles reduced the density of algal cells in a
   concentration-dependent way, and hatching life expectancy, average
   lifespan, net reproductive rate, and population intrinsic growth rate of
   rotifers decreased significantly with the concentration of nanomaterials
   increased (P < 0.05). Notably, nanoparticles accumulated in algal cells
   and were transferred to consumers through dietary exposure.
   Biomagnification of nano-TiO2 was observed in this simplified food
   chain, as many of the biomagnification factor (BMF) values in this study
   were >1. Exposure concentration, exposure time and their interactions
   play a strong part in the accumulation of nanoparticles in algae and
   rotifers. Overall, the present findings confirmed that nano-TiO2 was
   deleterious to plankton, posing a significant environmental threat to
   aquatic ecosystems.

Title = {High mercury concentrations in steelhead/rainbow trout, sculpin, and
   terrestrial invertebrates in a stream-riparian food web in coastal
   California},

Abstract = {Stream and riparian food webs are connected by cross-habitat exchanges
   of invertebrate prey that can transfer contaminants including mercury.
   Marine fog has been identified as a source of methylmercury (MeHg) to
   some terrestrial food webs in coastal California, suggesting that
   terrestrial invertebrates might have elevated MeHg relative to stream
   invertebrates and might lead to higher mercury exposure in fish that
   consume terrestrial subsidies. As an initial step to examine this
   possibility, we analyzed mercury concentrations in terrestrial and
   aquatic invertebrates and two fish species, steelhead/rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus), in a
   small watershed. Mean MeHg and total mercury (THg) concentrations in
   terrestrial invertebrates were three to four times higher than in
   aquatic invertebrates of the same trophic level. MeHg was > 1000 ng/g dw
   in some individual centipede and scorpion samples, and also relatively
   high (100-300 ng/g dw) in some terrestrial detritivores, including
   non-native isopods. Mean THg in age 0 trout was 400 ng/g dw compared to
   1200-1300 ng/g dw in age 1+ trout and sculpin, and the largest trout
   sampled had THg > 3500 ng/g dw. However, the similar mercury
   concentrations between age 1+ trout and sculpin, despite different diet
   types, indicated that Hg concentrations in fish were not related simply
   to differences in consumption of terrestrial invertebrates. The high
   mercury concentrations we found in terrestrial invertebrates and fish
   suggest that further research on the sources and bioaccumulation of
   mercury is warranted in this region where O. mykiss populations are
   threatened.},

Title = {Toxicity effect of the edible pigment carmoisine on Polyrhachis vicina
   Roger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Carmoisine belongs to a water-soluble synthetic dye and is often used as
   a food additive. Previous research has shown that carmoisine is toxic to
   rats and zebrafish, but there have been few reports on the effect of
   carmoisine on soil-dwelling social insects. The present study evaluated
   carmoisine toxicity in Polyrhachis vicina Roger. We found that the
   effects of different concentrations of carmoisine on the mortality of
   workers were dose-dependent. The 10\% lethal dose (LD10), 50\% lethal
   dose (LD50) and 90\% lethal dose (LD90) of carmoisine to workers at 96 h
   was calculated to be 0.504, 5.491 and 10.478 g/L, respectivily. LD10 of
   workers were selected to treat the fourth instar larvae, pupae and
   adults for 10 days. The results showed that the survival rate of all
   ants, except for females, was significantly reduced, especially larvae
   and workers. The body weight of larvae, pupae and males decreased
   significantly, while weight gain was observed in the females and
   workers. The appearance of larvae, pupae and workers changed after
   carmoisine treatment, such as body darkening and epidermis shrinking of
   larvae and pupae, as well as body segment expansion of workers.
   Furthermore, carmoisine altered the expression of the estrogen-related
   receptor, tailless and homothorax of P. vicina (Pv-ERR, Pv-tll and
   Pv-hth) to varying degrees in larvae and adults. We believe that
   variations in body weight can lead to a decrease in survival rate and
   appearance changes in the ants, which may be related to abnormal gene
   expressions caused by carmoisine treatment. Therefore, we confirm that
   carmoisine has negative effects on the growth and development of P.
   vicina.},

Title = {Climate change weakens the impact of disturbance interval on the growth
   rate of natural populations of Venus flytrap},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Disturbances elicit both positive and negative effects on organisms;
   these effects vary in their strength and their timing. Effects of
   disturbance interval (i.e., the length of time between disturbances) on
   population growth will depend on both the timing and strength of
   positive and negative effects of disturbances. Climate change can modify
   the relative strengths of these positive and negative effects, leading
   to altered optimal disturbance intervals (the disturbance interval at
   which population growth rate is highest) and changes in the sensitivity
   of population growth rate to disturbance interval. While we know that
   climate may alter impacts of disturbance in some systems, we have a poor
   understanding of which effects of disturbance and which vital rates
   might drive an altered response to disturbance interval in a changing
   climate. We use demographic monitoring of natural populations of Dionaea
   muscipula, the Venus flytrap, that have experienced natural and managed
   fires, combined with realistic past and future climate projections, to
   construct climate- and fire-driven integral projection models (IPMs). We
   use these IPMs to compare the effect of fire return interval (FRI) on
   population growth rate in past and future climates. To dissect the
   mechanisms driving FRI response, we then construct IPMs with demographic
   data from an experimental manipulation of fire effects (ash addition,
   neighbor removal) and an accidental fire. Our results show that an FRI
   of 10 years is optimal for D. muscipula in past climate conditions, but
   a longer FRI (12 years) is optimal in future climate conditions.
   Further, deviations from optimal FRI reduce population growth rate
   dramatically in the past climate, but this reduction is muted in a
   future climate (future minus past sensitivity = 0.006, 95\% CI {[}0.002,
   0.011]). Finally, our experimental work suggests that fire effects are
   driven in part by positive, additive effects of competitor removal and
   ash addition immediately following a fire; for one population, both
   these treatments significantly increased population growth rate. Our
   work suggests that climate change can alter the response of populations
   to disturbance, highlighting the need to consider the interacting
   effects of multiple abiotic drivers when projecting future population
   growth and geographical distributions.},

Title = {Accidental epiphytes: Ecological insights and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vascular epiphytes are an important component of many ecosystems and
   constitute a substantial part of global plant diversity. In this
   context, accidental epiphytism, that is, the opportunistic epiphytic
   growth of typically terrestrial species, deserves special attention
   because it provides crucial insights into the global distribution of
   vascular epiphytes and the initial evolution of epiphytic lineages. Even
   though accidental epiphytes have been mentioned in the literature for
   more than a century, they have been neglected in most epiphyte studies.
   Only recently has accidental epiphytism been investigated more
   thoroughly. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a
   comprehensive review of the ecological basis and evolutionary relevance
   of this common but largely neglected phenomenon and to highlight open
   questions and promising research directions. Our central statement-that
   any species has the potential to grow epiphytically given the
   availability of suitable microhabitats and successful dispersal-is
   backed up by a compilation of observations of accidental epiphytes from
   numerous ecosystems with diverse climates, even including semiarid
   Mediterranean ones. A variety of arboreal microhabitats and
   environmental conditions conform to the ecological niche of typical
   terrestrial species, with the availability of such microhabitats
   depending on the interaction of local climate conditions, host tree age,
   and host species identity. Whenever suitable microhabitats are available
   in tree crowns, accidental epiphytism is limited primarily by dispersal.
   In an evolutionary context, the conquest of forest canopy represents an
   ecological opportunity where accidental epiphytes act as links between
   terrestrial and epiphytic life forms. We discuss two fundamental
   scenarios with sympatric speciation, selective pressure, autopolyploidy,
   and allopatric speciation as underlying mechanisms in the transition
   from terrestrial to epiphytic growth. In conclusion, we argue that
   accidental epiphytism is a substrate and dispersal-dependent phenomenon
   and that, both from an individual perspective and an evolutionary
   perspective, epiphytism reflects the occupation of suitable but
   previously unexploited arboreal microhabitats. Acknowledging the
   fundamental principles that plant growth is opportunistic and that
   dispersal is a stochastic process can decisively improve our
   understanding of species distributions and other ecological patterns, as
   in the case of accidental epiphytism.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1477-1484},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An increasing number of studies have found tolerance variation in
   populations consistently exposed to contaminants, but few studies have
   examined whether these laboratory-derived estimates of tolerance have
   survival implications in field conditions. We examined four populations
   of the mayfly Stenacron interpunctatum for variation in tolerance to the
   common agricultural insecticide clothianidin. Using laboratory
   bioassays, we found a 2.3x range in 96 h EC50 tolerance values to
   clothianidin between our four populations. We then conducted a
   common-garden experiment with nymphs from each population placed into
   the collection stream most heavily impacted by upstream agricultural
   activities to assess whether our laboratory tolerance estimates predict
   survival under field conditions. We monitored survival and growth in
   situ for three weeks during the spring planting season, when
   clothianidin is applied to croplands upstream of our study site. While
   growth was similar across all groups, the most tolerant population,
   which was native to the impacted stream, had higher survival than the
   more sensitive populations. This suggests that population-level
   variation in contaminant tolerance as measured in laboratory bioassays
   could have real-world survival implications for sensitive aquatic
   macroinvertebrates in contaminated streams.},

Title = {Toxicity of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) toward embryonic stages of
   mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1057-1067},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent organic
   pollutants that have been detected in a wide array of environmental
   matrices and, in turn, diverse biota including humans and wildlife
   wherein they have been associated with a multitude of toxic, and
   otherwise adverse effects, including ecosystem impacts. In the present
   study, we developed a toxicity assay for embryonic stages of mahi-mahi
   (Coryphaena hippurus), as an environmentally relevant pelagic fish
   species, and applied this assay to the evaluation of the toxicity of
   ``legacy{''} and ``next-generation{''} PFAS including, respectively,
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and several perfluoroethercarboxylic acids
   (PFECA). Acute embryotoxicity, in the form of lethality, was measured
   for all five PFAS toward mahi-mahi embryos with median lethal
   concentrations (LC50) in the micromolar range. Consistent with studies
   in other similar model systems, and specifically the zebrafish,
   embryotoxicity in mahi-mahi generally (1) correlated with
   fluoroalkyl/fluoroether chain length and hydrophobicity, i.e., log P, of
   PFAS, and thus, aligned with a role of uptake in the relative toxicity;
   and (2) increased with continuous exposure, suggesting a possible role
   of development stage specifically including a contribution of hatching
   (and loss of protective chorion) and/or differentiation of target
   systems (e.g., liver). Compared to prior studies in the zebrafish embryo
   model, mahi-mahi was significantly more sensitive to PFAS which may be
   related to differences in either exposure conditions (e.g., salinity)
   and uptake, or possibly differential susceptibility of relevant targets,
   for the two species. Moreover, when considered in the context of the
   previously reported concentration of PFAS within upper sea surface
   layers, and co-localization of buoyant eggs (i.e., embryos) and other
   early development stages (i.e., larvae, juveniles) of pelagic fish
   species to the sea surface, the observed toxicity potentially aligns
   with environmentally relevant concentrations in these marine systems.
   Thus, impacts on ecosystems including, in particular, population
   recruitment are a possibility. The present study is the first to
   demonstrate embryotoxicity of PFAS in a pelagic marine fish species, and
   suggests that mahi-mahi represents a potentially informative, and
   moreover, environmentally relevant, ecotoxicological model for PFAS in
   marine systems.},

Abstract = {Until not so long ago, Antarctica was considered to be a polar region
   practically pristine. The Antarctic Peninsula has the highest
   concentration of scientific stations from different countries.
   Anthropogenic activity has caused alterations in the Antarctic
   ecosystems directly affecting terrestrial vegetation. This fact requires
   the finding of biomarkers in native plants to estimate the effects of
   human impact. Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) is the unique
   native grass described so far for Antarctica and was used for multiple
   investigations. In this study, plants were collected on Carlini
   scientific station, 25 de Mayo (King George) Island, Potter Peninsula,
   South Shetland Islands. Thus, the main objective planned consists of the
   evaluation of leaf stomata-related parameters as pollution biomarkers.
   The results of the stomatic index (SI), density (SD), and area (SA) were
   shown at sites with different levels of human impact (close and far away
   from the scientific station). It was found that the correlation between
   SD and SI, on the adaxial side of the leaves, resulted in a good
   biomarker for estimating the degree of anthropogenic impact in each
   studied area.},
