Abstract = {Radiation can cause the differential expression of biological miRNA
   molecules. This research was based on the development of the laboratory
   red crucian carp (LRCC) to explore the feasibility of its application in
   the detection of low-dose ionizing radiation-induced biological damage
   in aquatic environments and the development of related molecular
   markers. Adult LRCC were irradiated with caesium-137 at 0.3 Gy, while
   RNA-seq and bioinformatics techniques were used to identify miRNAs that
   were differentially expressed relative to their levels in the
   nonirradiation group. Analysis of liver sections showed that liver cells
   in the radiation group showed nuclear pyknosis. In this study, 34 miRNAs
   differentially expressed in the liver of LRCC after irradiation were
   identified, among which seven were new crucian carp miRNAs; a total of
   632 target genes were predicted in the prediction analysis. The results
   of comprehensive GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed that
   these target genes were mainly involved in energy transfer and material
   catabolism, especially malonyl-CoA biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
   activity, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism, and pyruvate
   metabolism; in addition, the AMPK signalling pathway was the most active
   pathway. This study shows that the LRCC is sensitive to radiation, or
   can be used as a candidate experimental animal to study the biological
   effects of radiation, and the screened miRNA can be used as a
   pre-selected biomarker for radiation damage detection and radiation
   biological environmental monitoring.},

Abstract = {Decades of poor reproductive success and young-of-the-year survival,
   combined with adult mortality events, have led to a decline in the
   smallmouth bass (SMB; Micropterus dolomieu) population in sections of
   the Potomac River. Previous studies have identified numerous biologic
   and environmental stressors associated with negative effects on SMB
   health. To better understand the impact of these stressors, this study
   was conducted at the confluence of Antietam Creek and the Potomac River
   from 2013 to 2019 to identify temporal changes associated with SMB
   reproductive health. Surface water samples were collected and analyzed
   for over 300 organic contaminants, including pesticides, phytoestrogens,
   pharmaceuticals, hormones and total estrogenicity (E2Eq). Adult SMB were
   collected and sampled for multiple endpoints, including gene transcripts
   associated with reproduction (molecular), histopathology (cellular), and
   organosomatic indices (tissue). In males, biomarkers of estrogenic
   endocrine disruption, including testicular oocytes (TO) and plasma
   vitellogenin (Vtg) were assessed. Numerous agriculture-related
   contaminants or land use patterns were associated with gene transcript
   abundance in both male and female SMB. Positive associations between
   pesticides in the immediate catchment with TO severity and E2Eq with
   plasma Vtg in males were identified. In males, the prevalence of TO and
   detectable levels of plasma Vtg, liver vitellogenin transcripts (vtg)
   and testis vtg were high throughout the study. Peaks of complex mixtures
   of numerous contaminants occurred during the spring/early summer when
   spawning and early development occurs and to a lesser extent in
   fall/winter during recrudescence. Management practices to reduce
   exposure during these critical and sensitive periods may enhance
   reproductive health of these economically important sportfishes.},

Title = {Role of abiotic factors in enhancing the capacity of mangroves in

Abstract = {The present study investigated the effects of rising carbon dioxide
   levels in nature and the carbon sequestration potential of dominant
   mangrove species for reducing the toxic effects of ocean acidification.
   The study was conducted on the east coast of Odisha, in the western Bay
   of Bengal. To determine the effect of these ambient parameters on the
   absorption of carbon dioxide by the mangroves, water temperature,
   salinity, pH levels of seawater along with soil texture and pH, salinity
   expressed in electrical conductivity, compactness expressed in bulk
   density, and soil organic carbon were simultaneously monitored. The
   aboveground biomass and carbon of the selected species were studied for
   2 consecutive years at 10 designated stations. The total carbon
   calculated for the study area varied from 242.50 +/- 49.00 to 1321.29
   +/- 445.52 tons with a mean of 626.68 +/- 174.81 tons for Bhitarkanika
   and Mahanadi mangrove chunks. This is equivalent to 2299.92 +/- 641.55
   tons of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere. A total of 27 equations were
   selected as the best fit models for the study area. The equations
   between mangrove biomass and carbon along with aquatic and edaphic
   factors governing the pH of water and soil strongly support the positive
   influence of mangrove photosynthetic activity in shifting the
   equilibrium toward alkalinity. This calls for conservation of mangrove
   ecosystem to minimize the pace of acidification of estuarine water. The
   results indicate that Excoecariaagallocha and Avicennia marina as are
   the most capable species for combatting maximum carbon dioxide toxicity
   from the atmosphere; which will be helpful in REDD + programs and
   carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES).},

Abstract = {Chloroquine (CQ) has been widely used for many years against malaria and
   various viral diseases. Its important use and high potential to being
   persistent make it of particular concern for ecotoxicological studies.
   Here, we evaluated the toxicity of CQ alone and in combination with
   copper (Cu) to the euryhaline rotifer Proales similis. All experiments
   were carried out using chronic toxicity reproductive five-day tests and
   an application factor (AF) of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 by multiplying the
   24-h LC50 values of CQ (4250 mu g/L) and Cu (68 mu g/L), which were
   administered in solution. The rate of population increase (r, d(-1))
   ranged from 0.50 to 52 (controls); 0.20 to 0.40 (CQ); 0.09 to 0.43 (Cu);
   and -0.03 to 0.30 (CQ-Cu) and showed significant decrease as the
   concentration of both chemicals in the medium increased. Almost all
   tested mixtures induced synergistic effects, mainly as the AF increased.
   We found that the presence of Cu intensifies the vulnerability of
   organisms to CQ and vice versa. These results stress the potential
   hazard that these combined chemicals may have on the aquatic systems.
   This research suggests that P. similis is sensitive to CQ as other
   standardized zooplankton species and may serve as a potential test
   species in the risk assessment of emerging pollutants in marine
   environments.},

Abstract = {With low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, insecticide-induced
   hormesis, a biphasic phenomenon, can contribute to pest resurgence. The
   cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora (Koch) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is a vital
   insect that infests legume crops. Its hormesis of flupyradifurone has
   not been previously established. Age-stage two-sex life analysis is used
   to investigate the sublethal and transgenerational effects of
   flupyradifurone on two successive generations of A. craccivora. A
   leaf-dip bioassay method revealed high toxicity of flupyradifurone
   against A. craccivora, with lethal concentration 50\% value (LC50) of
   1.82 mg L-1 after 48 h exposure. Treatment of parent generation (F-0)
   with LC10 and LC25 of flupyradifurone significantly increased the
   longevity and fecundity of the directly exposed adults. The results of
   transgenerational effects showed that the treatment of (F-0) with LC25
   induced significant hormetic effects in progeny generation (F-1).
   Furthermore, flupyradifurone at LC25 significantly enhanced the
   biological traits, such as intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate
   of increase (lambda), and net reproductive rate (R-0) compared with the
   control. Similarly, both LC10 and LC25 induced a significant increase in
   the mean generation time T (d). Conversely, both treatments caused a
   significant decrease in the doubling time (DT). Data in the present
   study demonstrate that the exposure of (F-0) to flupyradifurone at LC10
   and LC25 enhanced longevity and fecundity in the directly exposed adults
   of A. craccivora, and induced transgenerational hormesis across the
   subsequent (F-1) generation. These results should be taken into
   consideration when using flupyradifurone for controlling cowpea aphid.},

Abstract = {Forests dominated by the genus Polylepis (Rosaceae) are highly
   threatened due to anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Some species
   such as Polylepis flavipila are also affected by hemiparasitic plants
   such as Tristerix chodatianus (Loranthaceae) that induce progressive
   damage to the host canopy, altering the structure and functioning of the
   forest. In this paper, we focused on evaluating the parasitism pattern
   of T. chodatianus on Polylepis populations, as well as how human impact
   and environmental factors affect the Polylepis flavipila population
   structure. We carried this out along an altitudinal gradient in Nor
   Yauyos Cochas Landscape Reserve, Laraos, Lima-Peru. We laid out three
   transects in each forest (Shutco and Chaqsii-Chaqsii) from the bottom of
   their current distribution to the tree line, totaling a sampled area of
   3.44 ha. Phenotypic data were taken for all individuals (parasitized and
   non-parasitized) with a diameter at ground height >= 5 cm. Environmental
   factors (bare cover, slope, rock cover, grass cover, and elevation) and
   human impact (trails, overgrazing, and felling) variables were also
   collected. Our results showed that the higher the elevation is, the
   shorter are the trees and with the increase of the slope, the diameter
   decreases and the frequency of trees increases. Moreover, human impact
   (trails and overgrazing) affected negatively the dasometric
   characteristics of P. flavipila. Regarding the patterns of parasitism,
   we observed that the larger trees (in diameter and height) had a greater
   presence of T. chodatianus and, as the elevation increased, the
   proportion of parasitized trees decreased. In conclusion, our results
   showed that P. flavipila forest is threatened by several factors,
   including human impact and T. chodatianus infestation. Future
   evaluations on forest dynamics would clarify the observed pattern.},

Abstract = {Impacts to honey bees due to exposure to agricultural pesticides is one
   of the most serious threats to the beekeeping industry. Our research
   evaluated toxicity of the formulated insecticides Lufenuron+Emamectin
   benzoate (Proclaim Fit (R)) on the European honey bee Apis mellifera L.
   at field-realistic concentration (worst-case scenario). Newly emerged
   (<= 24-h old) and forager (unknown age) worker bees were treated with
   the field recommended concentration of Proclaim Fit (R) using three
   routes of exposure including residual contact, oral, and spray within
   the laboratory. We also assessed the effects of Proclaim Fit (R) on the
   specific activity of some well-known detoxifying enzymes including
   alpha-esterase, beta-esterase, and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) in
   the honey bees. In addition, toxicity of the formulation was tested on
   4th instar larvae within the hive. Based on estimated median survival
   times (MSTs), Proclaim Fit (R) was highly toxic to the bees, especially
   when applied as spray. According to our estimated relative median
   potency (RMP) values, newly emerged bees were 1.72x more susceptible
   than foragers to Proclaim Fit (R) applied orally. Enzyme assays revealed
   the considerable involvement of the enzymes, especially GST and
   alpha-esterase, in detoxification of the Proclaim Fit (R), but their
   activities were significantly influenced by route of exposure and age of
   bee. Notably, Proclaim Fit (R) was highly toxic to 4th instar honey bee
   larvae. Our results generally indicate a potent toxicity of Proclaim Fit
   (R) toward honey bees. Therefore, its application requires serious
   consideration and adherence to strict guidelines, especially during the
   flowering time of crops.},

Title = {Stress responses of bivalve mollusc Unio tumidus from two areas to

Abstract = {Even though bivalve molluscs are recognized as bioindicators of
   freshwater quality, their responses to multiple stressors are
   unpredictable. This study aims to elucidate the inter-population
   peculiarities of the effect in the sub-chronic environmentally relevant
   exposure to novel contaminants. The specimens of Unio tumidus from
   reference (Pr) and contaminated (Ct) areas were treated with ibuprofen
   (IBU, 0.8 mu g L-1), microplastic (MP, 1.0 mg L-1, size 0.1-0.5 mm), or
   their combination (Mix) for 14 days. Untreated mussels (PrC- and
   CtC-groups) served as controls. The PrC-group had higher levels of
   antioxidants Mn-SOD, Cu,Zn-SOD, catalase, and cholinesterase (AChE) as
   well as lesser levels of oxidative lesions (TBARS and protein carbonyls)
   in digestive glands, indicating lower environmental impact than in the
   CtC-group. However, lysosomal stability was similar in both control
   groups. Among antioxidants, Mn-SOD activity was affected most
   prominently, increasing in all exposed Ct-groups. TBARS level was
   increased only in PrMP-group compared to responsive control. IBU and Mix
   enhanced protein carbonyl concentration in the Pr-groups, and decreased
   it in the Ct-groups. AChE was induced in the CtIBU- and PrMix-groups,
   and lysosomal integrity increased in the CtIBU and CtMix-groups.
   Discriminant analyses indicated lesser differences between Pr-groups,
   demonstrating lower cumulative stress compared to Ct-groups. Generally,
   the most remarkable response was revealed in the CtIBU-group, and
   distortion of individual effects was established in combined exposures.
   The qualification of stress-neutral and stress-positive populations was
   proposed for Pr- and Ct-populations correspondingly. Inter-site
   peculiarities must be taken into consideration when the environmental
   impact of MP and pharmaceuticals is evaluated.},

Abstract = {Leachate toxicity using bioindicators such as microcrustaceans and
   earthworms has not been fully elucidated. These bioindicators are
   traditionally determined through physicochemical and microbiological
   analyses. The ecotoxicological assessment of leachate using indicator
   organisms from different environments is a technique to ensure the
   treatment and safe disposal of this effluent with minimum impact on
   human health and the environment. The current study aimed to evaluate
   the ecotoxicological responses of Daphnia magna and Eisenia andrei in
   landfill leachate, identifying which organism was more sensitive to this
   effluent. The leachate used in ecotoxicological tests was collected at
   the Campina Grande Sanitary Landfill (ASCG), Paraiba, Brazil. The
   leachate sample contained a high content of organic matter in the form
   of chemical oxygen demand (19496.86 mg.L-1) and ammoniacal nitrogen
   (2198.00 mg.NL-1), in addition to metals with carcinogenic potential,
   such as Cr (0.64 mg.L-1) and Fe (1.16 mg.L-1). The exposure of Daphnia
   magna to the leachate showed that the effluent is harmful to aquatic
   organisms, obtaining an EC 50, 48 h = 1.22\%, FT of 128 and a TU of
   81.96\%. Among the contaminant concentrations tested in Eisenia andrei,
   57\% (59.28 mL.kg(-1)) caused the highest lethality, causing the death
   of 21 earthworms within 72 hours of exposure. The avoidance test showed
   that exposure to leachate concentrations between 10.38 and 39.86
   mL.kg(-1) led to the leakage of earthworms, and habitat loss was
   observed at a concentration of 55.80 mL.kg(-1), in which leak response
   (LR) >= 80\% was obtained. This study demonstrates that the mentioned
   organisms are suitable for ecotoxicological tests in landfill leachate.
   Moreover, the microcrustacean Daphnia magna showed the most significant
   sensitivity, presenting a rapid ecotoxicological response to the
   leachate.},

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},

Volume = {223},
Number = {10-12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Determining traits correlated with invasiveness in order to identify
   potentially invasive species remains a priority in the field of invasion
   ecology. In trees, relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA),
   or plant height under optimal growing conditions have been identified as
   performance traits allowing pioneer exotic species to outcompete native
   species. However, few studies investigated the link between these traits
   and invasiveness on a continuous scale. Here, we compare the RGR, SLA,
   height, shoot-root ratio, and number of leaves of seedlings of eight
   maple species (Acer spp.) with their invasiveness at the global level.
   Seedlings were grown in non-limiting conditions indoor in Gembloux,
   Belgium and harvested after 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Global invasiveness was
   quantified using a combination of the number of regions and countries
   invaded in the GBIF database, the number of citations in the Global
   Compendium of Weeds (GCW), and the risk score estimated in the GCW. RGR,
   SLA, height, and number of leaves after 8 weeks were positively
   correlated with invasiveness. We conclude that invasive maple species
   could benefit from an acquisitive strategy and that high growth and
   light capture also favor invasiveness of shade-tolerant species.
   Finally, we recommend a close monitoring of Acer rufinerve in Western
   Europe due to its high RGR and SLA, comparable to other highly invasive
   maple species.},

Abstract = {Relationships between phenological and morphophysiological traits of
   functional groups of woody species in riparian forests of semi-arid
   environments are little understood, especially regarding the
   representativeness of these groups in the community. This study aimed to
   evaluate the influence of the leaf and wood morphofunctional
   characteristics on the vegetative phenology of woody species in a
   riparian forest in the Brazilian semi-arid region and how these traits
   act in the distribution of species in functional groups. Vegetative
   phenology and leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf area, leaf
   thickness, and leaf dry matter content), wood density, and amount of
   saturated water in the stem and their association with soil water
   availability, relative air humidity, precipitation, temperature,
   photoperiod, and vapor pressure deficit were evaluated. Cluster analysis
   showed three functional groups (n = 23): deciduous low wood density
   species (9\%), deciduous high wood density species (48\%), and
   non-deciduous species, which included semideciduous (17\%) and evergreen
   species (26\%). Deciduousness was positively related to specific leaf
   area and negatively related to leaf dry matter and leaf area. Deciduous
   and semideciduous species (55.1\% and 7.5\% of the individuals in the
   community, respectively) showed a strong dependence on abiotic factors
   linked to precipitation and temperature, while the evergreen species
   showed a strong dependence on the vapor pressure deficit to trigger
   their phenophases. We concluded that the studied functional traits act
   on the leaf habit, which is essential to understand how the phenology is
   projected within functional groups.},

Abstract = {Climate change projections predict that Mediterranean-type ecosystems
   (MTEs) are becoming hotter and drier and that fires will become more
   frequent and severe. While most plant species in these important
   biodiversity hotspots are adapted to hot, dry summers and recurrent
   fire, the Interval Squeeze framework suggests that reduced seed
   production (demographic shift), reduced seedling establishment after
   fire (post fire recruitment shift), and reduction in the time between
   successive fires (fire interval shift) will threaten fire killed species
   under climate change. One additional potential driver of accelerated
   species decline, however, has not been considered so far: the decrease
   in pollination success observed in many ecosystems worldwide has the
   potential to further reduce seed accumulation and thus population
   persistence also in these already threatened systems. Using the
   well-studied fire-killed and serotinous shrub species Banksia hookeriana
   as an example, we apply a new spatially implicit population simulation
   model to explore population dynamics under past (1988-2002) and current
   (2003-2017) climate conditions, deterministic and stochastic fire
   regimes, and alternative scenarios of pollination decline. Overall,
   model results suggest that while B. hookeriana populations were stable
   under past climate conditions, they will not continue to persist under
   current (and prospective future) climate. Negative effects of climatic
   changes and more frequent fires are reinforced by the measured decline
   in seed set leading to further reduction in the mean persistence time by
   12-17\%. These findings clearly indicate that declining pollination
   rates can be a critical factor that increases further the pressure on
   the persistence of fire-killed plants. Future research needs to
   investigate whether other fire-killed species are similarly threatened,
   and if local population extinction may be compensated by recolonization
   events, facilitating persistence in spatially structured
   meta-communities.},

Title = {Proline-mediated modulation on DNA repair pathway in rice seedlings
   under chromium stress by integrating gene chip and co-expression network
   analysis},

Abstract = {Chromium (Cr) stress can cause oxidative burst to plants. Application of
   exogenous proline (Pro) is one of the most effective approaches to
   improve the tolerance of plants to Cr stress. In this study, we
   integrated the data of gene chip with co-expression network analysis to
   identify the key pathways involved in the DNA repair processes in rice
   seedlings under Cr(VI) stress. Based on KEGG pathway analysis, 158 genes
   identified are activated in five different types of DNA repair pathways,
   namely base excision repair (BER, 20 genes), mismatch repair (MMR, 30
   genes), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ, 8 genes), nucleotide excision
   repair (NER, 56 genes) and homologous recombination (HR, 44 genes).
   Co-expression network analysis showed that genes activated in DNA repair
   pathways were categorized into six different modules, wherein Module 1
   (45.36\%), Module 2 (27.84\%) and Module 3 (19.59\%) carried more weight
   than others. Integrating the data of gene chip and co-expression network
   analysis indicated that coordinated actions of HR and NER pathways are
   mainly associated with DNA repair processes in Cr(VI)-treated rice
   seedlings supplied with exogenous Pro. OsCSB, OsXPG, OsBRIP1, OsRAD51C,
   OsRAD51A2, OsRPA, OsTOPBP1C, OsTOP3, and OsXRCC3 activated in the HR
   pathway had a stronger impact on repairing DNA damage induced by Cr(VI)
   stress in rice seedlings supplied with exogenous Pro, while OsXPB1,
   OsTTDA2, OsTFIIH1, OsXPC, OsRAD23, OsDSS1, and OsRPA located at the NER
   pathway showed more contribution to repairing DNA damage than others.},

Title = {Toxicity of lanthanides on various fish cell lines},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1147-1157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The growing use of Lanthanides in new technologies has increased their
   anthropogenic releases into the aquatic environment over the last
   decades. However, knowledge on their ecotoxicological impacts is still
   incomplete, especially with regard to biological effects of Lanthanides
   mixtures and the possible regular variation in toxicity along the
   Lanthanides series. The present study evaluated the individual toxicity
   of all Lanthanides and the toxicity of mixtures of three of them, namely
   Neodymium (Nd3+), Gadolinium (Gd3+), and Ytterbium (Yb3+) on Danio rerio
   fibroblast-like cells (ZF4). Individual and mixtures toxicity of
   Neodymium (Nd3+) and Ytterbium (Yb3+) were also assessed on Danio rerio
   hepatic cells (ZFL) and Oncorhynchus mykiss epithelial cells
   (RTgill-W1). The measured Lanthanide concentrations were close to the
   nominal ones in the culture media of ZF4, ZFL, and RTgill-W1 cells
   (85-99\%). A toxic impact was observed on the three fish cell lines
   exposed to all Lanthanides tested individually. RTgill-W1 appeared as
   the less sensitive cells, compared to the two others. Four Lanthanides,
   Erbium (Er3+), Thulium (Tm3+), Ytterbium (Yb3+) and Lutetium (Lu3+)
   showed a higher toxicity than the others on ZF4 cells but no correlation
   could be established between the toxicity of Lanthanides and the order
   of the elements within the Lanthanides series. Exposures to binary
   mixtures highlighted the presence of synergistic effects on cell
   viability for all cell lines.},

Abstract = {Plant functioning depends on variation in resource economics traits
   (acquisition vs. conservation) and the size of plants and their parts
   (the `global spectrum of plant form and function'). The anatomical basis
   of single traits (e.g., leaf mass per area; LMA) is generally
   understood, but little is known regarding the relationship between
   anatomical trade-offs and ecological strategies (representing integrated
   suites of traits). We hypothesised correlations between the relative
   extent of leaf tissue types and Grime's Competitor Stress-tolerator
   Ruderal (CSR) strategies, principally a trade-off between structural
   (mechanical/fibro-vascular) vs. photosynthetic (chlorenchyma and
   intercellular airspace; ICAS) tissues, for ecologically contrasting
   herbaceous angiosperms in northern Italy. Specifically, that in the
   lamina portion, the trade-off represents the economics spectrum (S-R
   selection), but in the midvein portion, it reflects the mechanical
   constraints inherent to supporting large leaves (i.e., varies with
   C-selection). We used microscopy and image analysis to determine the
   relative cross-sectional area of tissues from transverse leaf sections
   (lamina and midvein portions) of angiosperms of contrasting CSR
   strategies. Principal components analysis (PCA) determined that the main
   trade-off (PCA1) was between mechanical/fibro-vascular tissues vs.
   ICAS/epidermis/chlorenchyma, but that this was associated with the
   economics spectrum (R- to S-selection) in the lamina, and with size
   (C-selection) for the midvein. A secondary trade-off in both lamina and
   midvein portions involved ICAS (i.e., the internal gas diffusion
   pathway) vs. chlorenchyma/epidermis (light capture), associated with S-
   to R-selection, respectively. Our results confirm the expectation that
   ecological strategy variation has a basis in underlying trade-offs
   between tissues with contrasting metabolic/architectural (i.e.,
   economics/size-related) roles.},

Title = {Effects of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of lead

Abstract = {Old lead-zinc (Pb-Zn) mining sites in Greenland have increased the
   environmental concentration of Pb in local marine organisms, including
   the shorthorn sculpin. Organ metal concentrations and histopathology
   have been used in environmental monitoring programs to evaluate metal
   exposure and subsequent effects in shorthorn sculpins. So far, no study
   has reported the impact of heavy metals on gene expression involved in
   metal-related stress and immune responses in sculpins. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the effect of exposure to environmentally
   relevant waterborne Pb (0.73 +/- 0.35 mu g/L) on hepatic gene expression
   of metallothionein (mt), immunoglobulin M (igm), and microRNAs (miRNAs;
   mir132 and mir155) associated with immune responses in the shorthorn
   sculpin compared to a control group. The mt and igm expression were
   upregulated in the Pb-exposed group compared to the control group. The
   transcripts of mir132 and mir155 were not different in sculpins between
   the Pb-exposed and control group; however, miRNA levels were
   significantly correlated with Pb liver concentrations. Furthermore,
   there was a positive correlation between liver Pb concentrations and
   igm, and a positive relationship between igm and mir155. The results
   indicate that exposure to Pb similar to those concentrations reported in
   in marine waters around Greenland Pb-Zn mine sites influences the mt and
   immune responses in shorthorn sculpins. This is the first study to
   identify candidate molecular markers in the shorthorn sculpins exposed
   to waterborne environmentally relevant Pb suggesting mt and igm as
   potential molecular markers of exposure to be applied in future
   assessments of the marine environment near Arctic mining sites.},

Title = {Sublethal exposure to pyriproxyfen does not impair the abilities of the
   backswimmer Buenoa amnigenus to prey upon Aedes aegypti larvae},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analogue that is commonly used to
   control the immature stages of mosquitoes in both artificial and natural
   water reservoirs. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the
   community effectiveness of pyriproxyfen in preventing vector-transmitted
   diseases. Such concerns have been based on the unintended effects on
   non-target organisms and the selection of resistant mosquito
   populations. This investigation was, therefore, conducted to evaluate
   the toxicity of pyriproxyfen to Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
   larvae and the backswimmer Buenoa amnigenus (Hemiptera: Notonectidae), a
   naturally occurring mosquito larvae predator. We also assessed the
   abilities of backswimmers exposed to sublethal levels of pyriproxyfen to
   prey upon mosquito larvae (L2) under three larval densities (3, 6, or 9
   larvae/100 mL of water) using artificial containers. Our results
   revealed that pyriproxyfen killed backswimmers only at concentrations
   higher than 100 lug active ingredient {[}a.i.]/L, which is 10 times
   higher than that recommended for larvicidal field application (i.e, 10
   mu g a.i./L). The abilities of backswimmers exposed to sublethal levels
   of pyriproxyfen (100 mu g a.i./L) to prey upon mosquito larvae were not
   affected. Harmful effects on the backswimmer predatory abilities were
   detected only at concentrations of 150 mu g a.i./L and when there was a
   higher prey availability (i.e., 9 larvae/100 mL of water). Together, our
   findings indicate that the reduced community effectiveness of this
   insecticide derives from factors other than its detrimental effects on
   non-target organisms such as backswimmers.

Abstract = {Changes in the antioxidant protection system of Larix sibirica Ledeb at
   different pollution levels caused by emissions from a large aluminum
   smelter (BrAS) have been studied. We revealed that the content of
   peroxide (H2O2) in the needles is a reliable marker of oxidative stress
   in the trees under pollution. The crucial role of non-enzymatic
   components, in particular, proline, phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid,
   glutathione, in reducing the level of free radicals in the needles cells
   was found. Proline concentration in the needles significantly rises with
   the increase in pollution levels from low to high. Under critical level
   pollution, it decreases by 40\% compared to the background. The total
   content of ascorbic acid (ASC) in the needles of polluted trees varies
   slightly; however, there are significant changes in its various forms.
   With an increase in pollution to a high level, the content of the
   reduced form of ASC in the needles increases by 1.5-2.9 times compared
   to the background content. At a critical level of pollution, the total
   level of ascorbic acid and its reduced form falls, the content of the
   oxidized form reaches minimum values. The total content of phenolic
   compounds in the needles increased by 50-55\%, concentration of
   flavonoids by 1.5-1.8 times, catechins by 1.9-2.5 times,
   proanthocyanidins by 45\% compared to the background level under low,
   moderate, high pollution, whereas under critical pollution their content
   decreased. The absolute concentration of the reduced form glutathione in
   the needles falls by 1.9-3.0 times, the oxidized form increases by
   1.5-2.0 times compared to the background. The ratio of reduced
   glutathione to oxidized glutathione decreased, especially during
   critical pollution. The data obtained show significant activation of
   Siberian larch biochemical protection at low, moderate and high levels
   of pollution by the aluminum smelter emissions. At a critical levels of
   contamination, a significant depletion of the pool of low-molecular
   antioxidants was observed.},

Abstract = {Soil contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons affects plants and
   rhizospheric microorganisms. Microbial activity participates in
   important biochemical processes that stimulate, together with plants,
   the modification of toxic compounds for organisms. A nine-month
   experiment was set up to study the effect over time of oil on plant
   height (cm), formation of new plants, plant matter production
   (gravimetry), and population of rhizospheric microorganisms (serial
   dilution) in the sedge Eleocharis palustris. Removal of total petroleum
   hydrocarbons (soxhlet and gravimetry) from the soil was also evaluated.
   The means of the evaluated variables registered significant statistical
   differences (Duncan, p < 0.05) regarding the age of the plant and the
   amount of crude oil. There was a high correlation between oil and plant
   height (0.848) and with new plants (0.994). 60 mg oil dose promoted the
   greatest statistical difference in the amounts of roots and plant
   biomass (p < 0.05). E. palustris exposed to 60 and 75 mg of oil
   stimulated high densities of microalgae, actinomycetes, fungi,
   hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and Pseudomonas spp; the overall ratio was
   2:1 relative to natural attenuation. Plant and microorganism variables
   evaluated registered physiological and microbiological hormetic indices
   >= 1, showing a positive linear relationship. Natural attenuation was
   more efficient in removing crude oil. We conclude that E. palustris is
   tolerant to oil exposure. It is suggested to combine it with natural
   attenuation for the optimization of soils contaminated with crude oil.},

Title = {Cold storage effects on lethal and sublethal responses of Amphibalanus
   amphitrite Nauplii},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1078-1086},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bioassays are extensively used in ecotoxicology and there is a constant
   need for even more sensitive, reliable and easy to rear and obtain model
   organisms. Larvae of the crustacean Amphibalanus amphitrite are a good
   ecotoxicological model, for their high sensitivity to a wide range of
   toxicants and emerging contaminants. A standardized protocol for this
   toxicity bioassay has been recently proposed. Nevertheless, a limit of
   this model organism is the lack of resting stages and the need to use
   larvae immediately after their release from adults, thus increasing
   laboratory efforts related to the maintenance of adults. The aim of this
   work is to verify if short-term cold storage of A. amphitrite larvae
   prior to use in ecotoxicological tests may affect the ecotoxicological
   responses of these organisms. Three end-points (mortality,
   immobilization and swimming speed alteration) were measured on nauplii
   after storing them at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for different times (24, 72 and
   120 h) before bioassay set-up. Bioassays were set up using: (i) clean
   filtered natural sea water (0.22 mu m FNSW), (ii) a reference toxicant
   (Cadmium Nitrate) and (iii) an environmental matrix (sediment
   elutriate). Results show that mortality, differently from the other two
   endpoints, was not affected by cold-storage. Even after 5 days of larvae
   storage at 4 +/- 1 degrees C before bioassay set up, mortality data were
   comparable to those obtained for non-cold-stored organisms. Moreover,
   larval sensitivity to the reference toxicant and sediment elutriate did
   not change. Regarding the other two end points, low cadmium
   concentrations significantly changed immobility and swimming activity in
   cold-stored nauplii compared to larvae used immediately after larval
   release. In conclusion, short-term cold storage of A. amphitrite nauplii
   before bioassay set up is an appropriate procedure in ecotoxicological
   testing if mortality is the endpoint to be considered for final
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {Insular regions present peculiar characteristics, including small
   populations resulting from prolonged evolutionary isolation. Such
   conditions make these areas sensitive to anthropogenic changes. By
   consequence, these areas are interesting for studying genetic and
   adaptative processes. This study had two main goals: to evaluate the
   demographic structure (distribution, frequency of individuals in size
   classes, and sex ratio) and to assess the genetic diversity of a
   freshwater shrimp population of Potimirim brasiliana on the continental
   Sao Sebastiao Island. Subsequently, population structure (size,
   abundance, and sex ratio) and genetic analyses (network haplotype and
   genetic distance of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase subunit
   1 - COI) were analysed to compare the spatial distribution and
   connectivity of individuals along separated areas exposed to different
   conditions of dispersal. Three different areas were defined along the
   island (sheltered area - SA, exposed area - EA, and south extremity -
   SE). We found males and females in all areas except SE. The percentage
   of males was greater in the EA, that of non-ovigerous females was
   greater in the SE and that of ovigerous females was greater in the SA.
   Females were larger than males in all areas. No genetic structural
   difference was found between the studied areas and no genetic
   differences were detected in relation to the inland population. The
   strategy developed by P. brasiliana in the areas of the Sao Sebastiao
   Island involves a differential occupation among the demographic groups
   in and maintaining connectivity between different and separated areas of
   the island by larval dispersal.},

Abstract = {The paper describes the new land planarian genus Mapuplana gen. nov.
   from Chile, on the basis of the two new species Mapuplana guttulata sp.
   nov. and M. fjordica sp. nov. The genus Mapuplana is mainly
   characterised by two putative apomorphies: a subneural parenchymal
   musculature consisting of diagonal decussate muscle fibres; and a blind
   duct opening sideways into the female atrium. The new species are very
   similar to each other in their general anatomy and differ only in
   details in the pattern of dorsal colouration, the relative distance
   between mouth and gonopore, the relative thickness of the ventral
   cutaneous musculature, the orientation of the gonoduct, and the shape of
   the female atrium.},

Abstract = {Global climate change will probably exacerbate crop losses from insect
   pests, reducing agricultural production, and threatening food security.
   To predict where crop losses will occur, scientists have mainly used
   correlative models of species' distributions, but such models are
   unreliable when extrapolated to future environments. To minimize
   extrapolation, we developed mechanistic and hybrid models that
   explicitly capture range-limiting processes, and we explored how
   incorporating mechanisms altered the projected impacts of climate change
   for an agricultural pest, the South American locust (Schistocerca
   cancellata). Because locusts are generalist herbivores surrounded by
   food, their population growth may be limited by thermal effects on
   digestion more than food availability. To incorporate this mechanism
   into a distribution model, we measured the thermal effects on the
   consumption and defecation of field-captured locusts and used these data
   to model energy gain in current and future climates. We then created
   hybrid models by using outputs of the mechanistic model as predictor
   variables in correlative models, estimating the potential distribution
   of gregarious outbreaking locusts based on multiple predictor sets,
   modeling algorithms, and climate scenarios. Based on the mechanistic
   model, locusts can assimilate relatively high amounts of energy
   throughout temperate and tropical South America; however, correlative
   and hybrid modeling revealed that most tropical areas are unsuitable for
   locusts. When estimating current distributions, the top-ranked model was
   always the one fit with mechanistic predictors (i.e., the hybrid model).
   When projected to future climates, top-ranked hybrid models projected
   range expansions that were 23\%-30\% points smaller than those projected
   by correlative models. Therefore, a combination of the correlative and
   mechanistic approaches bracketed the potential outcomes of climate
   change and enhanced confidence where model projections agreed. Because
   all models projected a poleward range expansion under climate change,
   agriculturists should consider enhanced monitoring and the management of
   locusts near the southern margin of the range.},

Title = {Climate-driven thermal opportunities and risks for leaf miners in aspen
   canopies},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In tree canopies, incoming solar radiation interacts with leaves and
   branches to generate temperature differences within and among leaves,
   presenting thermal opportunities and risks for leaf-dwelling ectotherms.
   Although leaf biophysics and insect thermal ecology are well understood,
   few studies have examined them together in single systems. We examined
   temperature variability in aspen canopies, Populus tremuloides, and its
   consequences for a common herbivore, the leaf-mining caterpillar
   Phyllocnistis populiella. We shaded leaves in the field and measured
   effects on leaf temperature and larval growth and survival. We also
   estimated larval thermal performance curves for feeding and growth and
   measured upper lethal temperatures. Sunlit leaves directly facing the
   incoming rays reached the highest temperatures, typically 3-8 degrees C
   above ambient air temperature. Irradiance-driven increases in
   temperature, however, were transient enough that they did not alter
   observed growth rates of leaf miners. Incubator and ramping experiments
   suggested that larval performance peaks between 25 and 32 degrees C and
   declines to zero between 35 and 40 degrees C, depending on the duration
   of temperature exposure. Upper lethal temperatures during 1-h heat
   shocks were 42-43 degrees C. When larvae were active in early spring,
   temperatures generally were low enough to depress rates of feeding and
   growth below their maxima, and only rarely did estimated mine
   temperatures rise beyond optimal temperatures. Observed leaf or mine
   temperatures never approached larval upper lethal temperatures. At this
   site during our experiments, larvae thus appeared to have a significant
   thermal safety margin; the more pressing problem was inadequate heat.
   Detailed information on mine temperatures and larval performance curves,
   however, allowed us to leverage long-term data sets on air temperature
   to estimate potential future shifts in performance and longer-term risks
   to larvae from lethally high temperatures. This analysis suggests that,
   in the past 20 years, larval performance has often been limited by cold
   and that the risk of heat stress has been low. Future warming will raise
   mean rates of feeding and growth but also the risk of exposure to
   injuriously or lethally high temperatures.},

Abstract = {Olivella Swainson, 1831 is a genus of small marine benthic gastropods
   found worldwide, represented by 117 valid species in 17 subgenera
   usually defined by conchological features such as colouration, size,
   shape and shell sculpture. Despite some conchological research on
   species in the family Olividae Latreille, 1825, the soft anatomy of
   Olivella species is still poorly studied. The present study aims to
   describe and compare the morphology of the pallial cavity and its
   adjacent structures in three species of Olivella from the Brazilian
   coast: Olivella (Olivella) floralia (Duclos, 1844), Olivella (Olivella)
   nivea (Gmelin, 1791), and Olivella (Niteoliva) minuta (Link, 1807). We
   suggest that some conchological (e.g. reabsorption of the columella or
   not; presence or absence of the operculum) and soft anatomical (e.g.
   placement of the posterior mantle tentacle, morphology of osphradium and
   reproductive system) features are useful to better distinguish between
   the subgenera Olivella and Niteoliva. Such characters have a potential
   role in taxonomic decisions and hypotheses regarding subgenera and a
   better understanding of evolutionary relationships within Olivella.},

Abstract = {The genus Serrasalmus, popularly known as `pirambebas', includes 87
   valid species of endemic freshwater fish from the Neotropical region.
   Amidst this diversity, the parasitic fauna of Serrasalmus brandtii, the
   unique endemic species in the Caatinga domain, was investigated in the
   Lima Campos dam, municipality of Ico, Ceara, Brazil. Our objectives were
   to survey the parasite composition and to analyse the component
   community of this host. Of the total of 50 hosts examined, 48 (96\%)
   were parasitised by at least one species of parasite. A total of 682
   parasite specimens were recovered, representing a mean intensity of
   14.20 parasites per fish. Seven parasitic taxa were recorded: two
   monogeneans, three digeneans and two nematodes. The most prevalent taxa
   were the monogeneans Anacanthorus serrasalmi (82\%) and Amphithecium
   falcatum (76\%), also showing the highest abundance (n = 317 and n =
   177, respectively). Metacercariae of Clinostomum sp. revealed the
   highest mean intensity of infection (7.8). This survey reveals new host
   records for Serrasalmus brandtii, and new parasitic records for the
   Jaguaribe river basin. Two of the recovered species, Clinostomum sp. and
   Contracaecum sp., present a zoonotic potential: to raise awareness
   regarding the proper handling and preparation of fish for human
   consumption.},

Abstract = {Although lion tamarins (Leontopithecus spp.) are known to prey upon
   frogs, no study has attempted to document the frequency and seasonal
   patterns of such events. In this study, we compiled data on frog
   predation by black lion tamarins, Leontopithecus chrysopygus, in
   south-eastern Brazil between 2014 and 2020. We investigated the effects
   of seasonality on predation rate and described the behaviour of the lion
   tamarins. In 1972 observation hours, we recorded 49 frog predation
   events. Predation was more intense in the beginning (April and May) and
   the end (August and September) of the dry season, suggesting seasonal
   variation. The observed pattern may be related to a combination of
   increased fruit availability in the rainy season and decreased frog
   activity in the height of the dry season. Compared to Saguinus mystax,
   the only other tamarin species for which there is available data,
   predation rate of anurans by black lion tamarins is five times higher.
   We suggest that frogs are an important item in the diet of black lion
   tamarins and reinforce the idea that vertebrate predation in some
   primates is seasonal.},

Abstract = {Extreme fire seasons in both hemispheres in 2019 and 2020 have
   highlighted the strong link between climate warming and altered fire
   regimes. While shifts in fire regimes alone can drive profound changes
   in plant populations, communities, and ecosystems, the direct effects of
   warming climate conditions can impose added stress on key demographic
   processes prior to and immediately following fire. Altered survival-,
   growth-, and reproductive- rates in periods between fires, coupled with
   post-fire recruitment failure from increasingly stressful environmental
   conditions (including both heatwave and drought) can pose serious
   threats for conservation in fire-adapted ecosystems worldwide, raising
   concerns of ecosystem conversion and state change. In this special
   issue, a collection of 11 papers from fire-prone ecosystems in both
   hemispheres documents key insights into how changes are unfolding-and
   mechanisms underpinning such changes-across a diverse range of species
   and ecosystems. Here, we synthesize this work that uses latitudinal
   observational surveys, experiments, and simulation modeling to
   understand how climate warming and altered fire regimes are reshaping
   our planet. We place these studies in the context of broader advances,
   and highlight additional research directions to uncover how altered fire
   regimes, fires interacting with other disturbances, and pre-and
   post-fire demographic processes can erode resilience in a warming
   climate.},

Abstract = {A new brachypterous form of Alloxysta fracticornis (Thomson, 1862) has
   been found in the Museum of Natural History of Wroclaw University

   been recorded for A. fracticornis. The morphological features of this
   new form match with this species, except for the wing length, which is
   characteristic of the brachypterous form, and the colour. COI sequences
   and phylogenetic analysis for the specimens studied (macropterous and
   brachypterous) confirm that the two morphologies belong to the same
   species, as we suspected a priori. Thus, in this study we show evidence
   of morphological variation in A. fracticornis, and demonstrate the value
   of studying entomological collections as well as new material to improve
   the taxonomic knowledge of this subfamily.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {We analysed the diversity of Cerambycidae in three phytophysiognomies,
   one of Cerrado (cerradao) and two of Atlantic Forest (freshwater swamp
   forest and semideciduous seasonal forest) within the Municipal Botanical
   Garden of Bauru (central Sao Paulo State, Brazil), a relevant
   preservation area. Ceramybycidae, one of the most diverse beetle
   families, are important bioindicators due to their intimate relationship
   with their host plants. They have great ecological importance as one of
   the major groups of decomposers. Despite having a crucial role in forest
   ecosystems, detailed faunistic studies of the family are scarce.
   Sampling of adult Cerambycidae was conducted with malaise traps from
   October 2019 to September 2020. In total, we collected 69 species,
   mostly belonging to Cerambycinae and Lamiinae. Isomerida vittata
   (Pascoe, 1858) was the most abundant species. Species accumulation
   curves show sufficient sampling effort. We found higher abundances
   during the spring-summer period, indicating a seasonal distribution
   pattern. A comparison of species composition among the three areas
   showed that cerradao and semideciduous seasonal forest are more similar;
   a lower similarity was calculated between freshwater swamp forest and
   semideciduous seasonal forest. Diversity profiles show that the cerradao
   is the most diverse area and freshwater swamp forests have the highest
   evenness. Our study is one of the few survey studies of Cerambycidae in
   large remnant areas of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest and provides
   primary data on this taxon which may help to develop future conservation
   policies.},

Abstract = {Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are used worldwide for the control of
   rodent pests and are the main method of control of rat pest populations

   risk of ARs to non-target wildlife in oil palm areas in Southeast Asia,
   mainly Indonesia and Malaysia. We discussed AR use in oil palm areas and
   toxicities of ARs on target and non-target animals. We also reviewed
   published literature on wildlife species reported in oil palm areas in
   Southeast Asia and utilizing this information, we assessed the hazard
   risk of ARs to non-target wildlife in oil palm plantations. ARs are a
   secondary exposure hazard to rodent-consuming mammalian carnivores, such
   as leopard cats and civets, and rodent-consuming raptors, such as barn
   owls. Consumption of dead poisoned prey puts scavengers, such as water
   monitors, at high risk for AR exposure. Domestic livestock and
   granivorous birds are at high risk for AR exposure via primary exposure
   to toxic bait, while omnivores such as macaques and wild pigs are at
   moderate risk for both primary and secondary exposure to ARs. The
   effects of ARs on barn owls have been well studied in the field and in
   laboratory secondary toxicity studies. Thus, the nest-box occupancy and
   reproductive parameters of local barn owl populations can be monitored
   as an indicator of the AR exposure level in the area.},

Title = {Toxicity of the microcystin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis

Abstract = {Microcystis aeruginosa is reported to cause cyanobacterial blooms in
   shrimp breeding ponds, which can result in significant shrimp mortality.
   However, the toxic effects of M. aeruginosa on Litopenaeus vannamei are
   still not completely understood. In this paper, the toxicity of M.
   aeruginosa cells to L. vannamei was examined, and the toxic components
   in the cells were analyzed through high-pressure liquid chromatography
   (HLPC). In addition, the immune response of shrimp to the M. aeruginosa
   cell extract was assessed by measuring the activity of immune-related
   enzymes, as well as the transcription of the relevant genes. The results
   showed that M. aeruginosa cells, extract and cell-free cultured medium
   resulted in a 100\%, 98.3\%, and 1.7\% mortality rate in shrimp,
   respectively. HPLC analysis results revealed the presence of
   microcystin-LR (MC-LR) at a concentration of 190.40 mg/kg of cells. In
   addition, the activity and gene transcription of two immune related
   enzymes, SOD and LZM, were both significantly reduced in shrimp
   hepatopancreas (p < 0.05) after injection with extract. However, reduced
   glutathione (GSH) content was slightly increased, but the ratio of GSH
   to GSSG decreased. The transcription of gst gene function as
   detoxification, was significantly downregulated (p < 0.05). The results
   demonstrated that M. aeruginosa cell extract was highly toxic to L.
   vannamei, and exerted a negative effect on shrimp immunity including
   reduction of antioxidant capacity, antibacterial activity and
   detoxification activity, due to toxins including microcystin-LR.},

Title = {Prevalence of anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in red-tailed hawks
   (Buteo jamaicensis) and utility of clotting time assays to detect
   coagulopathy},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) continue to be used across the United
   States as a method for controlling pest rodent species. As a
   consequence, wild birds of prey are exposed to these toxicants by eating
   poisoned prey items. ARs prevent the hepatic recycling of vitamin K and
   thereby impede the post-translational processing of coagulation factors
   II, VII, IX, and X that are required for procoagulant complex assembly.
   Through this mechanism of action, ARs cause hemorrhage and death in
   their target species. Various studies have documented the persistence of
   these contaminants in birds of prey but few have attempted to use
   affordable and accessible diagnostic tests to diagnose coagulopathy in
   free-ranging birds of prey. In our study free-ranging red-tailed hawks
   were found to be exposed to difethialone and brodifacoum. Eleven of
   sixteen (68\%) livers tested for AR exposure had detectable residues.
   Difethialone was found in 1/16 (6\%), and brodifacoum was detected in
   10/16 (62\%) liver samples that were tested for rodenticide residues.
   Difethialone was found at a concentration of 0.18 ug/g wet weight and
   brodifacoum concentrations ranged from 0.003-0.234 ug/g wet weight. Two
   out of 34 (6\%) RTHA assessed for blood rodenticide had brodifacoum in
   serum with measured concentrations of 0.003 and 0.006 ug/g. The range of
   clotting times in the prothrombin time (PT) and Russell's viper venom
   time assays for control RTHA were 16.7 to 39.7 s and 11.5 to 91.8 s,
   respectively. One study bird was diagnosed with clinical AR intoxication
   with a brodifacoum levels in blood of 0.006 and 0.234 ug/g wet weight in
   blood and liver respectively, a packed cell volume (PCV) of 19\%, and PT
   and RVVT times of >180 s. No correlation was found between PT and RVVT
   in the control or free-range RTHA, and there was no relationship found
   between the presence of liver anticoagulant residues and clotting times
   in the PT and RVVT.},

   (22 species) accounted for 28\% of the total number of species, and
   Capitellidae, Lumbrineridae and Spionidae comprised 45\% of the total
   number of individuals. The most dominant species in the region were
   Lumbrineris geldiayi, Notomastus mossambicus and Prionospio saccifera. A
   total of 20 alien species belonging to 12 families were found in the
   region, with N. mossambicus and P. saccifera accounting for more than

Title = {Attempts to introduce a system of national, racial and/or ethnocultural

   etc.)},
Journal = {TAXON},

Abstract = {With their article ``Restoring indigenous names in taxonomy ``, Gillman
   \& Wright (2020) initiated a discussion that culminated in a set of
   proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae,
   fungi, and plants (ICN) by allowing the retroactive replacement of
   scientific names and/or epithets of plants and other organisms in favor
   of ``indigenous names `` (vernacular names used by Indigenous Peoples).
   Here I emphasize several main topics and questions critically important
   for the suggested implementation of the proposals by Wright and Gillman.
   My conclusions regarding the proposals by Wright and Gillman are as
   follows. The ``definition `` of Indigenous People proposed by Wright and
   Gillman for the ICN is dramatically different from the working
   definitions and identification/self-identification criteria of
   Indigenous Peoples provided in the UN Declaration on the rights of
   Indigenous Peoples (United Nations, 2007) and other relevant
   international documents. That ``definition `` is vague, potentially
   discriminatory, may bring unnecessary conflicts, and cannot be used in
   practice. Nomenclatural committees and the taxonomic community as a
   whole should not be involved in political debates about which peoples
   are indigenous and which are not, which bodies represent those peoples
   and which do not have that right. Giving special privileges in
   nomenclature to some groups of Indigenous Peoples but not to other
   peoples with comparable levels of traditional knowledge would be an act
   of unexplainable and unjustified discrimination. The argument of
   ``demonstrable chronological priority `` of vernacular ``indigenous ``
   names over scientific names used by Wright and Gillman is irrelevant in
   biological nomenclature and taxonomy and cannot be used in practice. The
   proposal to allow the use of ``indigenous `` diacritics in biological
   nomenclature would result in allowance of dozens diacritic signs
   actually used by various Indigenous ethnic groups, and should not be
   accepted. The replacement procedure proposed by Wright and Gillman will
   not work as they intended because they failed to outline workable rules
   for it. Science (the scientific nomenclature of organisms included)
   should not be biased or distorted politically, racially, ethnically,
   socially, genderly, religiously or otherwise. Any attempts or proposals
   aimed at granting preferences in biological nomenclature to any
   political, racial, ethnic, social, gender, religious or other group or
   groups should be rejected as discriminatory acts. Consequently, the
   ``proposals `` by Wright and Gillman should be rejected by the
   international community of taxonomists of plants, fungi, and algae.},

Abstract = {The widespread Neotropical genus Melocactus of approximately 42
   currently recognized species, is most diverse in eastern Brazil and the
   Greater Antilles, especially Cuba. Species delimitation is notoriously
   problematic in the group, although this is due in part to a lack of
   detailed systematic studies, as well as a severely cluttered
   nomenclatural history. To date, no comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses
   have been generated for the clade, although some population genetic and
   morphological studies exist. We generated the largest phylogenetic
   dataset of Melocactus to date based on plastome data derived from a
   genome-skimming approach for 26 taxa, which provided a framework for
   understanding species limits and relationships among Caribbean species.
   Our time-calibrated phylogeny revealed a mid-Pleistocene origin for
   Melocactus, and we resolved three major clades, a Cuban clade, a mostly
   South American clade, and a widespread Caribbean clade, which also
   included some South American taxa. Our topology recovered the Cuban
   clade as sister to the rest of the species, although this placement was
   poorly supported, and several other Cuban species are scattered
   throughout the rest of the tree. Biogeographic analyses suggested
   multiple dispersal events from South America leading to the current
   diversity on Cuba, as well as other parts of the Antilles. Based on our
   phylogenetic results, previous hypotheses of species numbers and
   relationships in the Caribbean generated solely on morphology have, in
   some cases, been greatly underestimated. Our study shows that plastome
   data are effective for resolving clades and species limits in
   Melocactus, although future work will need to include broader sampling
   and larger datasets to fully resolve relationships in this complicated
   group of cacti. We describe one new cryptic species for Cuba, Melocactus
   santiagoensis sp. nov., and provide a new combination (Melocactus
   lagunaensis comb. \& stat. nov.), based on our phylogenetic results and
   morphological data and typify numerous names in the genus. The genus
   Melocactus is another striking example of the exceptional diversity that
   has been generated in the poorly studied, seasonally dry tropical forest
   of the Greater Antilles.},

   helicarionid land snails of northern Queensland, Australia
   (Stylommatophora: Helicarionidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Volume = {56},

Pages = {1727-1799},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Helicarionid land snails with large shells have been placed in three
   genera: Malandena, Pravonitor and Elatonitor. These taxa are revised
   herein using comparative morpho-anatomy and mitochondrial phylogenetics.
   We demonstrate that these species represent three independent
   radiations, but this is not reflected in the current generic
   arrangement. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that these genera do
   not form a monophyletic group, and we conclude that large shells have
   evolved multiple times among helicarionids in Queensland, Australia,
   presumably as an adaptation to moist environments. Species belonging to
   Pravonitor have a medium-sized to large, glossy shell, often with a
   peripheral band. Among other traits, they always have a
   single-chambered, internally pustulose or ridged penis, an epiphallus
   with a slender flagellum, and a long epiphallic caecum with medial
   penial retractor muscle attachment. This genus comprises eight species:
   Pravonitor kreffti, P. ferrugineus, P. insularum, P. annulus, P.
   aquilonia comb. nov., P. monteithi comb. nov., P. septentrionalis sp.
   nov. and P. stuarti sp. nov. We describe Geminitor gen. nov. for
   Geminitor laura comb. nov., G. villaris comb. nov., G. kullaensis sp.
   nov., G. macveae sp. nov. and G. wenlockensis sp. nov. Geminitor has a
   small to medium-sized shell, a long, two-chambered penis, an epiphallus
   with a slender flagellum, and an epiphallic caecum with basal penial
   retractor muscle attachment. The unavailable genus name Malandena is
   subsumed under Elatonitor, which now contains Elatonitor montanus and E.
   suturalis comb. nov. Elatonitor has a large glossy shell with an
   angulate periphery, a long, narrow, single-chambered penis with
   longitudinal pilasters, an epiphallus with a broad flagellum, and no
   epiphallic caecum. While this study has nearly doubled the number of
   known large helicarionid species in Far North Queensland, there are
   still knowledge gaps and we recommend further surveys to search for
   undocumented species, improve our understanding of species distribution
   and undertake vital conservation assessments.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures have caused a substantial decline of global
   biodiversity and have been further reported to strongly affect the
   ecological performance of species in their habitat, especially reptiles.
   Understanding the ecology of species and how species respond to habitat
   alterations is basic knowledge needed to develop conservation programmes
   and address issues of biodiversity loss. All five species of tiger
   geckos (Goniurosaurus) in Vietnam are known to be threatened by
   extinction due to anthropogenic impacts such as habitat degradation and
   harvesting for the international pet trade. However, conservation
   actions have only been initiated for the better-studied species. This
   study provides detailed basic data on microhabitat use of two allopatric
   sister species, namely Goniurosaurus huuliensis and G. luii. In total,
   145 geckos (including 59 records of G. huuliensis and 86 records of G.
   luii) were observed during field surveys. All Goniurosaurus individuals
   were mostly recorded in the forest on karst formations, covered with
   evergreen broad-leaved woody trees, intermixed with ferns, shrubs and
   vines. Microhabitats of the two species were relatively similar in other
   traits, such as high vegetation coverage, high humidity, stable ambient
   temperature and dry-rock substrates. A multiple factor analysis
   supported that the ecological niche spaces of the two species highly
   overlap, even though their distribution ranges are geographically
   separated. We further found no intraspecific niche segregation in both
   species. The present data provide baseline knowledge for both in situ
   and ex situ conservation measures to protect species in the genus
   Goniurosaurus.},

Abstract = {The Tama small-eared shrew is found in the Andean cloud forests of the
   Cordillera Oriental of Colombia and the Tama paramo in western
   Venezuela. Few aspects of its biology are known, and all information
   comes from its original description. In a patch of oak cloud forest, we
   found a relatively abundant population of the species and studied its
   abundance, microhabitat preference, diet composition and reproductive
   features, and their relationship with the rainfall seasonality of the
   study area. The fieldwork was carried on for two years at altitudinal
   intervals from 2402 to 2627 m.a.s.l. We caught 44 shrews in
   microhabitats with dense vegetation cover, abundant litter and fallen
   trees; their abundance changed significantly through time, varying along
   with the precipitation of the month before the capture. We found seven
   groups of arthropods in their diet, the composition of which did not
   differ significantly between sexes, reproductive stages or seasons.
   These shrews have a specialised diet, with ants as the most important
   item. Reproductive males are distinguished externally by the presence of
   hypertrophic subcutaneous lateral glands. We found adult reproductive
   males and non-reproductive males throughout the duration of the study,
   and their abundance did not vary significantly with precipitation. In
   contrast, we did not capture females in the driest months of the years,
   and although adult non-reproductive females were also found, we found a
   significant relationship between the abundance of reproductive females
   and precipitation. Consequently, adult reproductive males would be a
   permanent reproductive resource for the females, which appear to adjust
   their reproductive activity during the rainy seasons.},

Title = {Descriptions of three new Pseudolitochira Ward, 1942 species (Crustacea:
   Brachyura: Pilumnidae) from the West Pacific},

Abstract = {Pseudolitochira Ward, 1942 (Brachyura: Pilumnidae) is superficially
   similar to Heteropilumnus De Man, 1895, but it can be distinguished from
   the latter by possessing a more subovate carapace, the dorsal surface of
   the carapace almost devoid of regions, a proportionately wider front
   with short anterolateral margins, and, most significantly, a different
   posterior margin of the epistome. In Heteropilumnus species, and most
   Pilumnus species, each lateral margin of the posterior margin of the
   epistome is separated into two parts, demarcated by a clear median
   fissure. In Pseudolitochira, the lateral margin is entire and evenly
   concave, without any trace of a cleft or fissure. For the present study,
   Japanese specimens reported as `P. integra' by Maenosono (2019) were
   examined and it was found that they should be referred to a new species.
   Furthermore, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu specimens belong to two other
   new species. The present paper provides a diagnosis for the three new
   species and compares them with P. integra (Miers, 1884) s. str.},

Abstract = {The large floral chambers of the Neotropical Annonaceae are pollinated
   by large beetles of the tribe Cyclocephalini Laporte (Melolonthidae).
   Previous research indicates that, depending on the geographic area, the
   assemblage of Cyclocephalini pollinators may differ. In this study,
   pollinators of Annona crassiflora Mart. were surveyed in the Cerrado of
   Chapada dos Guimaraes, Mato Grosso, Brazil, for the first time. The
   analysis of 74 flowers from 24 A. crassiflora individuals revealed that
   the principal pollinator was Cyclocephala octopunctata Burmeister. The
   secondary pollinator, Cyclocephala celata Dechambre, and C. octopunctata
   exhibited behaviour that may promote cross pollination, visiting both
   female- and male-phase flowers, touching stigmas and anthers and
   becoming coated in pollen during anthesis. This is the first record of
   C. celata, a species commonly found pollinating Araceae in the Atlantic
   Forest, as a pollinator of an Annonaceae species in the Cerrado.
   Additionally, an interim phase between the female and male phases of A.
   crassiflora is documented here for the first time.},

Volume = {56},

Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {The stalked barnacles Minyaspis faroni associated with antipatharians
   known from the southern Red Sea have been recently recorded in the
   northern Red Sea. Two genera of oxynaspids, Oxyaspis and Minyaspis,
   differ morphologically in the coverage of the capitulum. In Oxyaspis,
   the capitulum is covered by calcified plates, whereas in Minyaspis, the
   plates are reduced, and there is an uncalcified area between plates.
   Molecular analyses revealed that species with reduced plates do not
   cluster in the same clade, whereas species with full coverage and
   uncalcified capitula are found in the same clade. Our analysis indicates
   that the reduction of opercular plates in the epibiotic barnacles has
   occurred more than once in the barnacle evolutionary pathway. The
   reduction in shell plates' number, size, shape and thickness is an
   adaptive character of epibiotic symbiosis. This mode of life, common in
   thoracican barnacles, leads to adaptive morphological changes. Hence,
   the morphology of shell plates is not a homologous feature but reflects
   parallel evolution.},

Title = {Simple and complex burrow morphology in two Macrophthalmus species on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Burrowing Ocypodoidea crabs are an abundant component of many tropical
   and temperate coastal areas and central to the ecosystem functioning,
   for instance because they recycle nutrients, are important food for many
   shorebirds and alter the sediment through their burrowing behaviour. The
   burrow morphology of these crabs may differ between and within species,
   often correlated with differences in habitat preferences, crab
   morphology and life-history traits. Here we studied the burrow
   morphology and complexity of Macrophthalmus sulcatus and Macrophthalmus
   depressus, by means of casts (n = 7 and 10, respectively) and burrow
   excavations (n = 17 and 16, respectively) at the pristine intertidal
   mudflats of Barr Al Hikman in the Sultanate of Oman. We found that M.
   sulcatus construct simple burrows that were in all but one case
   inhabited by a single crab. By contrast, all burrows of M. depressus
   were complex, with multiple entrances and many (deep-reaching) branches.
   There was a strong relationship between M. sulcatus carapace width and
   burrow entrance size, indicating that the simple burrows are adapted to
   and made by the occupant. There was no relation between M. depressus
   carapace width and burrow entrance size, and in six burrows more than
   one crab was encountered, suggesting that the complex burrows are not
   made by and adapted to a single occupant. The complex burrows were found
   close to the shore whereas the simple burrows were found at the
   intermediate tidal zone. We speculate that the striking differences in
   burrow morphology may be explained by difference in habitat selection of
   the studied crabs, which most importantly relates to differences in
   sediment structure and tidal height. Crab morphology and life-history
   traits of the studied crabs could also account for the observed
   difference in burrow morphology.},

Title = {Starvation and cadmium affect energy reserves and oxidative stress in
   individuals of Spodoptera exigua},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {Different factors, such as starvation and metal exposure, may affect
   development and cause oxidative stress in insects. Some host plants may
   contain a high concentration of cadmium due to their hyperaccumulating
   property. The negative effects of metals and hunger may be manifested by
   low availability of energetic substrates. This study aimed to assess
   whether the insect population with a history of long metal exposure may
   better manage metal stress or/and starvation at different developmental
   stages, with the use of energetic substrates. Two strains of Spodoptera
   exigua model organism were tested: control strain and cadmium strain
   (treated continuously for over 200 generations with subtoxic amounts of
   cadmium). The effects of different factors, individually and in
   combination, on the tested strains were assessed, first by determining
   the body weight of larvae and pupae and then by estimating the
   concentration of biomolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, or
   glycogen) in the 4th and 5th larval stages and in pupae, and the total
   antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation level in the 4th larval
   stage. Compared to control strain, cadmium strain individuals exhibited
   changes in the concentration of soluble carbohydrates and protein. This
   was partly related to earlier 1-day starvation. In particular, changes
   in carbohydrate concentration seemed to be a sensitive biomarker of
   metal stress, independent of the age of individuals and period of
   starvation. However, the increase in the total antioxidant capacity and
   the concentration of lipid peroxidation products in the 4th larval stage

Abstract = {Avobenzone and octinoxate are frequently used as organic ultraviolet
   filters, and these chemicals are widely detected in water. This study
   evaluated the potential of avobenzone and octinoxate to disrupt thyroid
   endocrine system in wild-type and thyroid hormone receptor alpha a
   knockout (thr alpha a(-/-)) zebrafish embryo/larvae. Following a 120 h
   exposure to various concentrations of avobenzone and octinoxate, larvae
   mortality and developmental toxicity in wild-type and thr alpha a(-/-)
   fish were assessed. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels as
   well as transcriptional levels of ten genes associated with the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were measured in wild-type
   fish. Significantly lower larvae survival rate in thr alpha a(-/-) fish
   exposed to >= 3 mu M avobenzone and octinoxate suggests that the thyroid
   hormone receptor plays a crucial role in the toxic effects of avobenzone
   and octinoxate. A significant increase in the deio2 gene level in
   avobenzone-exposed zebrafish supports the result of an increased ratio
   of T3 to T4. Significant decrease of T4 level with upregulation of trh,
   tsh beta, and tshr genes indicates feedback in the hypothalamus and
   pituitary gland to maintain hormonal homeostasis. Our observation
   indicates that exposure to avobenzone and octinoxate affects the thyroid
   hormone receptor and the feedback mechanisms of the HPT axis.},

Abstract = {A catalogue of the species of Platylabini from the south-eastern United
   States is presented, with an updated list of the species, a review of
   their distribution, and the first illustrated key to the genera and
   species. Cyclolabus gracilicornis gracilicornis (Provancher, 1886) is
   newly recorded for the province of Nova Scotia (Canada), while eight
   species are recorded for the first time for the following US states:
   Amboplisus ornatus (Cresson, 1868) for Georgia; Asthenolabus canadensis
   (Cresson, 1877) for West Virginia; Linycus exhortator thoracicus
   (Cresson, 1864) for Virginia, Neolinycus michaelis Heinrich, 1971 for
   Florida; Platylabus clarus (Cresson, 1867) for Alabama, Virginia and
   West Virginia; Platylabus opaculus americanus Heinrich, 1962 for North
   Carolina; Probolus detritus (Brulle, 1846) and Tropicolabus foxi (Davis,
   1898) for Florida. Based on newly discovered and already published
   material, a new subspecies synonym has been recognised: Neolinycus
   michaelis arkansae Heinrich 1975 is regarded as a junior synonym of
   Neolinycus michaelis michaelis Heinrich, 1971, and the previous
   subspecies synonymy that regarded Neolinycus michaelis georgianus
   Heinrich, 1972 as a junior synonym of the nominate subspecies has been
   confirmed and explained. The female of Tropicolabus foxi is described
   for the first time, marking the first record of the species since its
   original description. Nomenclatural notes and extensive comments for
   each species are provided, as well as a key to the tribes of
   Ichneumoninae of North America, and to the genera and species of
   Platylabini from the south-eastern United States.},

Title = {Revision of Formosargus James, 1939 (Diptera: Stratiomyidae): five new
   species in an otherwise rare genus and Amsaria Adisoemarto, 1974 as a
   generic synonym},

Abstract = {The Australian and Oriental genus Formosargus James, 1939
   (Stratiomyidae: Sarginae), until recently only known from three
   described species - F. kerteszi James, 1939, F. melanogrammus Lessard
   and Woodley, 2020, and F. variegatus James, 1969 - is herein revised.
   The monotypic sargine genus Amsaria Adisoemarto, 1974 is considered to
   be a synonym of Formosargus, and examination of material accumulated
   over the years resulted in the description of five new species to
   science: F. berezovskiyi sp. nov., F. borneensis sp. nov., F.
   mangoleensis sp. nov., F. trivittatus sp. nov. and F. woodleyi sp. nov.
   The genus, which was previously thought to be restricted to the Oriental
   Region only - known from species from Taiwan and the Philippines, though
   recently discovered in northern Australia and West Java, Indonesia (F.
   melanogrammus) - is here shown to be widespread in Southeast Asia. It
   reaches not only the transition zone between the Oriental and Australian
   regions and beyond, with first records from Papua New Guinea, but is
   also reported from the continental portion of Asia, with first records
   from Malaysia and Thailand. Rare in collections and with virtually no
   biological information available, Formosargus may have a hidden
   diversity in the Southeast Asia tropical wet forests, so additional
   species are expected to be found with future collecting efforts in the
   area. A key to all the species of Formosargus (which now includes 10
   species), detailed descriptions of the species, and a map expanding the
   geographical distribution of the genus are also presented.},

Abstract = {Ganoderma is a large and diverse, cosmopolitan fungal genus in the
   Basidiomycota, comprises species with prized medicinal properties,
   valuable biotechnological applications and of significant
   phytopathological interest. In Europe, the number of Ganoderma species
   is low compared to North America, East Asia or the tropics. Among the
   seven accepted Ganoderma species in Europe, only one has a perennial
   basidiome with a resinous layer on the pileus surface and dark brown
   context. In the scientific literature, this species appears under the
   name G. pfeifferi or G. cupreolaccatum. However, Quelet provided a
   detailed watercolour painting of a single basidiome under the name Fomes
   advena in 1872, which shows similar morphological features. Considering
   that F. advena was validly and effectively published well before G.
   pfeifferi and ``Polyporus cupreolaccatus{''}, the nomenclatural status
   of this forgotten and overlooked name is discussed.},

   five species from the Palaearctic so far. All members of the genus are
   highly specialised to semi-aquatic habitats and aphid hosts and plants
   that occupy them. Because they have practically no economic importance
   as biocontrol agents, the biology of Diaeretellus species is still
   somewhat unknown. We describe a new species of this genus, Diaeretellus
   nymphaealis sp. nov., another member of aphid-parasitoid guilds from
   wetland habitats and the first species of the genus to be described from
   the Nearctic. Wetland habitats are under considerable anthropogenic
   pressure and as such require intensive conservation efforts. Placing the
   focus of conservation strategies on hyperdiverse entomofauna, instead of
   only charismatic megafauna, can have positive effects on their outcomes.},

Abstract = {The density and age structure of spider populations are affected by
   biotic and abiotic factors. The orb-web spider Eustala taquara
   (Araneidae) lives camouflaged on the dead vegetation of shrubs,
   especially in forest edges. Here, we describe the variation in the
   number of individuals over the year and the phenology of a population of
   E. taquara. We also tested whether these variables are influenced by
   temperature, precipitation or prey availability. We conducted the
   research in a tropical rainforest located in south-eastern Brazil. We
   recorded the number of spiders and their development stages (spiderling,
   young, juvenile, sub-adult and adult) monthly, for two years, along 1 km
   at the forest edge at an altitude of 1000 m above sea level. We
   estimated prey availability using 20 circular transparent plates
   containing tanglefoot on one side, exposed for 48 hours in the
   vegetation, sampled monthly for 18 months. We used circular statistics
   to assess the peaks of individuals during the study period, verifying
   the occurrence of time lags between the number of spiders with the
   climatic variables and prey availability. The population of E. taquara
   increased in periods of lower precipitation and temperature, and
   decreased during the rainy season. Thus, the population showed a
   negative correlation with the climatic variables and potential prey
   availability. All instars were present simultaneously, revealing that
   spiders can reproduce at any time of year. During the dry season, the
   higher number of spiders may be related to the increase in branches and
   dead plants that provide camouflage against visually oriented predators
   and sites for web building, increasing the likelihood of obtaining food.},

Title = {Persistence, leaching and associated toxicity risks of insecticide
   pyriproxyfen in soil ecosystem},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Pyriproxyfen is a pyridine-based insecticide used for pest control in
   fruits and vegetables. It is a potent endocrine disruptor and hormone
   imitator. Considering its potential hazards to non-target organisms and
   the associated environment, a lab study was conducted for assessing
   persistence, mobility in sandy loam soil and associated risk to various
   non-target organisms and soil enzymes. Pyriproxyfen formulation was
   applied at 0.05 and 0.10 mu g g(-1) soil which was equivalent to
   recommended and double dose of 100 and 200 g a.i. ha(-1), respectively.
   Three methods namely QuEChERS, liquid-solid extraction (LSE) and matrix
   solid phase dispersion (MSPD) were compared for achieving efficient
   sample preparation. MSPD was applied for final analysis as it gave
   better recoveries (94.2 to 104.3\%) over other methods with limits of
   detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) as 0.0001 and 0.0005 mu g
   g(-1), respectively. Dissipation followed first order kinetics with
   half-lives of 7.6 and 8.2 days in both doses but residues retained over
   45 days in soil. Leaching studies conducted at 50 and 100 mu g of
   pyriproxyfen showed extremely poor leaching potential. Retention of over
   90\% residues in top 5 cm soil surface indicated minimal threat of
   ground and surface water contamination. Toxicological study demonstrated
   very different behaviour toward different enzymatic activities.
   Pyriproxyfen was relatively toxic for alkaline phosphatase and
   fluorescein diacetate hydrolase enzymes. beta-glucosidase activity was
   triggered whereas arylsulfatase activity remained unaffected.
   Unacceptable risk to soil invertebrates at double dose application
   clearly indicated that its longer persistence in soil could be toxic to
   other non-target organisms and needs further investigations.},

   enzyme activities},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Saline-alkalisation of the soil environment and microorganism is a
   global challenge. However, relevant studies on the effects of
   saline-alkali stress on soil bacterial communities are limited. In this
   study, we investigated the effects of saline-alkali stress on the carbon
   source metabolic utilisation of the microbial community, bacterial
   diversity, and composition in soil using Biolog Ecoplate and 16S rRNA
   gene amplicon sequencing. Biolog Ecoplate results showed that
   saline-alkali stress decreased the metabolic activity and functional
   diversity, and changed the utilisation characteristics of carbon sources
   in soil microorganisms. Particularly, high level of saline-alkali stress
   significantly decreased the utilisation of carbohydrates and amino acids
   carbon sources. The results of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed
   that high level of saline-alkali stress significantly reduced the
   diversity of soil bacterial communities. In addition, high level of
   saline-alkali stress significantly decreased the relative abundances of
   some key bacterial taxa, such as Gemmatimonas, Sphingomonas, and
   Bradyrhizobium. Furthermore, as saline-alkali content increased, the
   soil catalase, protease, urease, and sucrase activities also
   significantly decreased. Collectively, these results provide new insight
   for studies on the changes in the soil bacterial community and soil
   enzyme activity under saline-alkali stress.},

   supralabials; 9-11 infralabials; dorsal tubercles rounded, conical to
   weakly keeled and in 19-20 longitudinal rows; 32-36 paravertebral
   tubercles between the level of axilla and groin; 32-39 mid-ventral scale
   rows across the ventral region; 6 precloacal pores in males and 0-6
   precloacal pits in females; 14-18 subdigital lamellae under toe IV; no
   single row of transversely enlarged subcaudal scales; indistinct pattern
   of alternating dark brown blotches on the dorsum of the body.
   Morphologically and genetically, the new species is recovered as the
   sister species to C. aaronbaueri, but is genetically distinct by an
   uncorrected p-distance of 0.099-0.1, and morphologically in the number

Abstract = {We monitored a recently discovered population of Paratelmatobius
   mantiqueira for 13 months and gathered new data for the species:
   external morphology of tadpoles, acoustic repertoire, and life history
   traits. We also collected unprecedented data on behaviours and
   interactions of adults and tadpoles observed during monitoring. Based on
   natural markings of P. mantiqueira adults, we estimated the effective
   population size and estimated their home range. With circular
   statistics, we tested whether they were seasonally active and evaluated
   how humidity and temperature influenced the detectability of the
   species. We found that tadpoles and advertisement calls of P.
   mantiqueira differed from congeneric species. We also described the
   release and aggressive calls. We found that the species has a small home
   range, with probable resident females. Temperature and humidity
   positively influenced the detectability of P. mantiqueira; encounters
   varied seasonally. Paratelmatobius mantiqueira is a strictly forest
   species, found mainly in leaf litter and associated with muddy areas in
   rocky outcrops of highland forests. Our study provides new data about P.
   mantiqueira, which may help future integrative taxonomy approaches and
   contribute to the conservation of this species.},

Title = {Assessing the nomenclatural history of the sucupira-branca trees:

Abstract = {Sucupira-branca is a popular name for the papilionoid legume tree genus
   Pterodon (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae), which is amply distributed
   across South American savannas and seasonally dry tropical forests.
   Pterodon has been strongly supported as monophyletic in all molecular
   phylogenetic analyses and stands out within the Dipterygeae clade by the
   pinnately compound leaves with terete rachis, symmetrical leaflets with
   emarginate apex, and indehiscent, one-seeded cryptosamara fruit. Despite
   a growing interest in Pterodon species, mainly due to their potential as
   drug and timber sources, their nomenclature was never fully assessed.
   Here, we present a nomenclatural review of the economically and
   ecologically important Pterodon, where we assess all 15 names and
   designations ever associated with the genus and provide all known
   orthographic variants and type localities for the accepted names.
   Besides that, we propose one new species the designation of which has
   never been validly published, typify five names, propose one new
   synonym, and provide a list of all the accepted names in the genus.
   Also, we show that the nomenclatural history of P. emarginatus, one of
   the ecologically most dominant species in fire-prone savanna vegetation,
   is closely related to how Friedrich Sellow (1789-1831) collected and
   numbered his gatherings. By elucidating the typification of this
   particularly important species, we shed light on how to more accurately
   annotate Sellow's specimens in nomenclatural revisions.},

Abstract = {The hydroids of Cocos Island (Isla del Coco), Costa Rica, have received
   scant attention and are poorly known. Only 11 species have been reported
   from there previously, with five of them being stylasterids. Hydroids
   examined here were collected during 2019 in a search for invasive
   species, as part of a fouling survey. Fourteen species - three
   anthoathecates and 11 leptothecates - were identified in the collection.
   All represent new records for Cocos Island, elevating its number of
   reported species to 25. The most abundant species in the collection were
   Clytia obliqua (Clarke, 1907) and Sertularella affinicostata Calder and
   Faucci, 2021, found in 11 of 42 samples (26\%), and Tridentata
   borneensis Billard, 1925a, present in nine (21\%) of them. Nematocysts
   of Corydendrium flabellatum Fraser, 1938a and Eudendrium cf. certicaule
   Fraser, 1938a are newly identified, measured and illustrated. Three
   species (Clytia brevithecata (Thornely, 1900), Halopteris alternata
   (Nutting, 1900) and Macrorhynchia philippina Kirchenpauer, 1872), are
   introduced, with the rest assigned to a native or cryptogenic status.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of the species of the South American genus Symmela
   Erichson, 1835 is revised. As a result, we propose the following new
   synonymies: Symmela longula Erichson, 1835 (= Symmela angustula Moser
   1919 syn. nov.), Symmela nitida Erichson, 1835 (= Symmela tenella
   Erichson, 1835 syn. nov.). Fourteen new species are described: Symmela

   nov., S. pseudopaca sp. nov., S. reischei sp. nov., S. terezae sp. nov.,
   S. unidentata sp. nov. The lectotypes of the following taxa were
   designated: Serica flavimana Gory, 1832, Symmela angustula Moser, 1919,
   S. clypeata Erichson, 1835, S. corumbana Moser, 1921, S. instabilis

   Moser, 1919, and S. tenella Erichson, 1835. Species are redescribed and
   a key to the species is given; details of external morphological
   features as well as the aedeagus are illustrated for all taxa.
   Distribution of the species is shown on a map. A phylogenetic analysis
   based on 137 morphological characters and parsimony indicates that
   Symmela is monophyletic.},

Abstract = {Loxaulus hyalinus Pujade-Villar \& Melika, 2014 was originally described
   as an asexual form but the recent collection of male samples confirms
   that it is, actually, a sexual form. The male of L. hyalinus is here
   morphologically described. With L. hyalinus being a sexual form, the
   reasonable question arises whether it may be the alternate generation of
   the only other Loxaulus species currently known from Mexico, L. laeta
   Pujade-Villar, 2014 (asex). An analysis of the phylogenetic
   relationships between L. hyalinus (sex) and L. laeta (asex) shows an
   uncorrected genetic distance variation between sympatric and allopatric
   individuals averaging 6.4\% (range 5.9-6.9\%) between the two species
   independently of the sampled locality. Four different species
   delimitation models - Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Bayesian
   implementation of the Poisson tree processes (bPTP), Bayesian
   Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP), and Bayesian Factor Delimitation
   (BFD) - support the distinctiveness of the two Loxaulus species.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal contamination in the coastal and marine ecosystems is
   becoming a serious risk to aquatic organisms and humans. This study
   reports the effects, including genetic damage, of accumulations of trace
   metals on Liza aurata, which is used as a bio-indicator species, in the
   Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay, north-eastern Mediterranean by COMET
   Assay. L. aurata were seasonally collected from a sampling site and a
   reference site for one year. Physicochemical parameters in water and
   trace metals in the tissues of fish collected from these sites were
   determined by electrochemical techniques. High DNA damage frequency in
   L. aurata was observed along the Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay compared
   to the reference site because of pollutants. The detected high levels of
   Cd, Pb, Fe and Cu accumulation in L. aurata exceed the maximum levels
   allowed by the national and international limit values. Significant
   positive correlations between Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Fe, Zn, and Cu
   accumulations and DNA damage parameters were observed in the present
   study. Additionally, we first reported the successful use of the
   electrochemical technique in the determination of trace metal
   concentrations in mullet. Moreover, L. aurata constitutes a key tool as
   a sentinel organism for biomonitoring of coastal ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The antidiabetic drug metformin is widely prescribed and found in
   different concentrations in the environment around the world, raising
   concern about potential impacts on aquatic life. Analyses of the effects
   of exposure of biological models to aquatic contaminants are important
   for assessing pollution effects on fish health. The gills of fishes
   represent primary targets of disturbance by pollutants, mainly because
   of the large surface of the respiratory epithelium and the high
   perfusion rate, which both help the entry of pollutants into this
   tissue. In this context, the aim of this work was to use gill
   histological analyses biomarkers to evaluate the toxicity of metformin
   on aquatic environmental systems, by means of chronic exposure for 90
   days of Astyanax lacustris (lambari), an ecologically important
   neotropical species that can be used as an environmental bioindicator.
   Histopathological analyses were performed using Light and Scanning
   Electron Microscopy. The main changes were lamellar fusion,
   telangiectasia hyperplasia and disappearance of microridges. The
   morphological changes observed possibly interfere with the gill
   physiology, indicating an unfavorable situation to the presence of
   metformin in the water, pointing to a concern that metformin may pose a
   risk to Astyanax lacustris and likely to other fish species,
   compromising the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem as a whole.},

Abstract = {Smith \& al. (2022), Hammer \& Thiele (2021), and some other authors
   recently discussed and proposed dramatic changes to the International
   Code of Nomenclature of algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) aimed at the
   provisions allowing rejection and replacement of valid and legitimate
   names that reflect the ``colonial and imperialist power{''} or may be
   considered, at least by some experts and users, as ``culturally
   offensive or inappropriate{''} because of several broadly and vaguely
   formulated reasons, such as names considered to be ``derogatory or
   insulting to a person or group of people{''}, those honoring ``a person
   that the taxonomic community agrees should not be honoured{''}, and even
   any name that ``otherwise causes deep offense{''}. These proposals and
   their possible outcomes were analyzed and criticized in my article
   (Mosyakin, 2022), which was, in turn, criticized in a recent article by
   Smith \& al. (2022). In the present note I respond to that criticism,
   discuss additional cases of possible ``culturally offensive or
   inappropriate{''} names, and provide additional evidence of possible
   (and, in my opinion, highly probable) confrontational and disruptive
   outcomes in case if the proposals to reject ``culturally offensive or
   inappropriate{''} names are accepted and incorporated into the ICN. I
   appeal to the international community of taxonomists to reject such
   proposals, to protect the fundamental Preamble 1 and Art. 51 of the ICN,
   to protect the scientific freedom and principles of nomenclatural
   stability and political neutrality, and to protect our science from
   politically motivated decisions. The Pandora's Box of anticipated fights
   for or against ``culturally offensive and inappropriate names{''} should
   remain firmly closed. Scientists in general and plant taxonomists in our
   case should firmly stand for the common values of scientific freedom,
   mutual understanding and respect, tolerance, reconciliation, a bold,
   open-minded and honest view of history (including history of taxonomy),
   and, specifically, the principle of neutrality of biological
   nomenclature well expressed in Art. 51 of the ICN. Essentially the same
   provisions in earlier versions of the Code or other earlier rules of
   botanical nomenclature served well the generations of taxonomists and
   users of taxonomic information, preventing unnecessary conflicts between
   people and peoples over names of organisms, which someone sometime
   somehow may or may not consider ``culturally offensive or
   inappropriate{''}. Preamble 1 and Art. 51 of the ICN are crucial tools
   for maintaining nomenclatural stability, civility, and tolerance in our
   diverse, complicated and, unfortunately, not so peaceful present-day
   world, and especially in our science of biological taxonomy reflecting
   the amazing diversity of the living world of our planet.},

Abstract = {Due to their burrowing lifestyles that make them difficult to sample,
   the distributions and habitat associations of most burrowing crayfishes
   are poorly understood. A distributional study was conducted in
   south-western Pennsylvania to better understand the range and habitat
   associations of the primary burrowing crayfish Cambarus dubius within
   the state. A total of 790 new sites and six previously surveyed sites
   were sampled between the Chestnut Ridge and Allegheny Mountains, with
   the majority of these localities being roadside ditches. Crayfish were
   collected using a combination of burrow excavation, baited lines, and by
   hand. We utilised permutation-based t-tests to determine differences in
   habitat variables between sites with and without C. dubius and sites
   with and without any burrowing crayfish species. Cambarus dubius was
   collected from 61 total sites, and active crayfish burrows were observed
   at 137 additional sites. Cambarus carinirostris was collected from 13
   sites, Lacunicambarus thomai was collected from six sites, and an exuvia
   of Procambarus acutus was collected from a stream at one site. New
   behavioural observations for C. dubius juveniles were observed while
   collecting specimens with baited lines. Sites with C. dubius had
   significantly more canopy cover and deciduous forest land cover and
   significantly less pasture-hay land cover than sites without C. dubius.
   Sites with burrowing crayfishes (all species) had significantly more
   canopy cover and deciduous forest land cover and significantly lower
   elevation, depth to the water table, percent sand substrate and
   pasture-hay land cover than sites without burrowing crayfish. In
   Pennsylvania, Cambarus dubius has not expanded its range in comparison
   to its historical range, and populations appear to be concentrated
   primarily in the southern valleys of the Chestnut Ridge and Allegheny
   Mountains.},

Abstract = {The use of insecticides to control undesirable pest species in forestry
   has undergone a shift from broad spectrum to narrow spectrum
   insecticides to reduce the risk of effects on non-target species.
   However, there is still risk of direct effects on non-target species as
   some insecticides function as hormone mimics, or through indirect
   pathways as the insecticide is broken down in the environment.
   Tebufenozide, an ecdysone hormone mimic, is the active ingredient in
   insecticides used in a variety of large scale pest control programs. An
   oft cited reason for the safety of Tebufenozide is that it is rapidly
   broken down in the environment by microbes. We investigated the
   potential non-target effects of two Tebufenozide formulations used in
   Canada, Mimic 240LV and Limit 240, on aquatic communities using an
   outdoor mesocosm experiment. We focus on direct effects on amphibian
   larvae (wood frog, Rana sylvaticus), zooplankton communities, and
   effects on biofilm and phytoplanktonic microbial communities that could
   arise from either direct toxicity, or from breaking down the insecticide
   as a nutrient and/or carbon source. There was limited evidence for
   direct effects on amphibian larvae or zooplankton communities. There
   were small but non-significant shifts in biofilm microbial communities
   responsible for nutrient cycling. Beta diversity in the plankton
   community was slightly higher among tanks treated with insecticide
   indicating a community dispersion/disbiosis effect. Overall, we found
   limited evidence of negative effects, however, subtle changes to
   microbial communities did occur and could indicate changes to ecosystem
   function.},

Title = {Does persistent organic pollutant PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate)
   negative impacts on the aquatic invertebrate organism, Astacus

Abstract = {Highly persistent perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an industrial
   fluorinated organic chemical with significant bioaccumulation and
   biomagnification properties. The purpose of this study was to determine
   the toxic effects of sublethal PFOS on the aquatic invertebrate
   organism, narrow-clawed crayfish {[}Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz,
   1823]. The 96 h LC50 value was determined as 48.81 mg/L (34.19-63.68
   mg/L) with probit analysis. The sublethal experimental design was formed
   into four groups solvent control (DMSO, dimethyl sulphoxide),
   non-treated control group, and 1/10 (5 mg/L) and 1/100 (0.5 mg/L) of 96
   h LC50 of PFOS, and crayfish were exposed for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d under
   laboratory conditions. Total haemocyte counts (THCs) decreased, while
   the haemolymph total antioxidant status (TAS) values increased (p <
   0.05) after exposure to 0.5 and 5 mg/L PFOS for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d.
   Haemolymph total oxidative stress (TOS) levels significantly increased
   at 5 mg/L PFOS concentration (p < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities
   increased at both concentrations after 48 h and 7 d and then returned to
   control levels after 21 d; whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities did not change in muscle tissue
   (p > 0.05). GPX and CAT activities decreased, but SOD activity increased
   in hepatopancreas tissue (p < 0.05). SOD activity at both concentrations
   and CAT activity at 5 mg/L PFOS exposure decreased in gill tissue, while
   GPX activity increased at both concentrations of 48 h and 7 d and
   returned to control values on day 21 of exposure. Histopathological
   alterations were detected in hepatopancreas and gill tissues. Lamellar
   deformations, epithelial hyperplasia, and haemocytic infiltrations were
   observed in the gill tissues, whereas tubular degeneration, tubule loss,
   necrosis, and lesions in the hepatopancreas tissues were the major
   recorded alterations. As a result, the sublethal concentrations of PFOS
   have toxic effects on crayfish and histologically cause tissue damage.
   Our findings also support a better understanding of the early
   toxicological effects of PFOS in freshwater ecosystems. Also, it could
   be concluded that A. leptodactylus is a reliable model for examining
   histopathological alterations and differences in enzyme activities
   together with the haemolymph findings in toxicology studies amid aquatic
   species.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the changes in the sinking rates and
   physiochemical characteristics of the planktonic marine diatom,
   Thalassiosira pseudonana, caused by 72 h exposure to antifouling agent
   tributyltin (TBT) at 1.0 mu g L-1 (72-h 10\% effective concentration for
   growth rate, EC10), and 1.7 mu g L-1 (EC50). After 72 h of exposure, the
   sinking rates of T. pseudonana cells were changed from 0.13-0.08 m
   day(-1) in the control, 0.08-0.05 m day(-1) in the EC10 treatment, and
   0.04-0.006 m day(-1) in the EC50 treatment. The results revealed that
   the sinking rate of T. pseudonana decreased significantly compared with
   the control at 48 h in the EC10 treatment group and at 24, 48, and 72 h
   in the EC50 treatment group. The photosynthetic performance index on an
   absorption basis and the maximum quantum yields of photosystem II also
   decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the TBT treatments compared with
   the control. There was a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation
   between sinking rates and cellular protein contents (ng cell(-1)).
   Changes in the biochemical and physiochemical composition of the cells
   suggest that interference with photosynthetic processes by TBT may have
   reduced their specific gravity and thereby caused a decrease in the
   sinking rates of T. pseudonana. The results of this investigation
   suggest the importance of considering the effects of pollutants on the
   sinking behaviors of diatoms when evaluating the adverse effects of
   pollutants on marine primary production.},

Abstract = {The increasing exploitation and application of rare earth elements
   (REEs) may induce hazardous risks to freshwater aquatic organisms. Due
   to the lack of water quality criteria (WQC) and sufficient reliable
   toxicity data, little information is available on the ecological risk of
   REEs in surface water. In this study, lanthanum (La) toxicity data were
   collected from published toxicological studies, and the data quality was
   assessed using a toxicological data reliability assessment tool. To
   obtain more toxicity data, Daphnia magna, Cyprinus carpio, and Dania
   rerio embryos were selected as surrogate species, and an interspecies
   correlation estimation (ICE) model was used to predict the toxicity of
   La for untested species. The species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of
   La toxicity and WQC were investigated. Differences were observed in the
   hazardous concentrations for 5\% of species (HC5), but no statistically
   significant differences were noted in the SSD curves between the
   measured acute toxicity data and the predicted data. For the SSDs
   constructed from the measured toxicity data, the ICE-predicted toxicity
   data and all acute data supplemented with the ICE-predicted data, the
   acute WQC values of La were 88, 1022 and 256 mu g/L, respectively.
   According to the SSD and corresponding HC5 of chronic toxicity data, the
   chronic WQC was 14 mu g/L. The results provide a scientific reference
   for establishing WQC for freshwater aquatic organisms and ecological
   risk assessments of REEs.},

Abstract = {It is well established that there are nine species of bumblebees
   indigenous to Taiwan, but what has been unclear is how many of them are
   endemic. We examine minimum divergence in COI barcodes and morphology
   between Taiwanese samples and some of the nearest mainland populations
   and compare the results with more detailed global coalescent analyses
   available for some of these species. Our results support separate status
   for four of the species, including the two species inferred to be
   endemic from coalescent and morphological evidence. We support the other
   five species as conspecific with mainland species, four of which are
   also inferred to be conspecific from coalescent and morphological
   evidence. This conclusion requires the description of one new endemic
   species, Bombus taiwanensis sp. nov., which can be diagnosed by
   integrated evidence from its COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I)
   barcodes, its colour pattern and its morphology.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analyses of Phaseolinae (Leguminosae) reveal a new genus
   endemic to limestone outcrops in Seasonally Dry Forests of Bahia, Brazil},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Phaseolinae is one of the most diverse groups within the family
   Leguminosae, characterized by a style bearing a pollen brush and seeds
   with an epihilum. This subtribe has a complex taxonomic history and has
   undergone several changes over time. In the early 2000s, our research
   team found a phaseoloid liana growing in a limestone outcrop in western
   Bahia, Brazil. Its identity remained a mystery until recently, when we
   revisited the locality to study it in more detail and gathered material
   to generate nuclear ITS and plastid trnK/matK sequences. These sequences
   were included in a broadly sampled Phaseolinae matrix used to perform
   phylogenetic analyses and an ancestral character states reconstruction.
   Our results demonstrate that the enigmatic taxon represents a new
   lineage within subtribe Phaseolinae, sister to the genus Sigmoidotropis.
   This new lineage, along with Sigmoidotropis and Ancistrotropis, forms a
   clade here called the Sigmoid-keel clade, since all representatives
   present flowers with sigmoid keel petals. The new taxon is here
   described as Delgadoa bambuicola gen. \& sp. nov., a new genus and a new
   species of woody lianas known from only two localities in the state of
   Bahia. We also present an identification key to the genera of the
   Sigmoid-keel clade, descriptions, illustrations, a distribution map,
   taxonomic comments, and a conservation status assessment of the new
   genus.},

Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1251-1267},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The genus Sclerophylax (Atropina clade, Solanaceae) has 14 species
   recognized to date, all except two endemic to Argentina. To clarify its
   phylogenetic relationships, molecular sequence data from the trnL-trnF
   and the rpl32F-trnL intergenic spacer regions, the waxy gene and the ITS
   region were employed in maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference
   analyses. Divergence times were estimated for the combined dataset using
   secondary calibrations. Ancestral distribution areas were reconstructed
   by Bayesian binary analyses and seven morphological traits (one
   continuous, six discrete) were traced. Sclerophylax is monophyletic and
   its sister clade is Lycium + Nolana. Sclerophylax is divided into S.
   sect. Caducifructus (1 sp.) and the monophyletic sect. Sclerophylax (11
   spp.). Sclerophylax sect. Sclerophylax includes five well-supported
   clades that are also supported by morphological synapomorphies;
   circumscription of some species remains uncertain, probably as a result
   of rapid diversifications, but four lineages are recognized by a
   combination of morphological traits. The ancestor of Sclerophylax was an
   annual, procumbent/decumbent plant with rhomboidal leaves and sessile,
   persistent, 2-3-seeded fruits. The most variable traits were leaf shape
   and life form, while flower size was shown to be highly informative in
   diagnosing clades within Sclerophylax. The area of origin for
   Sclerophylax was the Prepuna biogeographical province, from which it has
   spread in recent geological times. A total of 12 species are recognized
   in Sclerophylax, with an updated synonymy, lectotypifications, and
   re-circumscriptions provided.},

Abstract = {Salvia is the most species-rich genus of the family Lamiaceae, currently
   numbering almost 1000 species. The diagnostic feature of the genus is
   the unique staminal lever mechanism that allows for specific pollination
   modes. We encountered an unusual Salvia form in the field, in SE
   Romania, which resembles S. austriaca but features a radically different
   lever mechanism. This form proved to be geographically widespread on the
   Pontic steppe, never occurring in sympatry with S. austriaca. We used an
   integrative approach, employing morphometric and phylogenomic (RADseq)
   analyses, to study this unusual form. The taxon's floral morphology
   proved to be consistently and subtly different from that of S.
   austriaca, and similarly, Bayesian species delimitation using
   genome-wide SNP data indicated species-level differences. Our results
   provide compelling evidence that points toward the discovery of an
   unrecognized species. This species has been overlooked for centuries,
   misidentified as S. austriaca, a closely related taxon. The new species
   differs from S. austriaca in key features of floral structure, habitat
   preference, and distribution. The potential range of this cryptic
   species, its pollination biology, ecology, and phylogeography are
   discussed.},

Title = {Molecular insights on the conflicting generic boundaries in the
   Carduncellus-Carthamus complex (Compositae)},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1268-1286},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Carthamus-Carduncellus complex is formed by approximately 50 taxa
   that are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean basin and
   western Asia. The generic delineation of this complex has always been
   controversial. Currently, there are three widely diverging taxonomical
   proposals, suggesting that the complex is formed by (1) a single genus,
   Carthamus; (2) two genera, Carduncellus and Carthamus; and (3) four
   genera, Carduncellus, Carthamus, Femeniasia, and Phonus. The generic
   classification has varied depending on the importance assigned to some
   morphological characters, i.e., the morphology/structure of pappus,
   achenes, and involucral bracts. All these generic changes have
   complicated the nomenclature of the complex, leading to species
   wandering between four different genera. To objectively assess the
   taxonomic delimitation of this complex, we carried out phylogenetic
   analyses using nuclear (external and internal transcribed spacers of
   rDNA) and plastid (ndhF, trnH, rpl32, trnT) data, as well as
   multispecies coalescent model analyses on near-complete sampling.
   Phylogenetic reconstructions resolved two monophyletic groups, Carthamus
   s.str. and Carduncellus s.l. Within the latter, some groups could be
   differentiated, such as the monophyletic genus Phonus and the
   monospecific Femeniasia. Our multispecies coalescent analyses strongly
   support a classification based on four genera in the complex
   Carthamus-Carduncellus. In contrast, classifications based on only one
   or two genera lack relevant support. However, the absence of
   synapomorphic morphological characters that define the Carduncellus
   lineage (Carduncellus, Phonus, Femeniasia), and the possible
   hybridization in the ancestral lineages detected by incongruences
   between plastid and nuclear markers make it difficult to define clear
   generic boundaries. We propose maintaining the hypothesis of four
   genera, which was the first classification supported by molecular
   evidence, pending a broader study (both molecular and morphological) to
   reach a more definitive delineation and avoid more unfounded generic
   changes.},

Abstract = {We gathered morphological data and genome-wide single nucleotide
   polymorphisms to infer the evolutionary relationships of Xerochrysum,
   Coronidium, and Helichrysum leucopsideum, and to test the
   circumscription of the genera. SVDquartets species tree topology
   resolved relationships between the genera and within subsets of the
   Xerochrysum data. Results corroborated previous conclusions that
   Coronidium is non-monophyletic as presently circumscribed and forms, in
   addition to the more distantly related Coronidium scorpioides group,
   three morphologically distinct clades. SVDquartets returned two clades
   in Xerochrysum, though species-level relationships were unclear.
   Bayesian coalescent analysis using SNAPP produced tree topologies for
   the three clades of Coronidium with most species-level relationships
   well resolved. The new genus Leucozoma is described for seven taxa
   previously included in Coronidium. A revised description of Coronidium
   and images of phyllary and fruit diagnostic morphological characters are

   The study demonstrated the immense value of digital images to basic

   seen in many digital images, even at high resolution. Several
   recommendations are made on how to maximise the utility of online

Abstract = {The genus Byrsopolis Burmeister, 1844 is revised and six Brazilian
   species are described as new: Byrsopolis angeloottatii sp. nov. (Tres
   Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul), B. schmidti sp. nov. (Barreiras, Bahia), B.
   burmeisteri sp. nov. (Cantareira, Sao Paulo), B. vazdemelloi sp. nov.
   (Barra do Bugres, Mato Grosso), B. ohausi sp. nov. (Grao Mogol, Minas
   Gerais) and B. blanchardi sp. nov. (Encruzilhada, Bahia). Lectotypes are
   designated for B. castanea Burmeister, 1844, B. laticollis Burmeister,
   1855, and B. cribricollis Ohaus, 1912. A new synonym is proposed:
   Byrsopolis aenescens Ohaus, 1926 = B. chassaini Soula, 2010 (syn. nov.).
   The genus is diagnosed, and all the species are illustrated and
   compared. The previously published key to genera of Areodina has been
   updated with the new diagnosis after the revision of Bysropolis.
   Additionally, an identification key to species of Byrsopolis is
   provided, with similar characters we made species groups to better
   identify them, as well as an up-to-date checklist of South American
   Areodina. A distribution map is also provided and the genus is reported
   from Paraguay for the first time.},

Abstract = {It is difficult to assess the population status of large terrestrial
   carnivores due to their low density. Recently adopted camera-trap
   techniques allow us to investigate many aspects of animal ecology and
   conservation and are widely used in wildlife population estimation. In
   this study, we applied the random encounter model (REM) to estimate the
   density of Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Shirakawa Village,
   Gifu Prefecture, Japan, from May to October 2018. We installed 24 sensor
   cameras in the study area. Movement speeds of seven global positioning
   system (GPS)-collared bears were tracked from 2008 to 2018. The
   population density of bears in Shirakawa Village was estimated to be
   0.55 bears/km(2). To apply the REM method to Asiatic black bears, we
   recommend (1) installing more than 30 or 40 sensor cameras and
   implementing the REM method in a period of 3 weeks before the late
   summer season (i.e. late August), after the completion of the
   hibernation period and when a closed population is easily maintained;
   and (2) correcting the distance moved by the target animal species when
   using GPS telemetry with a low fixed interval.},

Abstract = {Bathynomus jamesi Kou, Chen and Li, 2017 from Zhengbin fishing port in
   Keelung, Taiwan, was identified by the shape of the distolateral corner
   of the uropodal endopod, the shape of the clypeus, and the nucleotide
   sequences of the COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and 16S rRNA
   genes. Only two species of Bathynomus have previously been recorded from
   Taiwan, B. doederleini Ortmann, 1894 and B. decemspinosus Shih, 1972.
   Bathynomus kensleyi, previously known from the South China Sea as well
   as the south-east Swain Reefs, Coral Sea, was primarily differentiated
   by the elongate and upturned pleotelson spines, but that character is
   now shown to also occur in mature Bathynomus jamesi. Two specimens from
   the Gulf of Mexico (obtained from the Enoshima Aquarium in Japan) were
   compared to species of Bathynomus from the western North Atlantic.
   Sequence data showed that one of two samples was not B. giganteus
   Milne-Edwards, 1879, as had been assumed, and it did not match any other
   species of Bathynomus. That specimen was collected off the Yucatan
   Peninsula and is morphologically distinct from both B. giganteus (in the
   relative length of the antennal flagellum and the length:width ratio of
   the pleotelson) and B. maxeyorum Shipley, Brooks, and Bruce in Shipley
   et al., 2016 (the number of pleotelson spines is seven and the
   distolateral corner is produced on the uropodal exopod). Therefore, it
   is here described as B. yucatanensis sp. nov. Bathynomus is currently a
   very minor fisheries resource in Taiwan and Japan, but this find
   demonstrates the continuing importance of the fishing industry to marine
   biological exploration.},

Title = {Population dynamics and reproductive biology of the sandhopper
   Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis (Amphipoda: Talitridae) of a sandy beach

Abstract = {Biodiversity losses can alter ecosystem functioning. In this context,
   sandy beach macrobenthic species are highly vulnerable due to
   anthropogenic impacts and global changes. Evaluating and monitoring life
   history-based biological traits is a key goal for ecologists to
   investigate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning changes. Due to
   environmental conditions, however, life-history traits may vary among
   regions, even for similar taxa. The South Atlantic Coast is highly
   under-sampled compared with North Atlantic regions. Here, we investigate
   the life cycle, population dynamics, and reproductive biology of the key
   species Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis (Dana, 1853) from a Southwestern
   Atlantic Coast sandy beach. We followed field time-series data of
   multiple life-cycle-based biological traits. The body length of A.
   brasiliensis varied from 1.25 to 11.86 mm. Longevity was estimated at
   11.9 months for both males and females. Growth parameters were estimated
   as L-infinity = 12.9 mm, k = 2.3, t(0) = -0.10 for males and L-infinity
   = 12.3, k = 2, t(0) = -0.13 for females. The population showed
   continuous reproduction and multiple cohorts without seasonality. The
   mean sex ratio was female-biased (1.71: 1). Females bear a mean of 4-6
   eggs per marsupium, with egg volume between 0.0472 and 0.0501 mm(3).
   Female maturation was estimated at age 3.53 months, with L-50\% = 7.0
   mm. Biological trait evaluations of A. brasiliensis were similar to
   those found for amphipods in South America and differed from those of
   similar taxa found in North Atlantic. Monitoring life history
   based-biological traits is essential to make management decisions,
   especially in environmental protection areas with vulnerable species
   whose recovery is challenging, to maintain the biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {We describe a new species of ophiodermatid brittle star from the Eastern
   Pacific: Ophioderma occultum sp. nov. This species has been mistakenly
   recorded since 1899 as a colour phase of one of its congeners,
   Ophioderma panamense. However, the integrative use of morphological and
   molecular data, and comparison with type material of other Eastern
   Pacific Ophioderma, led to its differentiation as a novel species.
   Ophioderma occultum sp. nov. is characterised by having radial shields
   and adoral shields covered with granules, dorsal arm plates divided
   typically into two pieces, and a particular colour pattern: a dark grey
   to brown body, and arms with subtle lighter transverse bands and
   parallel longitudinal white bands over some median and distal segments.
   Molecular information based on the mitochondrial genes cytochrome
   oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S also supported the species' validity,
   coinciding with the morphological observations. In particular, the
   molecular marker 16S had not been used before for species delimitation
   in this genus and was proven here to be resolutive. In contrast to most
   species of Ophioderma from the area, Ophioderma occultum sp. nov. shows
   a restricted distribution to the northern Mexican Pacific (Gulf of
   California and islas Revillagigedo). This new species is the 10th
   Ophioderma described from the Eastern Pacific and the 34th worldwide.},

Title = {Integrative species delimitation of Selaginella labordei and closely
   related species: Uncovering the mysterious identity of S. jugorum and S.
   tibetica, and description of a new species},
Journal = {TAXON},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of Selaginella has been historically problematic due to the
   indistinguishable morphological characters within species complexes. The
   S. labordei group contains (S. subg. Stachygynandrum) 4-7 species,
   distributed from the Himalayas to eastern China. The taxonomy of this
   group was problematic due to few collections that were available to
   delimitate S. jugorum and S. tibetica, and large variation of the widely
   distributed S. labordei in different ecological conditions. Here, we
   re-evaluate the species delimitation of the S. labordei group using
   morphological, molecular and cytological data. A total of 55 individuals
   representing five species of the S. labordei group were investigated
   using two nuclear markers (26S rDNA, pgiC), one plastid marker (rbcL),
   as well as 43 plastid-coding sequences obtained from assembled plastid
   genomes. Five species are recognized based on the phylogenetic analysis
   of nuclear genes and plastid-coding sequences. The plastid genomes
   phylogeny showed a good resolution at lower taxonomic levels. All the
   individuals of the broadly defined S. labordei formed a monophyletic
   group in our analyses of different datasets. However, samples of S.
   chrysocaulos were strongly supported as non-monophyletic and were
   divided into two clades. One clade of S. chrysocaulos is described as a
   new species, Selaginella parachrysocaulos sp. nov., which is a cryptic
   species morphologically almost indistinguishable from S. chrysocaulos
   but with the microspores covered by a honeycomb-like network
   microstructure. The nuclear pgiC phylogeny and flow cytometry evidence
   indicate that some individuals of S. parachrysocaulos may be derived
   from polyploidization. Based on molecular and morphological evidence, S.
   sichuanica and S. daozhenensis are treated as synonymous to S. labordei,
   and S. hengduanshanicola to S. tibetica. Our results uncover the
   previously mysterious affinities of S. jugorum and S. tibetica, which
   are members of the S. labordei group.},

Title = {Same sensitivity with shorter exposure: behavior as an appropriate

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1254-1265},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The exposure of animals to toxicants may cause a depletion in the energy
   uptake, which compromises reproduction and growth. Although both
   parameters are ecologically relevant, they usually need long-term
   bioassays. This is a handicap for the availability of toxicological data
   for environmental risk assessment. Short-term bioassays conducted with
   environmental concentrations, and using relevant ecological parameters
   sensitive to short-term exposures, such as behavior, could be a good
   alternative. Therefore, to include this parameter in the risk assessment
   procedures, it is relevant the comparison of its sensitivity with that
   of growth and reproduction bioassays. The study aim was the assessment
   of differences between endpoints based on mortality, behaviour,
   reproduction, and growth for the toxicity of metals on aquatic animals.
   We used the ECOTOX database to gather data to construct chemical
   toxicity distribution (CTD) curves. The mean concentrations, the mean
   exposure time, and the ratio between the mean concentration and the
   exposure time were compared among endpoints. Our results showed that
   behavioral, growth, and reproduction bioassays presented similar
   sensitivity. The shortest exposure was found in behavioral and
   reproduction bioassays. In general, the amount of toxicant used per time
   was lower in growth and reproduction bioassays than in behavioral and
   mortality bioassays. We can conclude that, for metal toxicity,
   behavioral bioassays are less time-consuming than growth bioassays. As
   the sensitivity of behavior was similar to that of growth and
   reproduction, this endpoint could be a better alternative to longer
   bioassays.},

Title = {Comparative assessment of blood mercury in American alligators
   (Alligator mississippiensis) from Coastal North Carolina and Florida},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a widespread and harmful persistent pollutant of aquatic
   ecosystems. Except for the northern most populations of American
   alligators (Alligator Mississippiensis) found in North Carolina, the
   potential adverse health impacts of Hg on ecosystems and humans
   consuming alligator meat have been studied for over three decades. Now
   that alligators are being recreationally hunted and consumed across
   their range, it is especially important to monitor toxic contaminant
   levels to best understand possible adverse impacts of exposures on
   alligator populations and human health. In this study, we determined
   blood Hg concentrations in American alligators from an urbanized site in
   Wilmington, NC, a nearby site at Lake Waccamaw, NC, and a site on the St
   Johns River in Florida. Median blood total Hg (tHg) concentrations were
   particularly high at Lake Waccamaw (526 ng/g, range 152-946 ng/g),
   resulting in median muscle concentrations (0.48 mg/kg, range 0.13-0.88
   mg/kg) well above US EPA screening values for fish consumption. Median
   concentrations at the Wilmington site (69 ng/g, range 22-336 ng/g) were
   generally low, and Hg concentrations from the St Johns River site (143
   ng/g, range 54-244 ng/g) were comparable to those reported in previous
   studies. Analysis of relationships between tHg concentrations and a
   panel of blood chemistry biomarkers found only modest
   concentration-dependent impact on biomarkers of renal function. The
   results of this study reveal that local environmental factors greatly
   impact Hg bioaccumulation in alligators, findings that reaffirm local
   contaminant biomonitoring in alligator populations will be critical for
   affective management and determination of guidelines for safe
   consumption of harvested alligators.},

Abstract = {After discovering an unknown Euphorbiaceae with an unusual combination
   of morphological characters, molecular phylogenetic analyses were
   conducted to evaluate the phylogenetic position of the plant. Results of
   the analyses support the recognition of a resolved lineage sister to a
   clade comprising Caryodendron, which is sister to the Adenophaedra +
   Bernardia clade in subfamily Acalyphoideae. The phylogenetic position of
   this taxon is also supported by morphology, justifying the description
   of a new genus and species, Bahiana pyriformis, from the Caatinga
   seasonally dry forest, in Bahia State, Brazil. We compare morphological
   characters and discuss the phylogenetic relationships of these four
   genera, here treated as the Bernardia clade, as well as the possible
   relationship this clade has with genus Avellanita and tribe
   Plukenetieae.},

Abstract = {Because different tropical forest regions possess their own species
   diversity and communities, it is crucial to investigate the
   diversification history of their biota to understand how biodiversity
   was assembled. However, this requires reliable species concepts and
   robust, well-sampled phylogenies. Here we focus on the fully
   mycoheterotrophic genus Voyria (Gentianaceae) and its diversification
   history in the Neotropics. We use a likelihood-based approach to test
   species boundaries in Voyria with a population-level ITS dataset and we
   build an extensive multigene species-level phylogenetic framework for
   Voyria, which we use to infer the biogeographic evolution of the genus.
   We find strong support for the established morphology-based species
   delimitation in this genus but we also discover a new species, which we
   describe here. Ancestral area reconstructions place the origin of the
   Voyrieae in the Guianas. Frequent exchange with other forest regions is
   inferred to have started from the Oligocene and continued toward the
   present. In these exchanges, the Guianas appeared to have acted as the
   most important source, while other regions mainly functioned as sinks.
   We conclude that well-sampled phylogenies of fully mycoheterotrophic
   plants, which are ecologically restricted to rainforest habitats, can be
   instrumental to test hypotheses on rainforest biome evolution.},

Title = {Assessing the potential chronic, sublethal and lethal ecotoxicity of
   land-applying biosolids on Folsomia candida and Lumbricus terrestris},

Abstract = {The ecotoxicity of biosolids has been studied extensively using
   single-compound toxicity testing and `spiking' studies; however, little
   knowledge exists on the ecotoxicity of biosolids as they are
   land-applied in the Canadian context. The purpose of this study is to
   elucidate the chronic, sub-lethal (i.e., behavioural), and lethal
   impacts of land- applying biosolids on the environmentally relevant
   Folsomia candida (springtails) and Lumbricus terrestris (earthworms) and
   concomitantly ascertain whether the use of biosolids for nutrient
   amendment is a sustainable practice. This study is part of a larger
   multi-compartment programme which includes terrestrial plants and
   aquatic arthropods. After a review of existing government protocols and
   research, the current study suggests new environmentally relevant
   bioassays as to elucidate the true nature of the potential ecotoxicity
   of land-applying biosolids, within a laboratory context. Specifically,
   protocols were developed (e.g., shoebox bioassays for L. terrestris
   sub-lethal testing) or modified (e.g., using Evans' boxes (Evans 1947)
   for chronic and sub-lethal testing on L. terrestris). Subsequently, two
   biosolids were tested on springtails and earthworms using avoidance and
   reproductive bioassay endpoints, at application rates that represent
   standard (8 tonnes ha(-1)) and worst-case scenarios (22 tonnes ha(-1)).
   Results indicated no effect of biosolids at the environmentally relevant
   concentration; the worst-case scenario exhibited a positive
   significantly significant relationship (indicating preference for
   treatment conditions). We suggest that further assessment of the
   potential ecotoxicological impact of biosolids employ (i)
   environmentally relevant organisms, (ii) appropriate bioassays including
   the use of whole-organism endpoints, and (iii) multi-kingdom testing
   (e.g., Kingdom Plantae, Animalia) to comprehensively elucidate answers.
   Lastly, in situ (field assays) are strongly encouraged for future
   studies.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Nanoscale zero-valent iron particles (NZVI) are widely used in a variety
   of industries owing to their advantageous mechanical, physical, and
   chemical properties. These particles can be released into environmental
   media, including water, soil, and air, through several pathways. NZVI in
   the ecosystem can be taken up, excreted and distributed within
   organisms, which is harmful to plants, animals and humans. Plants play a
   significant role as producers in the ecological circle and can both
   positively and negatively affect the ecological behavior of NZVI.
   Therefore, understanding the relationship between plants and NZVI is
   likely to be of great value for the assessment of NZVI-associated risks
   and future research directions. In this review, we summarize the current
   knowledge on the uptake, distribution, and accumulation of NZVI in
   plants; the phytotoxicity triggered by NZVI exposure at the
   physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels; and the defense
   mechanism used by plants to defend against NZVI-induced insults. We
   further discuss the toxic effects of NZVI on soil animals and
   microorganisms as well as the risk posed by the presence of NZVI in the
   food chain.},

Title = {Differential response of copper nanoparticles and ionic copper on

Abstract = {The current study explored the role of ionic copper (CuCl2; 0.2 mu M and
   1 mu M) and synthesized copper nanoparticles (CuNPs; 0.2 mM and 1 mM) in
   the two paddy field cyanobacteria (Nostoc muscorum ATCC 27893 and
   Anabaena sp. PCC 7120) with respect to growth, photosynthetic pigments,
   photosynthetic efficiency (O-2 evolution and photochemistry of
   photosystem II; PS II), oxidative stress biomarkers, and antioxidant
   system. The low doses of ionic Cu (0.2 mu M) and CuNPs (0.2 mM) showed
   stimulating effects on growth, pigment content (chlorophyll a,
   phycobiliproteins, and carotenoids), oxygen evolution, and PS II
   photochemistry. High doses of Cu/CuNPs (1 mu M Cu and 1 mM CuNPs) caused
   a decline in the above-mentioned parameters. The values of fluorescence
   kinetics parameters: phi P-0, F-V/F-0, phi E-0, psi(0), and PIABS,
   except for F-0/F-V, associated with PS II photochemistry in tested
   cyanobacteria and subjected to the high doses of ionic Cu and CuNPs,
   were decreased, while energy fluxes, ABS/RC, TR0/RC, ET0/RC, and DI0/RC,
   were increased. Conversely, treatment with low doses of Cu and CuNPs
   caused a reverse trend, indicating normalization of PS II performance.
   Although the activity of enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase
   SOD; peroxidase POD; catalase CAT and glutathione-S-transferase GST) in
   both cyanobacteria exposed to high doses of ionic Cu and CuNPs was
   accelerated considerably, the oxidative stress remained high.
   Conversely, at low doses of ionic Cu and CuNPs, a significant
   enhancement in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants decreased the
   levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. Nevertheless, in Anabaena sp.,
   the levels of biomarkers were greater than those of the control. The
   current study concluded that compared to synthesized CuNPs, ionic Cu at
   elevated concentration had a damaging effect on growth, photosynthetic
   pigments, and PS II photochemistry via increased oxidative stress, and
   this effect was enhanced in Anabaena sp. than N. muscorum.},

Title = {Shorebird food energy shortfalls and the effectiveness of habitat
   incentive programs in record wet, dry, and warm years},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Programs that incentivize private landowners to create habitats that
   offset losses due to conversion and climate change are increasingly
   being used to bolster sensitive wildlife populations. In the Central
   Valley of California, shorebird habitat incentive programs pay
   landowners to create additional habitat during the non-breeding season
   by flooding their fields. However, it remains unclear how successful
   these programs have been in supporting baseline shorebird population
   needs or meeting established population goals, particularly in the face
   of changing environmental conditions. To address these questions, we
   used bioenergetics modeling to estimate shorebird food energy needs over
   four consecutive years that had the highest annual mean air temperatures
   ever recorded in California, and included years of extreme drought, as
   well as the second wettest winter on record. Our objectives were to (1)
   characterize annual variability in the timing and magnitude of shorebird
   food energy shortfalls, (2) estimate the contributions that incentive
   programs made to meeting these needs, and (3) develop recommendations
   for implementation of future habitat programs to advance shorebird
   conservation in the region. Overall, we found a high level of
   consistency in the timing and magnitude of habitat shortfalls,
   especially in fall, despite large differences in annual rainfall, a
   result that was unexpected, but that emphasizes how highly managed the
   hydrological system is in the Central Valley. We also found that the
   magnitude of both fall and spring energy shortfalls increased, relative
   to recent (2007-2014) estimates, perhaps due to aberrantly warm
   conditions. Incentive programs implemented to provide supplemental
   habitat were somewhat effective in reducing shortfalls for the assumed
   baseline population, but there were consistent unmet habitat needs when
   there were not enough shallow open water foraging areas available.
   Strategies to offset these remaining food energy deficits include
   scaling up habitat investments, adjusting the timing of habitat programs
   to better match the migration patterns of the birds, and adapting
   programs to new geographies. To the extent that there is variability in
   annual habitat need we recommend implementing a dynamic conservation
   approach. This involves scaling the amount of additional habitat created
   to match the shifting needs of the birds to maximize return on
   investment.},

Abstract = {With 178 species, palm subtribe Dypsidinae is one of the largest plant
   radiations on Madagascar. A well-resolved species-level phylogeny is
   required not only to unpick the drivers of this spectacular radiation,
   but also to define natural and useful generic limits in this
   taxonomically difficult group. The only recent taxonomic revision of
   Dypsidinae recognised just four genera, including the large genus Dypsis
   (currently with 172 species), which was considered impossible to divide
   further based on morphology alone. Here we describe the first
   comprehensively sampled species-level phylogeny of Dypsidinae, including
   157 described species (88\% of the subtribe) as well as 10 samples of
   uncertain taxonomic identity (potentially new to science). Our tree is
   based on target sequence capture data for 161 nuclear DNA loci. The
   phylogenetic relationships recovered render Dypsis s.l. paraphyletic,
   requiring the resurrection of two previously synonymised genera. In
   total, we recognise six genera in Dypsidinae (Dypsis, Chrysalidocarpus,
   Marojejya, Vonitra, Lemurophoenix, Masoala), all of which are
   monophyletic and consistent with morphology.},

Title = {Comprehensive study of the effects of strobilurin-based fungicide
   formulations on Enchytraeus albidus},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 3},
Abstract = {Excessive application of fungicides in crop fields can cause adverse
   effects on soil organisms and consequently affect soil properties.
   Existing knowledge on the effects of strobilurin fungicides has been
   primarily based on toxicity tests with active ingredients, while the
   effects of fungicide formulations remain unclear. Therefore, this work
   aims to provide new data on the effects of three commercial formulations
   of strobilurin fungicides on the soil organism Enchytraeus albidus. The
   tested fungicide formulations were Retengo (R) (pyraclostrobin-PYR),
   Zato WG 50 (R) (trifloxystrobin-TRI) and Stroby WG (R)
   (kresoxim-methyl-KM). In laboratory experiments, multiple endpoints were
   considered at different time points. The results showed that PYR had the
   greatest impact on survival and reproduction (LC50 = 7.57
   mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1), EC50 = 0.98 mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1)), followed by TRI
   (LC50 = 72.98 mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1), EC50 = 16.93 mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1))
   and KM (LC50 = 73.12 mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1), EC50 \& GE; 30
   mg(a.i.)kg(soil)(-1)). After 7 days of exposure, MXR activity was
   inhibited at the highest concentration of all fungicides tested (6
   mg(PYR)kg(soil)(-1), 15 mg(TRI)kg(soil)(-1) and 30 mg(KM)kg(soil)(-1)).
   Furthermore, oxidative stress (induction of SOD, CAT and GST) and lipid
   peroxidation (increase in MDA) were also observed. In addition, there
   was a decrease in total available energy after exposure to PYR and KM.
   Exposure to fungicides resulted in a shift in the proportions of
   carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins affecting the amount of available
   energy. In addition to the initial findings on the effects of
   strobilurin formulations on enchytraeids, the observed results suggest
   that multiple and long-term exposure to strobilurin formulations in the
   field could have negative consequences on enchytraeid populations.},

Title = {Pesticide effects on the abundance of springtails and mites in field

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},

Abstract = {The use of pesticides to protect crops often affects non-target
   organisms vital to ecosystem functioning. A functional soil mesofauna is
   important for decomposition and nutrient cycling processes in
   agricultural soils, which generally have low biodiversity. To assess
   pesticide effects on natural soil communities we enclosed intact soil
   cores in situ in an agricultural field in 5 cm wide mesocosms. We used
   two types of mesh lids on the mesocosms, allowing or preventing
   migration of mesofauna. The mesocosms were exposed to the insecticide
   imidacloprid (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg dry soil) and left in the field
   for 20 days. Overall, regardless of lid type, mesocosm enclosure did not
   affect springtail or mite abundances during the experiment when compared
   with undisturbed soil. Imidacloprid exposure reduced the abundance of
   both surface- and soil-living springtails in a concentration-dependent
   manner, by 65-90\% at the two highest concentrations, and 21-23\% at 0.1
   mg/kg, a concentration found in some agricultural soils after pesticide
   application. Surface-living springtails were more affected by
   imidacloprid exposure than soil-living ones. In contrast, neither
   predatory nor saprotrophic mites showed imidacloprid-dependent changes
   in abundance, concurring with previous findings indicating that mites
   are generally less sensitive to neonicotinoids than other soil
   organisms. The possibility to migrate did not affect the springtail or
   mite abundance responses to imidacloprid. We show that under realistic
   exposure concentrations in the field, soil arthropod community
   composition and abundance can be substantially altered in an
   organism-dependent manner, thus affecting the soil community diversity.},

Abstract = {Remedial guidelines for petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) in soil aid in the
   mitigation of risks to human health and the environmental. However, some
   remediation guidelines may overestimate the potential for adverse
   effects to native plant species, contributing to unnecessary remedial
   efforts in attempts to meet the guidelines. At sites where
   PHC-contaminated soils undergo weathering, some PHCs may persist but
   with decreased bioavailability to organisms. In this study, the toxicity
   of both coarse and fine-grained subarctic soils, contaminated with
   weathered PHCs were assessed using five native plant species (Picea
   mariana, Achillea millefolium, Alnus viridis, Elymus trachycaulus and
   Salix bebbiana). Soil toxicity tests were conducted in a growth chamber
   with parameters set to simulate the site's subarctic climate conditions.
   Reference toxicant tests using boric acid were conducted to provide
   confidence in the interpretation of the results for the PHC-contaminated
   soils, and also provide new information on the sensitivities of the four
   boreal species to boric acid. All plants exhibited reduced growth and
   germination rates as boric acid concentrations increased. Despite
   exceeding the Canada-wide standard guidelines for Fraction 3 PHCs,
   field-collected contaminated soils had no significant negative impacts
   on the growth (i.e., length, dry weight and emergence) of any of the
   plant species tested.},

   Ceriodaphnia silvestrii and Daphnia similis, using model ecosystems
   (mesocosms). To this end, mesocosms were filled with natural soil and
   subjected to the following treatments: Control (Milli-Q water), Kraft
   (10.8 g abamectin ha(-1)), Score (20 g difenoconazole ha(-1)), and Kraft
   + Score (10.8 g abamectin ha(-1) + 20 g difenoconazole ha(-1)). The
   experiment lasted 18 days, and the applications were made on days 1, 8,
   and 15; the occurrence of rainfall was simulated on days 1, 8, and 15
   after applications and only rainfall simulation on days 4, 11, and 18.
   The experiment was conducted under two different temperatures: 23
   degrees C and 33 degrees C. At 23 degrees C, single Kraft treatment and
   in combination with Score showed high toxicity to both cladocerans. At
   33 degrees C, elutriate of the Kraft (R) and mixture treatments were
   highly toxic to D. similis but not to C. silvestrii. The results
   indicate that while Kraft had higher toxicity than Score to both
   cladocerans, this toxicity was counteracted at 33 degrees C only for the
   exotic species, D. similis. The results portray the complexity of
   pesticide toxicity when considering realistic experimental settings
   including different organisms and temperature treatments.},

Title = {Sarcosaprophagous flesh flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) are less diverse

   insights about environmental heterogeneity},

Abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity can affect the diversity of arthropods,
   resulting in a positive relationship in most studies, including of some
   Diptera groups. We investigated the diversity patterns of Sarcophagidae
   fauna in two phytophysiognomies with inferences about the environmental
   heterogeneity. In our hypothesis, the flesh flies have higher diversity
   in more heterogeneous environments than in the more homogeneous one. The
   study was performed in Sao Luis Island, state of Maranhao, Northeast
   Brazil. In total, we found 1482 specimens, of which 402 were males,
   representing six genera and 26 species. Peckia (Euboettcheria) collusor
   (Curran and Walley) was the most abundant species. The mangrove
   community was more diverse than the forest community. Species
   replacement contributes more significantly to the difference in species
   composition between environments than richness difference does, with
   higher values of dissimilarity of taxonomic diversity. Our data show
   that sarcosaprophagous flesh flies have a preference for open and sunny
   environments, implying greater diversity in mangroves rather than in
   forested areas. The negative relationship between species
   richness/abundance and vegetation cover in our study corroborates flesh
   flies' preference for open environments. Our data show a tendency to
   refute the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis. The mangrove fauna,
   especially Diptera communities, has received less attention.
   Nevertheless, mangrove has the potential to shelter high species
   richness, highlighting the need for further studies and conservation
   plans for these areas.},

Title = {Distribution characteristics of microplastics in the soil of mangrove
   restoration wetland and the effects of microplastics on soil
   characteristics},

Abstract = {The dense vegetation in the wetland could effectively retain
   microplastic particles, and the distribution of microplastics varied
   significantly under different planting densities. In addition,
   microplastics in the soil environment can affect soil properties to a
   certain extent, which in turn can affect soil functions and
   biodiversity. In this study, we investigated the distribution of soil
   microplastics in a mangrove restoration wetland under different planting
   densities and their effects on wetland soil properties. The results
   indicated that the average abundance of soil microplastics was 2177.5
   n/500 g, of which 70.9\% exhibited a diameter ranging from 0.038-0.05
   mm, while the remaining soil microplastics accounted for less than 20\%
   of all microplastics, indicating that smaller-diameter microplastics
   were more likely to accumulate in wetland soil. The microplastic
   abundance could be ranked based on the planting density as follows: 0.5
   x 0.5 m > 1.0 x 0.5 m > 1.0 x 1.0 m > control area. Raman spectroscopy
   revealed that the predominant microplastic categories in this region
   included polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 52\%), polyethylene (PE, 24\%)
   and polypropylene (PP, 15\%). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
   revealed fractures and tears on the surface of microplastics. EDS energy
   spectra indicated a large amount of metal elements on the surface of
   microplastics. Due to the adsorptive features of PET, this substance
   could influence the soil particle size distribution and thus the soil
   structure. All physicochemical factors, except for the soil pH, were
   significantly affected by PET. In addition, the CV analysis results
   indicated that soils in vegetated areas are more susceptible to PET than
   are soils in bare ground areas, leading to greater variation in their
   properties.},

   (50\%) were all above 50\%. Compared with river water (7.9-114.26 ng/L,
   medium: 27.7 ng/L), concentrations of the most antibiotics in seawater
   (9.5-32.0 ng/L, medium: 13.3 ng/L) were lower; seawater concentrations
   were similar to those reported from other coastal cities, such as
   Guangzhou and Zhuhai in China, which implied that the source of marine
   antibiotic pollution may be the nearby rivers, and the vastness of the
   ocean causes environmental dilution of antibiotics. According to the
   ratio of the measured environmental concentration (MEC) to the predicted
   no-effect concentration (PNEC), ofloxacin (OFX) (average risk quotient:
   1.94E-01) and ciprofloxacin (CFX) (average risk quotient: 3.53E-01)
   posed medium to high ecological risk in most places, whereas other
   antibiotics posed lower risk. In Yuen Long, where there were many
   livestock farms nearby, the detected concentration of antibiotics was
   higher, indicating that livestock wastewater may be the major reason for
   the increase in antibiotic levels in this area. In general, the detected
   concentration of antibiotics in Hong Kong was lower than that in the
   United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and coastal areas of China,
   but the long-term existence of low concentrations of antibiotics also
   poses great risks. According to the risk assessment, Hong Kong should
   pay more attention to the use of FQs (e.g., OFX and CFX) in the future.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of major ions in coal mine discharge waters and
   unconventional hydrocarbon produced waters derived from coal bed methane
   (CBM) production, are potentially harmful to freshwater ecosystems.
   Bicarbonate is a major constituent of produced waters from CBM and coal
   mining. However, little is known about the relative toxicity of
   differing ionic proportions, especially bicarbonate, found in these CBM
   waters. As all freshwater invertebrates tested are more acutely
   sensitive to sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) than sodium chloride (NaCl) or
   synthetic sea water, we tested the hypotheses that toxicity of CBM
   waters are driven by bicarbonate concentration, and waters containing a
   higher proportion of bicarbonate are more toxic to freshwater
   invertebrates than those with less bicarbonate. We compared the acute
   (96 h) lethal toxicity to six freshwater invertebrate species of NaHCO3
   and two synthetic CBM waters, with ionic proportions representative of
   water from CBM wells across New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld),
   in Australia. The ranking of LC50 values expressed as total salinity was
   consistent with the hypotheses. However, when toxicity was expressed as
   bicarbonate concentration, the hypothesis that the toxicity of coal bed
   waters would be explained by bicarbonate concentration was not well
   supported, and other ionic components were either ameliorating or
   exacerbating the NaHCO3 toxicity. Our findings showed NaHCO3 was more
   toxic than NaCl and that the NaHCO3 proportion of synthetic CBM waters
   drives toxicity, however other ions are altering the toxicity of
   bicarbonate.},

Abstract = {The Western Ghats, vernacularly known as the `Sahyadri' mountain ranges,
   constitutes a 1600 km chain of hills spread across 189,611 km(2) and
   reaching an average elevation of 900-1500 m above mean sea level along
   the south-western coast of India. Falling well within Meyer's
   classification as one of the hottest hotspots, the Western Ghats is home
   to thousands of endemic flora and associated fauna. Here we validate the
   biodiversity hotspot status of the Ghats with examples of chalcidid
   wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), describing with illustrations a new
   species of Phasgonophora Westwood (P. rubra Binoy, sp. nov.) from
   southern Western Ghats. The regional species of Phasgonophora are
   reviewed along with a phylogenetic analysis based on morphology,
   exploring the possible congruence of morphological data for the newly
   collected species. Additionally, diagnoses and illustrations are
   presented for an unnamed species of Megachalcis Cameron based on a male
   specimen from the southern Western Ghats. Megachalcis kannapuramensis
   Sureshan and Girish Kumar is redescribed with illustrations based on a
   female collected from Aaralam Wildlife Sanctuary, also within the
   Western Ghats. Distribution maps of Indian species of Phasgonophora
   Westwood and world species of Megachalcis Cameron are also provided.},

Title = {The Wettstein tesseract: A tool for conceptualising species-rank

Abstract = {Genealogy-based species-delimitation approaches resting upon multilocus
   sequence data aim at arranging organisms into species taxa (the
   ``grouping{''} step in a classification procedure), but provide no
   criteria for the subsequent decision of whether these taxa should be
   acknowledged as species in the Linnaean classification system (the
   ``ranking{''} step). By integration of genealogical, morphological,
   ecological, and geographical patterns as proposed by von Wettstein
   (1898), species-rank decisions can be conceptualised in a reproducible
   manner and comprehensibly depicted in a four-dimensional hypercube (the
   herewith introduced ``Wettstein tesseract{''}). Additionally, the
   Wettstein tesseract provides a tool for illustrating and teaching
   components and properties of speciation pathways realised in nature.},

Abstract = {Recent proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for
   algae, fungi, and plants (the Code) to allow the rejection of names that
   honour historical individuals who committed crimes against humanity has
   sparked a counter-reaction that we believe misrepresents both the intent
   and mechanism of the proposals. In this short paper we point out errors
   and fallacious reasoning in this counter-reaction, and again make the
   case that an open, balanced, modest, structured, and defensible way to
   deal with this issue is now, through sensible and reasonable proposals
   to amend the Code, within the grasp of the taxonomic and nomenclatural
   community. Adopting these proposals would represent a small but
   significant contribution to helping address some egregious historical
   wrongs.},

Title = {Phylogeny and historical biogeography of the Panama-hat family
   (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanales)},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {963-980},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The monocot family Cyclanthaceae (Pandanales) comprises ca. 230 known
   species in 12 genera restricted to the Neotropics. The family has not
   been the subject of a species-level molecular phylogenetic study to
   date, with multiple evolutionary and biogeographic questions about
   Cyclanthaceae still unanswered. In this study, we address genus- and
   species-level relationships and the historical biogeography of
   Cyclanthaceae based on a broadly sampled molecular phylogeny. Two
   low-copy nuclear genes (phyC, rpb2) and five plastid regions (atpB-rbcL,
   psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF, trnQ-rps16, matK) representing 99 species and all
   genera of Cyclanthaceae were sampled, spanning the taxonomic and
   biogeographic diversity of the family. Our results strongly support the
   monophyly of all Cyclanthaceae genera and confirm previously proposed
   hypotheses of intergeneric relationships. Infrageneric relationships are
   generally well supported, with some exceptions in the genus Asplundia
   that may require a broader sampling to clarify. The early
   diversification of Cyclanthaceae is estimated to date back to the
   Paleocene-Eocene period in South America, where the family possibly
   arrived through a boreotropical route. The origin of most genera is
   inferred from the Paleocene of the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena region,
   possibly indicating an earlier origin for this biodiversity hotspot. The
   current distribution of Cyclanthaceae is likely to have been strongly
   influenced by major biogeographical events in the Neotropics, such as
   the uplift of the Andes and the opening of the South America dry
   diagonal. Further studies that include a broader sample of the large
   Asplundia-Dicranopygium clade and Sphaeradenia group are required.},

Abstract = {Three new species of free-living nematodes were discovered in the
   central basin of the South China Sea and are described here as Elzalia
   longicaudata sp. nov., Minolaimus distalamphidus sp. nov. and
   Setoplectus minor sp. nov. Elzalia longicaudata sp. nov. is
   characterised by a longer tail and longer buccal cavity relative to
   other members of the genus; presence of a circle of four cervical setae;
   spicules slender and long, which curve as the body bends; and simple
   gubernaculum with only one section of dorsal apophysis. Minolaimus
   distalamphidus sp. nov. can be distinguished from congeners by the male
   having lateral differentiation with six longitudinal rows of large dots;
   multispiral amphideal fovea with 8.5 turns; pharynx cylindrical without
   bulb; spicules slightly arcuate; gubernaculum rod-like without
   apophysis; about 17 sucker-shaped precloacal supplements; and tail
   conical with long filiform posterior portion. Setoplectus minor sp. nov.
   differs from its congeners by small body size, anterior third of
   pharyngeal region attenuated; cephalic setae 2 mu m long; amphidial
   aperture circular or oval; tail elongated conical; male with a single
   papilliform precloacal supplement. Updated identification keys for
   species of the three genera are also given.},

Title = {Target-enrichment sequencing reveals for the first time a well-resolved
   phylogeny of the core Bromelioideae (family Bromeliaceae)},
Journal = {TAXON},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {A phylogenomic analysis of the so far phylogenetically unresolved
   subfamily Bromelioideae (Bromeliaceae) was performed to infer species
   relationships as the basis for future taxonomic treatment, stabilization
   of generic concept, and further analyses of evolution and biogeography
   of the subfamily. A target-enrichment approach was chosen, using the
   Angiosperms353 v.4 kit RNA-baits and including 86 Bromelioideae species
   representing previously identified major evolutionary lineages.
   Phylogenetic analyses were based on 125 target nuclear loci, assembled
   off-target plastome as well as mitogenome reads. A Bromelioideae
   phylogeny with a mostly well-resolved backbone is provided based on
   nuclear (194 kbp), plastome (109 kbp), and mitogenome data (34 kbp). For
   the nuclear markers, a coalescent-based analysis of single-locus gene
   trees was performed as well as a supermatrix analysis of concatenated
   gene alignments. Nuclear and plastome datasets provide well-resolved
   trees, which showed only minor topological incongruences. The mitogenome
   tree is not sufficiently resolved. A total of 26 well-supported clades
   were identified. The genera Aechmea, Canistrum, Hohenbergia, Neoregelia,
   and Quesnelia were revealed polyphyletic. In core Bromelioideae,
   Acanthostachys is sister to the remainder. Among the 26 recognized
   clades, 12 correspond with currently employed taxonomic concepts. Hence,
   the presented phylogenetic framework will serve as an important basis
   for future taxonomic revisions as well as to better understand the
   evolutionary drivers and processes in this exciting subfamily.},

Abstract = {Plants of the Selaginella tamariscina group are common rosette-forming
   species showing great morphological variability across their
   distribution range. Integrating chloroplast genome data and
   morphological evidence, we studied the species delimitation within this
   group. We newly sequenced the complete chloroplast genomes of 53
   individuals representing almost the entire geographical distribution of
   this group. Our phylogenetic analyses yielded a consistent topology
   dividing the S. tamariscina group into five major clades, which is
   further supported by principal component analysis of 18 morphological
   characters taken from 80 herbarium specimens. Based on the results of
   molecular analyses and morphological studies combined with the
   distribution information, we finally recognize five species in the S.
   tamariscina group, including two new species (S. algida sp. nov., S.
   graniticola sp. nov.), and one new subspecies (S. pulvinata subsp.
   qinbashanica subsp. nov.).},

Title = {Dipterocarps used India as a raft from Gondwana to Eurasia},
Journal = {TAXON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1214-1229},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that most Asian tropical lineages have
   originated in Gondwana with the Indian subcontinent playing a crucial
   role in the dispersal of ancestral Gondwanan taxa. The disjunct
   distribution of dipterocarps and the fossil record in India support the
   Gondwana hypothesis. This is the first comprehensive study addressing
   the evolutionary and biogeographic relationships of dipterocarps in the
   Indian subcontinent to test the Gondwana hypothesis. A Bayesian
   phylogenetic tree of the Dipterocarpaceae family including the Indian
   counterparts corroborates the monophyly of subfamilies/tribes and shows
   new biogeographic affinities. Molecular dating reveals the Cretaceous
   origin of Dipterocarpaceae. Diversification of major lineages occurred
   during the Pliocene-Miocene epochs. The DEC analysis ascertains the
   Gondwanan origin and dispersal route from the Madagascar
   (Africa)-India-Sri Lanka-Seychelles block to Eurasia. The biogeographic
   analysis suggests early vicariance followed by an out-of-India dispersal
   of Dipterocarpaceae. Three dispersal events from India to the remainder
   of Asia at 47.6 Ma, 42.53 Ma and 37.6 Ma are identified. There probably
   was a biotic interchange between India and mainland Asia via Sumatra
   following the collision of the Indian plate with Eurasia. Molecular
   dating and dispersal events coincide with the geological events. During
   the Miocene, uplift of the Himalayan-Tibetian plateau induced climatic
   variation, which seems to have resulted in the extinction of major
   Indian dipterocarp lineages and reverse dispersal into India.
   Hopea-Shorea, one of the earliest diverged lineages, originated in
   Southeast Asia. The establishment of Southeast Asian monsoon climate may
   have favoured allopatric speciation and diversification of Southeast
   Asian lineages also resulting in further dispersal into India.},

Title = {An exploratory study of bumble bee (Bombus) phenologies and plant

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {9-12},

Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of wild and
   cultivated plants. Evidence suggests their populations are declining
   globally, threatening the availability of the free pollination services
   they provide. Conservation of bumble bees in the US is limited due to a
   paucity of research on the natural history of most species. The purpose
   of this exploratory study was to establish baseline data about the
   Bombus species present in agricultural landscapes in central Georgia,
   their phenologies and the plants with which they interact. Bombus were
   captured and identified to species and caste during 10-minute surveys at
   three sites in 2010 and two sites in 2011. Average weekly captures
   differed between years, and some phenologies varied from those in
   published literature. Results suggest that Bombus range maps might need
   to be updated and that high temperatures might negatively impact
   foraging. Bumble bees were captured on a variety of plant genera, but
   were not always carrying pollen, suggesting that some pollens could be
   more desirable than others. This study is the first record in the
   peer-reviewed literature of overall B. bimaculatus phenology in the USA.
   Long-term Bombus research across the United States is urgently needed
   for conservation of this ecologically critical genus.},

Title = {Evaluating thermal performance of closely related taxa: Support for
   hotter is not better, but for unexpected reasons},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Temperature drives performance and therefore adaptation; to interpret
   and understand these, thermal performance curves (TPC) are used, often
   through meta-analyses, revealing trends across divergent taxa. Four
   discrete hypotheses-thermodynamic-constraint; biochemical-adaptation
   (hotter is not better); specialist-generalist; thermal-trade-off-have
   arisen to explain cross-phyletic trends. In contrast, detailed
   comparisons of closely related taxa are rare, yet trends arising from
   these should reveal mechanisms of adaptation, as taxa diverge. Here, we
   combine experimental work with TPC theory to assess if the current
   hypotheses apply equally to closely related taxa. We established TPC for
   six species (and two strains of one species) of the animal model
   Tetrahymena (Ciliophora)-characterized by SSU rDNA/COX1 sequences-by
   examining specific growth rate (r), size (V), production (P = rV), and
   metabolic rate (rV(-0.25)) across 15-20 temperatures. Using parameters
   derived from the mechanistic ``Sharpe and DeMichele{''} function, we
   established a framework to test which hypothesis best represented the
   data. We conclude that superficially the ``hotter is not better{''}
   hypothesis is best but argue that the mechanistic theory underlying it
   cannot apply at the genus level: trends are likely to arise from little
   rather than substantial adaptation. Our further analysis suggests: (1)
   upward shift in the maximum-functioning temperature (T-max) is more
   constrained than the optimal temperature (T-opt), leading to a decreased
   safety margin (T-opt-T-max) and suggesting that species initially
   succeed in warmer environments through an increase in T-opt, followed by
   increasing T-max; and (2) thermal performance traits are correlated with
   phylogeny for closely related species, suggesting that species gradually
   adapt to new thermal environments.},

Title = {Temporal dynamics of range expander and congeneric native plant
   responses during and after extreme drought events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is causing range shifts of many species to higher
   latitudes and altitudes and increasing their exposure to extreme weather
   events. It has been shown that range-shifting plant species may perform
   differently in new soil than related natives; however, little is known
   about how extreme weather events affect range-expanding plants compared
   to related natives. In this study we used outdoor mesocosms to study how
   range-expanding plant species responded to extreme drought in live soil
   from a habitat in a new range with and without live soil from a habitat
   in the original range (Hungary). During summer drought, the shoot
   biomass of the range-expanding plant community declined. In spite of
   this, in the mixed community, range expanders produced more shoot
   biomass than congeneric natives. In mesocosms with a history of range
   expanders in the previous year, native plants produced less biomass.
   Plant legacy or soil origin effects did not change the response of
   natives or range expanders to summer drought. During rewetting, range
   expanders had less biomass than congeneric natives but higher drought
   resilience (survival) in soils from the new range where in the previous
   year native plant species had grown. The biomass patterns of the mixed
   plant communities were dominated by Centaurea spp.; however, not all
   plant species within the groups of natives and of range expanders showed
   the general pattern. Drought reduced the litter decomposition, microbial
   biomass, and abundances of bacterivorous, fungivorous, and carnivorous
   nematodes. Their abundances recovered during rewetting. There was less
   microbial and fungal biomass, and there were fewer fungivorous nematodes
   in soils from the original range where range expanders had grown in the
   previous year. We concluded that in mixed plant communities of range
   expanders and congeneric natives, range expanders performed better,
   under both ambient and drought conditions, than congeneric natives.
   However, when considering the responses of individual species, we
   observed variations among pairs of congenerics, so that under the
   present mixed-community conditions there was no uniformity in responses
   to drought of range expanders versus congeneric natives. Range-expanding
   plant species reduced soil fungal biomass and the numbers of soil
   fungivorous nematodes, suggesting that the effects of range-expanding
   plant species can trickle up in the soil food web.},

Abstract = {The Apocynaceae subfamilies Secamonoideae and Asclepiadoideae have
   undergone several transitions during their evolution with regard to
   growth form and degree of woodiness. In this study, we present a wood
   anatomical overview of both subfamilies that complements previous work
   on the remaining Apocynaceae. Detailed microscopic wood descriptions
   using light and scanning electron microscopy were performed on 60
   species that cover most Secamonoideae genera and all major woody
   Asclepiadoideae lineages. Our observations are in line with subfamilial
   and (sometimes sub)tribal delimitations. Furthermore, we present for the
   first time an overview of the estimated number of shifts from
   herbaceousness to (phylogenetically) derived woodiness in
   Asclepiadoideae, along with a derived woody species list with
   distribution and habitat information. In total, at least 168 derived
   woody species resulting from at least 28 independent woodiness
   transitions were found, with drought possibly being one of the main
   drivers of most of these transitions.},

Title = {Temporal shifts in avian phenology across the circannual cycle in a
   rapidly changing climate: A global meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The alteration of the timing of biological events is one of the best
   documented effects of climate change, with overwhelming evidence across
   taxa. Many studies have investigated the phenology of consumers,
   especially birds. However, most of these studies have focused on
   specific phenophases, whereas a global analysis of avian phenological
   trends during recent climate change across different phases of the
   circannual cycle is still lacking. Here, we performed a comprehensive
   meta-analytic synthesis of the phenological responses (temporal shifts
   in days year -1 ) of birds across different phenophases (prebreeding
   migration, breeding, and postbreeding migration) by summarizing more
   than 5500 time series from 684 species from five continents during
   1811-2018. Our results confirm that avian taxa have advanced prebreeding
   migration and breeding by similar to 2-3 days per decade, whereas no
   significant temporal changes in the timing of postbreeding migration
   were documented. Advancement in the timing of prebreeding migration and
   breeding strongly depended on migratory behavior, with the advance being
   the weakest for long-distance migrants and the strongest for resident
   species. Diet generalists and primary consumers tended to advance
   prebreeding migration timing more than species with different dietary
   specializations. Increasing body size resulted in a larger advancement
   in the onset (but not in the mean date) of prebreeding migration and
   breeding, whereas phenological advances were larger in the northern than
   in the southern hemisphere. Our synthesis, covering most of the world,
   highlighted previously unappreciated patterns in avian phenological
   shifts over time, suggesting that specific life-history or ecological
   traits may drive different responses to climate change.},

Title = {From microbes to mammals: Pond biodiversity homogenization across
   different land-use types in an agricultural landscape},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Local biodiversity patterns are expected to strongly reflect variation
   in topography, land use, dispersal boundaries, nutrient supplies,
   contaminant spread, management practices, and other anthropogenic
   influences. Contrary to this expectation, studies focusing on specific
   taxa revealed a biodiversity homogenization effect in areas subjected to
   long-term intensive industrial agriculture. We investigated whether land
   use affects biodiversity levels and community composition (alpha- and
   beta-diversity) in 67 kettle holes (KH) representing small aquatic
   islands embedded in the patchwork matrix of a largely agricultural
   landscape comprising grassland, forest, and arable fields. These KH,
   similar to millions of standing water bodies of glacial origin, spread
   across northern Europe, Asia, and North America, are physico-chemically
   diverse and differ in the degree of coupling with their surroundings. We
   assessed aquatic and sediment biodiversity patterns of eukaryotes,
   Bacteria, and Archaea in relation to environmental features of the KH,
   using deep-amplicon-sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA). First, we
   asked whether deep sequencing of eDNA provides a representative picture
   of KH aquatic biodiversity across the Bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes.
   Second, we investigated if and to what extent KH biodiversity is
   influenced by the surrounding land use. We hypothesized that richness
   and community composition will greatly differ in KH from agricultural
   land use compared with KH in grasslands and forests. Our data show that
   deep eDNA amplicon sequencing is useful for in-depth assessments of
   cross-domain biodiversity comprising both micro- and macro-organisms,
   but has limitations with respect to single-taxa conservation studies.
   Using this broad method, we show that sediment eDNA, integrating several
   years to decades, depicts the history of agricultural land-use
   intensification. Aquatic biodiversity was best explained by seasonality,
   whereas land-use type explained little of the variation. We concluded
   that, counter to our hypothesis, land use intensification coupled with
   landscape wide nutrient enrichment (including atmospheric deposition),
   groundwater connectivity between KH and organismal (active and passive)
   dispersal in the tight network of ponds, resulted in a biodiversity
   homogenization in the KH water, leveling off today's detectable
   differences in KH biodiversity between land-use types. These findings
   have profound implications for measures and management strategies to
   combat current biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes worldwide.},

Title = {Phylogeny of Marsdenieae (Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae) based on
   chloroplast and nuclear loci, with a conspectus of the genera},

Abstract = {A densely sampled molecular phylogeny of the pantropical, predominantly
   forest-dwelling tribe Marsdenieae (Apocynaceae) is presented, including
   almost a quarter of the ca. 740 species. Sampling focused on resolving
   the circumscription of Marsdenia, which ranges from Marsdenia sensu
   Bullock with less than 10 Asian species closely related to the type, M.
   tinctoria, to Marsdenia sensu Forster, with ca. 300 species distributed
   throughout the range of the tribe, encompassing the genera Cionura,
   Dregea, Gongronema, Gymnema, Leichhardtia, Stephanotis, and Wattakaka as
   synonyms. All analyses resolve two well-supported clades: an
   Asia-Pacific Clade that includes the large epiphytic Dischidia-Hoya
   alliance and a number of Marsdenia species, among them the type M.
   tinctoria, and a Cosmopolitan Clade that includes most of the rest of
   Marsdenieae with several moderately to well-supported subclades that
   span the entire geographic range of Marsdenieae. The position of two
   small genera, Rhyssolobium (southern Africa) and Sicyocarpus
   (Madagascar), is ambiguous. Given this topology, a monophyletic
   Marsdenia s.l. would subsume all species of Marsdenieae. Instead, we
   propose a classification that maintains Dischidia and Hoya as distinct
   genera. We revise generic circumscriptions, reducing Marsdenia s.str. to
   a small clade of Asian species. Two new genera, Gongreos gen. nov. and
   Gongronemopsis gen. nov., are described, with two and nine species,
   respectively. A total of twenty-six new combinations, one new name, and
   six new synonyms are proposed. Three neotypes and eleven lectotypes are
   selected, and one 2nd step lectotypification is carried out. Diagnostic
   morphological characters for identified clades are discussed.
   Biogeographic analysis retrieves tropical Asia as most likely ancestral
   area for Marsdenieae, with widespread tropical Asia-Africa almost
   equally likely. The first-branching lineages in both major clades are
   tropical Asian; the Asia-Pacific Clade comprises a sizeable radiation in
   the Pacific area, with two dispersals from Australia to New Caledonia.
   The Cosmopolitan Clade comprises several genera (Gongronemopsis,
   Gymnema, Stephanotis, Telosma) widespread in Africa and tropical Asia,
   and some also in Madagascar, and the New World genus Ruehssia.},

Title = {Applying the structural causal model framework for observational causal
   inference in ecology},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ecologists are often interested in answering causal questions from
   observational data but generally lack the training to appropriately
   infer causation. When applying statistical analysis (e.g., generalized
   linear model) on observational data, common statistical adjustments can
   often lead to biased estimates between variables of interest due to
   processes such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias. To
   overcome these limitations, we present an overview of structural causal
   modeling (SCM), an emerging causal inference framework that can be used
   to determine cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The
   SCM framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visualize
   researchers' assumptions about the causal structure of a system or
   process under study. Following this, a DAG-based graphical rule known as
   the backdoor criterion can be applied to determine statistical
   adjustments (or lack thereof) required to determine causal relationships
   from observational data. In the presence of unobserved confounding
   variables, an additional rule called the frontdoor criterion can be
   employed to determine causal effects. Here, we use simulated ecological
   examples to review how the backdoor and frontdoor criteria can return
   accurate causal estimates between variables of interest, as well as how
   biases can arise when these criteria are not used. We further provide an
   overview of studies that have applied the SCM framework in ecology. SCM,
   along with its application of DAGs, has been widely used in other
   disciplines to make valid causal inferences from observational data.
   Their use in ecology holds tremendous potential for quantifying causal
   relationships and investigating a range of ecological questions without
   randomized experiments.},

Title = {Evolution of increased competitive ability may explain dominance of
   introduced species in ruderal communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis
   encapsulates the importance of evolution and ecology for biological
   invasions. According to this proposition, leaving specialist herbivores
   at home frees introduced plant species from investing limited resources
   in defense to instead use those resources for growth, selecting for
   individuals with reduced defense, enhanced growth, and, consequently,
   increased competitive ability. We took a multispecies approach,
   including ancestral and non-native populations of seven weeds, as well
   as seven coexisting local weeds, to explore all three predictions (i.e.,
   lower defense, greater growth, and better ability to compete in
   non-native than ancestral populations), the generality as an invasion
   mechanism for a given system, and community-level consequences of EICA.
   We assessed plant defenses by conducting herbivory trials with a
   generalist herbivore. Therefore, finding that non-native populations are
   better defended than ancestral populations would lend support to the
   shifting defense (SD) hypothesis, an extension of EICA that incorporates
   the observation that introduced species escape specialists, but
   encounter generalists. We also manipulated water additions to evaluate
   how resource availability influences competition in the context of EICA
   and plant plasticity in our semiarid system. We found that non-native
   populations of one study species, Centaurea solstitialis, were better
   defended, grew faster, and exerted stronger suppression on locals than
   ancestral populations, offering support to EICA through the SD
   hypothesis. The other species also displayed variation in trait
   attributes between ancestral and non-native populations, but they did
   not fully comply with the three predictions of EICA. Notably,
   differences between those populations generally favored the non-natives.
   Moreover, non-native populations were, overall, superior at suppressing
   locals relative to ancestral populations under low water conditions.
   There were no differences in plasticity among all three groups. These
   results suggest that evolutionary change between ancestral and
   non-native populations is widespread and could have facilitated invasion
   in our system. Additionally, although trading growth for shifted defense
   does not seem to be the main operational path for evolutionary change,
   it may explain the dominance of some introduced species in ruderal
   communities. Because introduced species dominate communities in
   disturbed environments around the world, our results are likely
   generalizable to other systems.},

Title = {Herbivory mediates direct and indirect interactions in long-unburned
   chaparral},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Community interaction webs describe both direct and indirect
   interactions among species. Changes in direct interactions often become
   noticeable soon after a perturbation, but time lags in the responses of
   many species may delay the appearance of indirect effects and lead to
   temporal or spatial variation in interaction webs. Accurately
   identifying these shifts in the field requires time-specific, spatially
   differentiated interaction webs. We explore how variation in browsing
   affects interaction webs in a long-unburned chaparral shrubland near the
   central California coast. Most prior work in chaparral focused on rapid
   changes for <5 years after a wildfire that were assumed to determine
   community patterns until the next fire. Here, we report the results of
   the first 15 years of an ongoing experiment monitoring how interaction
   webs in long-unburned chaparral (at least 100 years postfire) respond to
   experimental variation in browsing by deer and rabbits on dominant
   shrubs (Arctostaphylos pumila, Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, and
   Ericameria ericoides). We hypothesized that variation in browsing would
   directly affect foodplants, indirectly modify growth and survival of
   other shrubs, and impact habitat needed by herbaceous plants. We found a
   dynamic web of plant-herbivore and plant-plant interactions that
   responded rapidly to changes in deer browsing on Ceanothus followed by
   indirect interactions that continued developing over several years,
   affecting shrubs, open space, herbaceous plants, and small mammals.
   Experimental variation in the intensity of deer browsing led to temporal
   and spatial changes in interactions that produced three different
   community interaction webs. With deer, community webs were complex,
   having numerous direct and indirect interactions. Removing deer
   simplified the community web, changed outcomes of interactions, and
   reduced open space and herbaceous plant densities. Finally, changes in
   Ceanothus morphology without deer allowed woodrats to browse these
   shrubs, with negative impacts on Ceanothus growth and survival. General
   field observations also showed that all three alternative interaction
   webs occurred naturally at our fieldsite, varying across space and over
   time. Long-unburned chaparral communities browsed by deer maintain high
   biological diversity, but maintenance of this diversity involves many
   key direct and indirect biotic interactions.},

Title = {Combined influence of food availability and agricultural intensification
   on a declining aerial insectivore},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 21},
Abstract = {Aerial insectivores show worldwide population declines coinciding with
   shifts in agricultural practices. Increasing reliance on certain
   agricultural practices is thought to have led to an overall reduction in
   insect abundance that negatively affects aerial insectivore fitness. The
   relationship between prey availability and the fitness of insectivores
   may thus vary with the extent of agricultural intensity. It is therefore
   imperative to quantify the strength and direction of these associations.
   Here we used data from an 11-year study monitoring the breeding of Tree
   Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and the availability of Diptera (their
   main prey) across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern
   Quebec, Canada. This gradient was characterized by a shift in
   agricultural production, whereby landscapes composed of forage and
   pastures represented less agro-intensive landscapes and those focusing
   on large-scale arable row crop monocultures, such as corn (Zea mays) or
   soybean (Glycine max) that are innately associated with significant
   mechanization and agro-chemical inputs, represented more agro-intensive
   landscapes. We evaluated the landscape characteristics affecting prey
   availability and how this relationship influences the fledging success,
   duration of the nestling period, fledgling body mass, and wing length as
   these variables are known to influence the population dynamics of this
   species. Diptera availability was greatest within predominately forested
   landscapes, while within landscapes dominated by agriculture, it was
   marginally greater in less agro-intensive areas. Of the measured fitness
   and body condition proxies, both fledging success and nestling body mass
   were positively related to prey availability. The impact of prey
   availability varied across the agricultural gradient as fledging success
   improved with increasing prey levels within forage landscapes yet
   declined in more agro-intensive landscapes. Finally, after accounting
   for prey availability, fledging success was lowest, nestling periods
   were the longest, and wing length of fledglings were shortest within
   more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight the interacting
   roles that aerial insect availability and agricultural intensification
   have on the fitness of aerial insectivores, and by extension how food
   availability may interact with other aspects of breeding habitats to
   influence the population dynamics of predators.},

Title = {Do Nearctic hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) engage in long-distance
   migration? An assessment of evidence and mechanisms},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Long-distance insect migration is poorly understood despite its
   tremendous ecological and economic importance. As a group, Nearctic
   hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae: Syrphinae), which are crucial
   pollinators as adults and biological control agents as larvae, are
   almost entirely unrecognized as migratory despite examples of highly
   migratory behavior among several Palearctic species. Here, we examined
   evidence and mechanisms of migration for four hover fly species
   (Allograpta obliqua, Eupeodes americanus, Syrphus rectus, and Syrphus
   ribesii) common throughout eastern North America using stable hydrogen
   isotope (delta H-2) measurements of chitinous tissue, morphological
   assessments, abundance estimations, and cold-tolerance assays. Although
   further studies are needed, nonlocal isotopic values obtained from hover
   fly specimens collected in central Illinois support the existence of
   long-distance fall migratory behavior in Eu. americanus, and to a lesser
   extent S. ribesii and S. rectus. Elevated abundance of Eu. americanus
   during the expected autumn migratory period further supports the
   existence of such behavior. Moreover, high phenotypic plasticity of
   morphology associated with dispersal coupled with significant
   differences between local and nonlocal specimens suggest that Eu.
   americanus exhibits a unique suite of morphological traits that decrease
   costs associated with long-distance flight. Finally, compared with the
   ostensibly nonmigratory A. obliqua, Eu. americanus was less cold
   tolerant, a factor that may be associated with migratory behavior.
   Collectively, our findings imply that fall migration occurs in Nearctic
   hover flies, but we consider the methodological limitations of our study
   in addition to potential ecological and economic consequences of these
   novel findings.},

Title = {Toward a ``modern coexistence theory{''} for the discrete and spatial},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The usual theoretical condition for coexistence is that each species in
   a community can increase when it is rare (mutual invasibility).
   Traditional coexistence theory implicitly assumes that the invading
   species is common enough that we can ignore demographic stochasticity
   but rare enough that it does not compete with itself, even after it has
   reached a stationary spatial distribution. However, short-distance
   dispersal of discrete individuals leads to locally dense population
   clusters, and existing theory breaks down. We have an intuition that
   when we account for invader-invader competition, shorter-range dispersal
   should reduce the invader's ability to escape competition, but exactly
   how does this translate into lower population growth? And how will
   invader discreteness affect outcomes? We need a way of partitioning the
   contributions to coexistence, but current modern coexistence theory
   (MCT) does not apply under these conditions. Here we present a
   computationally based partitioning method to quantify the contributions
   to coexistence from different mechanisms, as in MCT. We also build up an
   intuition for how invader clumping and discreteness will affect these
   contributions by analyzing a case study, a lattice-based spatial lottery
   model. We first consider fluctuation-dependent coexistence, partitioning
   the contributions of variable environment, variable competition,
   demographic stochasticity, and their correlations and interactions. Our
   second example examines fluctuation-independent coexistence maintained
   by a fecundity-survival trade-off, and partitions the contributions to
   coexistence from interspecific differences in fecundity, in mortality,
   and in dispersal. We find that demographic stochasticity harms an
   invader, but only slightly. Localized invader dispersal, on the other
   hand, can have a strong effect. When invaders are more clumped, they
   compete with each other more intensely when rare, so they too become
   limited by environment-competition covariance. More invader clumping
   also means that variation in competition changes from helping the
   invader to harming it. More broadly, invader clumping is likely to
   weaken any coexistence mechanism that relies on the invader escaping
   competition from the resident, because invader clumping means that the
   resident is no longer the only source of competition.},

Abstract = {Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters have often been detected in aquatic
   ecosystems in concentrations ranging from ng/L to lug/L. However, both
   their acute and chronic effects on aquatic organisms have been
   insufficiently explored. This study aimed to evaluate acute toxicity of
   some of the main UV filters used worldwide
   (2-ethylhexy1,4-methoxycinnamate/EHMC, avobenzone/AVO,
   benzophenone-3/BP-3, and octocrylene/OC), in three aquatic organisms
   (Artemia salina, Desmodesmus subspicatus, and Daphnia magna), and to
   further investigate multigenerational effects in D. magna. After acute
   toxicity was confirmed, daphnids were chronically exposed to
   environmentally relevant concentrations of UV filters for two
   consecutive generations (F0 and F1), and reproductive endpoints, as well
   as catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, were
   assessed. EHMC showed the most toxic potential, with the lowest EC50
   values for the three organisms. On the other hand, reproductive delays
   and a decrease in the reproduction rate were observed in the Fl
   generation exposed to AVO (4.4 mu g/L), BP-3 (0.17 mu g/L), EHMC (0.2 mu
   g/L), and MIX. An increase of the CAT activity in organisms exposed to
   BP-3 and EHMC suggested induction of the antioxidant system. Although no
   reproductive effect was observed in the first generation, toxic effects
   obtained in the F1 revealed the importance of multigenerational studies
   and the potential harm of UV filters to the life cycle of D. magna, even
   at environmentally relevant concentrations. This emphasizes the need for
   further studies considering these levels of exposure and more realistic
   experimental designs to better understand their potential risks.

Title = {Identification and quantitation of the novel insecticide sulfoxaflor and

Abstract = {Sulfoxaflor is a new systemic insecticide developed as a replacement for
   older neonicotinoids which are known to be toxic to pollinators.
   However, its metabolism in nectar and effect on nectar biosynthesis have
   not been investigated. After soil and foliar application, sulfoxaflor
   and its main metabolites in soil, leaf and Salvia splendens nectar, were
   measured by liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass
   spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The chemical composition between the clean and
   sulfoxaflor spiked nectar were also compared. The activities of two
   possible sulfoxaflor detoxifying enzymes in S. splendens nectar, nitrile
   hydratase and glutathione-s-transferase, were measured by LC-MS and
   spectrophotometry. S. splendens nectar proteome was investigated by
   high-resolution orbitrap-based MS/MS to screen for sulfoxaflor
   detoxifying relevant proteins. S. splendens could absorb sulfoxaflor
   through root or leaf surface and secrete a proportion of sulfoxaflor
   along with its metabolites into the nectar. After soil application,
   sulfoxaflor's low toxic metabolite X11719474 was dominant in the nectar
   and reached an average concentration of 8905 ppb. However, after foliar
   application, sulfoxaflor was dominant over its metabolites in the
   nectar. S. splendens nectar has no nitrile hydratase and
   glutathione-s-transferase activity and none of the 106 proteins
   identified in the nectar were predicted to function in detoxifying
   sulfoxaflor. Soil and foliar sulfoxaflor application can result in
   different profiles of sulfoxaflor and its metabolites presented in the
   nectar. However, sulfoxaflor had no effects on S. splendens nectar
   secretion and chemical composition and cannot be directly detoxified by
   components in the nectar.},

Title = {Character displacement when natural selection pushes in only one
   direction},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The usual conception of character displacement is of resource
   competitors differentiating to specialize on different prey in order to
   reduce competition. However, traits that underlie many predator-prey
   interactions, such as chase-evade speeds, gape limitation, and toxin
   concentrations, do not permit such specialization, but instead result in
   unidirectional evolutionary arms races. Here, we develop and analyze an
   evolutionary model of predator-prey interactions to explore whether
   character displacement will still occur when such unidirectional traits
   define the species interactions, and if so, what environmental
   conditions foster or retard differentiation. Character displacement in
   predators and prey does occur, and this differentiation is driven by
   fitness component trade-offs. Instead of specialization or
   compartmentalization in which different sets of species have strong
   interactions, differentiation in this model causes a nested community
   structure in which species of predators and prey have the same rank
   interaction strengths with species at the other trophic level. Also,
   analyses of the model predict that character displacement is fostered in
   environments with higher productivity, weaker stressors, and lower
   structural complexity. Model comparisons suggest that character
   displacement should occur over a broader set of environmental conditions
   when traits permit prey specialization than when traits foster arms
   races. These results highlight how different types of phenotypic traits
   that underlie species interactions shape the species diversification and
   the structure of the resulting community.},

Title = {Typification of Adanson's generic name Pacoseroca (Zingiberaceae) and

Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {151-158},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Since its publication by Adanson in 1763, the name Pacoseroca has been
   treated as a synonym of several genera of Zingiberaceae by different
   authors. It is currently treated as a homotypic synonym of Zingiber
   Mill. (equivalent to Amomum L., nom. rej.) in Index Nominum Genericorum.
   No binomial combination has ever been proposed in Pacoseroca, and the
   typification of this long-forgotten generic name has never been
   undertaken. We show here that Pacoseroca is not homotypic with Amomum L.
   Instead, its protologue included elements that belong to at least three
   rather distantly related genera of Zingiberaceae (Aframomum, Elettaria,
   Renealmia), over all of which Pacoseroca has priority. Based on a study
   of the protologue and of Adanson's working methods, we typify Pacoseroca
   with Renealmia alpinia (Rottb.) Maas (equivalent to Amomum alpinia
   Rottb.), a species which is the best fit to a plant recorded by
   Marcgrave under the vernacular name ``Paco seroca{''} and upon which
   Adanson based his generic name. A formal proposal to reject Pacoseroca
   will be submitted to uphold the well-known Renealmia and to prevent new
   combinations for 82 species names currently accepted in this genus,
   which is widespread in Africa and South America.},

Title = {Stable pollination service in a generalist high Arctic community despite
   the warming climate},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Insects provide key pollination services in most terrestrial biomes, but
   this service depends on a multistep interaction between insect and
   plant. An insect needs to visit a flower, receive pollen from the
   anthers, move to another conspecific flower, and finally deposit the
   pollen on a receptive stigma. Each of these steps may be affected by
   climate change, and focusing on only one of them (e.g., flower
   visitation) may miss important signals of change in service provision.
   In this study, we combine data on visitation, pollen transport, and
   single-visit pollen deposition to estimate functional outcomes in the
   high Arctic plant-pollinator network of Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland,
   a model system for global warming-associated impacts in pollination
   services. Over two decades of rapid climate warming, we sampled the
   network repeatedly: in 1996, 1997, 2010, 2011, and 2016. Although the
   flowering plant and insect communities and their interactions varied
   substantially between years, as expected based on highly variable Arctic
   weather, there was no detectable directional change in either the
   structure of flower-visitor networks or estimated pollen deposition. For
   flower-visitor networks compiled over a single week, species phenologies
   caused major within-year variation in network structure despite
   consistency across years. Weekly networks for the middle of the
   flowering season emerged as especially important because most
   pollination service can be expected to be provided by these large,
   highly nested networks. Our findings suggest that pollination ecosystem
   service in the high Arctic is remarkably resilient. This resilience may
   reflect the plasticity of Arctic biota as an adaptation to extreme and
   unpredictable weather. However, most pollination service was contributed
   by relatively few fly taxa (Diptera: Spilogona sanctipauli and Drymeia
   segnis {[}Muscidae] and species of Rhamphomyia {[}Empididae]). If these
   key pollinators are negatively affected by climate change, network
   structure and the pollination service that depends on it would be
   seriously compromised.},

Title = {Allometry of behavior and niche differentiation among congeneric African
   antelopes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Size-structured differences in resource use stabilize species
   coexistence in animal communities, but what behavioral mechanisms
   underpin these niche differences? Behavior is constrained by
   morphological and physiological traits that scale allometrically with
   body size, yet the degree to which behaviors exhibit allometric scaling
   remains unclear; empirical datasets often encompass broad variation in
   environmental context and phylogenetic history, which complicates the
   detection and interpretation of scaling relationships between size and
   behavior. We studied the movement and foraging behaviors of three
   sympatric, congeneric spiral-horned antelope species (Tragelaphus spp.)
   that differ in body mass-bushbuck (26-40 kg), nyala (57-83 kg), and kudu
   (80-142 kg)-in an African savanna ecosystem where (i) food was patchily
   distributed due to ecosystem engineering by fungus-farming termites and
   (ii) predation risk was low due to the extirpation of several large
   carnivores. Because foraging behavior is directly linked to traits that
   scale allometrically with size (e.g., metabolic rate, locomotion), we
   hypothesized that habitat use and diet selection would likewise exhibit
   nonlinear scaling relationships. All three antelope species selected
   habitat near termitaria, which are hotspots of abundant, high-quality
   forage. Experimental removal of forage from termite mounds sharply
   reduced use of those mounds by bushbuck, confirming that habitat
   selection was resource driven. Strength of selection for termite mounds
   scaled negatively and nonlinearly with body mass, as did recursion
   (frequency with which individuals revisited locations), whereas
   home-range area and mean step length scaled positively and nonlinearly
   with body mass. All species disproportionately ate mound-associated
   plant taxa; nonetheless, forage selectivity and dietary composition,
   richness, and quality all differed among species, reflecting the
   partitioning of shared food resources. Dietary protein exhibited the
   theoretically predicted negative allometric relationship with body mass,
   whereas digestible-energy content scaled positively. Our results
   demonstrate cryptic size-based separation along spatial and dietary
   niche axes-despite superficial similarities among species-consistent
   with the idea that body-size differentiation is driven by selection for
   divergent resource-acquisition strategies, which in turn underpin
   coexistence. Foraging and space-use behaviors were nonlinearly related
   to body mass, supporting the hypothesis that behavior scales
   allometrically with size. However, explaining the variable functional
   forms of these relationships is a challenge for future research.},

Title = {Quantifying eco-evolutionary contributions to trait divergence in
   spatially structured systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary processes can occur at similar time scales
   and, hence, influence one another. There has been much progress in
   developing metrics that quantify contributions of ecological and
   evolutionary components to trait change over time. However, many
   empirical evolutionary ecology studies document trait differentiation
   among populations structured in space. In both time and space, the
   observed differentiation in trait values among populations and
   communities can be the result of interactions between nonevolutionary
   (phenotypic plasticity, changes in the relative abundance of species)
   and evolutionary (genetic differentiation among populations) processes.
   However, the tools developed so far to quantify ecological and
   evolutionary contributions to trait changes are implicitly addressing
   temporal dynamics because they require directionality of change from an
   ancestral to a derived state. Identifying directionality from one site
   to another in spatial studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics is not always
   possible and often not meaningful. We suggest three modifications to
   existing partitioning metrics so they allow quantifying ecological and
   evolutionary contributions to changes in population and community trait
   values across spatial locations in landscapes. Applying these spatially
   modified metrics to published empirical examples shows how these metrics
   can be used to generate new empirical insights and to facilitate future
   comparative analyses. The possibility of applying eco-evolutionary
   partitioning metrics to populations and communities in natural
   landscapes is critical as it will broaden our capacity to quantify
   eco-evolutionary interactions as they occur in nature.},

Abstract = {Understanding long-term forest fire histories of boreal landscapes is
   instrumental for parameterizing climate-fire interactions and the role
   of humans affecting natural fire regimes. The eastern sections of the
   European boreal zone currently lack a network of annually resolved and
   centuries-long forest fire histories. To fill in this knowledge gap, we
   dendrochronologically reconstructed the 600-year fire history of a
   middle boreal pine-dominated landscape of the southern part of the
   Republic of Komi, Russia. We combined the reconstruction of fire cycle
   (FC) and fire occurrence with the data on the village establishment and
   climate proxies and discussed the relative contribution of climate
   versus human land use in shaping historic fire regimes. Over the
   1340-1610 ce period, the territory had a FC of 66 years (with the 90\%
   confidence envelope of 56.8 and 78.6 years). Fire activity increased
   during the 1620-1730 ce period, with the FC reaching 32 years (31.0-34.7
   years). Between 1740-1950, the FC increased to 47 years (41.9-52.0). The
   most recent period, 1960-2010, marks FC's historic maximum, with the
   mean of 153 years (102.5-270.3). Establishment of the villages, often as
   small harbors on the Pechora River, was associated with a
   non-significant increase in fire occurrence in the sites nearest the
   villages (p = 0.07-0.20). We, however, observed a temporal association
   between village establishment and fire occurrence at the scale of the
   whole studied landscape. There was no positive association between the
   former and the FC. In fact, we documented a decline in the area burned,
   following the wave of village establishment during the second half of
   the 1600s and the first half of the 1700s. The lack of association
   between the dynamics of FC and the dates of village establishments, and
   the significant association between large fire years and the early and
   latewood pine chronologies, used as historic drought proxy, indirectly
   suggests that the climate was the primary control of the landscape-level
   FCs in the studied forests. Pine-dominated forests of the Komi Republic
   may hold a unique position as the ecosystem with the shortest history of
   human-related shifts in fire cycles across the European boreal region.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of biseasonal anthrax outbreak dynamics in two
   multihost savanna systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental factors are common forces driving infectious disease
   dynamics. We compared interannual and seasonal patterns of anthrax
   infections in two multihost systems in southern Africa: Etosha National
   Park, Namibia, and Kruger National Park, South Africa. Using several
   decades of mortality data from each system, we assessed possible
   transmission mechanisms behind anthrax dynamics, examining (1) within-
   and between-species temporal case correlations and (2) associations
   between anthrax mortalities and environmental factors, specifically
   rainfall and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with
   empirical dynamic modeling. Anthrax cases in Kruger had wide interannual
   variation in case numbers, and large outbreaks seemed to follow a
   roughly decadal cycle. In contrast, outbreaks in Etosha were smaller in
   magnitude and occurred annually. In Etosha, the host species commonly
   affected remained consistent over several decades, although plains zebra
   (Equus quagga) became relatively more dominant. In Kruger, turnover of
   the main host species occurred after the 1990s, where the previously
   dominant host species, greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), was
   replaced by impala (Aepyceros melampus). In both parks, anthrax
   infections showed two seasonal peaks, with each species having only one
   peak in a year. Zebra, springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), wildebeest
   (Connochaetes taurinus), and impala cases peaked in wet seasons, while
   elephant (Loxodonta africana), kudu, and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) cases
   peaked in dry seasons. For common host species shared between the two
   parks, anthrax mortalities peaked in the same season in both systems.
   Among host species with cases peaking in the same season, anthrax
   mortalities were mostly synchronized, which implies similar transmission
   mechanisms or shared sources of exposure. Between seasons, outbreaks in
   one species may contribute to more cases in another species in the
   following season. Higher vegetation greenness was associated with more
   zebra and springbok anthrax mortalities in Etosha but fewer elephant
   cases in Kruger. These results suggest that host behavioral responses to
   changing environmental conditions may affect anthrax transmission risk,
   with differences in transmission mechanisms leading to multihost
   biseasonal outbreaks. This study reveals the dynamics and potential
   environmental drivers of anthrax in two savanna systems, providing a
   better understanding of factors driving biseasonal dynamics and outbreak
   variation among locations.},

Title = {Reevaluating trophic discrimination factors (Delta delta C-13 and Delta
   delta N-15) for diet reconstruction},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is increasingly being used to assess diet and
   trophic positions of animals. Such assessments require estimates of
   trophic discrimination factors (TDFs)-offset between the isotopic
   composition of diet and animal tissues-with imprecise applications of
   TDFs leading to biased conclusions in resource use. Because TDFs are
   unavailable for most species, ecologists often apply values from
   taxonomically similar species or use trophic step increases of
   approximately 1 parts per thousand for carbon (TDF-delta C-13) and 3
   parts per thousand for nitrogen (TDF-delta N-15). Such practices may
   yield inaccuracies since TDFs vary greatly, even within a species. To
   better understand the factors that influence TDFs, we conducted a
   meta-analysis of TDF-delta C-13 and TDF-delta N-15 for mammals and
   quantified variation in relation to consumer type (herbivore, omnivore,
   carnivore) and diet source (C-3-based, C-4-based, marine-based,
   mixture). Additionally, to guide TDF choice, we used an isotopic data
   set of small mammal tissues and diet items to assess how predicted
   dietary contributions vary with TDFs estimated using (1) taxonomic
   relatedness, (2) consumer type and diet source, or (3) values derived
   from wild animals eating natural diets. Our meta-analysis revealed that
   metabolic routing and interactions between consumer class, dietary
   source, and the protein versus energy content of diets best explained
   variation in TDF-delta C-13 values (-1.5 parts per thousand to 7.3 parts
   per thousand), whereas consumer class best explained variation in
   TDF-delta N-15 values (-0.5 parts per thousand to 7.1 parts per
   thousand). Our test of methods to estimate TDFs indicated that
   ecologists should avoid relying on taxonomic relatedness when selecting
   TDF-delta C-13 because mixed-diet lab studies may produce misleading
   results for herbivores and omnivores. Additionally, field-derived
   estimates could help fill TDF gaps where diets within a consumer class
   are absent. Overall, we suggest that using standard TDF trophic step
   values should be abandoned, because feeding studies are often poor
   proxies for natural diets, particularly for herbivores and omnivores.
   Instead, we make recommendations on how to select TDFs, along with a
   range of TDF-delta C-13 and TDF-delta N-15 values depending on diet
   source, consumer class, and tissue type. Use of these more refined
   recommendations and TDF values in isotopic assessments will improve
   estimates of diets and trophic interactions in natural systems, leading
   to a better understanding of ecological interactions and communities.},

Title = {The effects of a half century of warming and fire exclusion on montane
   forests of the Klamath Mountains, California, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate warming and altered disturbance regimes are changing forest
   composition and structure worldwide. Given that species often exhibit
   individualistic responses to change, making predictions about the
   cumulative effects of multiple stressors across environmental gradients
   is challenging, especially in diverse communities. For example, warming
   temperatures are predicted to drive species upslope, whereas fire
   exclusion promotes the expansion of species at lower elevations where
   fire was historically frequent. We resampled 148 vegetation plots to
   assess 46 years (1969-2015) of species and community-level response to
   warming and fire exclusion in a topographically complex landscape in the
   Klamath Mountains, California, USA, a diverse region that served as a
   climate refugia throughout the Holocene. We compared cover and assessed
   change in the elevational distributions of 12 conifer species at
   different life stages (i.e., seedlings, saplings, canopy). We observed
   consistent but non-significant shifts upward in elevation for eight
   species, and a significant shift upward for one species, all of which
   were far less than expectations based on recent warming. Six species
   declined in total cover and another five declined in at least one life
   stage, whereas the drought- and fire-intolerant Abies concolor increased
   by 30.7\%. The largest declines were at lower elevations in
   drought-tolerant, early-seral species (Pinus lambertiana and Pinus
   ponderosa) and at higher elevations for the shade-tolerant Abies
   magnifica var. shastensis and the regionally rare Abies lasiocarpa.
   Regionally rare (Picea engelmannii) and endemic (Picea breweriana)
   species had reductions in early life stages, portending future declines.
   Multivariate analyses revealed a high degree of inertia with a minor,
   but significant, shift in composition and a slight decrease in species
   turnover along the elevation gradient driven by the expansion of A.
   concolor. Our results indicate that most species are declining,
   especially at lower and mid-elevations where fire exclusion has
   increased the cover of shade-tolerant species and reduced the
   recruitment for fire-adapted species. Collectively, declines in most
   species, insufficient upward movement to track warming, reductions in
   drought- and fire-tolerant early-seral species, and an increase in a
   single, shade-tolerant species will leave these communities maladapted
   to projected climate scenarios and questions the potential for future
   climate refugia in this region.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},

Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning can be partitioned into
   complementarity effects, driven by many species, and selection effects,
   driven by few. Selection effects occur through interspecific abundance
   shifts (dominance) and intraspecific shifts in functioning.
   Complementarity and selection effects are often calculated for biomass,
   but very rarely for secondary productivity, that is, energy transfer to
   higher trophic levels. We calculated diversity effects for three
   functions: aboveground biomass, insect herbivory and pathogen infection,
   the latter two as proxies for energy transfer to higher trophic levels,
   in a grassland experiment (PaNDiv) manipulating species richness,
   functional composition, nitrogen enrichment, and fungicide treatment.
   Complementarity effects were, on average, positive and selection effects
   negative for biomass production and pathogen infection and multiple
   species contributed to diversity effects in mixtures. Diversity effects
   were, on average, less pronounced for herbivory. Diversity effects for
   the three functions were not correlated, because different species drove
   the different effects. Benefits (and costs) from growing in diverse
   communities, be it reduced herbivore or pathogen damage or increased
   productivity either due to abundance increases or increased productivity
   per area were distributed across different plant species, leading to
   highly variable contributions of single species to effects of diversity
   on different functions. These results show that different underlying
   ecological mechanisms can result in similar overall diversity effects
   across functions.},

Title = {Defining, estimating, and understanding the fundamental niches of
   complex animals in heterogeneous environments},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During the past century, the fundamental niche, the complete set of
   environments that allow an individual, population, or species to
   persist, has shaped ecological thinking. It is a crucial concept
   connecting population dynamics, spatial ecology, and evolutionary
   theory, and a prerequisite for predictive ecological models at a time of
   rapid environmental change. Yet, its properties have eluded
   quantification, particularly for mobile, cognitively complex organisms.
   These difficulties are mainly a result of the separation between niche
   theory and field data, and the dichotomy between environmental and
   geographical spaces. Here, I combine recent mathematical and statistical
   results linking habitats to population growth, to achieve a quantitative
   and intuitive understanding of the fundamental niches of animals. I
   trace the development of niche ideas from the early steps of ecology to
   their use in modern statistical and conservation practice. I examine how
   animal mobility and behavior may blur the division between geographical
   and environmental space. I discuss how the central models of population
   and spatial ecology lead to a concise mathematical equation for the
   fundamental niche of animals and demonstrate how fitness parameters can
   be understood and directly estimated by fitting this model
   simultaneously to data on population growth and spatial distributions. I
   first illustrate these concepts theoretically for territorial species. I
   then fit the fundamental niche model to a data set of house sparrow
   colonies to quantify how a species of selective animals can increase
   their fitness in heterogeneous environments. This work confirms ideas
   that had been anticipated in the historical niche literature.
   Specifically, within traditionally defined environmental spaces, habitat
   heterogeneity and behavioral plasticity make the fundamental niche more
   complex and malleable than was historically envisaged. However, once
   examined in higher-dimensional environmental spaces, accounting for
   spatial heterogeneity, the niche is more predictable than recently
   suspected. This re-evaluation quantifies how organisms might buffer
   themselves from change by bending the boundaries of viable environmental
   space and offers a framework for designing optimal habitat interventions
   to protect biodiversity or obstruct invasive species. It therefore
   promotes the fundamental niche as a key concept for understanding animal
   responses to changing environments and a central tool for environmental
   management.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For the two-patch logistic model, we study the effect of dispersal
   intensity and dispersal asymmetry on the total population abundance and
   its distribution. Two complete classifications of the model parameter
   space are given: one concerning when dispersal causes smaller or larger
   total biomass than no dispersal, and the other addressing how the total
   biomass changes with dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry. The
   dependencies of the population abundance of each individual patch on
   dispersal intensity and dispersal asymmetry are also fully
   characterized. In addition, the maximal and minimal total population
   sizes induced by dispersal are determined for the logistic model with an
   arbitrary number of patches, and a weak order-preserving result
   correlated the local population abundances with and without dispersal is
   established. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Parasitoids are significant ecological elements of terrestrial food webs
   and have evolved within seven insect orders. Interestingly, however,
   associations with spiders as hosts have evolved only in two insect
   orders, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Here, we summarize various aspects of
   host utilization by dipteran flies with an emphasis on associations with
   spiders. Our synthesis reveals that spider flies (family Acroceridae)
   have evolved a unique life strategy among all the parasitoid taxa
   associated with spiders, in which koinobiont small-headed flies utilize
   an indirect oviposition strategy. This indirect oviposition in spider
   flies is inherited from Nemestrinimorpha ancestors which appeared in the
   Late Triassic and is characterized by the evolution of planidial larvae.
   Further, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of indirect
   oviposition in spider flies. On the one hand, indirect oviposition
   allows the fly to avoid contact/wrestling with spider hosts. On the
   other hand, larval survival is low because the planidium must actively
   seek out and infect a suitable host individually. The risk of failure to
   find a suitable spider host is offset by the fly's extremely high
   fecundity.},

Abstract = {The formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and Pleistocene
   climatic fluctuations have been shown to influence the diversification
   of lineages and species distributed throughout central Mexico. In some
   taxa, however, evidence of lineage diversification is not easily
   recognized, as often is the case in reptiles. Here we present a
   phylogeographic study on a Mexican endemic rattlesnake species (Crotalus
   ravus), with the aim of understanding how distinct lineages are
   distributed across the TMVB. Genetic (mtDNA) and genomic (ddRADseq) data
   were generated from samples across the species' range to evaluate
   phylogeographic structure, estimate phylogenetic relationships and
   divergence times, and perform environmental niche modeling (ENM). Both
   datasets recover strong phylogeographic structuring of two distinct
   lineages on an east-west axis, with an estimated Pleistocene divergence
   (similar to 1.47 Myr). The ENM suggest that the distribution of the two
   lineages experienced expansion and reduction events throughout recent
   evolutionary time. We attribute the diversification of C. ravus lineages
   to geological events associated with the formation of the TMVB, as well
   as Quaternary climate changes, both of which have been previously
   recognized in co-distributed taxa in the TMVB. This work emphasizes the
   existence of cryptic diversification processes in a morphologically
   conserved species distributed in a region of complex climatic and
   orogenic heterogeneity.},

Title = {Host interaction mechanisms in herbivorous insects - life cycles, host
   specialization and speciation},

Volume = {137},

Abstract = {Why are most herbivorous insects so specialized? How do generalists and
   specialists differ ecologically? And what sensory and cognitive
   processes determine which host species an insect recognizes and uses? We
   review sensory cues involved at different stages of interaction with
   host plants and outline a unified scheme of insect-host interaction
   mechanisms. Generalist species may be best understood as specialized
   organisms with a longer tail of secondary host species that they accept
   to a lessening extent. Secondary hosts have fewer attractive cues, and
   hence a lower probability of meeting the stimulation threshold required
   for egg laying. We then discuss the alternative theories of co-evolution
   and sequential evolution used to explain the diversification of insect
   herbivores. We conclude that `escape and radiate' co-evolution rests on
   unrealistic assumptions and empirical evidence favours sequential
   evolution of plants and herbivores, and the unique life cycles of insect
   herbivores may sufficiently explain their extreme diversity within the
   animal kingdom. We also outline a new speciation-oriented hypothesis to
   explain why specialists are far more diverse than generalists.
   Generalists tend to have large, contiguous distributions and therefore
   lower speciation rates. Natural selection in novel environments may also
   result in narrowing of the host range more often than broadening,
   further increasing specialist diversity.},

Title = {Biological challenges to conclusions from molecular phylogenies:
   behaviour strongly favours orb web monophyly, contradicting molecular
   analyses},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {This first-ever extensive review of the construction behaviour of orb
   webs, of webs secondarily derived from orbs, and of non-orbs shows that
   the evidence favouring monophyly over convergent evolution of orbs is
   stronger than previously appreciated. The two major orb-weaving groups,
   Uloboridae and Araneoidea, share 31 construction behaviour traits, 20 of
   which are likely to be both derived and to have feasible alternatives,
   making convergence an unlikely explanation. Convergence in two lineages
   seems unlikely, and convergence in five different lineages, as proposed
   in some recent molecular studies of phylogeny, is even less credible. A
   further set of seven shared responses in orb design to experimentally
   constrained spaces also supports orb monophyly. Finally, a `control'
   case of confirmed convergence on similar `pseudo-orbs' in a
   taxonomically distant group also supports this argument, as it shows a
   low frequency of behavioural similarities. I argue that the omission of
   behavioural data from recent molecular studies of orb web evolution
   represents a failure of the analytic techniques, not the data, and
   increases the risk of making mistakes. In general, phylogenetic studies
   that aim to understand the evolution of particular phenotypes can
   benefit from including careful study of the phenotypes themselves.},

Title = {Parameters of the adhesive setae and setal fields of the Jamaican

Abstract = {The subdigital adhesive pads of Caribbean Anolis lizards are considered
   to be a key innovation that permits occupation of novel ecological
   niches. Although previous work has demonstrated that subdigital pad
   morphology and performance vary with habitat use, such investigations
   have only considered the macroscale aspects of these structures (e.g.
   pad area). The morphological agents of attachment, however, are arrays
   of hair-like fibres (setae) that terminate in an expanded tip (spatula)
   and have not been examined in a similar manner. Here we examine the
   setal morphology and setal field configuration of ecologically distinct
   species of the monophyletic Jamaican Anolis radiation from a functional
   and ecological perspective. We find that anoles occupying the highest
   perches possess greater setal densities and smaller spatulae than those
   exploiting lower perches. This finding is consistent with the concept of
   contact splitting, whereby subdivision of an adhesive area into smaller
   and more densely packed fibres results in an increase in adhesive
   performance. Micromorphological evidence also suggests that the
   biomechanics of adhesive locomotion may vary between Anolis ecomorphs.
   Our findings indicate that, in a similar fashion to macroscale features
   of the subdigital pad, its microstructure may vary in relation to
   performance and habitat use in Caribbean Anolis.},

Volume = {136},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The Patagonian rainforest has environmental conditions that may have
   been appropriate for the evolution of different reproductive strategies
   in anurans. Despite its low species richness, the endemic family
   Batrachylidae has a wide diversity of reproductive modes. All species
   have exotrophic tadpoles, but oviposition sites may vary from
   lakes/ponds to the forest floor and tree holes. Here we study the
   embryonic development of five species to explore the morphological
   diversity and heterochronic shifts related to aquatic vs. terrestrial
   development. The main differences concern the length of the
   intracapsular period, morphology at tailbud stage, and gut and hind-limb
   development. Terrestrial embryos of Batrachyla have some peculiar
   features also reported in species with endotrophic development, such as
   yolk-rich eggs, poorly developed gills, precocious development of hind
   limbs and delayed gut coiling. Furthermore, observations on embryos
   releasing from the jelly layers with the vitelline membrane intact plus
   the likely absence of hatching gland cells at hatching stages make it
   likely that differences can occur in the hatching mechanism. Our results
   highlight that batrachylids and other neoaustraranans offer an excellent
   opportunity to investigate the evolution and diversity of reproductive
   and developmental strategies divergent from aquatic/exotrophic
   development.},

Title = {Teleonomy as a problem of self-causation},

Abstract = {A theoretical framework is provided to explore teleonomy as a problem of
   self-causation, distinct from upward, downward and reticulate causation.
   Causality theories in biology are often formulated within hierarchy
   theories, where causation is conceptualized as running up or down the
   rungs of a ladder-like hierarchy or, more recently, as moving between
   multiple hierarchies. Research on the genealogy of cosmologies
   demonstrates that in addition to hierarchy theories, causality theories
   also depend upon ideas of time. This paper explores the roots and impact
   of both time and hierarchy thinking on causal reasoning in the
   evolutionary sciences. Within evolutionary biology, the Neodarwinian
   synthesis adheres to a linear notion of time associated with linear
   hierarchies that portray upward causation. Eco-evo-devo schools
   recognize the importance of downward causation and consequently receive
   resistance from the standard view because downward causation is
   sometimes understood as backward causation, considered impossible by
   adherents of a linear time model. In contrast, downward causation works
   with a spatial or presential time notion. Hybridization, lateral gene
   transfer, infective heredity, symbiosis and symbiogenesis require
   recognition of reticulate causation occurring in both space and time, or
   spacetime, between distinct and interacting ontological hierarchies.
   Teleonomy is distinct from these types of causation because it invokes
   the problem of self-causation. By asking how the focal level in a
   hierarchy can persist through time, self-causation raises philosophical
   concerns on the nature of duration, identity and individuality.},

Abstract = {A meeting of the Linnean Society of London held on the evening of 1 July
   1858 is famous for being the occasion of the first public announcement
   of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. This declaration was completed
   by publication of On the Origin of Species in the following year. The
   present analysis rebuffs this interpretation, in that the material read
   and subsequently published did not promote a theory of evolution, let
   alone the Origin theory. It did promote natural selection, a theory of
   organic change; however, a theory of evolution requires, in addition, a
   theory of how both the organic and physical components of the world
   behave and interact (i.e. a world-view theory). A first announcement of
   a theory of evolution also requires some promotion of the likelihood
   that new species will result. The Origin world view and species
   transmutation as an outcome are both largely absent from the
   contributions. Hence, Bell's much maligned Presidential address might
   need re-assessment. Curiously, the published title almost denies species
   transmutation. The present paper undertakes detailed inspection of this
   meeting; it supports a re-assessment of its customary interpretation in
   the history of biological science.},

Abstract = {As dominant features of most ecosystems, insects are responsive to
   changes in climate, both over short temporal scales (e.g. seasonal
   fluctuations in abundance) and over longer evolutionary scales (e.g.
   decade-scale changes in patterns of biodiversity). One such taxonomic
   group that is sensitive to changing climate are the craneflies (Diptera:
   Tipulidae). Here, we used aggregated biodiversity data to examine
   elevational and latitudinal distributions of adult Tipulidae between
   1976 and 2019 in Wales, UK, and we related these distributions to
   climatic patterns. Our analyses showed that species with
   earlier-emerging adults were most affected by weather conditions in the
   year before observation. Specifically, as temperature increased,
   observed elevation increased in high-precipitation conditions, remained
   stable in average-precipitation conditions and decreased in
   low-precipitation conditions. For species with later-emerging adults,
   associations were seen between elevation and weather conditions in the
   year of observation. Observed latitude generally exhibited a negative
   association with maximum temperature in the year before observation,
   with observations of Tipulidae trending southwards during the 43-year
   study period. Our results support consideration of emergence phenology,
   weather and habitat data when predicting species distributional changes
   attributable to climate change, which is vital in understanding the
   selection pressures that species face in a changing environment.},

Abstract = {Genome change does not occur accidentally. The conventional Modern
   Synthesis view of gradual evolution guided solely by natural selection
   fails to incorporate many important lessons from direct examination of
   genome structure by cytogeneticists and modern genomic sequencers. Among
   other discoveries is the major role that interspecific hybridization has
   played in the rapid generation of new species. Interspecific hybrids
   display altered epigenetic regulation and genome expression, great
   genome variability (including activation of transposable elements and
   chromosome rearrangements), and frequently whole genome duplication
   (WGD) as well. These changes produce novel species with adaptively
   altered phenotypes and reproductive isolation due to meiotic
   incompatibility with the progenitor species. Genomics has revealed that
   hybrid speciation and WGD have been widespread among all types of
   eukaryotes, from yeast and diatoms to flowering plants and primates. The
   maintenance of the biological responses to interspecific hybridization
   across virtually all eukaryotic history indicates that eukaryotes have
   continuously inheritted a capability for rapid evolutionary change. In
   other words, the best-documented path to the origin of species we have
   is an inherited biological process, not a series of accidents.},

Title = {Male mating choices: The drive behind menopause?},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {126-135},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When we examine the life history of humans against our closest primate
   relatives, the other great apes, there is notably a greater longevity in
   humans which includes a distinctive postmenopausal life stage, leading
   to the question, ``How did human females evolve to have old-age
   infertility?{''}In their paper ``Mate choice and the origin of
   menopause{''}(Morton et al., 2013), Morton et al. developed an
   agentbased model (ABM) to investigate the novel hypothesis that
   ancestral male mating choices, particularly forgoing mating with older
   females, were the driving force behind the evolution of menopause. From
   their model, they concluded that indeed male preference for young female
   mates could have driven females to lose fertility at older ages through
   deleterious mutations, leading to menopause. In this work, we revisit
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis by formulating an analogous
   mathematical model using a system of ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs). We first show that our ODE model recreates the qualitative
   behaviour and hence conclusions of key scenarios in Morton et al.
   (2013). However, since our ODE system is less computationally demanding
   than their ABM, we also conduct a broader sensitivity analysis over a
   range of parameters and differing initial conditions to analyse the
   dependence on their conclusions to underlying assumptions. Our results
   challenge those of Morton et al. as we find that even the slightest
   deviation from an exclusive mating preference for younger females would
   counteract the evolution of menopause. Consequently, we propose that
   their male-mate-choice hypothesis is incomplete and needs further
   explanation of how a male strategy to exclusively mate with young
   females could have arisen in our common ancestors and remained
   evolutionarily stable for long enough to drive the evolution of old-age
   female infertility. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Immunoecology of Species with Alternative Reproductive Tactics and
   Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to
   polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual
   two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that
   have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition.
   Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental,
   behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the
   balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being
   immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic
   of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative
   morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex per se from other
   factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first
   summarize the evolution, development, and maintenance of ARTS. We then
   review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS,
   dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological
   hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in
   detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS.
   Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of
   studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working
   with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless
   forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the
   hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has
   generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest
   level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general
   guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated
   predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but
   perhaps they should take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as
   ``immunocompetence{''} and ``androgens{''} might be useful to develop a
   rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated.
   Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving
   deeper into physiology, sometimes at the cost of ignoring their
   organisms' evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful
   framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting
   immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that
   depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being
   increasingly recognized and sometimes applied to species with ARTS, but
   we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the
   effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Leonardo Fea, an Italian explorer and traveler, sampled a comprehensive
   collection of continental Mollusca during his travels throughout the
   former British Burma (currently Myanmar) in 1885-1887. Cesare Maria
   Tapparone-Canefri, an Italian malacologist, studied this sample and
   published a paper with a description of numerous terrestrial and
   freshwater molluscan taxa new to science. This collection was partly
   deposited in the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova (MSNG), Italy
   and the Indian Museum (ZSI: Zoological Survey of India) in Kolkata.
   Here, we provide a re-analysis of C.M. Tapparone-Canefri's Burmese
   Unionidae collection. Our study reveals that the type series of only
   four nominal taxa described by Tapparone-Canefri as new to science in
   1889 are still available in the MSNG, i.e. Unio rectangularis, U.
   pulcher, U. protensus var. obtusatus, and U. marginalis var.
   subflabellata. The first taxon is a valid species belonging to the genus
   Yaukthwa, while U. pulcher and U. protensus var. obtusatus are
   considered here as junior synonyms of the widespread Lamellidens
   generosus, and the last nominal taxon corresponds to L. savadiensis. The
   MSNG collection also contains shell lots of Indochinella pugio pugio, I.
   pugio paradoxa, Indonaia andersoniana, Radiatula chaudhurii, R. mouhoti
   haungthayawensis, Lamellidens savadiensis, L. generosus, Yaukthwa
   nesemanni, and Y. zayleymanensis, most of which were listed in
   Tapparone-Canefri's work under incorrect names. We revise all the
   freshwater mussel taxa listed by Tapparone-Canefri based on the original
   descriptions, available DNA sequences, morphological data, and
   biogeographic evidence. A freshwater mussel from the Haungthayaw River
   that was identified by Tapparone-Canefri as Unio exolescens is described
   here as Trapezoideus mitanensis sp. nov., a fourth species in this small
   Contradentini genus with a restricted range. Finally, new taxonomic
   opinions are proposed here for Leoparreysia tavoyensis, Trapezidens
   dolichorhynchus, Lamellidens generosus, and Lamellidens savadiensis.},

Volume = {148},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of individual admixture (IA) assumes that the genome of
   individuals is composed of alleles inherited from K ancestral
   populations. Each copy of each allele has the same chance qk to
   originate from population k, and together with the allele frequencies p
   in all populations at all M markers, comprises the admixture model.
   Here, we assume a supervised scheme, i.e. allele frequencies p are given
   through a reference database of size N, and q is estimated via maximum
   likelihood for a single sample. We study laws of large numbers and
   central limit theorems describing effects of finiteness of both, M and
   N, on the estimate of q. We recall results for the effect of finite M,
   and provide a central limit theorem for the effect of finite N,
   introduce a new way to express the uncertainty in estimates in standard
   barplots, give simulation results, and discuss applications in forensic
   genetics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Limiting distribution of X-chromosomal coalescence times under
   first-cousin consanguineous mating},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {By providing additional opportunities for coalescence within families,
   the presence of consanguineous unions in a population reduces
   coalescence times relative to non-consanguineous populations.
   First-cousin consanguinity can take one of six forms differing in the
   configuration of sexes in the pedigree of the male and female cousins
   who join in a consanguineous union: patrilateral parallel, patrilateral
   cross, matrilateral parallel, matrilateral cross, bilateral parallel,
   and bilateral cross. Considering populations with each of the six types
   of first-cousin consanguinity individually and a population with a
   mixture of the four unilateral types, we examine coalescent models of
   consanguinity. We previously computed, for first-cousin consanguinity
   models, the mean coalescence time for X-chromosomal loci and the
   limiting distribution of coalescence times for autosomal loci. Here, we
   use the separation-of-time-scales approach to obtain the limiting
   distribution of coalescence times for X-chromosomal loci. This limiting
   distribution has an instantaneous coalescence probability that depends
   on the probability that a union is consanguineous; lineages that do not
   coalesce instantaneously coalesce according to an exponential
   distribution. We study the effects on the coalescence time distribution
   of the type of first-cousin consanguinity, showing that
   patrilateral-parallel and patrilateral-cross consanguinity have no
   effect on X-chromosomal coalescence time distributions and that
   matrilateral-parallel consanguinity decreases coalescence times to a
   greater extent than does matrilateral-cross consanguinity. (C) 2022

Abstract = {Mass flowering (masting) has been hypothesized to be an adaptive
   strategy to satiate florivores/granivores. However, few studies have
   corroborated this by examining seed predation in multiple flowering
   patches of varying sizes across a wide geographical range over multiple
   years. Moreover, the trophic consequences of masting for the parasitoids
   of florivores/granivores and their feedback effects are poorly
   understood. Here, we used the nationwide masting of two bamboo species,
   Sasamorpha borealis var. borealis and Phyllostachys nigra var. henonis,
   in Japan and compared florivory and seed sets in multiple flowering
   patches during the masting year and the following sporadic flowering
   years. We found lower florivory damage in both bamboo species and higher
   seed set for Sasamorpha borealis var. borealis in patches with massive
   and spatiotemporally isolated flowering. Additionally, the relative
   level of parasitism of florivores increased considerably in the sporadic
   flowering year, particularly in large flowering patches of Sasamorpha
   borealis var. borealis. Our results indicate the importance of
   spatiotemporal isolation during masting for satiating two dipteran
   florivores and suggest that parasitoids might rapidly suppress the
   extent of florivory in the sporadic flowering years after masting.
   Collectively, our study highlights the importance of considering
   multi-trophic consequences in understanding the adaptive significance of
   masting.},

Abstract = {Avian obligate brood parasites and their hosts exhibit coevolution,
   where parasites respond to the evolution of host defences with
   counter-adaptations, such as egg mimicry, which can then lead to the
   evolution of more efficient host defences. Using objective measurements
   and avian visual modelling, we quantified the degree of similarity
   between the eggs of the channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops
   novaehollandiae) and the eggs of three host species from the hosts'
   visual perspective. We found no evidence that this cuckoo species has
   host-specific egg types, but it does appear to mimic one of its primary
   hosts, the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), in both colour and
   pattern. Currawongs showed significantly higher interclutch variation in
   colour and luminance than the other two hosts and had significantly
   lower intraclutch variation in pattern than interclutch variation. High
   interclutch and low intraclutch variation in a host could make it more
   difficult for a cuckoo to match closely any particular host clutch,
   potentially allowing a host to detect a parasitic egg more easily. This
   is the first empirical study using objective measurements to quantify
   the degree of egg mimicry in the channel-billed cuckoo and the results
   suggest a potential host defence to egg mimicry that merits further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {Neo-Darwinian biology has demonstrated that it is possible to construct
   a theory of life that excludes the role of organisms' free choice. In a
   richer theory, the latter as a possibility needs to be taken into
   account. For that purpose, it is necessary to introduce the biological
   concept of choice, analyse its structure and roles, and consider some
   implications for biological theory. It is argued here that the
   conditions for free choice emerge together with umwelt-the space of
   synchronous options. Basically, choice does not require purpose. This
   leads to the conclusion that freedom is an attribute of life.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {139},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {370-387},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {This paper attempts to clarify the notion of goal-directedness, which is
   often misunderstood as being inconsistent with standard causal
   mechanisms. We first note that goal-directedness does not presuppose any
   mysterious forces, such as intelligent design, vitalism, conscious
   intention or backward causation. We then review attempts at defining
   goal-directedness by means of more operational characteristics:
   equifinality, plasticity, persistence, concerted action and negative
   feedback. We show that all these features can be explained by
   interpreting a goal as a far-from-equilibrium attractor of a dynamical
   system. This implies that perturbations that make the system deviate
   from its goal-directed trajectory are automatically compensated-at least
   as long as the system stays within the same basin of attraction. We
   argue that attractors and basins with the necessary degree of resilience
   tend to self-organize in complex reaction networks, thus producing
   self-maintaining `organizations'. These can be seen as an abstract model
   of the first goal-directed systems, and thus of the origin of life.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of the average effect of an allele pervades much of
   evolutionary population genetics. In this context the average effect of
   an allele is often considered as the main component of the ``fitness''
   of that allele. It is widely believed that, if this fitness component
   for an allele is positive, then the frequency of this allele will
   increase, at least for one generation in discrete-time models. In this
   note we show that this is not necessarily the case since the average
   effect of an allele on fitness may be different from its marginal
   additive fitness even in a one-locus setting in non-random-mating
   populations. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Numerous traits under migration-selection balance are shown to exhibit
   complex patterns of genetic architecture with large variance in effect
   sizes. However, the conditions under which such genetic architectures
   are stable have yet to be investigated, because studying the influence
   of a large number of small allelic effects on the maintenance of spatial
   polymorphism is mathematically challenging, due to the high complexity
   of the systems that arise. In particular, in the most simple case of a
   haploid population in a two-patch environment, while it is known from
   population genetics that polymorphism at a single major-effect locus is
   stable in the symmetric case, there exist no analytical predictions on
   how this polymorphism holds when a polygenic background also contributes
   to the trait. Here we propose to answer this question by introducing a
   new eco-evo methodology that allows us to take into account the combined
   contributions of a major-effect locus and of a quantitative background
   resulting from small-effect loci, where inheritance is encoded according
   to an extension to the infinitesimal model. In a regime of small
   variance contributed by the quantitative loci, we justify that traits
   are concentrated around the major alleles, according to a normal
   distribution, using new convex analysis arguments. This allows a
   reduction in the complexity of the system using a separation of time
   scales approach. We predict an undocumented phenomenon of loss of
   polymorphism at the major-effect locus despite strong selection for
   local adaptation, because the quantitative background slowly disrupts
   the rapidly established polymorphism at the major-effect locus, which is
   confirmed by individual-based simulations. Our study highlights how
   segregation of a quantitative background can greatly impact the dynamics
   of major-effect loci by provoking migrational meltdowns. We also provide
   a comprehensive toolbox designed to describe how to apply our method to
   more complex population genetic models.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ancestral state reconstruction is one of the most important tasks in
   evolutionary biology. Conditions under which we can reliably reconstruct
   the ancestral state have been studied for both discrete and continuous
   traits. However, the connection between these results is unclear, and it
   seems that each model needs different conditions. In this work, we
   provide a unifying theory on the consistency of ancestral state
   reconstruction for various types of trait evolution models. Notably, we
   show that for a sequence of nested trees with bounded heights, the
   necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a consistent
   ancestral state reconstruction method under discrete models, the
   Brownian motion model, and the threshold model are equivalent. When tree
   heights are unbounded, we provide a simple counter-example to show that
   this equivalence is no longer valid.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Success-biased social learning in a one-consumer, two-resource model},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {29-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Previous analyses have predicted that social learning should not evolve
   in a predator-prey system. Here we examine whether success-biased social
   learning, by which social learners copy successful demonstrators, allows
   social learning by foragers to evolve. We construct a one-predator,
   two-prey system in which foragers must learn how to feed on depletable
   prey populations in an environment where foraging information can be
   difficult to obtain individually. We analyze two models in which social
   learning is success-biased: in the first, individual learning does not
   depend on the resource dynamics, and in the second model it depends on
   the relative frequency of the resource. Unlike previous results, we find
   that social learning does not cause predators to over-harvest one type
   of prey over the other. Furthermore, increasing the probability of
   social learning increases the probability of learning a successful
   foraging behavior, especially when individually learned information
   tends to be inaccurate. Whereas social learning does not evolve among
   individual learners in the first model, the assumption of
   resource-dependent learning in the second model allows a mutant with an
   increased probability of social learning to spread through the forager
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Title = {Gene drives and population persistence vs elimination: The impact of
   spatial structure and inbreeding at low density},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {109-125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease
   vectors, invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed
   random mating population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to
   eliminate a target population, but it is not clear whether the same is
   true when spatial processes play a role. In species with an appropriate
   biology it is possible that drive-induced reductions in density might
   lead to increased inbreeding, reducing the efficacy of drive, eventually
   leading to suppression rather than elimination, regardless of how strong
   the drive is. To investigate this question we analyse a series of
   explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range of scenarios
   for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and
   analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y
   chromosome and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find
   in all cases a sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the
   population will be eliminated, except in the one life history scenario
   (reproduction and mating in patches followed by dispersal) where low
   density leads to increased inbreeding, in which case the population
   persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable equilibrium or a limit
   cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have reduced mating
   success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer sisters to
   mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a
   homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive,
   if there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be
   rescued by inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the
   potentially critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and
   inbreeding depression (and, by extension, other sources of Allee
   effects) can have on the eventual impact of a gene drive on a target
   population. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Theoretical analysis of principal components in an umbrella model of
   intraspecific evolution},
Journal = {THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {11-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most frequently-used
   approach to describe population structure from multilocus genotype data.
   Regarding geographic range expansions of modern humans, interpretations
   of PCA have, however, been questioned, as there is uncertainty about the
   wave-like patterns that have been observed in principal components. It
   has indeed been argued that wave-like patterns are mathematical
   artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to data in which
   genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. Here, we
   present an alternative theory for the observation of wave-like patterns
   in PCA. We study a coalescent model - the umbrella model - for the
   diffusion of genetic variants. The model is based on genetic drift
   without any particular geographical structure. In the umbrella model,
   splits from an ancestral population occur almost continuously in time,
   giving birth to small daughter populations at a regular pace. Our
   results provide detailed mathematical descriptions of eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors for the PCA of sampled genomic sequences under the model.
   When variants uniquely represented in the sample are removed, the PCA
   eigenvectors are defined as cosine functions of increasing periodicity,
   reproducing wave-like patterns observed in equilibrium
   isolation-by-distance models. Including singleton variants in the
   analysis, the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
   exhibit complex wave shapes. The accuracy of our predictions is further
   investigated with coalescent simulations. Our analysis supports the
   hypothesis that highly structured wave-like patterns could arise from
   genetic drift only, and may not always be artificial outcomes of
   spatially structured data. Genomic data related to the peopling of the
   Americas are reanalyzed in the light of our new theory. (c) 2022 The

Abstract = {The Gini coefficient of the life table is a concentration index that
   provides information on lifespan variation. Originally proposed by
   economists to measure income and wealth inequalities, it has been widely
   used in population studies to investigate variation in ages at death. We
   focus on the complement of the Gini coefficient, Drewnowski's index,
   which is a measure of equality. We study its mathematical properties and
   analyze how changes over time relate to changes in life expectancy.
   Further, we identify the threshold age below which mortality
   improvements are translated into decreasing lifespan variation and above
   which these improvements translate into increasing lifespan inequality.
   We illustrate our theoretical findings simulating scenarios of mortality
   improvement in the Gompertz model, and showing an example of application
   to Swedish life table data. Our experiments demonstrate how Drewnowski's
   index can serve as an indicator of the shape of mortality patterns.
   These properties, along with our analytical findings, support studying
   lifespan variation alongside life expectancy trends in multiple
   species.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Title = {Phylogeography and Wolbachia Infections Reveal Postglacial

Abstract = {To reveal the phylogeographic pattern of the parthenogenetic psyllid
   Cacopsylla myrtilli (W. Wagner 1947) (Hemiptera, Psylloidea), we
   sequenced a 638 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene from 962
   individuals. These insects originated from 46 sampling sites, which
   cover a significant part of the northern Palearctic distribution range
   of the species. The sequence data revealed 40 haplotypes, with three
   main (H1, H2, and H3) and 37 derived ones. The main haplotypes H1 or H2
   or both were present at all sampling sites. The star-like shape of the
   haplotype networks indicated recent population expansion. In most cases,
   the derived haplotypes were specific for each country, suggesting that
   the main haplotypes H1 and H2 are of refugial origin, and the derived
   haplotypes have emerged after the postglacial recolonization process.
   Based on the haplotype sequences, we suggest H3 to represent the
   ancestral haplotype from which H1 and H2 have evolved. We suggest that
   the main haplotype H3 together with its derived haplotypes represents
   bisexual C. myrtilli, which shows a limited distribution on both sides
   of the border between Finland and Russia in northern Fennoscandia. The
   genetic diversity was the highest in Sjoa in southern Norway and also
   high in the White Sea region in northwest Russia. Higher diversity in
   Sjoa was attributed to both earlier recolonizations compared to that of
   the White Sea region and the absence of Wolbachia infection. We suggest
   that these sites were colonized from different Pleistocene refugia,
   i.e., from western and eastern refugia, respectively. From the White Sea
   region, recolonization continued eastwards to Ural Mountains and
   westwards to Finland and further north to Kola Peninsula. From northern
   Finland, recolonization continued to Finnmark, Norway, and further to
   Sweden and finally reached a secondary contact zone with colonizers from
   Norway in Central Sweden. The Caucasus and Siberian/Manchurian refugial
   regions have played an important role in the origin of C. myrtilli
   populations in Siberia and the Russian Far East.},

Abstract = {Skeletal pneumaticity implies bone invasion via air sacs that are
   diverticula of the respiratory system. Among extant vertebrates, this
   feature is found only in birds, and in extinct taxa it occurs in
   saurischian dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The sauropod axial skeleton is
   characterized by having a complex architecture of laminae and fossae
   that have usually been related to some degree of pneumaticity. We
   examined the external anatomy of the presacral vertebrae of two
   dicraeosaurid sauropods holotype specimens, Amargasaurus cazaui and
   Brachytrachelopan mesai, and obtained computed tomography scan images
   from mid- and posterior cervical vertebrae of both specimens and an
   anterior dorsal vertebra of Brachytrachelopan. In all cases, we
   recognized a `procamerate' internal pneumatization pattern, confirming
   previous hypotheses that dicraeosaurid vertebral pneumaticity is reduced
   relative to other eusauropod taxa. Thus, pneumatic diverticula were
   present in Amargasaurus, Brachytrachelopan, Dicraeosaurus, Pilmatueia
   and, possibly, other dicraeosaurid sauropods, but these diverticula did
   not invade their presacral vertebrae extensively. Furthermore, we found
   that the more pneumatic dicraeosaurid taxa, with some exceptions, occupy
   a basal position within Dicraeosauridae. There is some variability in
   pneumaticity among dicraeosaurids from Gondwana, with Pilmatueia
   achieving the highest degree of pneumatization.},

Title = {Cystic Echinococcosis: An Impact Assessment of Prevention Programs in
   Endemic Developing Countries in Africa, Central Asia, and South America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background. Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the tapeworm species,
   Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1), is one of many primary
   neglected zoonoses worldwide. Within endemic developing countries, CE
   has multiple effects on animal and human health and well-being. To
   address such effects, veterinary and human medical sector collaboration
   on prevention program delivery is essential. To begin preliminary
   evaluations of county specific prevention programs, a critically
   appraised topic (CAT) was conducted. It sought to answer: What impact do
   CE prevention programs have on human and animal disease prevalence, in
   populations living in endemic developing countries within Africa,
   Central Asia, and South America? Methodology. The aim was to assess the
   ability of prevention and control program outputs to produce measurable
   differences in health, social, and economic outcomes (e.g., improved
   access to medical services, positive behavioral change, or reduced
   treatment costs, respectively). Included articles were obtained using
   predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria from the four databases (CAB
   Abstracts and Global Health; the National Library of Medicine (PubMed);
   ScienceDirect; and WHO Institutional Repository of Information Sharing
   (IRIS)). The articles were appraised using three checklists: the Royal
   College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the Critical Appraisals Skills
   Programme (CASP), and the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Results.
   Ten articles were selected. Geographically, 20\% of studies were
   conducted in South America, 30\% in Africa, and 50\% in Central Asia.
   For definitive hosts, dogs, CoproELISA antigen testing, before and after
   Praziquantel (PZQ) de-worming, was a primary focus. For humans, who are
   intermediate hosts (IH), disease surveillance methods, namely ultrasound
   (US), were commonly assessed. Whilst for sheep, also acting as IH,
   disease prevention methods, such as the EG95 livestock vaccine and
   de-worming farm dogs, were evaluated. Common to all studies were issues
   of program sustainability, in terms of regular human US screening, dog
   de-worming, and annual sheep vaccination. This was attributed to
   transient and remote human or animal populations; limited access to
   adequate roads or hospitals; few skilled health workers or
   veterinarians; an over-reliance on communities to administer
   preventatives; and limited resources. Conclusion. Despite variations in
   result validity and collection periods, useful comparisons of CE endemic
   countries produced key research and program recommendations. Future
   research recommendations included testing the significance of multiple
   program outcomes in relation to prevalence (e.g., the social outcome:
   behavioral change), further research on the impact of livestock
   vaccinations, and the CE transmission role of waterways and sanitation.
   Program recommendations included calculating and distinguishing between
   stray versus owned dog populations; formal representation of internal
   and external stakeholder interests through institutional organization;
   establishing sustainable guidelines around the frequency of PZQ and
   vaccination administration; improved veterinary-human medical training
   and resource sharing; and combined prevention methods and multiple
   canine disease management.},

Abstract = {Noctiluca scintillans (Macartney) Kofoid and Swezy, 1921 contributes
   similar to 85\% of the total biomass of heterotrophic plankton in
   Crimean coastal waters. Data for the retrospective analysis come from a
   20-year sampling (in 2000s) across the Crimean shelf and in adjacent
   open sea waters. Samples were collected onboard research vessels, in the
   upper 150 m layer, by Juday nets (vertical hauls) fitted with 145 mu m
   mesh. These data were compared to field surveys of the 1960s. Seasonal
   blooms of Noctiluca were pronounced during summer time, with the peak of
   abundance in June. The mesoscale spatial distribution of Noctiluca
   abundance was most heterogeneous in June as well. The annual
   concentration of cells in coastal waters exceeded that of the open sea
   by four times. The coefficient of Noctiluca seasonal abundance variation
   in coastal waters was 1.5 times higher than that of the open sea. The
   Principal Component Analysis implied that the seasonal variation of the
   Noctiluca abundance offshore was modulated by coupling of the
   atmospheric precipitation, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically
   active radiation, euphotic depth, chlorophyll- a concentration,
   Noctiluca abundance in coastal waters, mesoscale eddies and wind stress.
   A general decline of Noctiluca abundance and biomass was observed in
   coastal waters, from the 1960s to the present.},

Abstract = {Gregor Mendel is generally presented as the `ignored and solitary
   founder of genetics'. This Moravian friar would have worked in strict
   isolation on the heredity of peas in the garden of his monastery, and
   his experiments would have been ignored by his contemporaries, before
   being `rediscovered' independently by three botanists in 1900, 34 years
   after their publication. Historians have contributed to replace the
   genesis of Mendel's work in the context of his time, questioning the
   mythical image that prevailed in academic circles and the public
   perception. This paper recalls that Mendel benefitted from a very
   favourable context for the development of his experiments at St Thomas
   Monastery in Brno and was not isolated from the scientific community of
   his time. Although the notions on which his work was based were already
   present in scientific publications, this does not diminish the
   importance of Mendel's contribution to the development of modern
   biology. We provide a detailed analysis of the results of his
   experiments on the development of hybrid plants that he presented in two
   lectures at the Brno Society of Natural History in 1865, demonstrating
   that beyond his major contribution to the foundation of genetics, Mendel
   was one of the pioneers of systems biology.},

Abstract = {Shape morph-specific studies in hippolytid shrimps revealed significant
   results on their ecomorphology and evolutionary adaptations. Among the
   species of the genus Hippolyte, only one exhibits an unusual, sharp
   rostral dimorphism and has been used as an animal model for the
   investigation of mechanisms of the morph-specific adaptation: the
   intertidal Hippolyte sapphica. The species is endemic of the
   Central/Eastern Mediterranean basin and exhibits morph-A with a long
   dentate rostrum and morph-B with a short, juvenile-like one. The two
   morphotypes were recently confirmed to be conspecific, while offspring
   and morphological studies showed significant microevolutionary
   adaptations, which balance the disadvantage of the ``rostral loss.{''}
   The present study aims to investigate the effect of such phenotypic
   variation on the reproductive traits of the species. We collected
   ovigerous females of H. sapphica in mixed (morph-A and morph-B) and
   unmixed populations (morph-A) along the species geographical range. We
   measured seven morphometric and maternal investment traits: carapace
   length, fecundity, embryo volume, egg density, female dry weight, brood
   dry weight, and reproductive output. Our results showed that ovigerous
   females were bigger in morph-A than in morph-B, whereas fecundity did
   not show any significant differences between the two morphotypes. High
   egg volume might be attributed to the latitudinal differences of our
   sampling sites compared to congenerics. Interestingly, the reproductive
   output was found to be bigger in morph-A specimens, suggesting that the
   maternal energy investment is selectively determined from the rostral
   presence/absence and the morphotype's higher viability in the species
   populations.},

Abstract = {Discrepancies in geographic variation patterns between nuclear DNA and
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are the result of the complicated
   differentiation processes in organisms and are the key to understanding
   their true evolutionary processes. The genetic differentiation of the
   northern and Southern-Izu lineages of the Japanese newt, Cynops
   pyrrhogaster, was investigated through their single nucleotide
   polymorphism variations obtained via multiplexed ISSR genotyping by
   sequencing (MIG-seq). We found three genetic groups (Tohoku, N-Kanto and
   S-Kanto), that were not detected by mtDNA variations, in the northern
   lineage. N-Kanto has intermediate genetic characteristics between Tohoku
   and S-Kanto. The genetic groups are now moderately isolated from each
   other and have unique genetic characteristics. An estimation of the
   evolutionary history using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
   approach suggested that Tohoku diverged from the common ancestor of
   S-Kanto and S-Izu. Then, S-Kanto and S-Izu split, and the recent
   hybridization between Tohoku and S-Kanto gave rise to N-Kanto. The
   origin of N-Kanto through the hybridization is relatively young and
   seems to be related to changes in the distributions of Tohoku and
   S-Kanto as a result of climatic oscillation in the Pleistocene. We
   conclude that the mitochondrial genome of S-Kanto was captured in Tohoku
   and that the original mitochondrial genome of Tohoku was entirely
   removed through hybridization.},

Abstract = {The mode of development of marine invertebrates has major effects on
   dispersal and population structure. Species without a feeding larval
   stage (direct developers) are generally more genetically subdivided than
   species with planktotrophic (swimming and feeding) development. Evidence
   of the re-evolution of planktotrophy from a direct-developing ancestor
   has been accumulating within marine invertebrates. However, it remains
   unclear whether such evolutionary transitions are rare or common. The
   Bembicium genus (Gastropoda: Littorinidae) provides an additional
   opportunity to examine the re-evolution of planktotrophy. The genus
   includes two species with planktotrophic development (Bembicium auratum
   and Bembicium nanum) and three species with direct development
   (Bembicium vittatum, Bembicium melanostoma and Bembicium flavescens).
   Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of two mitochondrial markers
   (COI and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear marker (ANT) provide evidence for a
   switch from direct development back to planktotrophy. Also, pairwise
   genetic distances between haplotypes reveal that the two planktotrophic
   species have greater genetic diversity (at the species level) than the
   direct developers, and the three direct-developing species are
   genetically structured based on geographical distance. Our study adds to
   growing evidence for the re-evolution of planktotrophy and suggests that
   the genetic basis for a switch between modes of development might be
   simple in marine snails.},

Abstract = {Life is purposefully creative in a continuous process of maintaining
   integrity; it adapts to counteract change. This is an ongoing, iterative
   process. Its actions are essentially directed to this purpose. Life
   exists to exist. Physiology is the study of purposeful living function.
   Function necessarily implies purpose. This was accepted all the way from
   William Harvey in the 17(th) century, who identified the purpose of the
   heart to pump blood and so feed the organs and tissues of the body,
   through many 19(th) and early 20(th) century examples. But late 20(th)
   century physiology was obliged to hide these ideas in shame. Teleology
   became the `lady who no physiologist could do without, but who could not
   be acknowledged in public.' This emasculation of the discipline
   accelerated once the Central Dogma of molecular biology was formulated,
   and once physiology had become sidelined as concerned only with the
   disposable vehicle of evolution. This development has to be reversed.
   Even on the practical criterion of relevance to health care,
   gene-centrism has been a disaster, since prediction from elements to the
   whole system only rarely succeeds, whereas identifying whole system
   functions invariably makes testable predictions at an elemental level.},

Abstract = {Our main goal was to investigate the phylogeography of the butterfly
   Phengaris arion to reveal the evolutionary origin of its `spring' and
   `summer' forms. Molecular analyses based on highly variable
   microsatellites, together with Wolbachia screening, were carried out on
   34 populations in Europe. We found three well-defined genetic lineages
   of different origins: the Apennine, the central and the eastern. The
   highly distinct Apennine lineage is limited by the Alps and evaluated as
   an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Therefore, the taxon name
   ligurica, described from the Ligurian coast (Italy), should not be
   applied to denote the `summer form' of the Pannonian region. The central
   lineage is limited by the Carpathians and the most eastern ranges of the
   Alps, and lacks major range fluctuations related to glaciations,
   although there is evidence for extra-Mediterranean refugia in the
   Carpathian Basin. The eastern clade could have had refugia in central
   Asia. Our results exclude the potential allopatric origin of the
   `spring' and `summer' arion, and support the hypothesis that the
   existence of the two forms could be a result of local adaptation to the
   distinctive phenology of host plant flowering which is manifested in the
   genetic differences between them. Wolbachia infection has been ruled out
   as a driver of sympatric speciation in P. arion.},

Abstract = {The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one
   evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen accidents and selection in
   specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar
   model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular
   collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin
   of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and
   of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in
   regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that
   have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles
   of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras,
   cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved
   and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular
   synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking,
   problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful
   invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin.
   Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial
   distinctions established by past limitations of technology and
   imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture
   facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines.
   Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed
   for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous
   implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.},

Abstract = {The oryzomyine rodent Euryzoryzomys russatus is endemic to the Atlantic
   Forest of South America, where it inhabits mostly pristine humid
   forests. Previous phylogeographical studies performed with limited
   sample sizes indicated that rivers and climatic oscillations might have
   driven the diversification of this species. Here, we used a more
   comprehensive database to revisit the phylogeography and demographic
   history of E. russatus. Our phylogenetic inferences and haplotype
   network recovered four groups within E. russatus, each of which
   diversified between 0.33 and 0.60 Mya. These groups are mostly
   allopatric and are structured latitudinally along the Atlantic Forest.
   We did not detect any genetic break related to the major river
   drainages. Species distribution models recovered similar suitable areas
   for E. russatus in the present and past times, suggesting stability in
   the geographical range during the Pleistocene. The most pronounced
   change was the expansion of suitable areas onto the emerged continental
   shelf during the Last Glacial Maximum. Demographic analyses showed
   evidence of population expansion during periods of lowered seal levels,
   especially for the haplogroup associated with the Serra do Mar forest
   refuge. Therefore, our results failed to support the hypothesis of
   riverine barriers and suggest that the diversification of E. russatus is
   explained better by forest refugial processes.},

Abstract = {Conspicuously coloured signals may evolve via sexual selection to be
   ornaments or armaments, thereby conferring a fitness advantage to their
   bearer. Conversely, conspicuous colours may also evolve under natural
   selection as either aposematic signals or deimatic displays that deter
   attacks from predators. While conspicuous colour patches may evolve for
   one purpose (e.g. quality indicators), they may later be co-opted for
   another (e.g. anti-predator defence). Phrynocephalus mystaceus is a
   cryptic agamid lizard with flaps in both sexes that when folded against
   the head are inconspicuous, but when deployed are predicted to be highly
   conspicuous and to increase the appearance of body size. We tested
   whether head flaps play a role in social signalling via courtship or as
   status signals during contests in both sexes. We also tested whether the
   head flaps have an anti-predator function by simulating predatory
   encounters. Head flaps were never deployed in courtship or during
   contests and, therefore, are unlikely to be under sexual selection.
   However, head flaps and their deployment during simulated predatory
   encounters were consistent with the predictions associated with deimatic
   display theory. First, head flaps were similar in form and function
   between sexes. Second, they were highly conspicuous to both avian and
   snake predators. Third, there was a rapid transition from crypsis to
   conspicuousness when they deployed their head flaps during a late stage
   of predation, the subjugation phase, consistent with an ambush.
   Confirmation of the deimatic display hypothesis will require future
   testing of receiver responses.},

Abstract = {Development determines the range of possible phenotypes that can be
   produced and exposed to selection and has a major role in the
   evolutionary trajectories of species. Nevertheless, development is
   itself subject to evolutionary forces. Here, we describe differences at
   the ontogenetic and population levels in head and limb proportions of
   the invasive gecko Hemidactylus mabouia, to assess the developmental
   mechanisms and extrinsic forces associated with morphological
   diversification during colonization of novel habitats. We have found
   that allometric trajectories of most skeletal traits remain constant
   throughout postnatal development. Linear morphometric analysis did not
   find multivariate differences between ontogenetic stages or sexes. When
   comparing populations, our results showed that the divergence of the
   corresponding external measures was explained by shifts in the intercept
   of static allometry curves, indicating that differences arose early in
   development. Populations aggregated into two morphological groups that
   did not correspond to the groups formed on the basis of genetic
   structure. Using two different approaches, we found support for an
   adaptive hypothesis when comparing observed patterns of morphological
   variation with that expected under neutral evolutionary models.},

Abstract = {Extreme body elongation in fishes is a major evolutionary transformation
   that extends the boundaries of morphological diversity and alters
   aspects of function, behaviour and ecology. Prior studies have
   identified features of the cranial and axial skeleton that characterize
   elongate fishes, but a lack of detailed reconstructions of anatomical
   evolution has limited inferences about factors that underlie major
   shifts in body shape. In this study, we fitted multi-peak adaptive
   (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) evolutionary models to species body shape and
   anatomical dimensions in Pelagiaria, a radiation of open-ocean fishes
   whose species span a continuum from deep bodied to highly elongate. We
   inferred an ancestral fusiform adaptive peak that is retained by several
   major pelagiarian lineages (e.g. Scombridae) and found robust support
   for multiple transitions to deep-bodied optima (in the families
   Stromateidae, Bramidae and Caristiidae) and elongate-bodied optima
   (within Trichiuroidei), including two instances of sequential shifts
   towards increasingly elongate optima that followed distinct paths of
   anatomical evolution. Within Trichiuridae, initial increases in head
   length and the number of vertebrae were followed by changes in head and
   vertebral shape. Within an elongate-bodied subclade of taxa
   traditionally identified as `gempylids', changes in head and vertebral
   shape and in the number of precaudal vertebrae preceded an increase in
   the number of caudal vertebrae. Altogether, this mosaic of anatomical
   peak shifts suggests that body shape transformations were associated
   with differing selective demands and developmental changes.},

Title = {From monocots to dicots: host shifts in Afrotropical derelomine weevils

Abstract = {Weevils from the tribe Derelomini (Curculionidae: Curculioninae) are
   specialized brood pollinators engaged in mutualistic relationships with
   several angiosperm lineages. In brood pollination systems, reproductive
   plant tissues are used for the development of insect larval stages,
   whereas adult insects pollinate their plant hosts as a reward. The
   evolutionary history of derelomines in relationship to their hosts is
   poorly understood and potentially contrasts with other brood pollination
   systems, wherein a pollinator lineage is usually associated with a
   single host plant family. In the case of Afrotropical Derelomini, host
   records indicate a diverse host repertoire consisting of several
   families of monocot and dicot plants. In this study, we investigate
   their phylogenetic relationships, timing of diversification and
   evolution of host use. Our results suggest that derelomine lineages
   started their diversification similar to 40 Mya. Reconstructions of host
   use evolution support an ancestral association with the monocotyledonous
   palm family (Arecaceae), followed by several shifts towards other plant
   families in Afrotropical lineages, especially to dicotyledonous plants
   from the family Ebenaceae (on the genus Euclea L.). Some level of
   phylogenetic conservatism of host use is recovered for the lineages
   associated with either palms or Euclea. Multiple instances of sympatric
   weevil assemblages on the same plant are also unravelled, corresponding
   to either single or independent colonization events. Overall, the
   diversity of hosts colonized and the frequency of sympatric assemblages
   highlighted in non-obligatory plant-derelomine brood pollination systems
   contrast with what is generally expected from plant-insect brood
   pollination systems.},

Abstract = {In many insects, short photoperiods induce females to lay diapausing
   eggs, which are associated with a reduction in female fecundity, and/or
   with an increase in their growth rate, allowing for a larger size at
   adulthood. The effects of short photoperiods may also differ among
   populations, depending on the different selection pressures imposed by
   the winter conditions. Thus, this study aimed to experimentally assess
   the effects of short photoperiods on Aedes aegypti, an invasive mosquito
   species that also vectors several viral diseases. We compared life
   history parameters of the females reared from the first larval instar
   under contrasting photoperiods, in two populations from the temperate
   region of Argentina, one with a milder winter (BA) and the other with a
   harsher winter (SB). The results showed a significant increase in the
   time to oviposition, a trend to a larger size of females (significant
   only for SB) and higher inhibition of egg hatching (more pronounced in
   SB), in response to short photoperiods. No differences in fecundity were
   detected among treatments. The different reaction norms of the
   populations in female body size and egg hatching response suggest an
   adaptation to local conditions, which might favour a further expansion
   of A. aegypti towards colder climates.},

Abstract = {Fritz Muller is known for explaining the evolutionary consequences of
   what is now called Mullerian mimicry, but his scientific contributions
   encompass a wide range of organisms and both ecological and evolutionary
   processes. His originality is seen in aspects as different as the
   discovery of the mutualistic nature of ant-fungus symbiosis, pioneering
   research in evolutionary developmental biology and the first
   mathematical treatment in a Darwinian framework. From his intimate
   knowledge of the natural history of Brazil and original observations of
   morphology and development, Muller provided evidence supporting natural
   selection. From the 20(th) century onwards, however, his scientific
   legacy has been re-examined only for single topics. To celebrate the
   bicentenary of his birth in 2022, this article briefly discusses his
   importance for current ecological and evolutionary knowledge.},

Abstract = {Chan, Durrett, and Lanchier introduced a multitype contact process with
   temporal heterogeneity involving two species competing for space on the
   d-dimensional integer lattice. Time is divided into two seasons. They
   proved that there is an open set of the parameters for which both
   species can coexist when their dispersal range is sufficiently large.
   Numerical simulations suggested that three species can coexist in the
   presence of two seasons. The main point of this paper is to prove that
   this conjecture is incorrect. To do this we prove results for a more
   general ODE model and contrast its behavior with other related systems
   that have been studied in order to understand the competitive exclusion
   principle. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A number of powerful demographic inference methods have been developed
   in recent years, with the goal of fitting rich evolutionary models to
   genetic data obtained from many populations. In this paper we
   investigate the statistical performance of these methods in the specific
   case where there is continuous migration between populations. Compared
   with earlier work, migration significantly complicates the theoretical
   analysis and requires new techniques. We employ the theories of
   phase-type distributions and concentration of measure in order to study
   the two-island and isolation-withmigration models, resulting in both
   upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence for parametric estimators
   in migration models. For the upper bounds, we consider inferring rates
   of coalescent and migration on the basis of directly observing pairwise
   coalescent times, and, more realistically, when (conditionally)
   Poisson-distributed mutations dropped on latent trees are observed. We
   complement these upper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds
   which establish a limit, in terms of sample size, below which inference
   is effectively impossible.},

Title = {The conspicuousness contradiction: brighter males have lower mating

Abstract = {In odonates, male coloration is often more conspicuous than female
   coloration. This difference is frequently attributed to the role of male
   colour in male-male competition to access females. However, there are
   sexually dimorphic odonate species, such as the damselflies Argia
   hasemani and Argia croceipennis, in which male-male interactions are
   much less intense. In these species, it might be that male coloration
   affects male success directly when interacting with females. Therefore,
   we hypothesized that males with more intense coloration present higher
   copulation success. To investigate this hypothesis, we registered which
   males copulated in the field during 4 days and estimated the coloration
   of all observed males in the female visual spectrum. Surprisingly, we
   found that dull males had higher chances of copulation in A. hasemani,
   whereas in A. croceipennis male coloration did not influence the chances
   of copulation. Our data also indicated that brighter males of A.
   hasemani were also more conspicuous to potential avian predators,
   whereas this was not the case in A. croceipennis. We suggest that
   females of A. hasemani might avoid brighter males owing to increased
   risk of predation during copulation.},

Abstract = {Differences between sexes in growth, ecology and behaviour strongly
   shape species biology. In some animal groups, such as spiders, it is
   difficult or impossible to identify the sex of juveniles based on
   external morphology. This information would be useful for field surveys,
   behavioural experiments and ecological studies, such as those on sex
   ratios and dispersal. In species with sex chromosomes, sex can be
   determined based on the specific sex chromosome complement.
   Additionally, information on the sequence of sex chromosomes provides
   the basis for studying sex chromosome evolution. We combined cytogenetic
   and genomic data to identify the sex chromosomes in the sexually
   dimorphic spider Argiope bruennichi and designed quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction sex markers. We found that the genome size and
   GC content of this spider fall into the ranges reported for the majority
   of araneids. The male karyotype is formed by 24 acrocentric chromosomes
   with an X(1)X(2)0 sex chromosome system, with little similarity between
   X chromosomes, suggesting an origin of these chromosomes by X chromosome
   fission or early duplication of an X chromosome and subsequent
   independent differentiation of the copies. Our data suggest X
   chromosomes of similar sizes in A. bruennichi. They are smaller
   chromosomes of the complement. Our findings open the door to new
   directions in spider evolutionary and ecological research.},

Abstract = {During embryonic development of the Caspian thin-toed gecko migration,
   formation of myoblast and myosatellite cells occurs in the
   cranial-distal direction. Somite formation begins in the body part close
   to the skull and ends in the tail. The time of separation of somites
   from the proximal mesoderm depends on the temperature of the air and the
   substrate. Myoblast cells reach their targets and are connected, and the
   membranes in the area of their contact are destroyed. Myoblast's fusion
   creates myosymplasts. The intermediate stage is observed after the
   formation of small myosymplasts. After that, the chain shape of
   myosymplasts are transformed into an intermediate plaque form. At this
   intermediate stage, the number of a nucleus is small, the shape of the
   nucleus differs from each other, and the location of the nucleus varies.
   Afterward, the connection of the intermediate forms with each other and
   with myoblasts forms a rounded shape, where the initial development of
   myotubules takes place. A fully formed myotubular and myosatellite cells
   are surrounded by a basal membrane and shape a muscle fiber. The
   skeletal muscles of the adult Caspian thin-toed gecko are mainly
   composed of white fibers. Thus, it allows the gecko to move very fast in
   a short time. Due to the small number of mitochondria in the myotubes,
   oxygen gas demand is decreased and the body is prevented from
   overheating.},

Title = {DNA Barcoding and Phylogeny of Acari Species Based on ITS and COI
   Markers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Acari harbor numerous minute species of agricultural economic
   importance, mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Great efforts have
   been established by means of recovering morphological, molecular, and
   phylogenetic traits for species identification. Traditional
   identification still relies on external diagnostic characters, which are
   limited and usually exhibit large phenotypic plasticity within the
   species, rendering them useless for species delimitation and
   identification. We decided to increase the number of sequences of the
   Acari mitochondrial COI (Cytochrome C oxidase I) marker and ITS nuclear
   ribosomal DNA region for species identification in Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae. The molecular data allow us to establish species
   boundaries and phylogenetic relationships among several clades of Acari,
   mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Sequence comparisons between
   complete COI and the Acari mitochondrial COI, ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, and ITS2
   among all Acari sequences have demonstrated that the selected regions,
   even small, gave enough informative positions for both species'
   identification and phylogenetic studies. Analyses of both DNA regions
   have unveiled their use as species identification characters, with
   special emphasis on Acari mitochondrial COI for Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae species in comparison with the Folmer fragment, which has
   been universally used as a barcode marker. We demonstrated that the
   Acari mitochondrial COI region is also a suitable marker to establish a
   barcode dataset for Acari identification. Our phylogenetic analyses are
   congruent with other recent works, showing that Acari is a monophyletic
   group, of which Astigmata, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Oribatida, and
   Prostigmata are also monophyletic.},

Title = {Wings of fringed fruit-eating bats (Artibeus fimbriatus) are highly

Abstract = {Phenotypic variability is ubiquitous. This is especially true in bats,
   where families such as Phyllostomidae encompass as much phenotypic
   variability as some entire orders of mammals. Typically, phenotypic
   variability is characterized based on cranial morphology, with studies
   of other functionally important aspects of the phenotype, such as legs,
   feet and wings, being less frequent. We examined patterns of secondary
   sexual dimorphism and allometry of wing elements of the fringed
   fruit-eating bat (Artibeus fimbriatus) and examined, for the first time,
   the modularity of bat wings. Patterns were based on 13 wing measurements
   taken from 21 females and 15 males from eastern Paraguay. From a
   multivariate perspective, A. fimbriatus exhibited significant secondary
   sexual dimorphism. Females were larger than males for all 13 wing
   characteristics, with significant differences involving the last phalanx
   of the fourth and fifth digits. Female wings were also relatively larger
   than male wings from a multivariate perspective, as was the last phalanx
   of the fourth and fifth digits, after adjusting for wing size based on
   forearm length. Wing elements were highly variable regarding allometric
   relationships, with some exhibiting no allometric patterns and others
   exhibiting isometry or hyperallometry, depending on the element. Wings
   exhibited significant modularity, with metacarpals, proximal phalanges
   and distal phalanges each representing a discrete module. The wings of
   A. fimbriatus exhibit substantive patterns of dimorphism, allometry and
   modularity. Although the big mother hypothesis is a strong theoretical
   construct to explain wing dimorphism, there is not yet any sound
   theoretical basis for the patterns of allometry and modularity of the
   wing. Further investigation is required to understand the determinants
   of variation in wing morphology.},

Title = {Examining the shape and size of female and male genitalia in snakes

Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Quantification of genital variation in males and females can inform our
   understanding of likely copulatory interactions and evolution of genital
   diversity. However, no studies have quantified genital shape variation
   within a single snake species or examined the shape and size of both the
   vaginal pouch and hemipenes. Here, we examine the shape and size of the
   genitalia of female and male diamondback water snakes, Nerodia
   rhombifer, using a three-dimensional automated landmark geometric
   morphometric approach on models of the lumen of the vaginal pouch and
   inflated hemipenes, applying these techniques for the first time to the
   genital shape of vertebrates. Vaginal pouch shape is significantly
   associated with body size and reproductive status. As females grow
   larger and become reproductive, the vaginal pouch enlarges, widens and
   becomes more bifurcated. In reproductive males, the shape of the
   hemipenes is also significantly associated with body size. As males grow
   larger, the hemipenes enlarge and widen; their bifurcation becomes more
   defined and the spines at the base become more prominent. Vaginal pouch
   and hemipenial centroid size are isometric with respect to body length.
   The centroid sizes of the hemipenes and vaginal pouch are not
   significantly different from one another, hence the genitalia match in
   size. Reproductive females and males covary in the degree of bifurcation
   and size of their genitalia. We demonstrate the utility of
   three-dimensional analysis in studies of the shape of soft tissues and
   advocate its use in future studies of genitalia.},

Title = {Simulating cyanide fishing: photosynthetic effects of short-term cyanide

Abstract = {Since the 1960s the demand for ornamental aquarium fish has grown
   steadily and consequently cyanide fishing is still a popular fishing
   method despite its prohibition. This poses a severe threat to coral
   reefs in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to investigate the short-term
   stress reaction on photosynthetic yield in the tissues of three
   different hard coral colonies (branching growth forms Pocillopora
   damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix, and massive Porites lobata) to
   initially high and then decreasing cyanide exposure, mimicking cyanide
   fishing by fishermen. Experiments were performed both in situ in the
   coral reefs of the Marine Protected Area Pulau Pieh, West Sumatra,
   Indonesia, and in the aquaria facilities of ZMT in Germany. A Diving-PAM
   fluorometer was used for in vivo stress assessment of the holobiont.
   While in all species the photosynthetic efficiency was significantly
   reduced right after cyanide application, the massive species displayed
   much lower Delta F/Fm' values. After three days in cyanide-free water
   all three coral species recovered to initial values of Fv/Fm, except for
   P. lobata. No bleaching or discolouration was detected by the conclusion
   of the experiment after 38 days. Especially Indonesian reefs with
   massive corals may be therefore more severely impacted by cyanide
   fishing since the retention time of the water in these reefs is longer
   than in reefs that consist primarily of branching corals. This might
   have implications for the management of different reef parts of the MPA.},

Abstract = {The study of avian species diversity and abundance at the Taunsa Barrage
   Ramsar site was carried out from September 2019 to March 2020. Taunsa
   Barrage is an important wetland for international and local migratory
   birds, including waterfowls, waders, and long-distance migrant avifauna.
   Data were collected by direct counts made on four-point transects
   representing a disturbance gradient due to humans and different
   habitats. Species diversity indices, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
   other statistical methods were used to analyze data. A total of 150
   avian species of 19 orders and 53 families were recorded. These included
   66 migrant species and 84 resident species. The spotting of ten globally
   threatened species also highlights the importance of wetland for avian
   species. On average, 1511 +/- 373 (mean +/- SD) species of birds were
   recorded every month. Shannon's diversity index indicated that Transect
   Point 2 had higher species diversity (H'=3.779), followed by Transect

   Evenness index showed that birds evenly distributed in September
   (E=0.5584) than November (E=0.3109). ANOVA showed a significant
   difference (F=4.800, df=3, P=0.002) of avian diversity and abundance
   among the transect points. But there was no statistically significant
   interaction between months (F=1.23, df=6, P=0.233). The results showed
   that the Taunsa Barrage Ramsar site harbors plenty of resident migratory
   and threatened bird species. Hence, it is important to protect its
   habitat and need to protect avian diversity by overcoming major threats.},

Abstract = {Species with large distributions provide unique opportunities to test
   how geography has influenced biotic diversification. In this work, we
   aimed to explore the effect of geographic barriers on the distribution
   of the phenotypic and genetic variation of a spider species that is
   widespread in continental and insular America. We obtained an alignment
   of the mitochondrial locus Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) for 408
   individuals across the geographic range of Gasteracantha cancriformis.
   We used phylogenetics, population genetics, and morphology to explore
   the genetic and phenotypic variation of this species. We found five
   genetically differentiated and geographically structured populations.
   Three of them are distributed in continental America, separated by the
   Andes mountains, and two are in the Caribbean and Galapagos Islands.
   Some of these geographic clades shared haplotypes between them, which
   may be a consequence of dispersal. We detected at least 20 phenotypes of
   G. cancriformis, some of which were exclusive to a geographic region,
   while others occurred in multiple regions. We did not observe
   well-defined morphological differences across male genitalia. This
   evidence suggests that G. cancriformis is a widespread species with high
   phenotypic variation that should be explored in more depth.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic changes in response to environmental cues allow organisms to
   adapt and enhance their fitness in a given habitat. Despite the
   significance of phenotypic plasticity in the evolution and ecology of
   natural populations and the ongoing development of new genomic tools,
   the underlying genetic basis is still largely unknown. Herein, we
   examined the underlying mechanisms of genetic and phenotypic divergence
   among alternative morphs of a natural population of the Greek smooth
   newt (Lissotriton graecus). The studied population consists of fully
   aquatic individuals exhibiting facultative paedomorphosis, the retention
   of larval traits such as gills, and individuals that have passed
   metamorphosis (paedomorphic vs. metamorphic newts). Based on the single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained, we observed low genetic
   divergence between the two alternative morphs and similar levels of gene
   diversity on neutral markers. Despite the observed high gene flow
   between the morphs, an Fst approach for outliers detected candidate loci
   putatively associated with the alternative morphs that mapped to four
   genes. These identified genes have functional roles in metabolic
   processes that may mediate the persistence of alternative ontogenetic
   trajectories.},

Title = {Resolving teleology's false dilemma},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the account of teleology previously proposed by
   the authors is consistent with the physical determinism that is implicit
   across many of the sciences. We suggest that much of the current
   aversion to teleological thinking found in the sciences is rooted in
   debates that can be traced back to ancient natural science, which pitted
   mechanistic and deterministic theories against teleological ones. These
   debates saw a deterministic world as one where freedom and agency is
   impossible. And, because teleological entities seem to be free to either
   reach their ends or not, it was assumed that they could not be
   deterministic. Mayr's modern account of teleonomy adheres to this basic
   assumption. Yet, the seeming tension between teleology and determinism
   is illusory because freedom and agency do not, in fact, conflict with a
   deterministic world. To show this, we present a taxonomy of different
   types of freedom that we see as inherent in teleological systems. Then
   we show that our taxonomy of freedom, which is crucial to understanding
   teleology, shares many of the features of a philosophical position
   regarding free will that is known in the contemporary literature as
   `compatibilism'. This position maintains that an agent is free when the
   sources of its actions are internal, when the agent itself is the
   deterministic cause of those actions. Our view shows that freedom is not
   only indispensable to teleology, but also that, contrary to common
   intuitions, there is no conflict between teleology and causal
   determinism.},

Title = {Genetic diversity of the endangered Mongolian saiga antelope Saiga

Abstract = {The Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is one of the few megafauna species
   from the mammoth steppe still living today. Currently, saiga are
   classified as critically endangered, persisting only in small areas of
   Central Asian steppe and desert ecosystems. The species is divided into
   two subspecies: Saiga tatarica mongolica and Saiga tatarica tatarica. In
   this study, we have for the first time characterized the genetic
   diversity of the Mongolian saiga (S. t. mongolica) using both
   mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers. We also analysed S. t.
   tatarica specimens in order to genetically compare both subspecies. The
   mitochondrial control region was sequenced for a total of 89
   individuals: 20 skin, 53 umbilical cord, three placentae and a muscle
   sample from S. t. mongolica, and a total of 12 hair samples from S. t.
   tatarica. Additionally, 19 microsatellites developed for saiga antelope
   were also screened. Our results revealed that the Mongolian saiga
   presents very low genetic diversity at the mitochondrial level, with no
   shared mitochondrial haplotype between the two subspecies. Low genetic
   diversity is also present at the autosomal level, with most loci having
   low heterozygosity (Ho/He) and a low number of alleles per locus.
   Despite the low genetic diversity, we found no separation between the
   subpopulations in Mongolia, indicating that conservation corridors are
   actually promoting contact between different herds. Our results validate
   current conservation efforts and inform the implementation of new
   measures to increase the viability of the S. t. mongolica subspecies.},

Title = {Cryptic Marine Diversity in the Northern Arabian Gulf: An Integrative
   Approach Uncovers a New Species of Oyster (Bivalvia: Ostreidae), Ostrea
   oleomargarita},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Animal biodiversity is greatly underestimated in nontemperate marine
   regions, especially for intertidal benthic organisms such as oysters.
   Recent surveys in the northern Arabian Gulf suggest the presence of
   numerous unidentified species, some of which form shallow reef
   ecosystems while others are cryptic and found under rocks. In this
   study, we focused on small oysters from Kuwait, which show typical
   characteristics in common with the genus Ostrea except for the presence
   of lophine chomata that would link it to the genera Lopha, Dendostrea,
   and Alectryonella. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial and
   nuclear markers unambiguously placed the Kuwait oyster within the
   Ostreinae as a sister to the Japanese species Ostrea futamiensis. The
   hypothesis that the Kuwait oyster represents a new species was assessed
   with phylogenetic and species delimitation methods combined with a
   morphological assessment. Results corroborated the Kuwait oysters as a
   new species herein described as Ostrea oleomargarita Oliver, Salvi, and
   Al-Kandari, sp. nov. The phylogeny of the Ostreinae shows extensive
   disagreement between morphology-based genera and phylogenetic clades.
   The genus Ostrea is polyphyletic, and the form and distribution of
   taxonomic characters such as chomata are not as definitive as suggested
   in previous studies. This study, along with other recent investigations,
   confirmed the Arabian Gulf as a key region for discovering marine animal
   diversity and suggested a possible biogeographic divide between the
   Eastern and Western Indo-Pacific. A pattern that has been documented in
   a growing number of taxa and that warrants further research attention.},

Title = {Genetic-morphological uncoupling and crypsis in Ectinogonia (Coleoptera:

   jewel beetles from Chile},

Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Ectinogonia is a genus of jewel beetles from the western slope of the
   Andes Cordillera, inhabiting arid and semiarid ecosystems in different
   biogeographical provinces. Most of the species in this genus have
   undergone several rearrangements and misassignments over time, making
   the taxonomic history of Ectinogonia particularly complex. Recent
   studies based on molecular phylogenies suggest that the taxonomy of the
   genus should be revised using genetic tools. Because some species are
   polymorphic and others cryptic and monomorphic, species diversity may be
   over- or underestimated. We performed here the first comprehensive
   molecular phylogeny for Ectinogonia s.s. using nuclear and mitochondrial
   genes. We also performed species delimitation analyses to estimate
   diversity within Ectinogonia. Results show that Ectinogonia is divided
   into two main groups: the artificial `southern group' and the natural
   `northern clade'. The southern group matched with the current
   morphology-based taxonomy, whereas the northern clade contained the
   largest number of species, several of which do not fit with the current
   taxonomy. There was both genetic-morphological uncoupling and crypsis by
   convergence, suggesting a complex evolutionary history. We also provide
   a new taxonomic arrangement based on our results.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is a principal driver of global biodiversity loss. Although
   many studies have examined the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity,
   we are only beginning to study urbanization as an evolutionary force.
   Urban environments are hotspots for invasive species, but most previous
   studies have focused on phenotypic changes in native species responding
   to urbanization. Quantifying the phenotypic responses of invasive
   species to urbanization may help reveal mechanisms promoting invasion.
   There are, however, few studies investigating the phenotypic response of
   invasive species to urbanization. We compared morphological traits of
   invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) between urban and rural areas in
   three cities in north-eastern Australia using generalized linear mixed
   models. We found that the parotoid glands, which are the major
   anti-predator defence of toads were smaller in urban than in rural
   populations. The tibiofibula length of males in urban populations was
   longer than those in rural populations, but females showed opposite
   trends, suggesting potential effects of urbanization on sexual
   dimorphism. These results demonstrate that urbanization drives
   morphological changes in invasive toads, suggesting they may adapt to
   urban environments rapidly.},

Abstract = {Launch is the most energetically expensive part of flight and is
   considered a limiting factor in the size of modern flyers. Pterosaurs
   reached significantly larger sizes than modern flyers and are proposed
   to have launched either bipedallly or quadrupedally. We investigated the
   ability of a medium-sized ornithocheiraean pterosaur to assume the poses
   required to launch bipedally or quadrupedally. We applied range of
   motion (ROM) mapping methodology to the pectoral and pelvic girdles to
   identify viable poses at varying levels of appendicular cartilage based
   on the extant phylogenetic bracket. The ROMs were constrained by novel
   triangulated minimum stretch methodology, used to identify the
   restraining tissue ROM. Our study indicates that a medium-sized
   ornithocheiraean could assume the poses required to use a quadrupedal
   launch and, with an additional 10 degrees of hindlimb abduction, a
   bipedal launch, although further analysis is required to determine
   whether sufficient muscular power and leverage was available to propel
   the animal into the air.},

Volume = {137},
Number = {1},

Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Pelagic seabirds are highly mobile, reducing opportunities for
   population isolation that might promote differentiation and speciation.
   At the same time, many seabirds are philopatric, and their tendency to
   return to their natal islands to breed might reduce gene flow
   sufficiently to permit local adaptation and differentiation. To test the
   net impact of these competing processes, estimates of differentiation
   and gene flow based on comprehensive geographical sampling are required.
   We leveraged diverse source material to achieve comprehensive
   geographical sampling in a widespread seabird, the Wedge-tailed
   Shearwater (Ardenna pacifica). Using data from sequence capture and
   high-throughput sequencing of 2402 loci containing 20 780 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms, we tested for population differentiation and
   gene flow among breeding areas. We found little evidence of deep
   divergences within A. pacifica but were able to resolve fine-scale
   differentiation across island groups. This differentiation was
   sufficient to assign individuals sampled away from breeding areas to
   their likely source populations. Estimated effective migration surfaces
   revealed reduced migration between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean,
   presumably owing to land barriers, and across the equatorial Pacific
   Ocean, perhaps associated with differences in breeding schedule. Our
   results reveal that, despite their mobility, pelagic seabirds can
   exhibit fine-scale population differentiation and reduced gene flow
   among ocean basins.},

Abstract = {Terrestrial animals in global wet-dry tropical ecosystems experience
   year-round high temperatures but concentrated summer rainfall. This
   highly seasonal precipitation is expected to have major evolutionary and
   ecological consequences for animals. We considered how strong seasonal
   patterns of rainfall might influence the environment and biological
   attributes of the world's largest predatory lizard, the Komodo dragon
   (Varanus komodoensis). We predicted that annual variation in rainfall or
   temperature may influence the seasonal phenology of vegetation, and in
   turn, the phenology of Komodo dragon reproduction and hatchling
   emergence. Similarly, seasonal environmental differences may affect
   Komodo dragon rates of somatic growth, body condition, survival and
   daily movement. Our results indicated evidence of strong seasonal
   variation in mean monthly rainfall and leaf area index for open
   deciduous forest and closed dense forest. These environmental variables
   were significantly correlated with female Komodo dragon nesting activity
   and hatchling emergence. Neither Komodo dragon somatic growth rate nor
   body condition exhibited seasonal differences. There was, however,
   increased daily movement rates of Komodo dragons during the dry season.
   This suggests dry season associated life-history activities or
   thermoregulatory efficiency might explain increased daily movement.
   Ultimately, the Komodo dragon showed differential sensitivities in its
   biology to seasonal environmental variation.},

Abstract = {The Arabian Sea (AS) oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is a site of intense
   denitrification, contributing to 20\% of the global oceanic
   denitrification, playing a significant role in the nitrogen cycle. In
   this study, the structure and diversity of culturable bacterial
   communities inhabiting the water column of the AS OMZ were investigated
   through phylogenetic analysis and nitrate-utilizing ability was studied
   through culture-based studies. A total of 248 isolates collected during
   pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season were analysed for 16S rRNA gene
   sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bacterial isolates
   belonged to 24 genera comprising class Gammaproteobacteria (79\%),
   Firmicutes (18.15\%), Bacteroidetes (1.61\%) and Alphaproteobacteria
   (1.2\%). Further, the ability of the organisms to reduce nitrate was
   tested by measuring nitrate reduction rate and nitrate reductase enzyme
   assay. Around 67\% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate
   reducers. The nitrate reduction rate ranged between 0.86-3.4 mu M NO3-
   day(-1) while nitrate reductase activity varied from 0.01-1.32 U ml(-1).
   The presence of a high number of nitrate-reducing bacteria in this
   region signifies a link between functional diversity and ecosystem
   biogeochemistry of the OMZ region of the Arabian Sea.},

Title = {Dwarf vipers on a small island: body size, diet and fecundity correlates},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-279},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Insular populations offer excellent opportunities to study the factors
   that influence phenotypes. We observed island dwarfism in a widespread
   snake, the nose-horned viper (Wpera ammodytes). Island vipers were
   similar to 20\% smaller than mainland individuals. They also produced
   fewer and smaller offspring. In snakes, food availability has a positive
   influence on body size, fecundity and offspring size. Consequently, low
   energy intake is a plausible explanation for insular dwarfism. The diet
   of island vipers was principally represented by lizards and centipedes,
   whereas the most profitable prey items (e.g. rodents) were regularly
   found in the stomach of mainland vipers. Furthermore, the proportion of
   individuals captured with a full stomach and good body condition were
   lower on the island compared with the mainland. Thus, island vipers were
   likely to be experiencing permanent energy restriction, with cascading
   effects on adult body size and reproductive output. Large prey promotes
   high relative jaw length in snakes. Island vipers displayed smaller
   relative jaw length compared with mainland populations, suggesting that
   plasticity played a role in insular dwarfism. But the difference in
   relative tail length between island and mainland populations, a trait
   not subjected to food-induced plasticity, indicates local adaptation.
   Both plasticity and adaptation might influence the phenotype of island
   vipers.},

Abstract = {In many animal species, an increase in the operational sex ratio (OSR),
   density or a combination of both should lead to more intensive
   competition among individuals of the more abundant sex. To test this, we
   examined pairing patterns of Minshan's toad (Bufo minshanicus) from six
   populations between 2008 and 2015 along the eastern Tibetan Plateau in
   south-west China. OSRs in breeding aggregations of Minshan's toad are
   normally male biased and males actively compete with each other for
   acquisition and retention of mates. We found evidence that deviations
   from random mating by size varied between populations and between years
   according to the magnitude of the OSR and male density. Larger males
   were generally more successful in pairing than smaller males when the
   OSR was slightly male biased and male density was high. However, the
   resulting size-disproportionate mating was more evident when OSR was
   closer to 1.99, indicating a positive correlation with the intensity of
   aggressive scramble competition. Thus, the intensity of male-male
   competition may partly explain variation in size-disproportionate mating
   among populations.},

Abstract = {The concept of `natural selection', as proposed in The Origin of Species
   (published in 1859), refers to the better known of Charles Darwin's two
   distinct theories of evolution. Darwin's other theory was originally
   associated with his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. (Darwin used
   the shorthand phrase, the `use and disuse of parts', to characterize
   this alternative theory.) Lamarck's theory was rejected (and even
   mocked) by many 20(th) century theorists, who instead adopted a
   gene-centred, one-way, bottom-up model of evolutionary change, called
   the modern synthesis. (It has also been termed neo-Darwinism.) Darwin
   was more receptive to Lamarck's approach, and in his second great work,
   The Descent of Man (published in 1874), he applied this Lamarckian
   theory particularly to human evolution. He ascribed our remarkable
   evolutionary success to our behaviour: social cooperation, innovation
   (and tools), morality and cumulative culture. Neo-Darwinists called it
   Darwin's biggest mistake. However, an ever-increasing body of evidence,
   inclusive of cultural phenomena in many other species, suggests that it
   was, in fact, their mistake. Often called gene-culture co-evolution
   theory, the reverse order (as used here) might be a better way of
   characterizing the underlying causal dynamics. The `purposeful'
   behaviour (teleonomy) of living systems has exerted a major influence on
   the trajectory of biological evolution.},

Title = {A New Interactive Web-Based Polytomous Key for Species Identification of
   Pin Nematodes of the Genus Paratylenchus Micoletzky, 1922 (Nematoda:

Abstract = {Pin nematodes of the genus Paratylenchus comprise 140 species. This
   group of nematodes is characterized by a quite homogeneous morphology
   and cosmopolitan distribution and is prevalent in cultivated and natural
   soil ecosystems. The present study describes the first interactive and
   illustrated web-assisted polytomous identification key for the genus
   Paratylenchus. The updated Paratylenchus species polytomous key was
   based on a wide list of 24 diagnostic characters generated for the 140
   species comprising this genus. Here we developed a web-assisted method
   to achieve an easy and accurate Paratylenchus species characterization
   that will greatly improve the identification of these plant-parasitic
   nematodes for many diagnostic laboratories and researchers. However,
   this identification needs to be completed with the use of molecular
   markers available for the species due to the existence of species
   complexes studied in former researches. This idea is pointed in the
   polytomous key in the specific species complexes up-to-know. In some
   cases, the presence in the soil as survival stage of few individuals in
   the fourth-stage juvenile (J4) required the use of molecular markers for
   species identification. We suggest the use of at least a fragment of
   mitochondrial COI gene for species identification or the combination of
   nuclear D2-D3 regions of the 28S rRNA and the COI to complement each
   marker. However, for some species complexes, the use of the D2-D3
   regions alone has not enough resolution to separate the putative species
   inside the species complex. Web-based polytomous key was constructed
   using the free software Xper3, for computers and mobile devices
   (smartphones, tablets, and pocket PCS).},

Abstract = {Predation risk has a great influence on animal behaviour. Juveniles are
   often more susceptible to predation than adults owing to their small
   body size and limited locomotive ability. Ezohelix gainesi (Camaenidae)
   is a ground-dwelling land snail that swings its shell as a strategy to
   avoid predation by beetles. This strategy, however, does not seem to
   work in juveniles, probably because of their small shell size. Instead,
   small individuals climb plants as an alternative strategy that is likely
   to avoid predation; to examine this, we initially made an experimental
   comparison of the rates of predation by beetles on land snails of
   different sizes. In these conditions, smaller snails were preyed upon
   more frequently than larger ones. Next, we compared the size
   distribution of snails on plants with those on the forest floor. Small
   snails occurred more frequently on plants than on the ground, and the
   shell diameter of land snails at 50\% probability of occurring on plants
   was similar to that at 50\% probability of predation. Climbing behaviour
   by small snails was also confirmed in the laboratory in the absence of
   predators. Therefore, plant-climbing by juvenile E. gainesi is probably
   an adaptive strategy to avoid predation by ground-dwelling beetles.},

Title = {Relationships between reproductive character displacement in genital

Volume = {138},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Natural selection against maladaptive interspecific reproductive
   interactions may cause greater divergence in mating traits between
   sympatric populations than between allopatric populations in a pair of
   species, known as reproductive character displacement (RCD) which is
   evidence for the lock-and-key hypothesis of genital evolution. However,
   the relative importance of various processes contributing to RCD in
   genital morphology (e.g. reinforcement, reproductive interference, and
   population filtering or the Templeton effect) is not clear. Here, we
   examined hypotheses for RCD in genital morphology, with a special focus
   on the Templeton effect (which predicts that only highly differentiated
   populations can exist in sympatry). We examined population-level fitness
   costs in interspecific mating between Carabus maiyasanus and Carabus
   iwawakianus with RCD in genital morphology. A mating experiment using
   populations with various degrees of RCD in genital morphology showed no
   evidence for consistently lower interspecific mating costs in C.
   maiyasanus populations in contact with displacement in genital
   morphology than in remote populations, contrary to the predictions of
   the Templeton effect. Alternatively, interspecific mating costs varied
   among populations. Observed relationships between the sizes of genital
   parts concerning isolation and interspecific mating costs across
   populations suggested that population-level fitness costs do not
   necessarily decrease during the process leading to RCD. Our results
   provide insight into ecological and evolutionary processes during
   secondary contact in closely related species.},

Abstract = {Asplenium scolopendrium is distributed in northern temperate forests
   with many global biogeographic disjunctions. The species complex of A.
   scolopendrium has been generated by spatial segregation coupled with
   divergent evolution. We elucidated the biogeographic history of the A.
   scolopendrium complex by exploring its origin, dispersal and evolution,
   thus providing insights into the evolutionary history of the Tertiary
   floras with northern pan-temperate disjunct distributions. The results
   revealed that all infraspecific taxa descended from a widely distributed
   common ancestor in the Northern Hemisphere. This pan-temperate ancestral
   population formed by unidirectional westward dispersal from European
   origins primarily during the Early Eocene when the Earth's climate was
   much warmer than today. The splitting of European, American and East
   Asian lineages occurred during the Early Miocene due to geo-climatic
   vicariances. Polyploidy events in the American ancestral populations
   created additional reproductive barriers. The star-shaped haplotypes in
   each continent indicated that local disjunctions also led to derived
   genotypes with potential to diverge into different taxa. This
   intracontinental lineage splitting is likely related to latitudinal
   range shift and habitat fragmentation caused by glacial cycles and
   climate change during the Pleistocene. The evolutionary history of the
   A. scolopendrium complex supported the Boreotropical hypothesis
   exhibiting range expansion during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum.},

Volume = {137},

Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {The white crab Munidopsis polymorpha (Crustacea: Galatheidae) is the
   only one of a species-rich genus not occurring in the deep sea. It is
   endemic to marine caves, anchialine pools and groundwaters of the
   volcanic island of Lanzarote (Canary Islands). The eye derives from the
   superposition type possessing a clear zone formed by the proximal
   extensions of the rudimentary crystalline cones. The number of ommatidia
   ranges among the lowest found in decapods and the optic ganglia are
   strongly diminished in size. The crystalline cones are rudimentary or
   lost and facets with individual corneas are not discernible. The
   rhabdoms are tiny and irregularly arranged in the rhabdom layer. Some
   rhabdoms display an open arrangement of rhabdomers with microvilli that
   are not aligned to form orthogonal layers. The eye is one of the rare
   exceptions of traits that despite being rudimentary is still partially
   functional. The absence of stabilizing selection is probably the reason
   for variability or reduction of the traits necessary for image
   formation. In contrast, negative phototactic behaviour is present,
   because light is still perceived by the eyes of M. polymorpha.},

Title = {Do distylous syntopic plant species partition their floral morphological
   traits?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-67},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Morphological niche partitioning between related syntopic plants that
   are distylous (with short- and long-styled morphs) is complex. Owing to
   differences in the heights of stigmas and anthers, each floral morph
   must place pollen onto two distinct parts of the body of the pollinator.
   This led us to hypothesize that such partitioning should be more
   accurate among distylous syntopic species in comparison to combinations
   with other related plants that do not co-occur. We tested these
   assumptions using a set of Palicourea (Rubiaceae) species as a model
   system. We compared the distribution, flowering phenology, floral
   measurements and reciprocity of sexual organ heights of two syntopic
   species (Palicourea rigida and Palicourea coriacea) and one non-syntopic
   congener (Palicourea marcgravii). The three species overlapped in their
   distributions and flowering periods. The position of sexual organs was,
   in most cases, partitioned between syntopic populations, with low
   overlap in anther and stigma heights. However, we found a higher overlap
   involving the non-syntopic species, especially between Palicourea rigida
   and Palicourea marcgravii. Additionally, reciprocity of sexual organs
   was more accurate in intraspecific inter-morph combinations (i.e.
   legitimate organ correspondence) in comparison to intraspecific
   intra-morph, interspecific syntopic and interspecific non-syntopic
   combinations. The partitioning of morphological traits between syntopic
   species might facilitate the differential placement of pollen on the
   body of the pollinator and reduce the chances of interspecific
   interference.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the recolonization behaviour of the rapa
   whelk (Rapana venosa) and the common starfish (Asterias rubens) on the
   mussel beds in their natural habitat. The monitoring studies were
   carried out seasonally on an island covered by a complete mussel bed in
   the Sea of Marmara (Turkey) between 19 October 2020 and 9 August 2021.
   Inhabitant rapa whelk and common starfish on the experimental study
   island (ESI) were tagged, then moved 10 m away from ESI. The
   recolonization potential of tagged invaders was monitored for 14 days
   with underwater surveys after their local eradication each season. The
   percentage of returned rapa whelk to the ESI was higher than common
   starfish end of the monitoring period. Rapa whelk moved non-stop towards
   the mussel bed, reaching the ESI at the latest 6th hour. Common starfish
   reached the mussel bed much later (at the 15(th) hour) than rapa whelk.
   The common starfish began to leave the ESI at the end of the 7(th) day,
   while the rapa whelk addicted to the ESI for 14 days. Re-invasion
   behaviour varied significantly seasonally, and both invaders reached the
   ESI much later in winter. During the monitoring periods, the highest
   invader densities were seen in the patches with the most abundant
   mussels, indicating continued uninterrupted feeding. The re-invasion
   duration and daily feeding activities support the spread of these
   invaders and could be considered a threat to marine resources.},

Abstract = {Morphology of the fish and otoliths are popularly used in the
   discrimination of species/stocks/populations and also to gather
   meaningful conclusions about their ecology. This approach is useful to
   enhance our understanding of the relationship between form and function
   in fishes when a direct assessment is impossible. Inter-species
   variation was analysed using geometric morphometric analysis for fish
   body shape, while morphometry and wavelet functions for sagittae
   morphology. A clear ecomorphological pattern in the body, as well as
   otolith shape, is evident among species as deeper inhabiting species
   possess a deeper body with oblong otoliths compared with shallower
   species that possess a more streamlined body with fusiform otoliths. We
   also observed that deeper species (P. obscura) possess bigger eyes for
   the optimum use of available light and bigger otoliths with higher
   otolith sensory area and otolith area ratio (S:O) for better sound
   reception capacities. Our hypothesis supports that the differences in
   fish morphological as well as sensorial traits (otoliths), which are
   closely related to their locomotion, foraging pattern and depth of
   habitation, lead to trophic segregation which in turn encourages their
   coexistence. This is the first work that discusses the relationship
   between body shape, otolith morphometry and morphology in deep-sea
   fishes and their ecomorphological interpretations.},

Abstract = {A red seaweed Croisettea sp. from Indonesia is reported for the first
   time. The species was collected from the south coastal area of
   Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The molecular identification was carried out by
   amplification of mitochondria gene (cox). The phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that the red seaweed belongs to the family Kallymeniaceae from
   the genus Croisettea with 93.3\% similarity to Croisettea tasmanica. The
   ash and protein contents were 16.12\% and 14.51\% of the dry weight,
   respectively. Analysis of FT-IR spectra indicated that the seaweed
   contained galactan sulphate with gelling property. The spectra of GC-MS
   showed the presence of saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid and stearic
   acid) and unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) and phthalate ester
   derivative. The spectra of (1) H-NMR confirmed the presence of the
   phthalate derivative Bis(2-ethylhexyl phthalate).},

Abstract = {Snakes are a stimulating life form from an evolutionary perspective.
   Despite the basic morphological body shape (limbless, with a tubular
   body), these vertebrates are extremely diverse. The Neotropical region
   is one of the most diverse regions for snakes in the world, with >650
   known species. Within this great diversity, the genus Xenodon includes
   12 species with interesting adaptations to terrestrial and
   semi-fossorial habitats. Members of this genus are mostly diurnal and
   terrestrial, feed mainly on anurans and exhibit Batesian mimicry of
   venomous snakes of the genera Bothrops or Micrurus. Here, through
   phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state estimation, we explore the
   evolution of the rostral scale and mimicry within the genus Xenodon. Our
   results suggest that the ancestral lineage of Xenodon had a rounded
   rostral scale and exhibited Bothrops mimicry. The evolution of the
   rostral scale in Xenodon might be related to abiotic factors, as an
   adaptation for open and forested habitats, and mimicry is likely to be
   related to biotic factors, as a defensive strategy resembling those of
   venomous snakes.},

Abstract = {Rhabdomys is a genus that occupies a variety of habitats, including
   forest margins. Among the Rhabdomys taxa, Rhabdomys dilectus chakae has
   a distribution that covers the eastern seaboard of South Africa, with a
   poorly defined divergence date from its sister taxon Rhabdomys dilectus
   dilectus. Here, we study three mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b,
   cytochrome c oxidase I and partial control region) of R. d. chakae
   across the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal forests of South Africa,
   aiming to determine the cladogenesis (molecular dating) and effective
   population size of this subspecies through time, in addition to its
   cladogenesis in relationship to other species within the genus. A
   phylogenetic analysis revealed six clades within Rhabdomys, confirming
   that our study area is occupied solely by R. d. chakae, to the exclusion
   of other recognized sibling species. A fossil-calibrated Bayesian
   relaxed molecular clock estimated a recent split between R. d. chakae
   and R. d. dilectus similar to 1.4 +/- 0.35 Mya and between two Rhabdomys
   pumilio groups, coastal A and B, at 1.16 +/- 0.44 Mya. Coalescent
   Bayesian skyline plots revealed a stable population of R. d. chakae in
   the study area that was in slow decline until 2500 years ago, when there
   was an expansion in the late Holocene. Radiation within Rhabdomys dates
   as far back as 4.27 Mya, and subsequent demographic fluctuations
   primarily reflect palaeoclimatic changes.},

Abstract = {The genus Noctiliostrebla Wenzel (Diptera: Streblidae) stands out for
   its high degree of specificity exhibited in relation to bat species of
   the genus Noctilio Linnaeus and provides an exciting system for
   understanding the history behind host-parasite associations. Here, we
   present a phylogeny of Noctiliostrebla based on an analysis of DNA
   sequences and morphological characters, along with cophylogenetic and
   biogeographical analyses. Our results strongly support the monophyly of
   Noctiliostrebla, but with uncertainties within the genus. With a low
   frequency of cospeciation events explaining the associations between
   hosts and parasites, cophylogenetic analyses did not show an overall
   congruence between the host and parasite phylogenies. Indeed, two
   parallel histories were recovered in the host-parasite associations,
   which might indicate that niche segregation is determined
   evolutionarily, facilitating the coexistence of parasites and promoting
   diversification. Biogeographical analysis showed a strong spatial
   congruence between disjunct distributions of Noctiliostrebla and major
   river basins in South America and with areas of higher elevation, which
   might be associated with the glacial periods throughout the Pliocene and
   Pleistocene. Overall, our findings suggest an agreement with the
   expectations of the `Stockholm paradigm' framework, in which
   biogeographical events and ecological factors act as important
   components to explain the associations, instead of cospeciation events.},

Abstract = {We approach the question `What is consciousness?' in a new way, not as
   Descartes' `systematic doubt', but as how organisms find their way in
   their world. Finding one's way involves finding possible uses of
   features of the world that might be beneficial or avoiding those that
   might be harmful. `Possible uses of X to accomplish Y' are
   `affordances'. The number of uses of X is indefinite (or unknown), the
   different uses are unordered, are not listable, and are not deducible
   from one another. All biological adaptations are either affordances
   seized by heritable variation and selection or, far faster, by the
   organism acting in its world finding uses of X to accomplish Y. Based on
   this, we reach rather astonishing conclusions: 1. Artificial general
   intelligence based on universal Turing machines (UTMs) is not possible,
   since UTMs cannot `find' novel affordances. 2. Brain-mind is not purely
   classical physics for no classical physics system can be an analogue
   computer whose dynamical behaviour can be isomorphic to `possible uses'.
   3. Brain-mind must be partly quantum-supported by increasing evidence at
   6.0 to 7.3 sigma. 4. Based on Heisenberg's interpretation of the quantum
   state as `potentia' converted to `actuals' by measurement, where this
   interpretation is not a substance dualism, a natural hypothesis is that
   mind actualizes potentia. This is supported at 5.2 sigma. Then mind's
   actualizations of entangled brain-mind-world states are experienced as
   qualia and allow `seeing' or `perceiving' of uses of X to accomplish Y.
   We can and do jury-rig. Computers cannot. 5. Beyond familiar quantum
   computers, we discuss the potentialities of trans-Turing systems.},

Title = {Where is WAIR (and other wing-assisted behaviours)? Essentially

Abstract = {Kuznetsov and Panyutina (2022) offer a reanalysis of the kinematic and
   force plate data previously published by Bundle and Dial (2003). Their
   intention is to describe instantaneous wing forces during wing-assisted
   incline running (WAIR), focusing particularly on the upstroke phase.
   Based on their interpretation of wing forces and muscle function, the
   authors conclude that `WAIR is a very specialized mode of locomotion
   that is employed by a few specialized birds as an adaptation to a very
   specific environment and involving highly developed flying features of
   the locomotor apparatus', and thus not relevant to the evolution of
   avian flight. Herein, we respond to the authors' interpretations,
   offering an alternative perspective on WAIR and, more generally, on
   studies exploring the evolution of avian flight.},

Abstract = {The common paradise-kingfisher, Tanysiptera galatea, species complex
   comprises 19 taxa distributed across New Guinea and Wallacea. Owing to
   its highly conserved morphological features, the lineage has been
   taxonomically confused, with 15 similar-plumaged taxa currently treated
   as conspecific. To shed light on species limits, we analysed eight
   bioacoustic parameters across 107 sound recordings using principal
   component analysis and the Isler criterion, among other methods. Our
   results show that multiple geographical entities of Tanysiptera
   paradise-kingfishers form discrete bioacoustic clusters across several
   vocal parameters, suggesting that species diversity of the common
   paradise-kingfisher complex has been greatly underestimated. Based on
   our results, we propose splitting T. galatea into six species: (1) Obi
   paradise-kingfisher, Tanysiptera obiensis; (2) Rossel
   paradise-kingfisher, Tanysiptera rosseliana; (3) Papuan
   paradise-kingfisher, T. galatea; (4) Halmahera paradise-kingfisher,
   Tanysiptera margarethae; (5) Morotai paradise-kingfisher, Tanysiptera
   doris; and (6) Amboyna paradise-kingfisher, Tanysiptera nais. Our work
   highlights that the non-invasive collection of avian vocal data is a
   crucial taxonomic tool and adds to increasing evidence that bioacoustic
   analyses are effective in elucidating cryptic diversity.},

Abstract = {Although discussed by 20(th) century philosophers in terms drawn from
   the sciences of non-living systems, in recent decades biological
   function has been considered in relationship to organismal capability
   and purpose. Bringing two phenomena generally neglected in evolutionary
   theory (i.e. inherency and agency) to bear on questions of function
   leads to a rejection of the adaptationist `selected effects' notion of
   biological function. I review work showing that organisms such as the
   placozoans can thrive with almost no functional embellishments beyond
   those of their constituent cells and physical properties of their simple
   tissues. I also discuss work showing that individual tissue cells and
   their artificial aggregates exhibit agential behaviours that are
   unprecedented in the histories of their respective lineages. I review
   findings on the unique metazoan mechanism of developmental gene
   expression that has recruited, during evolution, inherent ancestral
   cellular functionalities into specialized cell types and organs of the
   different animal groups. I conclude that most essential functions in
   animal species are inherent to the cells from which they evolved, not
   selected effects, and that many of the others are optional `add-ons', a
   status inimical to fitness-based models of evolution positing that
   traits emerge from stringent cycles of selection to meet external
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Characterizing the genetic diversity and structure of populations is
   essential for understanding their evolutionary history and planning
   species conservation. The lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina) is a
   large migratory raptor with a relatively small breeding range
   concentrated in Eastern Europe. We evaluated the level of genetic
   diversity and population structuring by estimating the length diversity
   of 23 microsatellite markers in 306 individuals and sequencing 473
   nucleotides from the mitochondrial pseudo-control region in 265
   individuals across the distribution range. The microsatellite data
   suggested shallow differentiation between geographical regions and
   moderate genetic diversity across the range; no recent population
   bottlenecks were detected. Mitochondrial diversity was relatively low;
   however, high values were recorded at the southern edge of the
   distribution range. This, in combination with the star-like distribution
   of mitochondrial haplotypes, suggests the expansion of the European
   population from a single (Balkan) refugium during the late Pleistocene
   or early Holocene after the glacial population bottleneck. However, the
   Caucasian population may have survived in a separate refugium. We
   conclude that the lack of clear population structuring and ongoing gene
   flow across Europe support the treatment of the geographically
   restricted global population of the lesser spotted eagle as a single
   evolutionary and conservation unit.},

Abstract = {A new small-sized lynx from Longdan, Gansu Province, China, Lynx hei sp.
   nov., is described in this study. The new species displays the
   characteristic Lynx generic traits, such as distinct buccal grooves in
   the upper canine, presence of an anterior groove in the upper canine,
   absence of upper premolar 2, and a moderately developed mastoid process,
   but it is markedly smaller than the previously described Lynx
   issiodorensis specimens from the same site and is also smaller overall
   than most living species, comparable to Lynx rufus in size. The new
   species has a relatively wide and deep zygomatic arch, similar to that
   of living Lynx lynx, Lynx pardinus and Lynx canadensis but wider than
   that of Lynx rufus. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that Lynx hei
   falls within the crown group Lynx, being the sister to Lynx rufus or,
   less probably, a sister to Lynx issiodorensis + three other living
   species of Lynx. The Plio-Pleistocene Lynx issiodorensis is supported as
   the ancestor of Lynx lynx, Lynx pardinus and Lynx canadensis. Our
   phylogenetic study suggests that Lynx diversification over the
   Plio-Pleistocene was achieved initially by body size differentiation,
   putatively forced by intraspecific competition with other carnivorans,
   followed by morphological divergence.},

Abstract = {In Drosophila spp., their often high number of annual generations, large
   population sizes and large amounts of standing genetic variation should
   predispose them to undergo contemporary adaptation to climatic warming.
   However, a number of laboratory experimental evolution studies in this
   group of organisms suggest strong limits on the rate and magnitude of
   contemporary thermal adaptation. Here, we explore this discrepancy by
   examining the potential for rapid evolutionary divergence between wild
   populations of Drosophila tripunctata Loew, 1862 from rural and urban
   sites. We performed a multi-generation common garden study and found
   evidence for the evolution of higher heat tolerance (critical thermal
   maximum) in flies from urban populations. We also detected evolutionary
   divergence in cold resistance (chill coma recovery time), with
   diminished cold resistance in flies from urban populations, although the
   effect was weaker than the shift in heat tolerance. Our study provides
   evidence of contemporary urban thermal adaptation, although the
   magnitude of phenotypic change lagged the magnitude of environmental
   temperature change across the urbanization gradient, suggesting
   potential limits on the evolution of urban thermal physiology.},

Title = {Three laws of teleonometrics},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-124},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {We define teleonometrics as the theoretical and empirical study of
   teleonomy. We propose three laws for teleonometrics. The first law
   describes the hierarchical organization of teleonomic functions across
   biological levels from genes to individuals. According to this law, the
   number of goal-directed functions increases from individuals (one goal,
   maximizing inclusive fitness) to intermediate levels and to genes and
   alleles (myriad time-, space- and context-dependent goals, depending
   upon degrees and patterns of pleiotropy). The second law describes the
   operation of teleonomic functions under trade-offs, coadaptations and
   negative and positive pleiotropies, which are universal in biological
   systems. According to this law, the functions of an allele, gene or
   trait are described and defined by patterns of antagonistic (trading
   off) and compatible (coadapted) functions. The third law of
   teleonometrics is that the major transitions in evolution are driven by
   the origins of novel, emergent goals associated with functional changes
   and by the breaking and reshaping of trade-offs, especially by
   mechanisms involving increases in resources or time, and new divisions
   of labour or function. We illustrate the application of these laws using
   data from three empirical vignettes, which help to show the usefulness
   of teleonometric viewpoints for understanding the interfaces between
   function, trade-offs and dysfunctions manifest as disease.},

Abstract = {Pachygrapsus transversus is an abundant crab in the intertidal
   ecosystems in the tropical and temperate coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.
   This study aims to investigate the egg production (number and volume) in
   P. transversus in a temperate region (Torres, Rio Grande do Sul,
   Brazil), comparing between three stages of egg development and four
   seasons. Ovigerous females were sampled in 2019 at Praia Prainha once
   per season. In the laboratory, females were identified, measured, and
   their eggs were classified by stage of development, counted and
   measured. The main results were: ovigerous females were collected in all
   seasons, but showed a sharp decrease in winter; fecundity (stage I) was
   positively correlated with female body size and the highest number of
   eggs was found in spring and summer; the egg volume was higher in autumn
   than all other seasons; there was an increase in egg volume during
   development, while egg loss was only detected in spring. The
   reproduction of P. transversus presented seasonal and latitudinal
   differences, which are attributed to environmental conditions.},

Title = {Spirulina- a marine miracle for sustainable food system},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 2},
Abstract = {Promoting optimal nutrition, health, and sustainable food systems in an
   era of population explosion, dietary transformation, and climate change
   is a critical risk factor of our generation. Thus, the food sector is
   confronted with the issue of producing low-cost, nutrient-dense, and
   convenient foods. Therefore, it is critical to investigate food sources
   that are technologically feasible and have a positive environmental and
   economic impact. Spirulina is one of those sources that facilitate
   manufacturing, processing, and distribution together with a wide variety
   of nutrients that enhance human health. It is a marine alga that
   provides the possibility of improving food security while at the same
   time benefiting the environment by utilizing fewer soils to produce as
   much protein and energy as livestock thereby helping to reach SDG 14
   which states the use of marine resources for sustainable development.
   Spirulina has been shown to have potential therapeutic roles. Moreover,
   Spirulina and its constituents have found widespread application in the
   food manufacturing industry. Thus, this paper aims to provide an
   overview of the beneficial applications of Spirulina, its role in
   maintaining food security, and its application to combat the global
   problem of malnutrition without affecting the sustainable food system.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed at investigating nitrogen stress-induced
   biochemical changes in the marine microalgae Chlorella salina. The algae
   were grown in N free medium (N-) in order to study the proximate
   composition via the determination of protein, lipid and carbohydrate.
   The chemical constituents of this algae were determined using GC-MS and
   mineral content was analysed using Inductive Coupled Plasma-Mass
   Spectrometry (ICP-MS). From the results, the proximate analysis showed
   increased lipid (34.77 +/- 0.6\%), followed by carbohydrate (26.21 +/-
   0.2\%) and protein (5.4\% dry weight). The chemical constituents of C.
   salina were successively extracted with diethyl ether, hexane,
   chloroform, acetone and methanol. The extract percentage varied greatly
   between various solvents, with the highest one (4.68\%) recorded for
   methanol. A total of 35 compounds were identified from the extracts and
   the identified chemical groups included ketones, terpenes, fatty acids
   (FA), fatty alcohols and esters derived fatty acids and/or dicarboxylic
   acid and hydrocarbons. The methanol extract consisted of FA (35\%),
   amino acids and N-containing metabolites (7\%), fatty alcohols (8\%),
   organic acids (3\%) and hydrocarbons (80\%). The algae exhibited high
   amounts of Mg (54.079 mg/50 g) followed by C (17.341 mg/50 g), S (5.702
   mg/50 g) and Na (3.275 mg/50 g). These results demonstrated a strong
   correlation between the nitrogen content and lipid accumulation, hence
   showing that Chlorella salina could serve as a potential candidate for
   biodiesel production.},

Title = {Have Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) adequately addressed key needs

Abstract = {Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) are time-bound, public efforts to
   improve specific aspects of environmental or sustainability performance
   in a fishery. They rely upon a joint effort by seafood stakeholders to
   leverage action to move a fishery toward greater sustainability through
   developing and implementing better policies, management and fishing
   practices, supported in part by the supply chain exercising informed
   purchasing choices of fisheries products. This study sought to examine
   available evidence of the ability of FIPs, through the actions of the
   FIP participants if successfully implemented in the future, to galvanize
   conservation and sustainability improvements in fisheries at various
   spatial and jurisdictional scales. Twenty-seven publicly reported FIPs
   (and their associated fisheries) were reviewed to: (1) identify
   endangered, threatened, or protected (ETP) species interactions with the
   fisheries considered, (2) analyse which FIPs had planned or were already
   implementing measures to specifically address aspects of bycatch of ETP
   species, (3) identify new or additional necessary improvement actions
   for ETP species in FIP workplans, and (4) develop general guidance to
   improve the development of the ETP-related components of FIP workplans.
   Out of the FIPs included for final consideration, only two appeared to
   have no interactions with ETP species. We identified three main areas
   related to addressing ETP bycatch where the remaining FIP workplans were
   found to be inadequate: (1) mitigation, (2) monitoring, and (3)
   stakeholder engagement. In addition, six key recommendations to FIP
   implementers and stakeholders were developed.},

Abstract = {Little yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) and big head croaker
   (Collichthys lucidus) are economically important fishes of the Lyusi
   fishing ground. The intestinal bacterial communities of L. polyactis and
   C. lucidus were examined using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing
   technology. The Shannon and Chao-1 indices of the small body length
   group were significantly larger than those of the large body length
   group, and the Simpson index was the opposite (P < 0.05). Pseudomonas
   and Photobacterium of L. polyactis were significantly less abundant than
   those of C. lucidus (P < 0.05), and Clostridium sensu stricto and
   Acinetobacter were significantly more abundant than those of C. lucidus
   (P < 0.05). The abundance of Pseudomonas in L. polyactis increased
   significantly with increasing body length (P < 0.05), and the abundances
   of Psychrobacter and Acinetobacter decreased significantly with
   increasing body length (P < 0.05). The abundance of Clostridium sensu
   stricto in the large body length group was significantly increased
   compared with that in the small body length group (P < 0.05). The
   abundance of Vibrio first increased significantly and then decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing body length. The abundances of
   Pseudomonas and Photobacterium of C. lucidus increased significantly
   with increasing body length (P < 0.05). The abundance of Psychrobacter
   in the large body length group was significantly lower than that in the
   other groups (P < 0.05). Clostridium sensu stricto was significantly
   more abundant in the small body length group than in the other groups (P
   < 0.05). Vibrio was significantly more abundant in the small body length
   group than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Studies have shown that the
   feeding range of L. polyactis is wider than that of C. lucidus. Compared
   with C. lucidus, L. polyactis is less carnivorous and more herbivorous.
   The carnivorous habit of the two fish became more and more obvious with
   the increase of body length. The Clostridium sensu stricto related to
   herbivory of the two fishes may be related to the need to degrade
   indirectly ingested plants. The larval stages of the two fishes had a
   higher proportion of Vibrio.},

Abstract = {Shallow estuarine habitats are well recognized for providing a positive
   correlation to the abundance and diversity of juvenile fish species.
   This has been associated with the hypotheses of refuge from predators
   and the availability of food. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate
   the importance of two adjacent habitats to mangrove fringes (area
   adjacent to pneumatophore zone and mudflat) as an ecological habitat for
   Diapterus auratus juveniles. Sampling was carried out in the rainy
   (January-July 2016) and dry (August-December 2016) periods. This study
   indicated that D. auratus juveniles did not show significant differences
   in abundance and biomass between adjacent habitats. However, univariate
   analyses found there was a significant increase in fish abundance in the
   dry season, due to influx of young-of-the-year. Further, the
   size-frequency of D. auratus showed a recruitment pattern recorded
   between August and January, suggesting a broad spawning period between
   the end of the rainy season and a recovery period between March and May.
   There were distinct changes in the diet between seasons for D. auratus,
   according to the dendrogram of the food eaten by the fish. The combined
   results from the distribution and feeding ecology suggest a connectivity
   among adjacent areas, and indicate that both habitats provide critical
   foraging and refuge habitat for D. auratus in this tropical estuary.},

Title = {Keeping it in the family: Relationships between Polar medallists},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {During the 19th century, members of British Arctic expeditions received
   one of two silver Arctic medals. In 1904, the British Polar Medal was
   established in both silver and bronze to returning members of the
   British National Antarctic Expedition. Subsequently awarded to members
   of both Arctic and Antarctic expeditions, the medal in silver is still
   awarded today. This paper explores the family links of the recipients
   from 1904 to the present. Polar medallists related by blood comprise
   five pairs of brothers, five father-and-son pairs, one
   grandfather-and-grandson pair, one uncle-and-nephew pair and six pairs
   of cousins including one male-to-female pair. A female-to-female link
   has yet to be recorded. Family links resulting from marriage include six
   husband-and-wife pairs and four pairs of brothers-in-law.},

Title = {Update: Assessing the evolutionary trajectory of the Apaporis caiman
   (Caiman crocodilus apaporiensis, Medem 1955) via mitochondrial molecular
   markers},

Abstract = {The spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) is currently considered to be
   a species complex due to the relatively high morphological and molecular
   diversity expressed across its range. One of the populations of
   interest, inhabiting the Apaporis River (Colombia), was described based
   on skull features as an incipient species (C. c. apaporiensis) and has
   been treated by some authors as a full species. Recent molecular work
   challenged this hypothesis, because relatively low mitochondrial
   molecular differentiation was found between the morphologically
   described Apaporis caiman and C. crocodilus (s.s.) Amazonian
   populations. Here, we present an update on the topic based on a larger
   molecular sample size and on analysis of expanded geometric morphometric
   data that include six newly collected skulls. Morphometric data support
   the existence of previously recognized morphotypes within the complex in
   Colombia and demonstrate that the newly collected material can be
   assigned to the classic Apaporis caiman morphotype. However, our
   expanded genetic analysis fails to find appreciable mitochondrial
   molecular divergence of the Apaporis caiman population from the C. c.
   crocodilus population (COI-CytB: Amazon Peru 0.17 +/- 0.06\%, CytB-only:
   Caqueta River Colombia 0.08 +/- 0.07\%). The Apaporis caiman is
   interpreted to be a phenotypically distinct member of the cis-Andean C.
   crocodilus metapopulation that has not yet achieved (or may not be
   undergoing at all) appreciable genetic differentiation. Thus, it should
   not be considered a fully independent evolutionary lineage, nor given
   full species rank.},

Volume = {137},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {To understand the diversity of ways in which natural materials interact
   with light, it is important to consider how their reflectance changes
   with the angle of illumination or viewing and to consider wavelengths
   beyond the visible. Efforts to characterize these optical properties,
   however, have been hampered by heterogeneity in measurement techniques,
   parameters and terminology. Here, we propose a standardized set of
   measurements, parameters and terminology to describe the optical
   properties of natural objects based on spectrometry, including
   angle-dependent effects, such as iridescence and specularity. We select
   a set of existing measurements and parameters that are generalizable to
   any wavelength range and spectral shape, and we highlight which subsets
   of measures are relevant to different biological questions. As a case
   study, we have applied these measures to 30 species of Christmas
   beetles, in which we observed previously unrealized diversity in visible
   and near-infrared reflectance. As expected, reflection of short
   wavelengths was associated with high spectral purity and angle
   dependence. In contrast to simple, artificial structures, iridescence
   and specularity were not strongly correlated, highlighting the
   complexity and modularity of natural materials. Species did not cluster
   according to spectral parameters or genus, suggesting high lability of
   optical properties. The proposed standardization of measures and
   parameters will improve our understanding of biological adaptations for
   manipulating light by facilitating the systematic comparison of complex
   optical properties, such as glossy or metallic appearances and visible
   or near-infrared iridescence.},

Abstract = {Background matching, a common form of camouflage, is a widespread
   anti-predator adaptation that hinders detection or recognition by
   increasing the resemblance of prey to its environment. However, the
   natural environment is complex and both spatially and temporally
   variable, which constrains effective background matching as an
   anti-predator strategy. Here, using remote sensing data (publicly
   available satellite imagery), we investigated how variation of habitat
   parameters predicts background matching in 16 Sahara-Sahel rodent
   species across spatial and temporal scales. All fur colour parameters
   (hue, saturation and brightness) strongly matched the respective
   habitats of the different species. Background matching in terms of hue
   was best at the microscale, whereas results for saturation and
   brightness showed more variation across spatial scales among species.
   Camouflage across the temporal scale (from 1 to 3 years before capture)
   was variable among species for all colour parameters. These complex
   interactions suggest that, in desert rodents, colour parameters are
   differentially sensitive to the respective scale of the habitat,
   plausibly reflecting the behaviour and life history of the species and
   the ecological properties determining their activity patterns.
   Consequently, the division between habitat (camouflage) generalists and
   specialists might become blurred in temporally changing and spatially
   variable environments.},

Abstract = {Interspecific associations may limit the dispersal of individual
   species, but may also facilitate it when entire co-evolved systems
   expand their geographic ranges. We tested the recent proposal that
   episodic land bridges linked Africa and Madagascar at three stages
   during the Cenozoic by comparing divergence estimates of Madagascar's
   angiosperm taxa with their dispersal mechanisms. Plants that rely on
   gravity for seed dispersal indicate at least two episodes of land
   connection between Africa and Madagascar, in the Early Palaeocene and
   Early Oligocene. Seed dispersal by strepsirrhine primates possibly
   evolved in the Palaeocene, with the divergence of at least one endemic
   Malagasy angiosperm genus, Burasaia (Menispermaceae). This genus may
   have facilitated the lemur colonization of Madagascar. Frugivory,
   nectarivory and gummivory probably generalized in the Oligocene, with
   the co-evolution of modern lemurs and at least 10 new Malagasy
   angiosperm families. In the Late Miocene, more angiosperms were probably
   brought from Africa by birds via a discontinuous land connection, and
   radiated on Madagascar in diffuse association with birds (asities) and
   dwarf nocturnal lemurs (cheirogaleids). During the same connective
   episode, Madagascar was probably colonized by hippopotamuses, which both
   followed and re-seeded a variety of plants, forming the grassy Uapaca
   `tapia' forest and ericoid `savoka' thicket.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the tight mutual specialization between nectarivorous
   birds and ornithophilous plants has been questioned, and instead, high
   degrees of generalization and interaction asymmetry have been
   highlighted. Here, we studied interactions among two sunbirds and four
   plant species in two Mount Cameroon forests, with two plant species from
   each forest. First, we investigated whether sunbirds differ in
   frequencies of visitation to target plant species in natural conditions.
   Second, using a cage experiment, we investigated whether sunbirds prefer
   various plant species, plants with which they are more familiar and that
   occur in the habitat where they were caught and/or the only studied
   ornithophilous plant, Impatiens sakeriana. In natural conditions, the
   short-billed sunbird, Cinnyris reichenowi, fed more on flowers with
   shorter tubes than the long-billed sunbird, Cyanomitra oritis. Likewise,
   sunbirds differed in their experimental preferences. Local plants were
   generally preferred. This was most obvious in the case of I. sakeriana,
   which was often visited by both sunbirds, but only in the habitat where
   it grows naturally. This study supports the importance of associative
   learning. Together with other studies, we suggest that the signalling
   traits of flowers with bird pollination syndromes evolved to filter out
   other visitors rather than to attract bird pollinators.},

Abstract = {Measuring the dispersal ability of birds is particularly challenging and
   thus researchers have relied on the extended use of morphological
   proxies as surrogates for such ability. However, few studies have tested
   the relationship between morphological proxies and other
   dispersal-related traits. In this study, we test the relationship of the
   most commonly used morphological proxy for dispersal-the Hand-Wing Index
   (HWI)-with traits highly associated with dispersal abilities, such as
   geographic range size, migratory behaviour and migratory distances. We
   used the Emberizoidea superfamily to evaluate these relationships and
   measured the HWI of 2520 individuals from 431 species (almost half of
   all the species in the superfamily). We first estimated the phylogenetic
   signal of HWI and searched for the best evolutionary model to explain
   its variation. We then performed PGLS analyses to assess the
   relationships between HWI and dispersal abilities. Our results showed
   that HWI has a strong phylogenetic signal and is positively related to
   dispersal abilities. Our findings support the use of HWI as a viable
   morphological proxy for dispersal in birds.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change is intensifying in Amazonia through, among
   other causes, the higher frequency of both severe droughts and floods
   due to El Nino and La Nina events as well as an Atlantic influence. Over
   a 25-year period (1997-2021) we examined in French Guiana the impact of
   different climatic parameters on the most frequent social wasp, Polybia
   bistriata (Polistinae). As it commonly nests on Clusia grandiflora
   (Clusiaceae), its nests are easily found. Heavy rainfall, particularly
   during the 1999-2000 La Nina episode, negatively affected this social
   wasp species as the percentage of Clusia sheltering an active P.
   bistriata nest decreased from approximate to 40\% during the pre-2000
   period to zero in 2021. We conclude that extreme wet seasons related to
   climate change translated into the decline of this species and likely
   were detrimental to many other polistine wasps of north-eastern
   Amazonia.},

Abstract = {Morphological integration of skull modules can explain the outstanding
   morphological diversity of the rostrum in phyllostomids, the largest
   radiation of bats in the Western Hemisphere. However, the covariation of
   the rostral and caudal modules within adaptive zones, where
   specializations may impose constraints on morphological diversification,
   remains unknown. Here we used phylogenetic linear models and accounted
   for phylogenetic uncertainty to examine the evolutionary relationship
   between brain volume-as a proxy for neurocranium size-and palate
   morphology in 42 species of specialized frugivores of the subfamily
   Stenodermatinae. We found that the palate surface area increased and
   became relatively wider as brain size increased. This pattern may be
   pervasive in frugivorous phyllostomids, although different lineages may
   show different rates of covariation. These results demonstrate that the
   tight relationship between the two main modules of the skull is
   consistent at different macroevolutionary scales, providing new insights
   into the macroevolutionary dynamics of the largest group of Neotropical
   frugivorous bats.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The article analyses the experience of international scientific
   cooperation in the Arctic in organising and conducting an academic
   Swedish-Russian Arc-of-Meridian expedition to the Spitsbergen
   archipelago in 1898-1901. This was one of the largest projects of its
   kind in history. The military and naval government agencies of the two
   countries were extremely interested in measuring the meridian arc near
   the Geographic North Pole. The fulfilment of this task made it possible
   to more accurately determine the shape of the Earth as a geoid. This was
   the significant and fundamental result of testing the hypothesis of the
   Newton-Huygens spheroid and was of applied importance. Funding for the
   expeditionary activities was carried out on a parity basis from the
   budgets of the two nations. The study of archival documents from the
   collections of the Russian Academy of Sciences Archives enabled an
   understanding of the unprecedented financial and physical costs of
   preparing and carrying out expeditionary work. Analysing inter-academic
   research of the late nineteenth - early twentieth centuries is valuable
   for understanding the potential interactions between the government and
   academic structures of international scientific cooperation in the
   Arctic during the modern era.},

Abstract = {A review of historical documents concerning the 1859 discovery of the
   skeleton of a member of the 1845 Franklin expedition on southern King
   William Island revealed a significant but previously unrecognized
   geographical error about the site's reported and mapped location.
   Archeological investigations conducted in 2019 established the site's
   correct location and the fact that it had unwittingly been rediscovered
   in 1973. Misconceptions concerning the site's location and key aspects
   of its interpretation highlight the importance of careful evaluation of
   historical and archeological data regarding the 1845 Franklin

Abstract = {Psalidodon fasciatus is a complex of several fish species widely
   distributed in Brazilian hydrographic systems that share morphological
   characteristics and show a high taxonomic complexity and genetic
   variability. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses were carried out in
   populations from three Brazilian hydrographic basins, aiming to
   contribute to systematic and biogeographical knowledge of the group. The
   chromosomal markers verified the occurrence of species-specific
   characters and indicated the existence of six distinct operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs): P. fasciatus (Sao Francisco River basin),
   Psalidodon sp. 1, Psalidodon sp. 2 and Psalidodon eigenmanniorum
   (Uruguay River basin); and Psalidodon sp. 3 and Psalidodon sp. 4 (Parana
   River basin). The chromosomal markers showed more similarities among
   species from the Uruguay River and Sao Francisco River basins. DNA
   barcoding analyses (assemble species by automatic partitioning,
   neighbour-joining, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony) indicated
   the existence of at least three distinct OTUs. The chromosomal evolution
   rates were demonstrated to be higher than the molecular evolution rates,
   reinforcing the importance of using chromosomal markers to delimit OTUs
   in integrative taxonomy studies. These results suggest that the Sao
   Francisco River Basin population (the type locality) should be
   considered as true P. fasciatus, and the others, until now treated as
   Psalidodon aff. fasciatus, are cryptic species.},

Abstract = {The history of a lineage is intertwined with the history of the
   landscape it inhabits. Here we showcase how the geo-tectonic and
   climatic evolution of South Asia and surrounding landmasses have shaped
   the biogeographical history of Indoplanorbis exustus, a tropical Asian,
   freshwater snail. We amplified partial COI gene fragments from all over
   India and combined this with a larger dataset from South and Southeast
   Asia to carry out phylogenetic reconstruction, species delimitation
   analysis and population genetic analyses. Two nuclear genes were also
   amplified from a few individuals per putative species to carry out
   divergence dating and ancestral area reconstruction analyses. The
   results suggest that I. exustus dispersed out of Africa into India
   during the Eocene. Furthermore, molecular data suggest I. exustus is a
   species complex consisting of multiple putative species. Primary
   diversification took place in the Northern Indian plains or in Northeast
   India. The speciation events appear to be primarily allopatric caused by
   a series of aridification events starting from the late Miocene to early
   Pleistocene. None of the species appears to have any underlying genetic
   structure suggestive of high vagility. All the species underwent
   population fluctuations during the Pleistocene, probably driven by the
   Quaternary climatic fluctuations.},

Title = {Early developmental stages of the sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis

Abstract = {Early developmental stages of echinoids have been thoroughly studied but
   continue to offer remarkable insights for the current understanding of
   biological sciences. The sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis has been
   commonly tested by exposing its developmental stages to a variety of
   stressors, but current descriptions about developmental time and
   morphological features are lacking. This study aimed to describe for the
   first time the embryonic and larval development of Sphaerechinus
   granularis with detailed light micrographs and morphological
   measurements. Adult sea urchins were obtained and spawned to rear
   embryos and larvae in laboratory conditions at 19 degrees C until
   competence. Development was monitored by observing individuals in a
   light microscope and taking microphotographs for description. Embryonic
   development from fertilization to two-arm pluteus lasted 72 h post
   fertilization and larvae reached a competent stage 33 days post
   fertilization. Skeletal post oral rods in larvae from this research
   lacked lateral spines, which were illustrated by other authors in
   previous studies. This intraspecific variation should be further studied
   to understand changes in functional morphology of populations from the
   same species. Development from fertilization to metamorphosis of S.
   granularis can be achieved under laboratory conditions in less than 40
   days. This original article offers the first detailed description for
   both embryonic and larval stages of this species, including light
   microphotographs, and can be used as a comprehensive description of S.
   granularis larval development, as well as a baseline to establish a
   rearing protocol.},

Abstract = {Megabenthic communities on continental margins benefit from structural
   complexity of the seafloor and sedimentary dynamics. These communities
   were tested in the outer margins of the Yucatan continental shelf (YCS)
   during August 2016 to evaluate the relationships between community
   attributes with environmental variables. The total capture was 1,366
   10(3) ind km(-2) and 2,078kg ash free dry weight (AFDW) km(-2),
   distributed among 319 species. Crustaceans and molluscs were co-dominant
   in abundance (576,629 ind km(-2) similar to 42.2\% and 481,372 ind
   km(-2) similar to 35.2\%), while crustaceans and sponges were the
   greatest contributors to community biomass (699.84kg AFDW km(-2) similar
   to 33.6\% and 47.8kg AFDW km(-2) similar to 23.0\%). Local diversity was
   higher than reported for other areas of the GoM, showing a
   pseudo-latitudinal gradient of richness related to the karstic bottom
   and autogenic species. Beta diversity showed no species loss in these
   communities. The BIOENV test pointed to longitude, temperature, sorting,
   vanadium, 2.6-dimethyl naphthalene, latitude, chlorophyll, average grain
   size, n-C-16 and n-C-23 as the most important variables. Hydrocarbons
   were recorded at lower concentrations than the threshold effects level
   (TEL) reference values; however, the significant correlation between
   richness and dibenzothiophene must be evaluated. Beta diversity
   exhibited a high turnover and functional diversity showed an absence of
   regional distribution. Differences in benthic megafauna among sites were
   because of gradients in latitude and concentrations of aliphatic
   compounds which can be attributed to the distance from the stations to
   the coastline or groundwater flow. Environmental monitoring programmes
   are recommended because of petrogenic compounds that influence the
   community structure.},

Title = {The interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship in rocky intertidal
   communities},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {A commonly assumed pattern in species assemblages is the
   abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR), which refers to a relationship
   between the mean local abundance of each species and the proportion of
   local sites that each species occupies. The AOR concept is relevant
   because it allows researchers to make inferences or predictions between
   species abundance and occupancy, which are key variables in ecology.
   Although the AOR is thought to be ubiquitous, it has not been found for
   every system where it has been tested. To date, the studies that have
   evaluated its generality were largely done in terrestrial systems.
   Therefore, there is a need to evaluate its occurrence in aquatic
   systems. This study tests whether the AOR occurs in rocky intertidal
   systems. Using data for algae and invertebrates from Atlantic Canada, we
   show that the negative binomial model properly describes the
   relationship between abundance and occupancy in rocky intertidal
   communities. Moreover, we found the AOR to hold for two hydrodynamically
   contrasting habitat types. Overall, these findings expand the
   applicability of the AOR to marine benthic systems. The raw data are
   included as part of this article and should be valuable for future
   syntheses on the AOR, as such studies will benefit from using datasets
   spanning terrestrial and aquatic systems. In this sense, our abundance
   data are particularly relevant because they describe density of
   organisms, which is a condition for AOR modelling that intertidal
   ecological studies typically do not follow entirely, as the abundance of
   sessile species is often measured as percent cover.},

Abstract = {Nemipterus randalli is one of the most commercially important fish
   species along the Indian coast. Specimens were sampled from
   Visakhapatnam, northern Bay of Bengal, along the east coast of India. We
   analysed the data generated in the present study with previously
   available sequences from the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Red Sea and the
   Mediterranean Sea. Intraspecific variation in COI sequences between the
   Visakhapatnam and other locales varied from 0.7-1.1\%. Also, analysis of
   D-loop sequences revealed deep genetic divergence with high pairwise
   phi(ST) values (0.77-0.89). Results identified a distinct population of
   N. randalli from Visakhapatnam. To conserve genetic integrity, special
   attention and detailed studies are needed on the Visakhapatnam
   population of N. randalli in the northern Bay of Bengal.},

Abstract = {The main fisheries of northern shrimp in Icelandic waters are located
   west and north of Iceland. These locations are studied in an annual
   survey to estimate stock size and distribution of northern shrimp. In
   July 2015, an additional survey was conducted to study the benthic
   community structure and function to describe the habitat where the
   northern shrimp fisheries take place. Underwater images were taken from
   26 stations, grab samples were collected at 11 stations and in addition,
   by-catch was collected from the annual Icelandic shrimp survey in August
   2015. The sampling sites, despite being distributed throughout a
   relatively large area north of Iceland, were rather uniform in relation
   to sediment type and fauna composition. The stations were similar in
   grain size and dominated by soft sediment of sand and silt/mud and soft
   sediment fauna. The infauna was mainly burrowing infauna with affinity
   to soft sediment and surface deposit feeding. The epifauna were
   free-living crawlers with affinity for predation feeding habit. No
   relationship with environment was observed for either the epifauna or
   the infauna. Species diversity and community composition did not vary
   with depth, probably because of the narrow depth range of the sites.
   This study provides the first data on benthic in- and epifauna in
   northern shrimp fishery locations north of Iceland, which can later be
   used to estimate possible changes and/or the effect of shrimp fishing
   within this area.},

Abstract = {The goal-directedness of biological evolution is realized via the
   anticipatory achievement of the final state of the system that
   corresponds to the condition of its perfection in self-maintenance and
   in adaptability. In the course of individual development, a biological
   system maximizes its power via synergistic effects and becomes able to
   perform external work most efficiently. In this state, defined as
   stasis, robust self-maintaining configurations act as attractors
   resistant to external and internal perturbations. This corresponds to
   the local energy-time constraints that most efficiently fit the integral
   optimization of the whole system. In evolution, major evolutionary
   transitions that establish new states of stasis are achieved via
   codepoiesis, a process in which the undecided statements of existing
   coding systems form the basis for the evolutionary unfolding of the
   system by assigning new values to them. The genetic fixation of this
   macroevolutionary process leads to new programmes of individual
   development representing the process of natural computation. The
   phenomenon of complexi?cation in evolution represents a metasystem
   transition that results in maximization of a system's power and in the
   ability to increase external work performed by the system.},

Title = {Population level variation in silk chemistry but not web architecture in

Abstract = {Spider webs are iconic examples of extended phenotypes that are
   remarkably plastic across different environments. Orb webs are not only
   effective traps for capturing prey, but can also provide information to
   potential mates and, in some cases, potential predators and prey through
   silk-based chemicals. As with regular phenotypic traits, variability in
   the properties of spider webs is thought to be mediated by a combination
   of genetic and environmental effects. Here, we examined variation in
   several key features of the webs of the orb-weaving spider Argiope
   keyserlingi across five geographically disparate populations. We
   documented variation in web architecture and chemical properties of webs
   collected directly from the field. We then probed the potential for the
   underlying environmental driver of local insect abundance to explain
   this variation, by analysing the properties of orb webs constructed by
   the spiders from these different populations, but under identical
   laboratory conditions. We found no evidence of variation across
   populations in the architecture of webs constructed in the laboratory,
   despite the large geographic distances. Nonetheless, we discovered
   between population variation in the composition of chemicals found on
   the surface of silk and in the taxonomic distribution of available prey.
   Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the quantity of
   nitrogenous compounds in web silks and female body condition. When
   combined, these findings suggest that environmental mechanisms can drive
   variation in web traits across spider populations.},

Abstract = {The biodiversity within tropical dry forests (TDFs) is astounding and
   yet poorly catalogued due to inadequate sampling and the presence of
   cryptic species. In the Mexican TDF, endemic species are common, and the
   landscape has been continually altered by geological and anthropogenic
   changes. To understand how landscape and environmental variables have
   shaped the population structure of endemic species, we studied the
   recently described species of leaf-toed gecko, Phyllodactylus
   benedettii, in coastal western Mexico. Using double-digest restriction
   site-associated DNA sequencing data, we first explore population
   structure and estimate the number of ancestral populations. The results
   indicate a high degree of genetic structure with little admixture, and
   patterns corresponding to both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. We
   find that genetic structure cannot be explained purely by geographical
   distance, and that ecological corridors may facilitate dispersal and
   gene flow. We then model the spatial distribution of P. benedettii in
   the TDF through time and find that the coastline has been climatically
   suitable for the species since the Last Glacial Maximum. Landscape
   genetic analyses suggest that the combination of isolation by distance
   (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR; forest cover) has influenced the
   spatial genetic structure of the species. Overall, our genomic data
   demonstrate fine-scale population structure in TDF habitat, a complex
   colonization history, and spatial patterns consistent with both IBD and
   other ecological factors. These results further highlight the Mexican
   TDF as a diversity hotspot and suggest that continued anthropogenic
   changes are likely to affect native fauna.},

Title = {Evolution of resource generalism via generalized stress response confers

Abstract = {Generalism should be favoured evolutionarily when there is no genetic
   constraint or loss of fitness across alternative environments. However,
   evolution of generalism can require substantial evolutionary change,
   which can confer a general stress response to other aspects of the
   environment. We created generalist lineages from an ancestral,
   resource-specialized laboratory population of seed beetles
   (Callosobruchus maculatus) by rearing lines over 60 generations on a
   mixture of both ancestral and novel host species to test for costs
   associated with the evolution of generalism involving evolutionary
   changes in gene expression and correlated phenotypic responses during a
   shift to generalism. Evolved lines had higher fitness on the novel
   resource, with no loss of fitness on the ancestral resource, indicating
   that they overcame initial fitness trade-offs. This involved
   upregulation of major stress response (heat shock protein) genes and
   genes coding for metabolic enzymes, suggesting an underpinning metabolic
   and physiological cost. Resource generalist populations also evolved
   greater thermal tolerance breadth, highlighting that the evolution of
   resource generalism might pre-adapt species to respond favourably to
   other environmental stressors, following selection for generalized
   stress response gene upregulation. The rapid gain of novel hosts during
   a pest invasion might also confer greater thermal resilience to ongoing
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Prophalangopsidae was a diverse family during the Late Mesozoic, but the
   variation and sexual dimorphism in their forewing morphologies are
   rarely discussed. Based on 43 specimens - of both sexes - from eight
   species, an investigation into wing venation variation among/within
   species of Prophalangopsidae was performed using geometric morphometrics
   and morphological comparisons. The results indicate that wing characters
   are reliable for taxonomy in fossil Prophalangopsidae and that variation
   in wing shape and venation is common within species. The structures of
   the forewings are analogous between sexes within species, and it is
   possible to pair males and females for a fossil species. Due to the
   potential existence of synonyms arising from the lack of knowledge on
   wing venation variation within species and sexes, the species richness
   of fossil prophalangopsids is probably over-estimated. The role of wing
   venation characters in systematics and phylogenetic analysis needs to be
   further analysed. In addition, two new species of Prophalangopsidae from
   the Middle Jurassic are described.},

Title = {Roald Amundsen's route across the polar plateau in 1911-1912},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Roald Amundsen's exact route from the top of the Axel Heiberg glacier to
   the South Pole and back in 1911-1912 has always been somewhat unclear
   because he never observed his longitude during his southern journey. His
   approach was simply to steer approximately in a true southerly direction
   by magnetic compass as long as obstacles did not force him to deviate.
   The fact that he only knew approximately where he was most of the time
   on the polar plateau never caused any severe problems for him, but it
   complicated the search for a depot during the return journey. Based on
   Amundsen's bearings of some peaks in the Transantarctic Mountains, in
   combination with his compass courses adjusted with accurate values for
   the magnetic declination at the time, this paper elucidates Amundsen's
   actual route across the polar plateau in 1911-1912. The main result is
   that Amundsen must have taken a more easterly route than what previously
   has been assumed.},

   Atlantic goliath grouper in a tropical estuary on the southeastern

   November 2015 and from March 2018 to October 2019. A total of 265
   juveniles ranging from 5.4-50.5 cm were sampled, from which 148
   individuals were tagged using pit tags. Seventeen (11.5\%) of the total
   tagged individuals were recaptured at least once over time, with two
   specimens recaptured on two different occasions. Some recaptures
   occurred in less than a week, while others occurred after six months.
   The length-weight-relationship of all juveniles resulted in a negative
   allometric growth pattern. These findings suggest that the estuary
   represents a suitable and important habitat for juvenile Atlantic

Abstract = {The placement of the southern border of the Neotropical region, called
   the Subtropical Line, is a long-lasting point of discussion. Its most
   debatable section runs around the Pampean province, where an isolated
   mountain system called Ventania has Andean connections surrounded by
   Neotropical biota. To answer where to place the Subtropical Line, a
   thorough revision of the biogeography of Ventania is needed. Thus, we
   characterized Ventania as an area of endemism and conducted a similitude
   analysis to compare it with surrounding systems using stenoic taxa. Then
   we compiled the disjunct distributions in Ventania and the phylogenetic
   information of its endemic taxa to know with which other areas it is
   related. We also compared the biogeographic differences with Tandilia,
   the nearest mountain system. We found that Ventania is a small but
   well-defined area of endemism mostly related to the Andean and South
   American Transition Zone (SATZ) provinces. Relatedness with the Pampean
   province is less than had been thought. We suggest that Ventania is a
   SATZ sky island province, and the smallest continental province of the
   world. The Subtropical Line should therefore be placed in the southern
   border of the Pampean province, with Ventania as a SATZ island inside
   the Neotropical region.},

Abstract = {Anurans have served as models in evolutionary studies on reproduction
   and development. Several generalizations have emerged but it is unclear
   whether they represent the diversity of the entire group. We studied the
   development of two species of the Neotropical family Cycloramphidae.
   Frogs in this family have peculiar spawning sites and developmental
   biologies. Whereas some cycloramphid tadpoles are exotrophic,
   quasi-terrestrial and thrive in films of water that flow over rocky
   outcrops, others are endotrophic, terrestrial and complete their
   development outside the eggs laid on the forest floor, under logs or in
   crevices. Cycloramphid tadpoles have aspects of their morphology
   distinct from those of pond and stream dwellers; they hatch in more
   advanced stages of development and have typical tadpole structures,
   either in a modified form or absent. Herein we present a study of the
   tadpoles of C. lithomimeticus and T. miliaris, in order to document and
   discuss alterations in the ontogeny of several larval structures. These
   changes seem to be associated with adaptations to life in the peculiar
   habitats where the tadpoles thrive. We infer that the observations we
   present are explained by development being associated with aspects of
   terrestrialization and endotrophism.},

Abstract = {The origin of novel complex traits constitutes a central yet largely
   unresolved challenge in evolutionary biology. Intriguingly, many of the
   most promising breakthroughs in understanding the genesis of
   evolutionary novelty in recent years have occurred not in evolutionary
   biology itself, but through the comparative study of development and,
   more recently, the interface of developmental biology and ecology. Here,
   I discuss how these insights are changing our understanding of what
   matters in the origin of novel, complex traits in ontogeny and
   evolution. Specifically, my essay has two major objectives. First, I
   discuss how the nature of developmental systems biases the production of
   phenotypic variation in the face of novel or stressful environments
   toward functional, integrated and, possibly, adaptive variants. This, in
   turn, allows the production of novel phenotypes to precede (rather than
   follow) changes in genotype and allows developmental processes that are
   the product of past evolution to shape evolutionary change that has yet
   to occur. Second, I explore how this nature of developmental systems has
   itself evolved over time, increasing the repertoire of ontogenies to
   pursue a wider range of objectives across an expanding range of
   conditions, thereby creating an increasingly extensive affordance
   landscape in development and developmental evolution. Developmental
   systems and their evolution can thus be viewed as dynamic processes that
   modify their own means across ontogeny and phylogeny. The study of these
   dynamics necessitates more than the strict reductionist approach that
   currently dominates the fields of developmental and evolutionary
   developmental biology.},

Abstract = {Pupil constriction has important functional consequences for animal
   vision, yet the evolutionary mechanisms underlying diverse pupil sizes
   and shapes are poorly understood. We aimed to quantify the diversity and
   evolution of pupil shapes among amphibians and to test for potential
   correlations to ecology based on functional hypotheses. Using
   photographs, we surveyed pupil shape across adults of 1294 amphibian
   species, 74 families and three orders, and additionally for larval
   stages for all families of frogs and salamanders with a biphasic
   ontogeny. For amphibians with a biphasic life history, pupil shape
   changed in many species that occupy distinct habitats before and after
   metamorphosis. In addition, non-elongated (circular or diamond)
   constricted pupils were associated with species inhabiting aquatic or
   underground environments, and elongated pupils (with vertical or
   horizontal long axes) were more common in species with larger absolute
   eye sizes. We propose that amphibians provide a valuable group within
   which to explore the anatomical, physiological, optical and ecological
   mechanisms underlying the evolution of pupil shape.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of oysters along the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf
   and the Gulf of Oman is not well recognized. We present a phylogenetic
   analysis of oyster species in these regions. We combined morphological
   and molecular techniques to obtain the identity of oysters to the lowest
   taxonomic levels. Analysis of partial nucleotide sequences from
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was used for the
   phylogenetic evaluation. Based on our findings, Iranian samples nested
   within the genus Saccostrea and belonged to Saccostrea mordax and
   Saccostrea palmula clades. The shell morphology of the studied samples
   was variable, as in other rock oyster species. The examination of
   morphological features was in line with the molecular outcomes, but
   despite some similarities, Iranian S. palmula had well-developed and
   elongated chomata. The results also showed that S. mordax and S. palmula
   possessed significant relative abundance as dominant oysters in the
   Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that Iranian samples of S. palmula formed a separate subclade
   from the Gulf of California and Panama samples, with large genetic
   distances (6-7\%). Iranian specimens differed morphologically and
   genetically, suggesting that they could be a new species, although more
   research is needed.},

Abstract = {Various ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) may be impacted by the
   present increase in offshore oil exploitation. To identify future
   changes caused by this activity, we assessed the structure of the
   megabenthos community in the Perdido Fold Belt (PFB) and its
   relationships with environmental variables, hydrocarbons, and heavy
   metals. To achieve this, biological and sediment samples were obtained
   during the surveys Perdido II (PII) and Perdido III (PIII). 325.75 10(3)
   ind km(-2) and 582.34 kg AFDW km(-2) were collected, distributed in 110
   species. Crustaceans and echinoderms comprised more than 70\% of the
   total abundance and biomass. The most abundant species were Astropecten
   cingulatus Sladen, 1883, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896, Astropecten
   duplicatus Gray, 1840, and Penaeus aztecus (Ives, 1891) (12.2 10(3) <=
   ind Km(-2) <= 59.4 10(3)). They also had the greatest biomass
   contribution (16.8 <= kg AFDW km(-2) <= 192.2). BIOENV test showed the
   influence of depth (Z), salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), Acenaphthylene
   (Acy), Fluoranthene (Flu), n-C-12, n-C-37, and nickel (Ni) on the
   community structure. Recruitment and trawling also influenced the
   abundance and biomass values. Despite Z defines the environmental
   gradient, the hydrocarbon concentration gradient within the shelf areas
   makes it a good candidate for developing monitoring programmes.},

Abstract = {Trade-offs among life-history traits (e.g. growth, reproduction, and
   survival) are fundamental to the population success of living beings in
   the wild. This study describes the life-history traits of the sergeant
   major, Abudefduf saxatilis, one of those fishes most abundant in the
   coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea. The reproductive biology, age, growth,
   and abundance of a particular population of A. saxatilis from Mexico was
   explored using 12 monthly samplings to collect 414 specimens, and
   abundance monitoring through visual censuses for age-based demographic
   analysis. Our results indicated that A. saxatilis would have an
   opportunistic strategy with a type II survivorship curve since the
   studied population was characterized by fast growth, maturation at
   intermediate sizes (approximate to 11 cm L-T or 2.5 yrs. old), with
   batch spawning and indeterminate fecundity, protracted spawning season
   (January to September), high abundance of recruits, low instantaneous
   natural mortality (M = 0.114 year (-1)), high life expectancy at birth
   (e(0) approximate to 4.7 yrs.) and maturity (e(alpha) approximate to 2.8
   yrs.), and high annual survival of adults and high survival to maturity
   (l proportional to(mat) = 75.0\%). All these life-history traits
   facilitate the population success of A. saxatilis, showing a high
   reproductive effort and a rapid population turnover, making this species
   an efficient colonizer.},

Title = {Between global collaboration and national competition: Unraveling the
   many faces of Arctic science diplomacy},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {It has been argued that science diplomacy (SD) helps avoid or mitigate
   conflicts among stakeholders in the Arctic. Yet underlying some of these
   well-intended and sometimes successful initiatives is a one-sided
   understanding of SD. The most recent literature takes a more
   differentiated approach towards the means and ends of SD. It shows that
   international scientific interaction is shaped by the twofold logic of
   competition and collaboration. Instruments of SD can be meant to serve
   national interests, collective regional goals or global agendas. The
   present paper disentangles these confounding discourses of collaboration
   and competition based on a conceptually enhanced SD framework. It
   analyses Arctic strategies and two cases of Arctic SD, the Agreement on
   Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation and research
   activities on Svalbard, to reveal the mechanisms of collaboration and
   competition in the sphere of international science in relation to
   security, environment and economy. By pointing out where and how science
   is currently being used in the Arctic, this article provides (a) a
   systematic overview of the state of SD in the region and (b) a tool for
   policy-makers and scientists to assess what impact different facets of
   SD have in Arctic politics.},

Abstract = {Thermo-hydroregulation strategies involve concurrent changes in
   functional traits related to energy, water balance and thermoregulation
   and play a key role in determining life-history traits and population
   demography of terrestrial ectotherms. Local thermal and hydric
   conditions should be important drivers of the geographical variation of
   thermo-hydroregulation strategies, but we lack studies that examine
   these changes across climatic gradients in different habitat types.
   Here, we investigated intraspecific variation of morphology and
   thermo-hydroregulation traits in the widespread European common lizard
   (Zootoca vivipara louislantzi) across a multidimensional environmental
   gradient involving independent variation in air temperature and rainfall
   and differences in habitat features (access to free-standing water and
   forest cover). We sampled adult males for morphology, resting metabolic
   rate, total and cutaneous evaporative water loss and thermal preferences
   in 15 populations from the rear to the leading edge of the distribution
   across an elevational gradient ranging from sea level to 1750 m. Besides
   a decrease in adult body size with increasing environmental
   temperatures, we found little effect of thermal conditions on
   thermo-hydroregulation strategies. In particular, relict lowland
   populations from the warm rear edge showed no specific ecophysiological
   adaptations. Instead, body mass, body condition and resting metabolic
   rate were positively associated with a rainfall gradient, while forest
   cover and water access in the habitat throughout the season also
   influenced cutaneous evaporative water loss. Our study emphasizes the
   importance of rainfall and habitat features rather than thermal
   conditions for geographical variation in lizard morphology and
   physiology.},

Title = {Fine-scale geographical sampling and molecular characterization of the

Abstract = {Native to East Africa, the giant African snail Lissachatina
   {[}=Achatina] fulica (Bowdich, 1822) is a tropical crop pest and one of
   the world's top 100 invasive species. It is now present in at least 52
   countries worldwide, with an actively expanding range. Lissachatina
   fulica was first introduced to India in 1847, but subsequent arrivals in
   India and local patterns of spread remain unclear. This study uses the
   16S rRNA gene to identify the extent of genetic variation in India by
   sampling Indian populations and comparing them with published sequence
   data. A total of 307 snails were collected from 178 localities in India
   and from a single locality in the UAE, and the 16S rRNA gene was
   amplified and sequenced. Eight haplotypes were identified from India of
   which four are newly recognized. The new haplotypes identified in this
   study have increased the number of L. fulica 16S rRNA haplotypes from 19
   to 23. Examination of haplotype and nucleotide diversities revealed that
   genetic variation is low in India, the UAE and across Asia as a whole.
   The number of haplotypes was higher in India when compared to other
   invasive regions but all of the Asian haplotypes appear to be closely
   related to the most common haplotypes in the Indian Ocean Islands. Heavy
   trade between the snail-infested and native-range countries suggests
   that the variation observed in India might be traced back to its native
   range, but the lack of sampling and paucity of sequences from East
   Africa currently prevents a comparison. Tracing back the emergent
   haplotypes by additional sampling could throw more light on the spread
   of L. fulica.},

Abstract = {Locomotion in animals follows simple mathematical rules: when active,
   most time is spent at lower velocities and exponentially decreasing time
   is spent at increasing velocities; when inactive, there is an abundance
   of short quiescence periods decreasing by an inverse power function
   towards longer quiescence periods. We investigated whether these
   mathematical rules are `universal', i.e. followed by all animals
   independently of their modes of movement (walking, gliding/crawling,
   swimming) or their habitat (land, water). Using automated video tracking
   with high temporal and spatial resolution, we investigated the velocity
   and quiescence period distributions in ten species representing major
   divisions of the animal kingdom (snails, woodlice, springtail, beetle,
   fish, reptile, chicken and mouse). We confirm that the two functions are
   followed by most species, although we also found important exceptions:
   the snails and woodlice showed uni- or bimodal velocity distributions;
   the snails did not follow the inverse power law of quiescence periods.
   Thus, most animals running on legs or swimming follow the expected
   distributions, while other runners (isopods) and substrate
   gliders/crawlers (snails) do not. We suggest a difference in velocity
   distribution between animals that use running to escape predators and
   those that do not (snails and woodlice).},

Abstract = {The Arabian carpet shark, Chiloscyllium arabicum is endemic to the
   Arabian Gulf and the northern Arabian Sea. The aim of this work is to
   study the reproduction and maturity of this species. A total of 87 males
   and 139 females, including 19 egg-bearing individuals collected from
   bottom set longline fisheries in the Saudi Arabian waters of the Arabian
   Gulf between October 2017 and February 2019, were examined. The size at
   50\% maturity was estimated as 62.3 and 62.5 cm total length (TL) for
   males and females, respectively. Changes in the gonadosomatic index
   (GSI) of males indicated the mating to happen between December and
   February. The maximum follicle diameter, oviducal gland width and GSI in
   mature females, suggested the ovulation to extend from September to May
   with the peak during March-May. Females carried 2-4 egg cases in the
   uteri, and the egg-laying period was between February and May. The
   segregation of sexes was observed in the larger (70-80 cm TL) size
   ranges.},

Abstract = {The warm temperate South-east Pacific coast hosts extensive kelp forests
   that provide protected habitats to benthic organisms such as sponges. To
   soundly understand the interactions between kelps and sponges, a prior
   taxonomic identification of the associated species is necessary. This
   study aimed to report cryptic sponges found associated with the inner
   walls of the holdfast of the kelp Lessonia trabeculata,
   opportunistically collected in the upwelling area of San Juan de Marcona
   (15 degrees S, Peru). Three sponges were identified including one
   Calcarea, Clathrina antofagastensis, and two Demospongiae, Johannesia
   reticulosa and Haliclona (Halichoclona) paracas. None of them was
   previously known to occur associated with kelps. These findings
   highlight the importance of exploring these less-studied (biogenic)
   substrates to uncover hidden marine biodiversity and the need for
   observational or experimental studies addressing the interactions
   developed between kelps and their epiphytozoans.},

Title = {grid-net design that successfully reduces discarded catch and damage to
   benthic species in the veined rapa whelk beam trawl fishery},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5-6},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {In this study, a grid-net design (GND) with three different bar spacings
   was compared with the commercial beam trawl used in the veined rapa
   whelk fishery to minimize the discarded catch amount and the loss of
   commercial product. In addition, the damage and mortality rates of the
   species that entered the tested fishing gear were determined to
   understand whether the tested fishing gear has a possible negative
   effect on benthic species. In the grid-net design, a rectangular
   metallic grid positioned 6 cm off the ground substituted half of the
   codend to allow the escape of discard species. Sea trials were carried
   out in the south-eastern Black Sea between 13 and 24 October 2021.
   Results showed that the discarded catch amount was significantly reduced
   by each GND (P < 0.05). Compared with the commercial fishing gear, the
   reductions in the discarded catch amounts (in terms of number) were
   91.6\%, 92.2\%, and 95.0\% for 22, 25, and 28 mm GNDs, respectively. The
   minimum commercial product loss was determined at 22 mm GND. In
   addition, it was seen that each GND compared to commercial gear caused
   statistically significantly less damage and mortality on the discarded
   species. In conclusion, 22 mm GND was the most successful design among
   the tested gears in minimizing commercial product loss and reducing the
   discarded catch amount. Recommendations are given for this design to be
   adopted by the commercial fleet.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of the gastropod genus Calliotropis Seguenza, 1902
   (Vetigastropoda: Calliotropidae), including fossil and living species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The taxonomic content of the genus Calliotropis and the systematic
   positions of the fossil species referred to this genus have been under
   debate because of the striking resemblance they bear to their extant
   counterparts in terms of general shell morphology and ornament pattern.
   In a recent contribution, two subgenera of Calliotropis were
   preliminarily distinguished and considered to be a result of
   ecomorphological variation translated into evolutionary changes:
   shallow-reef ecomorphotypes, representing the fossil species of
   Calliotropis (Riselloidea), and deep-water ecomorphotypes, grouping the
   living forms of Calliotropis (Calliotropis). However, this division of
   Calliotropis species was based on qualitative grounds, lacking a
   quantitative phylogenetic analysis sampling both modern and fossil taxa.
   The present research aims to comprehensively revisit this systematic
   scheme after a morphological delimitation of calliotropid lineages. We
   use a quantitative phylogenetic analysis to shed light on the
   evolutionary history of this group of gastropods. Our results indicate
   that the Mesozoic genus `Calliotropis' is not monophyletic, but living
   species comprise a monophyletic group with a Pliocene-Recent
   distribution. Fossil `Calliotropis' species represent a paraphyletic
   assemblage composed of different clades: the monophyletic Riselloidea
   (Cossmann) including only Jurassic species; a Palaeogene group
   represented by the new genus Arachnotropis gen. nov.; and a monophyletic
   Triassic group that matches the content of the previously described
   genus Trochonodus Niitzel et al., 2003. The genus Ambercyclus Ferrari et
   al., 2014 is monophyletic and also related to the above-mentioned taxa.},

Abstract = {Microplastics in aquatic ecosystems are one of the emerging threats that
   concern aquatic life and human health. Plastic particles of varied sizes
   are very common in the marine environment, with microplastics disturbing
   aquatic life globally. Aquatic ecosystems play a pivotal role in
   stabilizing the global climate, and also provide a variety of services
   to the growing human population. However, anthropogenic activities
   provoke the microplastics accumulation in the aquatic ecosystems through
   various sources including extensive production, ubiquitous usage, wide
   applications and improper disposal. Recent years have witnessed that
   Indian waterbodies are drowning in plastic waste owing to poor
   management and improper facilities to dispose of plastic effluents. The
   occurrence, distribution and toxicity of microplastics are increasing in
   diverse aquatic sectors of Indian coastlines. The unique physiochemical
   properties, rapid internalization, retention time and long-term impacts
   of microplastics pose threats to aquatic life, and indirectly affect
   human health by fish consumption. A very few studies have reported that
   microplastics pollution is confined to recreational beaches and other
   industrial areas. This review provides additional information to
   understand the extent of microplastic defilement in the waterbodies of
   Indian coastlines, and also create awareness of the emerging
   pollutant-related health issues.},

   and palaeoenvironmental settings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We report a new small podocnemidid, Gestemys powelli gen. et sp. nov.,
   based on one nearly complete skull, lower jaw, two shells, and remains
   of the appendicular skeleton belonging to two specimens from the Eocene
   Geste Formation of the San Antonio de la Cobres Basin, Salta Province,
   north-western Argentina. As in other podocnemidid genera, Gestemys
   exhibits a fully developed and medially extensive cavum pterygoidei, an
   incisura columellae auris enclosing the stapes and Eustachian tube, and
   lacks an exoccipital quadrate contact. Gestemys powelli bears a huge
   foramen palatinum posterius and a short pterygoid flange that does not
   reach the basisphenoid suture, exposing the cavum pterygoid.
   Phylogenetic analyses place Gestemys powelli as a member of
   Podocnemididae more closely related to Erymnochelyinae than
   Podocnemidinae. In regards to the palaeoenvironmental settings of the
   Palaeogene formations (Maiz Gordo and Geste) of north-western Argentina,
   at least two features differentiate the palaeoenvironment where G.
   powelli was recovered and those of other podocnemidid turtles from the
   Maiz Gordo Formation: 1) G. powelli was found in situ with very little
   re-working; and 2) in contrast to the muddy rocks indicating the
   marginal lacustrine setting and humid climate of the Maiz Gordo
   Formation, G. powelli is associated with a coarse-grained floodplain
   setting and a dry, temperate climate. Such differences highlight the
   contrasting environmental dynamics in which podocnemidid turtles lived
   during the Palaeogene.},

Abstract = {Four complete isolated neurocrania excavated during the nineteenth
   century in the Autun Basin (Saone-et-Loire, France) were used by Heyler
   \& Poplin (1982) to erect two species: the symmoriiform Bibractopiscis
   niger and the xenacanthiform Orthacanthus commailli. However, the
   specimens have not been mechanically prepared and only a portion of
   their anatomy is available, complicating their systematic attribution.
   We revise their systematic status by using X-ray computed
   microtomography and new comparative material from the Bourbon
   l'Archambault Basin (Allier, France). This method allows access to the
   hidden anatomy of the specimens and new systematic revision: we propose
   O. commailli to be left in open nomenclature as ?Xenacanthimorpha. The
   specimens attributed to B. niger encompass two distinct morphologies:
   the holotype, one paratype and a neurocranium from the Bourbon
   l'Archambault Basin are identified as cf. Triodus sp. The last paratype
   is left in open nomenclature as `Ctenacanthiformes' indet. We included
   these neurocrania in geometric morphometric and cladistic analyses of a
   large sample of Palaeozoic chondrichthyans. Based on the results we
   propose an evolutionary scenario for the neurocranial transition between
   the orders `Ctenacanthiformes' and Xenacanthiformes. This transition
   mostly affects the ethmo-orbital region. The revision of the diversity
   of these chondrichthyan faunas calls into question potential differences
   in trophic structures between the different European
   Carboniferous-Permian basins.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},

Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {In this commentary, I investigate the Poles differently, and in situ,
   rather than only as stereotypically barren uninhabited expansive places
   on a globe or maps. The human stories are behind the relatively white
   space on which few place names are marked. But the more visible ones are
   made and told through a male-dominated, colonial narrator and mapmaker,
   until more recently. Cartography, like history, has overwhelmingly
   documented men's worlds, stories, dominations and accomplishments,
   creating a virtual whiteout of women's and notably Indigenous women's
   stories also in polar regions. In this commentary, I report on a journey
   into (re)mapmaking I did of women's stories told through female place
   names and toponymies of women especially in the Antarctic, through a
   crowd-sourced project, Mapping Antarctic Women. I explore not only
   mapping female place names and women's stories in the Arctic, exploring
   gendered, colonial and western culture mapping but also newer digital
   Indigenous place name mapping and also mapping of human-exacerbated
   changes in the ice that makes the Antarctic map.},

Title = {Phylogeny of the amphibamiform temnospondyls: the relationship of taxa
   known by adults, larvae and neotenes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Amphibamiformes, small temnospondyls from late Palaeozoic rocks,
   have been increasingly considered as the stem-group of some or all
   extant amphibians (Lissamphibia). Their relationships have become
   intensely studied after the discovery of new taxa and the revision of
   poorly known ones, but understanding is hampered by the fact that
   amphibamiforms fall into two very distinct groups: (a) terrestrial taxa
   known by adults only (Amphibamidae, Micropholidae) and (b) aquatic taxa
   known by larvae and neotenic adults (Branchiosauridae). The
   Branchiosauridae were recognized as a clade supported by a suite of
   larval synapomorphies, but the unknown larval morphology of the
   terrestrial clades leaves the question open to whether some
   branchiosaurid apomorphies might have been more widely distributed.
   Recently, some branchiosaurid specimens from NATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
   ACUTErany (Czech Republic) were proposed to be larvae of olsoniforms and
   amphibamids, and together with a revision of ancient branchiosaurid-like
   taxa from the United States and France prompt a re-analysis of this
   issue. In a phylogenetic analysis of 48 taxa and 113 characters, the
   Branchiosauridae were found to be monophyletic and nest in an unresolved
   trichotomy with Amphibamidae and the putative relatives of Lissamphibia.
   The present analysis finds the hypothesized olsoniform larvae from NATIN
   SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTErany to be adults of Branchiosaurus
   salamandroides, whereas some of the larvae from Mazon Creek (Illinois,
   USA) are not branchiosaurids, but immature specimens of the amphibamid
   Amphibamus grandiceps. Within branchiosaurids, four clades have been
   identified: (a) the Carboniferous Anthracobamus clade (Anthracobamus,
   Montceaubatrachus), (b) the mostly Carboniferous Branchiosaurinae
   (Branchiosaurus, Milnererpeton) and two largely Permian clades, the
   newly defined Apateoninae (genus Apateon) and Leptorophinae
   (Melanerpeton, Leptorophus, Schoenfelderpeton) clade. Branchiosaurid
   evolution involved a trend towards an enhanced paedomorphosis, a
   modification of branchial teeth, and successive reduction of bone in the
   scales and pectoral girdle.},

Abstract = {The ontogenetic and interannual variations in the diet and feeding
   strategy of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) were examined based on
   1302 specimens collected by a trawling net off the southern coast of
   Hokkaido from late June to early July during 2016-2020. The diet
   comprised 63 species (13 taxa). Fish was the most important prey,
   followed by decapod crustaceans. In 2016, walleye pollock (Gadus
   chalcogrammus) was the dominant fish prey species, while amphipods,
   decapods and Japanese lanternfish (Notoscopelus japonicus) were
   prominent in the diet in 2017. Japanese sardine (Sardinops
   melanostictus) were more predominant during 2018-2020. An ontogenetic
   comparison of diet indicated that smaller individuals (<= 400 mm
   standard length, SL) preyed mainly on small prey items, such as decapod
   crustaceans and polychaetes, whereas larger individuals (>400 mm SL)
   preyed mainly on fish. Moreover, prey size exhibited a significant
   increasing trend with predator body length. These results suggest that
   Pacific cod has a flexible feeding strategy that differs by life stage.
   The updated information on predator-prey relationships provided herein
   improves our understanding of energy flow in the marine ecosystem and
   could facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management strategies.},

Abstract = {Seawater temperature, oxygen, salinity and pH are important abiotic
   factors, changes in which can generate stress in marine organisms.
   Subtidal and intertidal species, such as the sand dollar Dendraster
   excentricus, are daily exposed to stressors against which they have
   developed survival mechanisms to face environmental challenges.
   Analysing the expression of some key genes in response to stress factors
   due to changes in temperature and pH, especially in the early stages of
   development, opens a window of knowledge on the effect that these
   stressors have on benthos marine organisms. In the present work larvae
   and post-larvae of D. excentricus were exposed to high temperature and
   low pH scenarios. Survival, size and gene expression of five genes,
   involved in both stress response (hsp70 IV and hsp90 beta-like) and
   biomineralization for skeletogenesis (sm29, sm30A, carbonic anhydrase
   14-like and mitochondrial proton/calcium exchanger protein LOC575637),
   were analysed in 4-, 6-, 8-arms, competent larvae and post-larvae.
   Survival of stressed larvae and post-larvae presented a significant
   decrease, up to 37\% in some stages. A size reduction of almost 30 mu m
   was observed when larvae were exposed to stressful conditions, except in
   competent larvae and in post-larvae where no significant changes were
   detected. After stress treatments, transcripts of hsp90 beta-like were
   up-regulated in all larval stages but hsp70 IV transcripts were not.
   Under tested stressful conditions sm29 and sm30A expression was
   down-regulated in larvae and post-larvae, while carbonic anhydrase
   14-like and LOC575637 expressions were up-regulated. It is evident that
   tolerance to changes in seawater temperature and pH has a direct effect
   on metabolic functions of D. excentricus larvae and post-larvae, which
   depends on the developmental stage. If laboratory results are
   extrapolated to marine ecosystems, it is possible that populations of
   this structuring organism may be disturbed with subsequent damage to
   ecosystem balance, until resilient organisms acclimatize and adapt to
   their changing habitats.},

Title = {Under pressure: Cassiopea andromeda jellyfish exposed to increasing
   water temperature or lead, cadmium and anthropogenic gadolinium
   contamination},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Similar to other cnidarians such as stony corals, the upside-down
   jellyfish (Cassiopea spp.) lives in endosymbiosis with dinoflagellates
   of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These jellyfish have been described as
   invasive species and are now found circumtropically in coastal marine
   environments. This study investigates the response of Cassiopea
   andromeda and its symbiotic algae to increased water temperature,
   further elucidating potential impacts of climate change on its
   populations in tropical ecosystems. It is demonstrated that water
   temperatures above 34 degrees C are lethal for the C. andromeda medusae
   tested in this study. A non-lethal temperature rise triggers significant
   changes in the animals behaviour and physiology, including significant
   changes in bell pulsation rate and a significant decrease in
   photochemical efficiency, once 33 degrees C is reached. Additionally, it
   is demonstrated that C. andromeda is capable of bioconcentrating
   significant amounts of cadmium from the surrounding water column. In the
   case of lead exposure, the jellyfish appear capable of regulating
   intake; no significant bioconcentration has been observed in this study.
   Our results do not indicate significant differences between the uptake
   patterns of anthropogenically complexed gadolinium chelates - emerging
   aquatic pollutants originating from hospital effluents - and the
   natural, non-chelated rare earth element terbium. This study supports
   the potential use of Cassiopea jellyfish as an attractive bioindicator
   species, serving to detect both continuous and pulse-contamination of
   coastal marine ecosystems. Cassiopea andromeda appears stable up until
   temperatures of about 34 degrees C, suggesting that temperature increase
   concomitant with climate change might drive important range extensions
   of this tropical species into new environments - environments in which
   the holobiont will play significant roles in local pollutant dynamics.},

Title = {Catch composition of non-target species escaping dredge gear of Rapana
   fisheries in the western coast of the Black Sea},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of Rapana fisheries in the Black Sea region, few
   studies have focused on the non-target species, and determined discard
   rates from hauls on the deck, with no data on organisms that entered and
   subsequently escaped the fishing net during the dredge fishing. Rapana
   venosa is harvested along the entire coast of the Black Sea using
   dredging or beam-trawl fishing. This study adopted the cover net method
   to assess the composition and proportion of non-target escapees in
   Rapana fisheries by dredging along the western coast of the Black Sea.
   In this method, the dredge net bag (codend net) is covered with a second
   net bag that has a smaller mesh size to retain those individuals
   escaping from the dredge net bag. Up to 87\% of the total similar to
   1.4x10(6) individuals per km (ind. km(-2)) cover net catches belonged to
   non-target species. Overall, 24 non-target species were caught in the
   cover net, with 46\% of species belonging to the Teleostei (mostly
   flatfishes), 21\% Malacostraca, 17\% Bivalvia, 8\% Gastropoda, 4\%
   Amphibia, and 4\% Ascidiacea. On the other hand, up to 6.8\% of the
   total similar to 0.16x10(6) ind. km(-2) catches of the codend net
   (dredge net) belonged to non-target species. Compared to the cover net,
   a total of seven non-target species were retained in the codend net, and
   six of them belonged to Bivalvia. This study demonstrated an apparent
   negative impact of Rapana fisheries, particularly on escapees that often
   go unaccounted for their vulnerability to stress and physical damage.},

Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Prior to 2009, it had been generally accepted that Captain Crozier was
   born in September 1796 and most likely on the 17th of that month.
   Further research, published in this Journal, then suggested that upon a
   fresh scrutiny of the evidence the alternative date of 16 August 1796
   was more probable. This note proposes that whilst the date of 16 August
   was of significance to Captain Crozier, that significance was other than
   natal and furthermore that alternative evidence, namely a letter dated
   20 March 1810 from his father to the 3rd Marquess of Downshire, records
   his date of birth as being 17 October 1796.},

Title = {The short-term development of performance and aerobic endurance
   following prolonged low-intensity ski trekking in Svalbard: A case study},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {The purpose of this case study was to examine the short-term development
   of performance and aerobic endurance following prolonged low-intensity
   ski trekking (LIST) in an Arctic region. Two male recreational athletes
   (aged 24 and 26 years) with high aerobic fitness performed LIST 7 +/- 2
   h center dot day(-1) for 23 consecutive days, while hauling sledges
   (similar to 80 kg initially) with supplies from the north to the south
   of Svalbard (similar to 640 km). Time to exhaustion, maximal oxygen
   uptake (V?O-2max), lactate threshold (LT) and work economy were
   evaluated at pre- and post-trek. The results showed that the absolute
   and relative exercise intensity during LIST were similar to 3.9 km
   center dot h(-1) and similar to 60\% of maximal heart rate,
   respectively. Time to exhaustion during a similar to 4-6 min ramp
   walking test, and a >45 min stepwise walking test, while pulling 12.5 kg
   weights (simulation of ski trekking with loaded sledge), increased by
   11-17\% and 3-9\%, respectively, following LIST. Body mass and V?O-2max
   relative to body mass (ml center dot kg(-1)center dot min(-1)) decreased
   by 5-8\% and increased by 3-8\%, respectively. Furthermore, the workload
   associated with LT and LT percentage of V?O-2max increased by 39-69\%
   and 12-13\%, respectively. No notable change in work economy was
   observed. The mean pace during LIST (similar to 3.9 km center dot h(-1))
   corresponded to the treadmill walking speed (4 km center dot h(-1)) with
   the lowest oxygen cost (mL center dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1)) in both
   participants. It can be concluded that short-term prolonged LIST can
   improve ski trek-simulated performance and fractional utilisation of
   V?O-2max in recreational athletes with high aerobic fitness. Moreover,
   highly aerobically fit ski trekkers appear to instinctively choose the
   most energy-efficient pace during LIST.},

Title = {Xinjiangchelyid turtles from the Middle Jurassic of the Berezovsk coal
   mine (Krasnoyarsk Territory, Russia): systematics, skeletal morphology,
   variation, relationships and palaeobiogeographic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the description of a new species of
   xinjiangchelyid turtle - Annemys variabilis sp. nov. - represented by
   thousands of isolated bones and several more complete specimens from the
   Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) Itat Formation of the Berezovsk coal mine,
   Krasnoyarsk Territory, western Siberia, Russia. The description is based
   on a sample of the best-preserved specimens. The new species differs
   from other Annemys spp. by a combination of cranial and shell
   characters. The basisphenoids (about 200 specimens) of A. variabilis
   demonstrate variation in 12 characters, some of which are reported in
   turtles for the first time. About 20 shell characters of A. variabilis
   are subject to ontogenetic or interindividual variation. Some of these
   characters are variable in other Annemys spp. and other
   xinjiangchelyids. The formula of the cervical vertebrae
   {[}(2(3()4()5()6()7()8) or (2(3()4()5()6()7()8(] with two opisthocoelous
   vertebrae (2 and 3), four or five amphicoelous vertebrae (4-7 or 4-8),
   and one procoelous vertebra is unique for this species among
   xinjiangchelyids, which were previously known to have only amphicoelous
   cervicals. Other characters of the non-shell postcranium correspond to
   those of other xinjiangchelyids. Of the three phylogenetic analyses
   performed in this study, Analysis 1 does not support the monophyly of
   either Xinjiangchelyidae or Annemys, Analysis 2 shows paraphyly of
   Xinjiangchelyidae and monophyly of the Annemys clade (A. latiens, A.
   levensis, A. variabilis and A. wusu), and Analysis 3 supports monophyly
   of the Annemys clade with A. latiens, A. levensis and A. variabilis,
   only in the majority rule consensus tree. The diversity of the turtle
   assemblage of the Itat Formation is re-assessed as containing 2-3 taxa
   (A. variabilis {[}=Testudines indet. 2], Testudines indet. 1 and 3),
   which is in agreement with similar diversities seen in some other Middle
   Jurassic Asian turtle assemblages. The known record of Annemys spp. is
   restricted to the northern part of Asia.

Abstract = {The Silurian Waukesha Lagerstatte of Wisconsin, USA, hosts a fauna of
   distinctive soft-bodied organisms, including a range of graptolites,
   worms, trilobites and uncommon arthropods, but otherwise lacks most of
   the shelly fauna typical of contemporaneous deposits. While several
   species have been described, much of the Waukesha biota remains
   understudied. Here, we examine numerous specimens of a previously
   unnamed and undescribed vermiform arthropod that bears a cephalic
   carapace, a suite of specialized head appendages, a long, segmented
   trunk, and a battery of small swimming appendages. The taxonomic and
   phylogenetic evaluations presented herein establish this taxon as a
   novel genus and species, Acheronauta stimulapis gen. et sp. nov.,
   plausibly positioned within the basal mandibulates. Our phylogenetic
   analyses suggest that a new arthropod clade may be warranted, comprising
   Acheronauta gen. nov., Captopodus, and the thylacocephalans.},

Abstract = {The family Cynodontidae is composed of freshwater fishes inhabiting
   drainages east of the Andes in South America. Its fossil record is
   mostly represented by isolated teeth that are difficult to identify.
   Here we describe fossil cranial remains of the extant species Hydrolycus
   scomberoides as well as isolated teeth that were identified as
   Hydrolycus and cf. Rhaphiodon in sediments of the late Pliocene Ware
   Formation in the Guajira Peninsula, west of the Andes. Novel,
   phylogenetically informative characters were found including the number
   of symphysial teeth, the plane of insertion of the leading teeth onto
   the dentary, the presence of accessory posterior dentigerous patches,
   and depressions and outline of the dentary. We performed a phylogenetic
   analysis combining morphological and molecular characters including both
   extant and extinct specimens, producing a well-resolved topology that
   recovers a novel sister-group relationship between the genera Hydrolycus
   and Cynodon, while the genus Rhaphiodon falls to the base of this clade.
   This contradicts earlier studies recovering Hydrolycus and Rhaphiodon as
   sister taxa. The phylogenetic position of Hydrolycus wallacei was found
   to be unstable. The occurrence of H. scomberoides in the late Pliocene
   of Guajira is a puzzle that could be explained by different mechanisms,
   including a persistent drainage connection across the Andes during the
   late Pliocene, and/or the result of severe drying and subsequent
   extinction.},

Abstract = {Science diplomacy can be defined as ``the use of scientific
   collaborations between countries to address joint problems and to build
   constructive international partnerships for delivering effective
   scientific advice for policy making{''}. During the last 10 years, the
   Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR) has been
   active in finding ways to solve global Grand Challenges, particularly
   climate change and poor air quality in polluted megacities, and at the
   same time, better bridge research to international climate policy and
   science diplomacy processes. INAR has introduced Pan-Eurasian Experiment
   programme running since the year 2012 (www.atm.helsinki.fi/peex) to
   better address the scientific challenge to understand Atmosphere - Earth
   Surface - Biosphere interactions and feedbacks in the Northern Eurasian
   context. INAR has also launched a measurement concept called the Global
   Network of Stations Measuring Earth Surface and Atmosphere Interactions
   (GlobalSMEAR) and has hosted the European Centre of the International
   Eurasian Academy of Sciences since 2015. Most recently, INAR has
   coordinated the Arena for the gap analysis of the existing Arctic
   Science Co-Operations (AASCO), 2020-2021, to promote research with a
   holistic and integrated approach in understanding feedbacks and
   interactions globally and locally at the Arctic and outside the Arctic
   environments.},

Title = {Knowledge, innovation and the race to the South Pole},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {The present article extends recent studies that ask what might else have
   been considered by Scott and Amundsen in planning their sledging
   operations to reach the South Pole during the southern summer of
   1911/12. Both were on the cusp of changes in exploration methods and had
   at hand significant knowledge from past expeditions. Scott's
   preparations were based on British Arctic experiences using several
   haulage methods including the recent innovation, motor sledges. He had
   little success with them although more research and experimentation
   might have made them valuable. Amundsen's integrated program was based
   on previous American and Norwegian exploration in the Arctic and
   Antarctica. The race was between two men with very different
   backgrounds. Scott and Amundsen belonged to the same generation, Scott
   followed the romantic tradition of heroism as suffering; whereas
   Amundsen came from a culture that did not value unnecessary risk to life
   and limb. He won the race with a different organizational type and a
   different approach to gathering and using knowledge. Evolutionary
   economics with its focus on organizational structure and its impact on
   the use of knowledge and innovation is used to evaluate the plans and
   results of Scott and Amundsen.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},

Volume = {58},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Science diplomacy has been instrumental in facilitating cooperation in
   the Arctic region, yet through the projection of vast hydrocarbon
   potential in the region, it has also served to undermine the major
   transformation necessary in Arctic decision-making towards the goals of
   climate governance. This article surveys the translation of science from
   the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reports (i.e. the CARA study
   and Factsheet 2008-3049) on Arctic oil and gas and its transformation
   into common knowledge within Arctic discourse through repetition by the
   agents in between and its subsequent adoption into Arctic policy
   documents. In this process, we interrogate the production of the science
   underpinning US science diplomacy and the influence of this science on
   international Arctic discourse and policy use science diplomacy. This
   paper contributes to the literature of science diplomacy in the Arctic
   by examining the contributions of the USGS to Arctic policy discourses
   and its impact on Arctic governance at the nexus of science diplomacy on

Title = {In search of the origin of an Antarctic ghost ship: The legend of the
   Jenny re-evaluated},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {When Sir John Franklin's expedition ships, lost since 1845, were found
   in the Arctic in 2014 and 2016, respectively, they were referred to
   several times in the media as ghost ships. However, such a comparison is
   not new. In 1862, an article linking the disappearance of the Franklin
   expedition to that of a ghost ship in Antarctic waters appeared in a
   newly founded German geographic journal aimed at a general audience. The
   story of the ghost ship Jenny in the Drake Passage between South America
   and Antarctica would probably have been long forgotten had it not
   appeared again in this journal in English translation a century later.
   Since then, the story has appeared again and again in publications about
   mysterious phenomena, without succeeding in answering the question of
   whether such a ship ever existed at all. Instead of continuing to look
   for evidence of the actual existence of the ship, the following article
   not only presents the sources of the 1862 journal article but also
   examines how the story itself might have originated. In addition to a
   well-known legend about a ghost ship in the Arctic waters of Greenland,
   which will also be analysed in greater detail, oral tales and tradition
   about two almost forgotten voyages into Antarctic waters and a
   well-known one have probably also been incorporated into the tale of the
   ghost ship Jenny. All translations from German are by the author.},

Title = {Careful amendment of morphological data sets improves phylogenetic
   frameworks: re-evaluating placement of the fossil Amiskwia sagittiformis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},

Abstract = {The Cambrian fossil Amiskwia sagittiformis has puzzled palaeontologists
   for more than a century, but recent re-investigation of its morphology
   suggested a close relationship with the bilaterian clade Gnathifera,
   comprising Rotifera, Gnathostomulida and Micrognathozoa. Since Amiskwia
   has already been considered closely related to Chaetognatha, this new
   interpretation of its morphology supports recent molecular and
   developmental studies finding a close phylogenetic relationship between
   Chaetognatha and Gnathifera. The recent re-description of the jaw
   apparatus of Amiskwia with the first phylogenetic analysis by Vinther \&
   Parry (2019) found a rather surprising topology with Amiskwia and
   Chaetognatha being sister groups and nested inside Gnathifera.
   Furthermore, a subsequent paper from Caron \& Cheung (2019) re-described
   the jaws of Amiskwia as very similar to the configuration found in
   Gnathostomulida, but did not include any phylogenetic analysis. Here we
   test the topology of Vinther \& Parry with various parsimony and
   Bayesian analyses, taking into account the new description of Caron \&
   Cheung with careful re-amendment of the matrix of Vinther \& Parry.
   According to our results and the recent findings on the molecular
   phylogeny of their extant members, we suggest a new systematization of
   these taxa. We recovered Amiskwia as a stem-group chaetognath within a
   clade Cucullophora nov., rejecting the Caron \& Cheung hypothesis of its
   close affinity to Gnathostomulida, and found a more consensual topology
   with monophyletic Gnathifera sister group to Cucullophora, all together
   forming the clade Chaetognathifera. Furthermore, Rotifera +
   Micrognathozoa form a clade named Gynognathifera nov. We discuss the
   characters supporting each clade and the reasons that account for the
   topology found by Vinther \& Parry. Finally, we hope that this carefully
   amended matrix focused on Gnathifera, Amiskwia and Chaetognatha,
   together with a formal classification and robust phylogeny, will be of
   use for future studies on the palaeontology and morphology of these
   clades.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Reliable access to Arctic research infrastructure is critical to the
   future of polar science. In cultivating proposals, it is essential that
   researchers have a deep understanding of existing platforms when
   selecting the appropriate research site and experimental design for
   projects. However, Arctic infrastructure platforms are often funded as
   national assets, and choices for what would be the best platform for the
   project are sometimes at odds with a researcher's ability to gain
   access. Researchers from Arctic and non-Arctic nations are poised to
   benefit from reducing barriers and increasing cooperation around
   transnational access to Arctic infrastructure, allowing scientists to
   successfully execute the research that is most needed rather than what
   is just logistically feasible. This commentary provides a summary of
   findings from a workshop held at the 2021 Arctic Science Summit Week to
   discuss navigating ``transnational{''} or ``cross-border{''} access to
   national research infrastructure. This workshop brought together users
   and operators of Arctic infrastructure platforms with the three goals of
   identifying challenges, best practices, and possible next steps for
   improved collaboration.},

Title = {From mining tool to tourist attraction: Cultural heritage as a
   materialised form of transformation in Svalbard society},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {In the context of socio-economic transformation of Svalbard, from a
   place dominated by the coal mining industry to a nature-based tourism
   destination, the article focuses on how this transformation is
   co-created with material objects of coal mining remnants. These
   seemingly marginal, insignificant or even out-of-place remnants of coal
   mining activity (such as rusty barrels or collapsing infrastructure)
   have become, by law, a protected part of the Svalbard environment, a
   cultural heritage. Based on the relational (more-than-human) ethnography
   of guided tours, the analysis shows that this transformation is
   co-creating the characteristics of both the past of coal mining and the
   present notion of wilderness. It demonstrates the process not only as a
   transformation of interpretations, knowledge and values but also as a
   transformation of relations with non-human components of the
   environment. Rather contextual than linear shifts in a biography of the
   objects, together with the temporality of the objects and their porous
   character, play a significant role in the Svalbard's transformation into
   a nature-based tourism destination.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore tourism development as an ongoing
   becoming-with and in the world. We draw on Haraway's concept of worlding
   to describe the coming together of tourism not as a solitary or
   industry-related endeavour, but as entangled. We introduce the
   analytical concepts of frictions, companions and string figures to
   exemplify and discuss what this looks like when stepping closer to the
   tinkering with tourism. The article illustrates and discusses ways to
   re-conceptualise tourism development not as a simple solution to local
   problem, but as world-making in tension. We abstain from identifying
   ``good{''} tourism and claims of how to pursue ways to ``fix{''}
   tourism, instead tending to how tourism actors imagine and tinker with
   and around tourism towards more livable futures in a turbulent terrain.},

Abstract = {The article is dealing with indigenous peoples' sustainability issues in
   Russian Arctic labour market. There we surveyed 74 indigenous
   communities and 32 municipal unitary enterprises in the Arctic. Obtained
   data helped to identify demanded occupations for indigenous peoples in
   the Russian Arctic for the period of 2035. It turned out that 75\% of
   respondents continue working in occupations that are traditional for
   indigenous peoples (reindeer farmer, coastal fisherman, whale hunter
   etc.) in the Russian Arctic, 25\% continue working in occupations
   demanded in Arctic labour market mainly in social sphere (doctor,
   teacher and kindergarten teacher). Both Rosstat data and indigenous
   peoples' surveys' results indicated that indigenous peoples are usually
   not enrolled in vocational educations programmes. After graduating both
   schools and boarding schools, indigenous peoples usually do not continue
   their education. They also have a high disposal rate at tertiary
   vocational education organisations in case they are enrolled. Unequal
   access to education as well as labour market is a strong characteristic
   of indigenous peoples in the Russian Arctic.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The Miocene ape (Sivapithecus) locality of Tapar in Kutch (Gujarat,
   India) has yielded a diverse rodent assemblage that includes: a new
   murine Progonomys prasadi sp. nov., a new gerbilline Myocricetodon
   gujaratensis sp. nov., a new rhizomyne Kanisamys kutchensis sp. nov. and
   a new sciurine Tamias gilaharee sp. nov., beside additional remains of
   Progonomys morganae, Dakkamys asiaticus, Prokanisamys sp., Sayimys
   sivalensis and Democricetodon fejfari. Morphometric and PAUP based
   phylogenetic analyses place Progonomys prasadi sp. nov. within the
   Progonomys lineage. The cladogram obtained for the Siwalik murines
   suggest that Progonomys was ancestral to all the modem and one extinct
   murine genera recovered from the Siwaliks. The advanced features of
   Myocricetodon gujaratensis sp. nov. indicate that it was an immigrant to
   the subcontinent in the late Miocene. The cladistic analysis performed
   on Kanisamys kutchensis sp. nov. shows that it shared several advanced
   characters with contemporaneous Kanisamys nagrii and Kanisamys
   sivalensis. Based on the biostratigraphical ranges of Siwalik rodents
   and the co-occurrence of advanced forms of new and already reported
   murines, a new gerbilline and a new sciurine, we propose an age of
   similar to 10 Ma to the primate-bearing Tapar locality. Already reported
   stable isotope data on murines, and ecological preferences of modem
   counterparts of the fossil rodents and associated sharks and rays from
   Tapar locality, indicate that the Miocene ape Sivapithecus may have
   lived in a subtropical monsoonal forest close to the coast, very
   different from the present day arid conditions.},

Abstract = {Extant istiophorids are open ocean apex predators that are extensively
   studied due to their ecological importance and high values for
   fisheries. Nevertheless, little is known about their evolution because
   of a fragmentary fossil record and extremely difficult taxonomy of
   fossil species. Here, we present a new phylogenetic hypothesis covering
   fossil and living istiophorids. Our results demonstrate that istiophorid
   richness is larger than previously assumed, comprising eight genera with
   15 species. The phylogenetic analysis shows that istiophorids are
   grouped into four clades: the Istiophorus Glade, which includes the
   sailfish; the Machairostra Glade, which comprises Makaira spp.,
   including two new species from the late Miocene (dagger Makaira
   colonense sp. nov. and dagger Makaira fierstini sp. nov.); the
   Gracilorostra Glade, which comprise all remaining istiophorids with
   exception of spearfishes and includes two new genera and one new species
   (dagger Morgula donosochagrense gen. et sp. nov. and dagger Spathochoira
   calvertense gen. et . comb. nov.); and the Tetrapturomorpha Glade is
   composed of the spearfishes and the extinct dagger Prototetrapturus
   courcelli gen. et . comb. nov. The family Istiophoridae shows an
   evolutionary trend toward reduction of the premaxillary thickness and
   increasing the extension of narial cavities. This reduction is related
   to an increase of adipose tissues in the rostrum base probably driven by
   the presence of the oleofera gland, an organ involved in feeding,
   healing, endothermy and hydrophobic functions. Our phylogeny shows a
   direct relationship between the rostral and cranial shape explained by
   body size and feeding behaviour. The larger istiophorids have lateral
   apophysis and the larger spines of the vertebral column. The spearfishes
   represent the smaller species of the family, with the extant Tetrapturus
   spp. first appearing in the late Pliocene. The Glade Tetrapturomorpha
   shows an extreme size reduction over time when compared with species of
   their sister Glade Gracilorostra, demonstrating an evolutionary trend
   towards size reduction.},

Title = {Towards customised sovereignty: West Nordic societies in the new great
   power rivalry},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Two factors historically played a decisive role in the West Nordic
   region's affairs: its strategic location and small societies' long
   struggle for independence. The current power balance shift challenges
   the progress of Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland towards
   strengthening their independence and sovereignty. The research suggests
   a theoretical contemplation of the West Nordic region's shifting
   practices of sovereignty in current affairs with Russia and China amid
   the US' patronage. Drawing on the model of Patron-Client relations, the
   article considers the US as a patron state for the West Nordic region,
   whereas Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland are discussed as
   clients. The Kingdom of Denmark is regarded as a junior patron due to
   its intermediate position in relations with the US on the one hand and
   the Faroe Islands and Greenland on the other. Russia and China are
   addressed as patron adversaries. The research enquires as to whether any
   of the two US opponents advertise themselves as alternative patrons for
   the West Nordic region and what explains the weak or alarmist US
   reactions to Russia and China initiatives in the region. Special focus
   is on the comparison of the three great powers' behaviour in the region.
   Major findings raise the discussion of customisation of sovereignty and
   its consequences for future relations in the West Nordic and globally.},

Title = {A new aetiocetid (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Aetiocetidae) from the late
   Oligocene of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The aetiocetids are a well-known extinct taxon of Oligocene toothed
   mysticetes in the North Pacific. They display a high degree of diversity
   contrasting with that of other tooth-bearing mysticetes such as
   mammalodontids, llanocetids and Coronodon spp. The disparate
   developmental patterns (heterochrony) and origin of the first kelp
   forests in the North Pacific during the Eocene-Oligocene transition
   might explain such diversity. Aetiocetidae have been the focus of debate
   regarding the origin of baleen and filter-feeding in Mysticeti. The
   current interpretation of aetiocetid feeding strategies is based on the
   presence of teeth, unfused mandibular symphysis and lateral palatal
   foramina. However, our understating of their feeding apparatus function
   is limited, leaving associated structures like the zygomatic arch
   unnoticed. The present study describes a new fossil of a small-sized
   mysticete (similar to 3 m long), Kaaucetus thesaurus gen. et sp. nov.,
   which belongs to Aetiocetidae. The protruded squamosal prominence and
   distinctive zygomatic process present in this new fossil highlight
   disparity in feeding morphology amongst aetiocetids. Moreover, the
   zygomatic arch complex and masticatory muscle system reconstruction are
   crucial to interpreting the likely capability of mastication (shearing
   motion) in aetiocetids and other toothed mysticetes. Lastly, the record
   of several aetiocetid genera in Mexico extends the geographical range of
   the group into the subtropical region.},

Title = {Unravelling the identity of the platanistoid Notocetus vanbenedeni
   Moreno, 1892 (Cetacea, Odontoceti) from the early Miocene of Patagonia
   (Argentina)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},

Abstract = {Platanistoidea remains one of the most evolutionarily intriguing
   lineages of toothed whales (Odontoceti). The clade comprises mostly
   extinct species from the late Oligocene-early Miocene onward and a
   single extant riverine genus (Platanista). There is an ongoing debate as
   to the membership of Platanistoidea and the causes of their near
   extinction. In Patagonia (Argentina), the most abundant platanistoid
   recorded in the lower Miocene Gaiman Formation is Notocetus vanbenedeni,
   first described by Moreno in 1892 based on two individuals. The goal of
   the present contribution is to conduct an updated anatomical,
   palaeobiological and phylogenetic analyses of Notocetus vanbenedeni and
   hence contribute to an understanding of the evolutionary history of the
   Platanistoidea. Our analyses, including at least 26 individuals (12
   undescribed), show that Notocetus vanbenedeni is a valid platanistoid
   taxon, recovered as part of a new clade. Among its most outstanding
   features, this taxon has an elevated dorsal tubercular supraorbital
   crest formed mainly by the frontal, the precursor of the pneumatized
   crest of the extant Platanista. Notocetus vanbenedeni also shows initial
   stages of the plesiomorphic bony connection between the earbones and
   skull as in Platanista, although the functional implications for hearing
   remain elusive. The nasal sac system, pterygoid sinus system and
   morphology of the earbones suggest that this species was able to hear
   high-frequency sounds and echolocate underwater, similar to extant
   odontocetes. Thus, Notocetus vanbenedeni presents a mosaic of features
   that suggest an intermediate platanistoid morphotype. Anatomical
   differences and phylogenetic analyses suggest that Peruvian specimens
   could not be referred to this species. The feeding apparatus of
   Notocetus vanbenedeni makes it the only combination suction-feeder
   recorded in the early Miocene of Patagonia and among the smallest
   odontocetes. Finally, the abundant records of Notocetus vanbenedeni in
   an inner shelf environment with freshwater influence suggest a possible
   early preference for such protected habitats.},

Title = {A nearly complete skeleton of a new eusphenodontian from the Upper
   Jurassic Morrison Formation, Wyoming, USA, provides insight into the
   evolution and diversity of Rhynchocephalia (Reptilia: Lepidosauria)},

Abstract = {We describe a new, small-bodied rhynchocephalian reptile, Opisthiamimus
   gregori gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of
   Wyoming, USA. Whereas many fossil rhynchocephalians are based on
   isolated incomplete jaws, the holotype of O. gregori includes most of
   the skull and postcranium and therefore represents one of the most
   complete specimens of Rhynchocephalia known from North America. We used
   micro-computed tomography to examine its skeletal anatomy in detail and
   to develop a three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull. The skull of
   O. gregori is similar to that of several non-neosphenodontian
   rhynchocephalians such as Planocephalosaurus (e.g. large orbits) and
   Clevosaurus (e.g. parietal parasagittal crests) yet exhibits a suite of
   other features related to the proal shearing mechanism that becomes
   increasingly elaborated among more phylogenetically nested taxa such as
   Sphenodon (e.g. lateral palatine tooth row parallels maxillary tooth row
   along its entire length, pyramidal dentary teeth with mesial shearing
   crests). The postcranial skeleton of O. gregori exhibits characteristics
   typical of a terrestrial rhynchocephalian. Our phylogenetic analyses use
   a substantially updated data set of 118 characters and 46 taxa, and both
   maximum parsimony and Bayesian frameworks. Results place O. gregori
   inside Eusphenodontia but outside Neosphenodontia, and therefore in a
   key position for contributing to character polarity for more deeply
   nested clades such as Clevosauridae, Sphenodontidae and Pleurosauridae.
   We also erect Leptorhynchia taxon nov., composed primarily of
   aquatically adapted taxa (e.g. Pleurosaurus, Sapheosaurus), which is
   supported by both cranial and postcranial characters. Because O. gregori
   is not particularly closely related to the other named Morrison
   rhynchocephalians (e.g. Opisthias rarus), it increases both the alpha
   and beta taxonomic diversities within the formation. Similarly, major
   differences in body size and inferred diet of the Morrison taxa imply
   considerable concomitant palaeoecological diversity just prior to a
   major global decline in rhynchocephalian diversity around the close of
   the Jurassic.},

Title = {Changing Svalbard: Tracing interrelated socio-economic and environmental
   change in remote Arctic settlements},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {The archipelago of Svalbard is a good example of an Arctic locale
   undergoing rapid changes on multiple levels. This contribution is a
   joint effort of three anthropologists with up-to-date ethnographic data
   from Svalbard (mostly Longyearbyen and Barentsburg) to frame and
   interpret interconnected changes. The processes impacting Svalbard are
   related to issues such as geopolitical interests, and increasing
   pressure by the Norwegian government to exercise presence and control
   over the territory. Our interpretations are based on a bottom-up
   approach, drawing on experiences living in the field. We identify three
   great ruptures in recent years - the avalanche of 2015, the gradual
   phasing out of mining enterprises and the COVID-19 pandemic - and show
   how they further impact, accelerate or highlight preexisting
   vulnerabilities in terms of socio-economic development, and
   environmental and climate change. We discuss the shift from coal mining
   to the industries of tourism, education, and research and development,
   and the resulting changed social and demographic structure of the
   settlements. Another facet is the complexity of environmental drivers of
   change and how they relate to the socio-economic ones. This article
   serves as an introductory text to the collection of articles published
   in Polar Record in 2021/2022 with the overarching theme ``changing
   Svalbard{''}. Issues discussed range from socio-economic change and its
   implications for local populations including identity of place, through
   tourism (value creation, mediation, human-environment relations,
   environmental dilemmas, balancing contradictory trends), to security and
   risk perception, and environmental and climate change issues.},

Title = {Osteology of Dashanpusaurus dongi (Sauropoda: Macronaria) and new
   evolutionary evidence from Middle Jurassic Chinese sauropods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Middle Jurassic lower Shaximiao Formation in Sichuan Province of
   south-western China has yielded a diverse terrestrial vertebrate fauna
   dominated by sauropod dinosaurs. However, many of these sauropods lack
   detailed descriptions or explicit phylogenetic diagnoses. Here, we
   present a comprehensive redescription of Dashanpusaurus dongi, a species
   of sauropod found only in the lower Shaximiao Formation. We define the
   revised autapomorphies of the species as follows: neural canals are
   sub-square in anterior dorsal vertebrae; the presence of a thin
   accessory lamina that contacts the prezygodiapophyseal and
   paradiapophyseal laminae of the middle dorsals, forming an angle of 75
   degrees to the horizontal; and four ridges on the anterodistal edge of
   the humerus. Often considered part of the epipophyseal-prezygapophyseal
   lamina, a strut invades the spinodiapophyseal fossa in the cervical and
   anterior dorsal vertebrae. Anatomical comparisons indicate that this
   feature was widespread among early-diverging Middle Jurassic eusauropod
   lineages. This comparative anatomical data provides an opportunity to
   revisit the phylogenetic position of Dashanpusaurus and the
   relationships of the neosauropod clade. Recovered as a macronarian, a
   better understanding of Dashanpusaurus dongi will allow for
   clarification of the origin, early evolution, and palaeogeographical
   distribution of neosauropods. This study also suggests that the
   diversity and dispersity of the neosauropod clade occurred much earlier
   than previously realized.},

Abstract = {We report new allotherian tooth specimens from the Middle Jurassic White
   Limestone Formation at Woodeaton Quarry (Oxfordshire), United Kingdom.
   Two teeth are assigned to Kermackodon (=Eleutherodon) oxfordensis, a
   taxon whose original generic name (Eleutherodon) was preoccupied and is
   here assigned to Kermackodon to form a new binomial combination for the
   species name. Butlerodon quadratus gen. et sp. nov. (family
   Kermackodontidae), based on 13 cheek teeth and incisors, shows dental
   features intermediate between K oxfordensis and the Late Triassic
   ``haramiyidans{''} (Haramiyavia and Thomasia). Woodeatonia parva gen. et
   sp. nov. (family indeterminate), based on three teeth, is characterized
   by its small size. A second upper molar from a multituberculate is
   identified as Hahnotherium cf H antiquum, which possesses characters
   typical for multituberculates but distinctive from ``haramiyidans{''}.
   The allotherian teeth from the Forest Marble Formation, previously
   assigned to the haramiyidans ``Eleutherodon{''}, ``Millsodon{''} and
   ``Kirtlingtonia{''}, and the multituberculate Kermackodon, are
   reinterpreted as teeth from different upper or lower dental loci of the
   same haramiyidan species K oxfordensis, which result in significant
   taxonomical modification of these allotherians ({''}haramiyidans{''} and
   multituberculates). Given that Kermackodon has been regarded as a
   transitional form between multituberculates and ``haramiyidans{''},
   these taxonomical modifications would affect interpretation of early
   evolution of allotherians. In a comparison of molars in known
   ``haramiyidans{''}, we delve into their occlusal patterns and cusp
   homologies that have been controversial but pivotal for understanding
   evolution of allotherians. We further conduct the first phylogenetic
   analysis of haramiyidan species. The European Late Triassic species form
   the stem-ward taxa of ``haramiyidans{''} and the Jurassic species from
   the United Kingdom are grouped with arboroharamiyids from the Yanliao
   Biota, China, and nested in ``haramiyidans{''}.},

Abstract = {Vector-borne diseases constitute a major global public health threat.
   The most significant arthropod disease vectors are predominantly
   comprised of members of the insect order Diptera (true flies), which
   have long been the focus of research into host-pathogen dynamics. Recent
   studies have revealed the underappreciated diversity and function of
   dipteran-associated gut microbial communities, with important
   implications for dipteran physiology, ecology, and pathogen
   transmission. However, the effective parameterization of these aspects
   into epidemiological models will require a comprehensive study of
   microbe-dipteran interactions across vectors and related species. Here,
   we synthesize recent research into microbial communities associated with
   major families of dipteran vectors and highlight the importance of
   development and expansion of experimentally tractable models across
   Diptera towards understanding the functional roles of the gut microbiota
   in modulating disease transmission. We then posit why further study of
   these and other dipteran insects is not only essential to a
   comprehensive understanding of how to integrate vector-microbiota
   interactions into existing epidemiological frameworks, but our
   understanding of the ecology and evolution of animal-microbe symbiosis
   more broadly.},

Title = {Fitness effects of somatic mutations accumulating during vegetative
   growth},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {767-785},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The unique life form of plants promotes the accumulation of somatic
   mutations that can be passed to offspring in the next generation,
   because the same meristem cells responsible for vegetative growth also
   generate gametes for sexual reproduction. However, little is known about
   the consequences of somatic mutation accumulation for offspring fitness.
   We evaluate the fitness effects of somatic mutations in Mimulus guttatus
   by comparing progeny from self-pollinations made within the same flower
   (autogamy) to progeny from self-pollinations made between stems on the
   same plant (geitonogamy). The effects of somatic mutations are evident
   from this comparison, as autogamy leads to homozygosity of a proportion
   of somatic mutations, but progeny from geitonogamy remain heterozygous
   for mutations unique to each stem. In two different experiments, we find
   consistent fitness effects of somatic mutations from individual stems.
   Surprisingly, several progeny groups from autogamous crosses displayed
   increases in fitness compared to progeny from geitonogamy crosses,
   likely indicating that beneficial somatic mutations occurred in some
   stems. These results support the hypothesis that somatic mutations
   accumulate during vegetative growth, but they are filtered by different
   forms of selection that occur throughout development, resulting in the
   culling of expressed deleterious mutations and the retention of
   beneficial mutations.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork data, this article argues
   there is tension between how Longyearbyen's residents wish to perform as
   a community and hindrances the town inherited from its past and accepts
   as demarcation lines of Norway's Svalbard politics. The population of
   Longyearbyen has undergone considerable change since the 1990s, turning
   from a predominantly Norwegian mining community into a highly
   diversified group of people from all over the world. This article places
   Longyearbyen into the wider context of settlements with similar traces
   (in Scandinavia, the Arctic, multilingual and immigrant communities
   worldwide, or in the context of extractivism) and discusses the existing
   barriers of communitification. Encounters with four participants
   illuminate the tensions and contradictions when it comes to cultivating
   social cohesion and shaping Longyearbyen's ``desired futures.{''} Unless
   the process of increasing the community's agency is actively encouraged
   by people living there and those governing it from the outside, the
   future of the settlement risks being alienating for its inhabitants,
   weakening further the communitification potential.},

Title = {Physical and feasible: Climate change adaptation in Longyearbyen,
   Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Longyearbyen, Svalbard, has become showcase of Arctic climate change.
   However, we know little about how these changes are dealt with locally.
   This article aims to fill this gap by examining climate change impacts
   and adaptation in a non-Indigenous ``community of experts{''} and sets
   out to 1) describe observed changes and perceived societal impacts of
   climate change and 2) discuss adaptation measures and related
   understandings of adaptation. The research consists of ethnographic
   fieldwork and interviews with planners, engineers, architects,
   scientists, construction workers and local politicians. The research
   finds that climate change impacts the built environment in Longyearbyen,
   and that there is vast awareness of and concern related to these
   impacts. There is a substantial knowledge base for adaptation, and a
   special trust in scientific knowledge, skills and experts. The interview
   partners consider adaptation as necessary and feasible. Adaptation is
   understood and implemented as technical responses to physical problems,
   rooted in a modernist understanding of the environment as separated from
   humans, who can control it through technical means. This suggests a
   narrow understanding of adaptation that might fail to address more
   socially transformative processes.},

Title = {Is it real? Science diplomacy in the Arctic states' strategies},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Dominant geopolitical narratives on the Arctic argue that the region is
   either edging towards conflict or international law is respected and
   peace is maintained through cooperation to address shared concerns.
   While both of these narratives are present in the Arctic states'
   strategies, most of them tend to support collaborative efforts. Science
   diplomacy (SD) is a useful mechanism in this regard as it helps states
   overcome potential disagreements and can stimulate cooperation in other
   areas. Given the growing concerns about global risks, SD is more
   important now than ever before. In our study, we identify and focus on
   three indicators for potential SD in the Arctic strategies: i)
   scientific infrastructure; ii) membership in
   intergovernmental/interparliamentary and scientific/education
   organisations and networks and iii) specific areas of scientific
   cooperation. Considering the intensive scientific activity in the
   region, it is not surprising that the strategies discuss different forms
   of research and scientific cooperation, although none explicitly use the
   term ``science diplomacy{''}. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals the
   Arctic states do apply the SD concept in their strategies and use three
   types of diplomacy - science in diplomacy, science for diplomacy or
   diplomacy for science - in the three indicators.},

Title = {Unfinished indigenous geographies: The endurances and becomings of a
   Sami tourism venture},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {For many years, and within the context of pre-pandemic tourism growth in
   the Norwegian Arctic, governmental institutions have had expectations
   that Sami indigenous people of the north of Norway should engage more
   strongly in the tourism economy. What does it however imply for Sami
   people to become agents in tourism and take ownership to tourism
   development? This paper attends to Sami people who engage as
   entrepreneurs in tourism in Norwegian parts of Sapmi. We suggest ways to
   identify when and how indigeneity emerges as a topic and meaning
   dimension that makes a difference in the entrepreneurship process and
   discuss how Saminess can mark the process in ambiguous ways. The current
   paper's exploration is enabled by a qualitative co-creative study and
   detailed account of a Sami tourism venture in a coastal town in
   Finnmark, Norway. The paper attends to the venture as part of the
   entrepreneurs' life stories, everyday life, and material relational
   practices and explores the intrinsic geographies and histories to which
   their various relational practices connect the enterprise. Sami
   entrepreneurships in tourism are considered in light of the unstable and
   changing ethnic qualities of places, through an approach that
   acknowledges the current transformative complexities of indigeneity. The
   analysis illuminates tourism entrepreneurs' engagements in indigenously
   transgressive enactments of places and of Sami culture and tells about
   vitalities and vulnerabilities involved in becoming indigenous agents in
   Arctic destinations.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out between April 2014 and March 2016. We counted
   233 species dominated by diatoms (126 species) and dinoflagellates (97
   species). The most common diatom species were Leptocylindrus danicus and
   Rhizosolenia styliformus, while Scrippsiella sp. was the most common
   dinoflagellate species. The richness and relative abundance of diatoms
   were greater during the spring of 2014-2015 and the winter of 2015 and
   present an increasing north-south gradient. However, those of
   dinoflagellates were greater during the summer and autumn seasons of the
   years 2014-2015 and the winter of 2016, with a decreasing north-south
   gradient. This could be mainly related to the difference between the
   requirements of these two groups and the spatiotemporal variability of
   the physicochemical characteristics of the waters governed by seasonal
   and inter-annual variations of the currents, by the floods and by the
   morphology of the coast in this area. Indeed, the increase in the
   richness and abundance of dinoflagellates coincides with the increase in
   temperature, transparency and the decrease in the concentration of
   nutrient salts in the environment. However, the increase in nutrient
   content, the decrease in temperature and transparency favours diatoms
   compared with dinoflagellates.},

Abstract = {dagger Protosyngnathus sumatrensis is known from six specimens from
   Eocene lacustrine deposits of the Sangkarawang Formation of Sumatra,
   Indonesia. The fish was named almost 150 years ago, but has never been
   well described or figured. Probably because of this, it has not been
   included in phylogenies of extant pipefishes and seahorses
   (Syngnathiformes). A detailed description is provided, along with a new
   phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters that allows the Eocene
   fish to be confidently placed with the extant families Syngnathidae
   (pipefishes and seahorses) and Solenostomidae (ghost seahorses) along
   with the Paleocene marine fossil dagger Eekaulostomus cuevasae from
   Mexico. The vast majority of these fishes are marine inhabitants, with a
   few syngnathids entering brackish or freshwater habitats. dagger
   Protosyngnathus documents the occurrence of syngnathiform fishes in a
   lacustrine environment, indicating that this lineage invaded and became
   adapted to the freshwater environment early in the evolution of this

Title = {Silicified cupulate seed-bearing structures from the Early Cretaceous of
   eastern Inner Mongolia, China: rethinking the corystosperm concept},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The group referred to informally as the corystosperms, described
   initially based on compression fossils from the Triassic of Gondwana,
   have long been considered critical extinct plants for understanding seed
   plant phylogeny, the evolution of seed plant reproductive structures and
   the relationships of angiosperms. Here we describe a new genus and
   species of corystosperm seed-bearing structure, Jarudia zhoui gen. et
   sp. nov., based on abundant silicified material collected from the newly
   discovered chert in the Early Cretaceous Huolinhe Formation of eastern
   Inner Mongolia, north-eastern China. Jarudia zhoui is a lax seed cone
   consisting of a flexible central axis bearing deciduous, helically
   arranged, lateral seed-bearing units. Individual seed-bearing units
   consist of an elongate bract partially fused to an unbranched cupule
   stalk that bears a single, reflexed cupule apically. Each cupule is
   formed by the strongly reflexed cupule stalk and one median and two
   lateral flaps. The cupule stalk supplied by two vascular bundles and
   three unvascularized flaps partially enclose two three-angled seeds.
   Jarudia zhoui bears a striking resemblance to Doylea tetrahedrasperma
   from the Early Cretaceous of Canada and similar plants from the Early
   Cretaceous of Mongolia. There are also strong similarities with ovulate
   structures of Umkomasia from the Triassic of Gondwana in the structure
   and anatomy of individual cupules, their axial nature, and the
   architecture of the entire seed-bearing structure that has two orders of
   branching. New information from Jarudia zhoui, together with information
   on other corystosperm ovulate organs from the Northern Hemisphere,
   significantly expands our understanding of this key group of extinct
   plants, suggests that the cupules of the Early Cretaceous and Triassic
   corystosperms are homologous, and raises critical questions about the
   definition and phylogenetic circumscription of the corystosperms,
   including how Early Cretaceous and Triassic corystosperms are related to
   each other and to other groups of seed plants, including angiosperms.},

Abstract = {The extinct fossil snake Boavus occurs in early-middle Eocene localities
   in the United States. Four species are currently recognized, but until
   now, no formal phylogenetic analyses have been conducted to test its
   relationships within snakes. Here, we provide an osteological
   redescription and systematic revision of the genus, accompanied by
   phylogenetic analyses using multiple methods. Based on new morphological
   information obtained through first-hand observation and published
   descriptions, differences between Boavus occidentalis, B. agilis and B.
   affinis can be ascribed to normal intracolumnar vertebral variation,
   making the latter two junior synonyms of the first species. Our
   phylogenetic analyses retrieved Boavus within crown-Booidea as an early
   booid but outside of Boidae. A morphological and molecular analysis of
   booids, with dense taxon sampling including fossil and living forms,
   results in a new booid phylogeny. Boavus, along with other fossil booids
   from Europe (Eoconstrictor, Messelophis, Rieppelophis, Rageryx),
   suggests that crown-Booidea likely diverged earlier than estimated by
   some molecular studies (similar to 45.4 Ma).},

Title = {A new proterochampsid (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia) from the Late
   Triassic of southern Brazil and the emergence of archosaurian hind limb
   traits},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Characterized by an elongated snout, proterochampsids are carnivorous
   non-archosaur archosauriforms. The clade is endemic to South America and
   its fossil record extends from the early Carnian to the late
   Carnian/early Norian. Nesting close to Archosauria, it is a key clade
   for understanding the origin and evolution of archosaurian traits.
   Unfortunately, hind limb elements are usually poorly preserved for the
   group. Therefore, the hind limb anatomy of proterochampsids still lacks
   detailed descriptions. In the present study, we partially fill this gap
   with the description of a new proterochampsid represented by a complete
   and well-preserved hind limb. Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov.
   was excavated from the late Carnian/early Norian (Late Triassic) beds of
   southern Brazil. A phylogenetic investigation recovers the new taxon as
   a non-rhadinosuchine proterochampsid. The species bears an unusual set
   of traits for the group, which provides clues on the evolutionary
   origins of some muscle attachment structures. For instance, the femur of
   Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov. possesses an anterior
   trochanter and an anterolateral scar. So far, these features have not
   been reported in other non-archosaurian archosauriforms. Therefore, the
   new specimen indicates that some typical archosaurian features evolved
   earlier than previously thought. The taxon also carries additional
   uncommon features for proterochampsids, such as an iliofibularis
   tubercle on the anterior margin of the fibula and a vestigial phalanx in
   digit V. In sum, Stenoscelida aurantiacus has one of the best-preserved
   hind limbs within Proterochampsidae and sheds light on the polarization
   of important traits regarding the evolutionary context of Archosauria.},

Journal = {POLAR RECORD},

Abstract = {The vegetation at and beyond the northern edge of the world's boreal
   forest plays an important though imperfectly understood role in the
   climate system. This is particularly true within Russia, where only a
   small proportion of the boreal land area has been studied in depth, and
   little is known about its recent evolution over time. We describe a
   long-term collaboration between institutions in Russia and the United
   Kingdom, aimed at developing a better understanding of high-latitude
   vegetation in Russia using remote sensing methods. The focus of the
   collaboration has varied over time; in its most recent form, it is
   concerned with the dynamics of the Russian boreal forest during the 21st
   century and its relation to climate change. We discuss the support
   framework within which it has been developed and reflect on its
   relationship to science diplomacy. We consider the factors that have
   contributed to the success of a decades-long international collaboration
   and make recommendations as to how such joint efforts can be encouraged
   in future.},

Title = {Disaster risk perceptions and multinational cooperation in Barentsburg,
   Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Svalbard's geographical positioning, environmental characteristics and
   multinational population make it conducive for considering informality
   and multinational cooperation in disaster risk reduction and response.
   Most research examining disaster risks and disasters for Svalbard has
   focused on Norwegian efforts in and for the main settlement of
   Longyearbyen, with none covering Svalbard's second-largest settlement of
   Barentsburg. This paper addresses this gap by analysing how 21
   Barentsburg residents deal with disasters. We conducted semi-structured
   interviews, visually aided by the revised PRISM (Pictorial
   Representation of Illness and Self Measure) tool, to examine
   interviewees' disaster perceptions, sources for disaster-related
   information and learning, and formal and informal sources for dealing
   with disaster risks and disasters. Our findings suggest that, despite
   being risk-aware, Barentsburg interviewees consider the settlement, and
   Svalbard as a whole, to be safe. The explanation is their faith in the
   existing disaster-related mechanisms, made up of both local Russian
   entities and the Norwegian rescue services, especially Svalbard's

Abstract = {The most representative ankylosaurian remains from Argentina have been
   found in sediments of the Allen Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian) in
   Salitral Moreno, Rio Negro Province. Several authors have discussed the
   identity and history of these remains In this study, we review all
   published material along with some new remains in order to summarize all
   the knowledge about these ankylosaurs. Previously published material
   includes a tooth, dorsal and anterior caudal vertebrae, a femur and
   several osteoderms. The new remains include synsacral and caudal
   elements, a partial femur and osteoderms. The anatomy of the tooth, the
   synsacrum, the mid-caudal vertebra, the femur and the osteoderms, and
   the histology of the post-cervical osteoderms, support a nodosaurid
   identification, as proposed in previous descriptions of the Salitral
   Moreno material. Patagopelta cristata gen. et sp. nov. is a new
   nodosaurid ankylosaur characterized by the presence of unique cervical
   half-ring and femoral anatomies, including high-crested lateral
   osteoderms in the half rings and a strongly developed muscular crest in
   the anterior surface of the femur. The similar to 2 m body length
   estimated for Patagopelta is very small for an ankylosaur, comparable
   with the dwarf nodosaurid Struthiosaurus. We recovered Patagopelta
   within Nodosaurinae, related to nodosaurids from the `mid'-Cretaceous of
   North America, contrasting the previous topologies that related this
   material with Panoplosaurini (Late Cretaceous North American
   nodosaurids). These results support a palaeobiogeographical context in
   which the nodosaurids from Salitral Moreno, Argentina, are part of the
   allochthonous fauna that migrated into South America during the late
   Campanian as part of the First American Biotic Interchange.},

Abstract = {The unintentional introduction and rapid spread of chestnut blight
   (caused by Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr) in the early 20th
   century resulted in the demise of American chestnut (Castanea dentata
   (Marsh.) Borkh.; Fagaceae) as a major component of forest canopies
   resulting in negative impacts on eastern forest communities. Research
   efforts over the last century have documented the persistence of
   occasional trees and root crown/stump sprouts throughout much of the
   species' historic range, providing the basis for ongoing breeding of
   blight-resistant trees and restoration efforts. Here we use
   environmental niche modeling to investigate whether environmentally
   suitable habitat remains for remnant trees throughout the southwestern
   historical range, and to evaluate the reintroduction potential of this
   relatively understudied part of the historical distribution. We also use
   stage-structured matrix projection models to investigate the potential
   demographic future of C. dentata near the historical southwestern range
   limit based on observations of American chestnut in these areas over the
   last several decades. We found suitable upland habitat with areas of
   high forest canopy cover occurs throughout much of the southwestern
   portion of the historical range and that populations of American
   chestnut in these areas are predicted to drastically decline over the
   coming decades. These results highlight the continued presence of
   suitable C. dentata habitat throughout the southwestern extent of its
   historical distribution, which should be incorporated into evaluations
   for future reintroduction, and emphasize the need for efforts to locate,
   conserve, and introduce genetic material from individuals with locally
   adapted genotypes into active restoration programs.},

Title = {Urban-rural gradients: how landscape changes drive adaptive evolution of
   plant competitive traits},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-232},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The role of competition in local adaptation and the associated traits
   underlying adaptation remain unclear. One reason for the lack of
   evidence may be that plant-plant competition is ubiquitous in natural
   environments; thus, local adaptation to different levels of competition
   is difficult to test. Comparison between urban and rural habitats is
   suitable for examining the evolutionary impacts of competition because
   these habitats share several plant species, but differ greatly in plant
   density and their resulting degree of competition. Here, using methods
   of landscape ecology, we propose a landscape evolutionary ecological
   approach-a simple analytical framework-to investigate how landscape
   changes in urban-rural gradients drive the local adaptation of
   competitive traits. We demonstrated adaptive divergence of competitive
   traits (i.e. growth habits) between urban and rural populations in two
   Poaceae plants (Digitaria ciliaris and Eleusine indica) and summarised
   the experimental procedure to examine local adaptation to different
   levels of competitive environments. Landscape change due to urbanisation
   provides an opportunity to understand the drivers and constraints of the
   evolution of plant competitive traits. Our analytical framework will be
   useful for integrating research on urban evolution conducted in
   different countries and regions.},

Abstract = {The ecological and evolutionary processes that allow alien species to
   establish and dominate native communities (i.e., become invasive) have
   been a rich area of research. Past areas of inquiry have included
   identifying the traits necessary to invade a community and/or
   determining how phylogenetic relatedness of the introduced species with
   the resident community can promote invasive success. Yet despite decades
   of research, little consensus exists about why particular species
   successfully invade native communities while others do not. Here we
   develop a conceptual framework for why only certain introduced species
   become invasive: optimal differentiation to the edge of trait space
   (EoTS). We posit that optimal differentiation leading to successful
   invasion into a community requires that the multi-dimensional trait
   space of the introduced species exists at the edge of the
   multi-dimensional trait space of the native community. Species that
   possess traits that are too different cannot enter the community because
   of environmental filtering, while species that are too similar will
   either become integrated into the community but not take over or
   alternatively never establish. We apply this conceptual framework to
   species functional traits and discuss how both genetic processes and
   phylogenetic processes may also result in optimal differentiation to
   EoTS.},

   biogeographical implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The Eurasian fossil record is rich with the remains of sminthid rodents,
   a Glade today represented by a single genus, Sicista. In contrast, the
   North American record of the family is sparse and exclusively composed
   of species of Plesiosminthus, an animal bearing a grooved incisor,
   during the Oligocene. This fossil record is the product of dispersal
   events from Eurasia. We here present the first occurrence of a
   smooth-incisor sminthid from North America. The new species, Heosminthus
   teredens from the Arikareean-aged Cabbage Patch beds of Montana,
   represents a rare occurrence of cranial material showing the clear
   association between incisors and cheek teeth, and the first postcranial
   remains for fossil sminthids. Our phylogenetic analysis, expanding on
   prior work, shows that Heosminthus teredens is most closely related to
   Heosminthus borrae, from Mongolia. In combination with published
   radioisotopic dating, our phylogenetic framework of sminthids provides
   evidence for an additional dispersal of sminthid rodents from Eurasia to
   North America 30 million years ago via Beringia. Our morphometric
   analysis of the tibia and metatarsal supports a terrestrial ecology for
   the new species; it is possible the animal had limited scansorial and/or
   saltatorial abilities. The large sample size of teeth available for the
   new taxon enables an analysis of morphological variation and indicates a
   high degree of polymorphism as well as a large size variation, even when
   controlling for stratigraphical and geographical range.},

Abstract = {Skorpiovenator bustingorryi is a derived abelisaurid theropod
   represented by a fairly complete skeleton from the Late Cretaceous
   sedimentary beds of north-western Patagonia. Although some features were
   described in the original paper, mainly related to the skull, the
   appendicular anatomy remains undescribed. The aim of the present
   contribution is to provide a detailed description and analysis of the
   available appendicular bones, including comparisons with other
   ceratosaurian theropods close to Skorpiovenator. In this way, new
   autapomorphies emerged to further distinguish Skorpiovenator from its
   relatives. Furthermore, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was
   performed and several characteristics of the hind limb, in particular
   some of the autopodium, resulted in the identification of new apomorphic
   traits for Ceratosauria and Abelisauridae. These features might prove to
   be useful for future phylogenetic analyses and may help to resolve the
   still confusing and debated internal relationships of abelisaurid
   theropods.},

Abstract = {The role of mutations have been subject to many controversies since the
   formation of the Modern Synthesis of evolution in the early 1940ties.
   Geneticists in the early half of the twentieth century tended to view
   mutations as a limiting factor in evolutionary change. In contrast,
   natural selection was largely viewed as a ``sieve{''} whose main role
   was to sort out the unfit but which could not create anything novel
   alone. This view gradually changed with the development of mathematical
   population genetics theory, increased appreciation of standing genetic
   variation and the discovery of more complex forms of selection,
   including balancing selection. Short-term evolutionary responses to
   selection are mainly influenced by standing genetic variation, and are
   predictable to some degree using information about the genetic
   variance-covariance matrix (G) and the strength and form of selection
   (e. g. the vector of selection gradients, beta). However, predicting
   long-term evolution is more challenging, and requires information about
   the nature and supply of novel mutations, summarized by the mutational
   variance-covariance matrix (M). Recently, there has been increased
   attention to the role of mutations in general and M in particular. Some
   evolutionary biologists argue that evolution is largely mutation-driven
   and claim that mutation bias frequently results in mutation-biased
   adaptation. Strong similarities between G and M have also raised
   questions about the non-randomness of mutations. Moreover, novel
   mutations are typically not isotropic in their phenotypic effects and
   mutational pleiotropy is common. Here I discuss the evolutionary origin
   and consequences of mutational pleiotropy and how multivariate selection
   directly shapes G and indirectly M through changed epistatic
   relationships. I illustrate these ideas by reviewing recent literature
   and models about correlational selection, evolution of G and M, sexual
   selection and the fitness consequences of sexual antagonism.},

Abstract = {Amphibians are a highly vulnerable taxonomic group that have suffered
   population declines worldwide. As amphibians serve critical links
   between trophic levels and facilitate nutrient recycling, it is critical
   to understand how their species richness, abundance, and phenology shift
   over time. Because amphibian populations naturally fluctuate, short-term
   monitoring can provide insight into how amphibian communities respond to
   proximate changes in weather conditions, which is helpful for predicting
   long-term responses to climate change. We used pitfall traps to examine
   interannual variation of the amphibian community at Powdermill Nature
   Reserve (PNR) in Pennsylvania during 2020-2021 to provide critical
   details for future long-term monitoring. Mean monthly temperature and
   precipitation did not vary significantly between years, but monthly
   captures per sampling effort declined and monthly biomass per sampling
   effort increased from 2020 to 2021. Despite a lack of significant
   relationships between total amphibian captures and temperature and
   precipitation, peak abundance shifted earlier, and individuals were
   larger in 2021 compared to 2020. Interestingly, individual species
   biomass was predicted by an interaction between temperature and
   precipitation, suggesting individual species will vary in vulnerability
   to climate change, but the amphibian community as a whole at PNR is
   resilient to minor fluctuations in temperature and precipitation.},

Title = {Reproductive Status of Several Members of the Simulium arcticum Complex

Volume = {188},

Abstract = {Black fly larval collection sites at three rivers in central Washington
   state all possess taxa of the Simulium arcticum Malloch complex with the
   autosomal inversion, IS-1, in high enough frequency to test for
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium independently at each site. Such tests
   determine reproductive status of the taxa present. These situations in
   which the IS-1 autosomal inversion is in relative high frequency are
   rare. Moreover, earlier molecular comparisons suggest a single taxon for
   the S. arcticum complex and cytogenetic studies at the local level may
   or may not support earlier molecular work. Such knowledge could further
   our understanding of the proper taxonomy of these taxa, that is, whether
   they arc good biological species or not. I scored the three genotypes of
   the IS-1 inversion in 247 larvae to test the reproductive status of
   populations of three members of the Simulium arcticum complex (Simulium
   brevicercum, S. saxasum, and the newly discovered cytotype (S. arcticum
   IIL- 81) at the Methow, Entiat and Wenatchee rivers of Washington state.
   In all three cases, larvae conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
   suggesting these populations were panmictic when the collections were
   made. Thus, these results support earlier molecular work and indicate
   that the three taxa at these sites can freely interbreed.},

Title = {Androgens, antlers, and sexual selection: testosterone's relationship to

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {While hormones such as testosterone are known to drive reproduction and
   sexually selected traits in many species, research demonstrating a
   relationship between testosterone and annual or overall reproductive
   success is sparse. We sought to directly measure how circulating
   testosterone relates to sexually selected characteristics and
   reproductive success in a freely breeding population of white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginanus). We captured individuals during
   September-March annually from 2007 to 2017 and investigated the
   association between testosterone and antler size, body size, and annual
   reproductive success for individuals. We also assessed lifetime patterns
   from individuals captured multiple years. We found a positive
   relationship between testosterone and body size, and between
   testosterone and antler size. However, we found a significant
   interaction between testosterone and age for both body size and antler
   size response variables, indicating that as age increases, the
   aforementioned positive relationships with testosterone diminish. Thus,
   for deer >= 6.5 years of age, testosterone is negatively related to body
   and antler size. In contrast, annual reproductive success, measured by
   number of offspring sired and recruited into the breeding population,
   was positively associated with antler size and body size, but not
   testosterone, age, or an interaction between testosterone and age.
   Instead, while an individual's average lifetime testosterone had no
   relationship with overall reproductive success, greater variation in
   lifetime testosterone was positively related to overall reproductive
   success. Thus, while we found no significant association between
   testosterone and annual reproductive success directly, testosterone may
   be indirectly related to reproductive success through its positive
   association with antler and body size. Furthermore, understanding how
   testosterone may fluctuate throughout an individual's lifetime may offer
   new perspectives in understanding variation in individual reproductive
   success.},

Abstract = {Late Pleistocene climate changes have deeply impacted the range dynamics
   of temperate species. While the genetic legacy of these dynamics has
   been widely investigated, little is known about their phenotypic
   consequences. Anti-predatory strategies offer intriguing opportunities
   to study phenotypic evolution in response to dispersal dynamics since
   the ability to avoid predation can be pivotal for populations colonising
   new environments. Here we investigated the spatial differentiation of
   background colour matching strategies along a Late Pleistocene range
   expansion route of a temperate species, the Tyrrhenian tree frog Hyla
   sarda. Using common-garden experiments, we tested whether individuals
   from the source area (Sardinia) and individuals from the newly founded
   area (Corsica) differ in two components of the camouflage strategy:
   colour change abilities and background choice behaviour. We found a
   remarkable spatial structure in both colour change abilities and
   background choice behaviour, across the expansion range. Tree frogs from
   the source area displayed higher colour change abilities and a more
   pronounced preference for a greener background, with respect to tree
   frogs from the newly colonised area. Our results support the intriguing
   hypothesis that Late Pleistocene biogeographic history might be an
   overlooked major player in shaping current spatial patterns of
   phenotypic traits variation across animal populations.},

Abstract = {Most evolutionary theory predicts that, during epidemics, hosts will
   evolve higher resistance to parasites that kill them. Here, we provide
   an alternative to that typical expectation, with an explanation centered
   on resource feedbacks. When resistance is costly, hosts evolve
   decreasing resistance without parasites, as expected. But with
   parasites, hosts can evolve lower resistance than they would in the
   absence of parasites. This outcome arises in an eco-evolutionary model
   when four conditions are met: first, resistance has a fecundity cost
   (here, via decreased foraging/exposure rate); second, resources increase
   during epidemics via trophic cascades; third, increased resources
   magnify the benefit of maintaining a fast foraging rate, thereby
   magnifying the cost of evolving a slower foraging/exposure rate (i.e.,
   resistance); fourth, that amplification of the cost outweighs the
   benefit of resistance. When these conditions are met, hosts evolve lower
   resistance than without parasites. This phenomenon was previously
   observed in a motivating mesocosm experiment with fungal parasites,
   zooplankton hosts, and algal resources. Re-analyzing this experiment
   produced evidence for our model's mechanism. Thus, both model and
   experiment indicate that, via resource feedbacks, parasites can
   counterintuitively select against resistance.},

Abstract = {A fundamental problem for any animal is how to weigh the benefits of
   making a rapid decision against the costs of making a poor decision,
   because time for detecting and evaluating all options is often
   restricted. For nest-site selection in birds, an important cost of a
   speedy decision would be nest predation, which is a major factor
   lowering reproductive success. I tested whether shorter time available
   for assessment of nest sites would lead to a decision with higher
   probability of nest predation. Where boreal owls (Aegolius funereus) had
   nested successfully in a box in the previous season, I manipulated nest
   box availability by offering a dyad of nest boxes. One box (kept or
   exchanged) was in the original nest tree and one box (new or taken from
   the original tree) was in a new tree for the season, each box containing
   either ``post-nesting residue{''} from the successful nesting or new
   wood shavings. Hence, the owls could assess the risk of nest predation
   at a familiar site relative to that at a new site. The timing of nest
   box installation and relocation was such that time for assessment varied
   among localities, from the whole non-breeding season to just a few days
   prior to laying in spring. Owls that had had longer time in which to
   make their assessment and selection were less likely to have their nest
   predated by pine martens (Martes martes). Boreal owls are non-migratory
   and probably gained information on the relative safety of the two
   options by a Bayesian-like updating process in the days, weeks or months
   before the decision had to be made. A migratory cavity-nester exposed to
   the same landscape of nest predation would be more time-constrained and
   forced to rely on the win-stay loose-shift tactic, which underperforms
   relative to Bayesian-like updating.},

Title = {How does access to water at different life-stages affect male investment

Abstract = {Holometabolous insects have four distinct life-stages - eggs, larvae,
   pupae and adults. Active resource acquisition generally occurs during
   either or both the larval and adult stages. Previous research on the
   acquisition of food resources in holometabolous insects, has shown that
   resources acquired during each of these life-stages can differ in how
   they are allocated to different traits, and how they affect fitness. In
   addition to food, water is also an essential resource needed for a range
   of biological processes that enhance fitness. Yet, how water acquired at
   different life-stages affects key fitness traits is still not clear.
   Here, we manipulated both developmental and adult water availability of
   male seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus) to explore how water
   acquired at each life-stage affects a range of fitness related traits,
   including body mass, ejaculate weight, mating behavior and lifespan. Our
   results indicate that the juvenile environment had little effect on body
   weight, ejaculate weight, ejaculate replenishment or lifespan, but did
   influence male mating behavior in both early and late adult life. This
   contrasts with the adult environment, which had strong effects on weight
   loss, ejaculate size and lifespan but little effect on mating behavior.
   Males with access to water during adulthood transferred larger
   ejaculates during their first mating, lost less weight as they aged, and
   lived longer. These results suggest that water acquired during
   development and adulthood are allocated differently to a variety of
   fitness traits across life.},

Abstract = {Allometry-the study of proportional growth of body parts, and the
   relationship of body size to an organism's morphology, physiology and
   behaviour-is a fundamental influencer of ecological and evolutionary
   diversity. Allometric studies can focus on scaling across an
   individual's development (ontogenetic allometry), among individuals at
   the same developmental stage (static allometry), and among species
   (evolutionary allometry). The key assumption in allometry is that an
   organism's body size is a critical factor in shaping its biology, so
   biological scaling underpins biological diversity. This commentary
   accompanies a special issue that collates original research papers on
   the wide-ranging ecological and evolutionary implications of biological
   scaling. We discuss the common themes uniting each contribution, such as
   how ontogenetic allometry facilitates evolutionary allometry, how size
   influences feeding performance and trophic niche, methodology in
   allometry and size estimation, and allometry in sexual selection. In
   doing so we highlight areas of particular need for future studies to
   better understand the role of allometry in evolutionary ecology.},

Title = {Why do some funneliform flowers have petal folds accompanied with

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Plant surface microstructure and its ultrastructural cuticular patterns,
   especially of the petal surface, is diverse in nature, and has
   associated diverse biological functions. These microstructures can be
   primary as well as secondary, i.e. hierarchical in development. Since
   the discovery of these structures over a century ago, many functional
   aspects about them, including biological, chemical, and physical, have
   been constantly redefined over the years. Funneliform flowers, an
   example of synorganization in corolla, are known to be a derived trait
   in angiosperms. As for pollinator interaction, gamopetalous corolla is a
   definite advantage because it provides a sturdy seat or a sturdy
   receptacle for the pollinator depending on the type of pollinator. Petal
   folds likewise play a role in increasing the total size of the
   interacting surface of the petal with the pollinator without losing
   compactness in the bargain. We illustrate that petal folds have multiple
   evolutionary occurrences in Acanthaceae as well as in Asterids and
   therefore provide a strong reason for their functional association with
   the corresponding types of floral forms. We present observations on
   petal folds and their surface microstructure in two Ruellia species
   studied, and note that the microstructure differs in different regions
   containing petal folds-denser on out-folds compared to the
   in-folds-throughout the throat of the funneliform corolla. We then
   discuss: (a) how these secondary microstructures differentiating in the
   two types of folds could be associated with varied functional aspects,
   and (b) what might be governing this differential development of
   cuticular secondary microstructure, through some hypotheses.},

Title = {Sexual recombination and temporal gene flow maintain host resistance and

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Infectious disease can threaten host populations. Hosts can rapidly
   evolve resistance during epidemics, with this evolution often modulated
   by fitness trade-offs (e.g., between resistance and fecundity). However,
   many organisms switch between asexual and sexual reproduction, and this
   shift in reproductive strategy can also alter how resistance in host
   populations persists through time. Recombination can shuffle alleles
   selected for during an asexual phase, uncoupling the combinations of
   alleles that facilitated resistance to parasites and altering the
   distribution of resistance phenotypes in populations. Furthermore, in
   host species that produce diapausing propagules (e.g., seeds, spores, or
   resting eggs) after sex, accumulation of propagules into and gene flow
   out of a germ bank introduce allele combinations from past populations.
   Thus, recombination and gene flow might shift populations away from the
   trait distribution reached after selection by parasites. To understand
   how recombination and gene flow alter host population resistance, we
   tracked the genotypic diversity and resistance distributions of two wild
   populations of cyclical parthenogens. In one population, resistance and
   genetic diversity increased after recombination whereas, in the other,
   recombination did not shift already high resistance and genetic
   diversity. In both lakes, resistance remained high after temporal gene
   flow. This observation surprised us: due to costs to resistance imposed
   by a fecundity-resistance trade-off, we expected that high population
   resistance would be a transient state that would be eroded through time
   by recombination and gene flow. Instead, low resistance was the
   transient state, while recombination and gene flow re-established or
   maintained high resistance to this virulent parasite. We propose this
   outcome may have been driven by the joint influence of fitness
   trade-offs, genetic slippage after recombination, and temporal gene flow
   via the egg bank.},

Title = {Resource availability for the mosquito Aedes aegypti affects the
   transmission mode evolution of a microsporidian parasite},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ecological conditions may greatly affect the relative importance of
   vertical and horizontal transmission, in particular for parasites with a
   mixed mode of transmission. Resource availability is one important
   environmental factor, affecting host growth and fecundity, but also the
   parasite's own development. The consequences for the potential of
   vertical and horizontal transmission and for the evolution of
   transmission mode are largely unknown. We let the mixed-mode
   microsporidian parasite Edhazardia aedis evolve on its mosquito host
   Aedes aegypti under high-food or low-food conditions, representing
   permissive and restricted conditions. These alter the timing of
   development of infected larvae and thereby the probabilities for the
   parasites to enter the vertical or horizontal transmission pathways.
   After 10 generations, evolved parasites were assayed under the two food
   levels. There was an ecological trade-off between transmission modes,
   mediated by nutrient effects on host development, resulting in a higher
   vertical transmission (VT) potential under high-food and a higher
   horizontal transmission (HT) potential under low-food test conditions.
   Evolution under high food increased the VT potential of the parasite,
   particularly if it was tested at low food. This involved higher
   probability of carrying binucleate spores for the emerging females,
   greater fecundity and a longer life compared to parasites that were
   tested in the same conditions but had evolved under low food. The
   changes are related to the developmental regulation and switch in the
   production of two spore types, affecting investment in VT or HT. In
   contrast, the HT potential remained relatively unaffected by the
   parasite's evolutionary history, suggesting that, within our
   experiential design, the VT mode evolved independently of the HT mode.
   Our work illustrates the possible links between resource availability,
   within-host developmental processes and the evolution of parasite
   transmission investment. Future work, theoretical and experimental,
   should scale up from within-host to between-host levels, including
   eco-evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to new ecological niches is known to spur population
   diversification and may lead to speciation if gene flow is ceased. While
   adaptation to the same ecological niche is expected to be parallel, it
   is more difficult to predict whether selection against maladaptive
   hybridization in secondary sympatry results in parallel divergence also
   in traits that are not directly related to the ecological niches. Such
   parallelisms in response to selection for reproductive isolation can be
   identified through estimating parallelism in reproductive character
   displacement across different zones of secondary contact. Here, we use a
   host shift in the phytophagous peacock fly Tephritis conura, with both
   host races represented in two geographically separate areas East and
   West of the Baltic Sea to investigate convergence in morphological
   adaptations. We asked (i) if there are consistent morphological
   adaptations to a host plant shift and (ii) if the response to secondary
   sympatry with the alternate host race is parallel across contact zones.
   We found surprisingly low and variable, albeit significant, divergence
   between host races. Only one trait, the length of the female ovipositor,
   which serves an important function in the interaction with the hosts,
   was consistently different between host races. Instead, co-existence
   with the other host race significantly affected the degree of
   morphological divergence, but the divergence was largely driven by
   different traits in different contact zones. Thus, local stochastic
   fixation or reinforcement could generate trait divergence, and
   additional evidence is needed to conclude whether divergence is locally
   adaptive.},

Abstract = {Descendants of introgressive hybridization between species may have
   evolutionary advantages over their parental species. Prior studies have
   documented evidence of introgressive hybridization between coyotes,
   dogs, grey wolves and eastern wolves. This study attempts to attribute
   morphology and pelage patterns of Pennsylvania coyotes to sex,
   ecoregion, and the degree of coyote-wolf introgressive hybridization. A
   total of 192 coyotes were genotyped at 63 ancestry informative SNPS to
   determine the percent of coyote genome attributable to wolf origin
   (percent wolf). Females had higher percent wolf than males, which could
   be the result of lower survivorship in hybrid males. Percent wolf, sex,
   and ecoregion each were found to independently influence size using
   general linear model analysis, and the effect of sex was most
   pronounced. Coyotes from Northeastern and northcentral ecoregions of
   Pennsylvania were larger in size and possessed a higher percent wolf.
   Moreover, coyotes with higher percent wolf were larger, less red in some
   parts of their pelage, and had a different pelage patchiness
   composition. This correlates with previous studies that showed
   ecoregions with increased deer density correlated to coyotes with higher
   percent wolf. Size and percent wolf may be adaptively advantageous in
   Northeastern Pennsylvania where there is a relatively high deer
   population abundance. Furthermore, the degree of redness within coyotes
   may be used as an indicator for introgression levels for population
   managers, aiding in understanding the shifting ecological role of
   coyotes.},

Title = {Extrapair mating opportunity explains the evolutionary transition
   between the presence and absence of tail ornamentation in swallows},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {899-913},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Evolutionary drivers of the gain and loss of ornamentation are often
   unclear even for classic ornamentation such as swallows' tails, because
   macroevolutionary analysis, which is needed to clarify the factors
   responsible for the transition, is rarely conducted. Some behavioural
   experiments support the hypothesis that sexual selection is responsible
   for the evolution of ``forked{''} tails, while others support the
   hypothesis that foraging on large prey favours the evolution of forked
   tails. However, empirical tests of these hypotheses used
   already-ornamented species and macroevolutionary studies of
   forked/forkless tails, which is critical for inferring the evolutionary
   forces driving the transition between the presence and absence of
   ornamentation, are still lacking. Here, using a clade of swallows and
   martins (Aves: Hirundininae), we examined the evolutionary transition
   between forkless and forked tails in relation to measures of foraging
   mode and sexual selection. We found replicated evolution of forkless
   tails from forked tails, all in clades with sexually monomorphic
   plumage. Furthermore, we detected correlated evolution of tail shape
   (i.e., forkless/forked) and extrapair mating opportunity, measured as
   incubation type which is tightly linked to extrapair paternity both
   within and among species. A transition from forked to forkless tails was
   less likely to occur than the reverse transition when extrapair mating
   opportunities were readily available, but not when extrapair mating
   opportunities were limited. In contrast, the tail shape was more likely
   to evolve independently with prey size (i.e., small/large) and social
   foraging behaviour (i.e., social/solitary foraging). These findings
   indicate that the intensity of sexual selection, rather than foraging
   mode, explains the evolutionary transition between the presence and
   absence of tail ornamentation, questioning the widespread perspective
   that capturing large prey is an evolutionary force driving and
   maintaining forked tails.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Butterflies are frequently conspicuous. The function of this
   conspicuousness is understudied and may vary between species or family.
   Aposematism has frequently been proposed, as well as sexual signalling;
   even allowing for other functions, gaps seem to remain. Butterflies are
   also frequently social and many species will aggregate in large
   clusters. Here I propose that striking colourations may have evolved in
   some species to improve visibility to conspecifics, even if it also
   increases visibility to predators and even if colouration provides no
   other benefit, merely because the improved visibility increases the
   probability of being part of a cluster which provides protection against
   predation through dilution. As well as showing the potential existence
   of a new mechanism which can lead to bright colour occurring in flying
   insects, the proposed mechanism may provide an explanation to the
   mimicry rings of Heliconius butterflies that is superior to Mullerian
   mimicry. Several features of Heliconius rings seem to contradict the
   logic and premises of Mullerian mimicry, but would be predicted by, or
   consistent with, the hypothesis that the marks on Heliconius wings are
   signals towards co-roosters.},

Abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs are frequently monitored by researchers for
   elevated mercury concentrations in sportfish. Rivers and streams,
   especially those of smaller orders, are less frequently monitored for
   mercury contamination and nonsport fishes and invertebrates, although
   important components of the food web, are rarely examined. We addressed
   this gap by surveying mercury levels in a stream community in the
   Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, U.S., by sampling fish and
   macroinvertebrates at ten sites in the river. We found elevated levels
   of mercury across taxa within the river including individuals of
   smallmouth bass populations 10-25 cm in length having concentrations
   (2986 +/- 1053 ng/g dry weight) above the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency human limit. Furthermore, we observed high concentrations in
   darters and logperch (1133 +/- 464 ng/g dry weight), nonsport fishes
   found predominantly in rivers and streams. Our results indicate mercury
   contamination can reach elevated concentrations in rivers and stream
   food webs, posing risks to both humans and wildlife.},

Abstract = {Daily and seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions can
   significantly impact the survivorship and reproductive success of
   animals by altering energetic costs and predation risks. Behaviorally,
   animals often respond to changes in their environment through regulation
   of activity and associated movement patterns. We used
   accelerometer-informed GPS telemetry to assess nightly activity and
   movement patterns in response to environmental conditions in a small
   endotherm, the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale !Morita). Nightly
   movements and activity of skunks were monitored in association with
   ambient temperature, precipitation, and moon illumination during late
   winter through summer in Alabama. Eastern spotted skunks were strictly
   nocturnal, exhibiting almost no daytime activity. Total time active and
   total distance moved each night increased with ambient temperature and
   rainfall. Variation in moon illumination, which may affect predation
   risk, did not impact skunk nightly activity or movement. Eastern spotted
   skunks likely reduce predation risk by being active between sunset and
   sunrise when they are less visible to predators. Lower activity and
   movement at cooler temperatures significantly reduces thermoregulatory
   costs for small endotherms. Increased activity of skunks during or
   shortly after precipitation may be driven by increased prey
   availability. Our findings indicate that small endotherms, like the
   eastern spotted skunk, rely extensively on behavioral thermoregulation,
   instead of physiological adaptation, to buffer themselves against
   changing environmental conditions. Behavioral flexibility may promote
   species persistence as climate changes, and should be considered in
   conservation strategies of vulnerable species, such as eastern spotted
   skunks.},

Title = {Drivers of Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans Aggregation Size
   in South Carolina, USA},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-32},

Abstract = {Although it is known that southern flying squirrels (Glaticomys volans)
   nest in larger groups to offset the energetic costs of low temper:mires.
   the influence of other variables on aggregation size remains relatively
   unknown. Therefore, the influence of environmental variables and
   individual characteristics of G. volans on nest box aggregation size was
   studied from 1992-1998 at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.
   Over the study period, 5859 occupied boxes were observed, representing
   11,238 captures and 2671 unique individuals. The majority of occupied
   boxes (60.3\%) contained solitary individuals, while 26.1\% contained
   aggregations (>= 2 individuals) of adult and/or subadult individuals and
   13.6\% contained litters. Although ambient temperature is widely
   believed to be the most important variable influencing aggregation size
   of G. volans, the final model explaining nest aggregation size for G.
   volans included not only minimum daily ambient temperature, but also
   Julian date and individual G. volans characteristics of sex, age, and
   reproductive status. Minimum ambient temperature was inversely related
   to aggregation size, with larger aggregation sizes associated with
   winter months, although aggregation size sharply increased between the
   months of Aug.- Sept. The retention of Julian date in the final model,
   in addition to minimum ambient temperature, indicates that behavioral
   shifts due to seasonal changes, independent of temperature, should be
   considered. Nestlings were associated with larger aggregation sizes, as
   were inactive and lactating females and inactive males. However, sex
   alone did not significantly contribute to the final model. This study
   demonstrates that in addition to temperature, there are a suite of
   predictors of nest aggregation size for G. volans that should be
   considered when evaluating nest box occupancy for this species.},

Title = {An Assessment of Prairie Management Practices for Maintaining Habitat
   Quality for the Endangered Poweshiek Skipperling Butterfly in Canada},

Abstract = {The Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek) was once a common prairie
   butterfly in central North America, but is now critically endangered in
   Canada and the United States. The Poweshiek skipperling is confined to
   the largest remaining tall grass prairie in Canada, which is currently
   managed using grazing and fire to maintain prairie habitat and prevent
   forest and shrub encroachment. To support re-introduction, restocking,
   and recovery of this critically endangered species, it is necessary to
   understand the habitat conditions preferred by skipperlings. By
   surveying prairie sites with Poweshiek skipperling across age and
   treatment categories (1-2 y since burn, 4-6 y since burn, >15 y since
   burn, and grazing), we identified commonly-used nectar plants and
   recorded physical variables known to influence plant diversity. We
   measured soil variables, including macronutrients, compaction, pH,
   texture, and moisture content, and used multivariate statistics to test
   for significant differences in site characteristics and plant community
   across treatments. For each site, we captured plant diversity,
   abundance, and cover, as well as total plant biomass. We found the
   oldest burn sites had the fewest skipperlings. Intermediate burn sites
   and lightly grazed sites contained the most skipperlings. In 95\% of
   nectaring observations, adult skipperlings were feeding on Black-eyed
   Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), upland white aster (Solidago ptarmicoides), and
   Self-heal (Prunella vulgaris). Characteristics in the physical
   components of sites and plant communities did not significantly differ
   across treatment types for most variables with the exception of the
   oldest burns, which showed significantly higher levels of soil
   compaction, live biomass, bare ground, less flowering species during the
   flight period, less flowering stems, and increased presence of nonnative
   and invasive species. Poweshiek skipperling is at high risk of imminent
   extirpation, and we recommend that the management regimes be adjusted to
   plan for a consistent supply of habitat conditions and plant species
   composition exemplified by our intermediate burn sites. We suggest fire
   return intervals of 4-6 y using patch burns in combination with grazing,
   permitted at times that minimize the impact on immature stages of
   Poweshick skipperling. This management is needed to provide suitable
   habitat conditions to maintain the current population and allow for
   successful restocking and recovery.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to one stressor can influence organismal responses to future
   environmental changes, either to the same or a novel stressor. But there
   is a lack of research on this topic, particularly in the context of
   freshwater habitats. Fluctuating salinity and heatwaves that are
   becoming more frequent and intensified are affecting freshwater
   ecosystems. We applied an experimental evolution approach to examine the
   influence of adaptation to elevated salinity on the population's
   responses to subsequent salt and heat stress. We conducted lab
   experiments using Daphnia pulicaria cultured from individuals with
   previous 8-week exposure history to two salinity treatments (6.5 or 350
   mg Cl-/L). Iso-female lines with or without prior exposure to elevated
   salinity were assayed along a salt gradient (18.5 to 1500 mg Cl-/L) or
   an acute heat gradient treatment (20 to 35 degrees C). Our results
   showed that Daphnia survival, fecundity, and body length growth rate
   declined with increased salt concentration, with survival and fecundity
   being most sensitive. The treatment group with previous salt exposure
   history had higher survival and fecundity than the naive treatment group
   when treated with salt, without loss of fitness under low-salinity
   conditions. Daphnia survival and growth rates were reduced in
   temperatures higher than 30 degrees C. Despite the fact that the two
   stressors can induce similar defense mechanisms, previous exposure
   history to salt did not prevent Daphnia populations from experiencing
   reduced survival and growth rates under heated conditions. Our work
   demonstrates that organisms can rapidly adapt to a stressor that
   protects them from later exposure to increases in this stressor, without
   a trade-off in fitness under undisturbed conditions, but this evolved
   tolerance cannot protect them from all levels of this stressor or
   alleviate damage by a novel one.},

Title = {Five-Year Effects of Introduced Mountain Goats and Recreation on Plant
   Communities and Species of Conservation Concern in an Alpine Sky Island},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems in the arid southwestern United States are vulnerable
   to climate change. Many of these ecosystems are experiencing increased
   recreational use and introductions of nonindigenous ungulates. In the La
   Sal Mountains of southeastern Utah, alpine plant communities support an
   endemic plant species, Erigeron mancus, 11 plant and two animal species
   of conservation concern, and a United States Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) Forest Service Research Natural Area. Nonindigenous mountain
   goats (Oreamnos americanus) were introduced by the Utah Division of
   Wildlife Resources (UDWR) in 2013 and 2014, and recreational use has
   increased in the intervening period. To evaluate potential effects of
   mountain goat and recreational use, vegetation monitoring was initiated
   by the USDA Forest Service in 2016. We used 5 y monitoring data
   (2016-2020) and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the separate
   and interacting effects of year, recreational use, and mountain goat use
   on: (1) populations of plant species of conservation concern; (2)
   vascular and nonvascular plant cover; and (3) ground cover. Our analyses
   revealed decreases in proportional frequency of E. mancus at the end of
   the monitoring. Proportional cover of dominant plant growth forms,
   especially forbs, declined, while proportional cover of litter and
   ineffective ground cover (bare soil and pavement) increased.
   Recreational or goat use were a factor in several of the observed
   changes, although weather and climate likely also influenced the
   results. Management complexity arises because of the different missions
   of USDA Forest Service and UDWR, but adjustments in mountain goat
   numbers and recreational use may be needed to maintain ecologically
   resilient ecosystems. Continued monitoring can provide the basis for
   adaptive management.},

Abstract = {Based on daily collections of final instar exuviae, the widespread
   annual cicada adult emergence of Neotibicen canicularis (Harris)
   (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) was studied in southeastern Wisconsin in a
   combined plot containing 15 mature trees and suburban lawns for seven
   successive years and in a separate plot of two trees for four years. The
   daily numbers of males and females were recorded. Over the entire seven
   years of the 15-tree plot, total female and male exuviae were equal, a
   summative 50:50 ratio. However, there was considerable deviation from
   this ratio three of the seven years. More females than males eclosed in
   the first two years and more males eclosed in the final year, yet the
   overall trend was for females to eclose later than males for the entire
   seven-year study of the 15-tree plot, with many more females emerging in
   the last twenty plus days. Although ambient temperatures varied over the
   study (cooler in the first two years and warmer later), they did not
   have any discernible effect on the timing of female and male eclosions.
   The overall annual emergence period was 56.7 (SE 4.48) d for a
   seven-year total of 2967 exuviae, with the annual average emergence
   being 437.6 (SE 34.6) per year. The average density of exuviae, an
   estimate of the emerging adult population, was 1.3 +/- 0.09 (SE) per
   m(2). In the separate two-tree plot, a greater number of males emerged
   than females for all four years.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Although past work has considered how evolution and Allee effects each
   shape population spread, these factors have rarely been considered
   together. We develop an integrodifference equation model that tracks
   individuals of multiple dispersal types (i.e., short- and long-distance
   dispersers) of male and female individuals subject to a strong Allee
   effect due to mate-finding process. We use our model to explore how
   mutation between different dispersal types affects the rate of
   population spread, since this evolutionary mechanism has been shown to
   lead to both faster and slower spread in a previous individual-based
   model. We ask, under what conditions does mutation cause the population
   to spread faster (or slower) than it spreads without mutation (from the
   same initial conditions)? We find that mutation can both speed up and
   slow down invasions. Speeding up occurs in a relatively small range of
   parameter space near the Allee threshold of the population. Slowing down
   occurs across a broad range of parameters.},

Abstract = {Sibly et al. (2005) described that most species have a fundamental
   characteristic to follow the theta-logistic growth trait with the convex
   downward trend. The fundamental yardstick of this research work builds
   under the deterministic setup, whereas the involvement of the external
   noise in any growth system is inevitable. But, the involvement of
   external affairs in any species growth can not be well judged only
   through its density dependence; it requires a further assessment. So, we
   frame the theta-logistic model with the stochastic analog in two
   directions, i.e., the discrete and continuous setup. The analysis of the
   discrete stochastic model is manifested by the bifurcation analysis,
   which shows that the attainment of the chaotic regime enhances with the
   increase in noise intensity level. Although the role of chaos in species
   extinction is debatable, a literature survey suggests that chaos with
   stochasticity accelerates the extinction of species. Similarly, in the
   case of the continuous version, we performed a theoretical study on the
   stochastic theta-logistic model to provide a critical value of the noise
   intensity parameter. This threshold magnitude acts as the sustainability
   criterion of any species environmental tolerability. In this connection,
   we use the data of four major taxonomic groups, i.e., Bird, Insect,
   Mammal, and Fish, from the GPDD database and classifies the species
   based on environmental sensitivity. The highly sensitive species have a
   low tolerance level, associated with the small magnitude of
   environmental noise intensity parameter. Moreover, the simulation
   prediction model on these four taxonomic classes also shows that the
   overall extinction probability of the considered birds in our research
   work is almost negligible for the current time window.},

   accumulation lines reveals association of metabolic disruption and

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which mutations affect fitness and the
   distribution of mutational effects are central goals in evolutionary
   biology. Mutation accumulation (MA) lines have long been an important
   tool for understanding the effect of new mutations on fitness,
   phenotypic variation, and mutational parameters. However, there is a
   clear gap in predicting the effect of specific new mutations to their
   effects on fitness. In an attempt to directly connect the effect of
   spontaneous mutations to their fitness effects, we quantified the
   metabolic expression of 386 known compounds in primary and secondary
   metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana MA lines that had consistently higher
   and lower relative fitness than the progenitor. The high and low fitness
   lines do not have a difference in the average number of mutations and
   share the same types of metabolic pathways disrupted. However, compared
   to the progenitor, low fitness lines have significantly more metabolic
   subpathways disrupted than lines with higher fitness. These results
   suggest that the effect of a new mutation on fitness depends less on the
   specific metabolic pathways disrupted and potentially more on the number
   of disrupted pathways. We fail to identify any direct connection of
   mutations in or near well annotated genes to their effect on
   well-characterized biochemical pathways, possibly due to incomplete
   annotations of molecular function or to non-genetic variation
   controlling metabolic expression. Our findings indicate that organisms
   can explore a considerable amount of physiological space with only a few
   mutations.},

Abstract = {Previous work involving integro-difference equations of a single species
   in a homogenous environment has emphasized spreading behavior in
   unbounded habitats. We show that, under suitable conditions, a simple
   scalar integro-difference equation incorporating a strong Allee effect
   and overcompensation can produce solutions where the population persists
   in an essentially bounded domain without spread despite the homogeneity
   of the environment. These solutions are robust in that they occupy a
   region of full measure in parameter space. We develop orbit diagrams
   showing various patterns of nonspreading solutions from stable
   equilibria, period-two, to higher periodicity. We show that from a
   relatively uniform initial density with small stochastic perturbations,
   a population consisting of multiple isolated patches can emerge. In
   ecological terms, this work suggests a novel endogenous mechanism for
   the creation of patch boundaries.},

Title = {When growing pains and sick days collide: infectious disease can

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {All individuals transition through various life stages over the course
   of their development and nearly all organisms must contend with
   infectious disease at some point in their lives. Yet the intersection of
   these two universal features of life-stage structure and infectious
   disease-and their joint effects on population dynamics are poorly
   understood. Here, we develop a two-stage population model in which
   density dependence acts on juvenile maturation, and infectious disease
   affects either juveniles or adults via reduction in maturation,
   reproduction, or survival. In the absence of disease, this form of
   density dependence can generate persistent population oscillations. We
   examine whether infectious disease further accentuates these
   oscillations (by augmenting their amplitude) or stabilizes them (by
   reducing their amplitude). We find that, for moderate transmission rates
   (a proxy for disease incidence), disease can stabilize dynamics. In
   contrast, fast disease transmission is not generally stabilizing, which
   is, at least in part, due to disease overexploitation of the infectious
   class. Hydra effects are possible in the model due to density
   overcompensation and occur when disease increases juvenile mortality or
   decreases adult fecundity (but do not occur when disease augments adult
   mortality or reduces maturation). Slow maturation, large disease-free
   population size, and strong density-dependent population regulation can
   each lower the transmission rate required for the infectious disease to
   invade the population.},

Title = {The combined effects of dispersal and herbivores on stable states in
   coral reefs},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {321-335},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Theory and empirical work suggest that coral reefs may exhibit
   alternative stable states of coral versus macroalgal dominance. However,
   it is unclear how dispersal of coral and macroalgae among reefs might
   impact this bistability and the resilience of the coral-dominated state.
   We develop a mathematical model to investigate how reef cover dynamics
   are affected by (1) coral and macroalgal dispersal between two reefs and
   (2) heterogeneous grazer abundances. We find that at low coral and
   macroalgal dispersal levels, a new type of stable state emerges with
   both coral and macroalgae present. Furthermore, we show that a reef
   abundant with coral and grazers can support a coral-dominated stable
   state in a second reef depauperate of grazers by dispersal of coral
   larvae. These results help explain previous empirical findings on reefs
   once thought to be incongruent with traditional coral-macroalgal
   alternative stable states theory-such as intermediate coral and
   macroalgal cover stable states and high coral-low grazing scenarios. Our
   findings indicate that changing dispersal levels (e.g., due to climate
   change, reef degradation) between reefs changes the possible stable
   states and the grazing rate at which the coral-dominated state is
   predicted to be stable. This work demonstrates the relevance of
   accounting for the level of dispersal among coral reefs or other
   bistable ecosystems when designing conservation management plans.},

Title = {Size-dependent fitness trade-offs of foraging in the presence of

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-189},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Prey species make choices about whether to employ costly predator
   avoidance behaviors throughout their growth and lifecycle. Here, we
   explore the effects of prey size at a given age (ontogenetic size) and
   prey growth on optimal behavior using a dynamic optimization model.
   Under the assumption that prey experience greatest predation risk at
   intermediate or large sizes, and that growth is fastest at intermediate
   or large sizes, we find that prey should generally forage when they are
   small in size and hide when they are larger due to a critical strategy
   switching size threshold. But this is dependent both on the mortality
   risks and on the rate of growth. Higher background mortality rates or
   lower predator-induced detection costs of foraging reduce the size at
   which prey switches from foraging to hiding. Rapid initial growth leads
   to decreased overall survival and a wider range of conditions under
   which the prey hides from the predator. As a test case, the model is
   parametrized with data and applied to understand differing risk-reducing
   behaviors between cannibal and non-cannibal Leptinotarsa decemlineata,
   Colorado potato beetle, larvae. The model predicts that a wide range of
   parameter values lead to differing behaviors of cannibals and
   non-cannibals of the same age due to differences in ontogenetic size. We
   also see that individuals with swifter early growth switch to hiding at
   larger sizes but will often have earlier strategy switching times. This
   increases survival of cannibals to the critical pupation size with the
   largest increases occurring when the baseline death rate is high. Our
   findings suggest that ecological factors that affect the rate of growth
   during development, even if final size is not affected, may have an
   important role in prey responses to predators.},

Abstract = {Despite their visibility, abundance, and widespread distribution, the
   movements of Isabella moth larvae (a.k.a ``woolly worms:'' Pyrrharctia
   isabella (J.E. Smith); Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae) have been
   poorly studied. We observed these larvae to assess the relationship
   between their movement and local environmental conditions. Twice each
   day for 83 d, nearly 52 km of highway were observed in northwest
   Missouri. A total of 264 larvae were encountered during 664 total visits
   to four road sections, peaking in the first week of October. Analyses
   revealed increased larva abundance (n >= 159 road-section visits)
   associated with temperature, wind speed, pale pavement tint, and
   afternoon time-of-day. The best overall model to explain larval movement
   patterns, based on 163 visits and all measured conditions, incorporated
   temperature, north wind speed, west wind speed, and humidity (P =
   0.015), but no other factors. In addition, larvae showed a significant
   tendency to travel in the same direction as the wind, and to travel
   eastward in the afternoons. These observations provide insights into the
   fall movements of a common larva, and provide directions for future
   research.},

Title = {Allometric patterns in phrynosomatid lizards and the implications for
   reconstructing body size for fossils},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Body size is an important life history trait that for fossils can be
   reconstructed by utilizing scaling relationships between body size and
   measurements on isolated bones from extant taxa. Allometry, which
   describes the scaling relationship between such a measurement and body
   size, has traditionally been thought of as constrained, meaning that
   evolutionary allometries should follow the same trajectories as
   ontogenetic and static allometries. However, if allometries are evolving
   it may be difficult to accurately estimate body size for extinct taxa or
   fossils that cannot be identified to low taxonomic levels. Knowing the
   degree to which the allometric relationships of features are
   evolutionarily constrained therefore has implications for studying the
   fossil record and can also provide insight into morphological evolution.
   We use phrynosomatid lizards as a case study for investigating scaling
   relationships at different taxonomic levels. We examined scaling
   relationships between body size, represented as snout-vent length (SVL),
   and 15 skeletal measurements taken from 188 phrynosomatid lizards with
   30 species represented. For each measurement, we developed
   species-level, genus-level, subfamily-level, and family-level linear
   models. We used these models to predict SVL in cross-validation tests
   and determine which models and measurements produced the most accurate
   body size predictions. Generally, predictions from congeneric species
   accurately reconstructed body size, but some measurements also exhibited
   conserved scaling relationships across phrynosomatids and appear to
   serve as good family-wide predictors for body size. We found that static
   allometries are more similar to evolutionary allometries at the
   genus-level than to family-level evolutionary allometries. Differences
   between evolutionary allometries at the genus and family-level appear to
   be driven by Phrynosoma, as measurements on several cranioskeletal
   elements are highly divergent. Our work sets a foundation for
   understanding allometric relationships across Phrynosomatidae and

Abstract = {Cognitive and sensory abilities are vital in affecting survival under
   predation risk, leading to selection on brain anatomy. However, how
   exactly predation and brain evolution are linked has not yet been
   resolved, as current empirical evidence is inconclusive. This may be due
   to predation pressure having different effects across life stages and/or
   due to confounding factors in ecological comparisons of predation
   pressure. Here, we used adult guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to
   experimentally test how direct predation during adulthood would impact
   the relative brain size and brain anatomy of surviving individuals to
   examine if predators selectively remove individuals with specific brain
   morphology. To this end, we compared fish surviving predation to control
   fish, which were exposed to visual and olfactory predator cues but could
   not be predated on. We found that predation impacted the relative size
   of female brains. However, this effect was dependent on body size, as
   larger female survivors showed relatively larger brains, while smaller
   survivors showed relatively smaller brains when compared to control
   females. We found no differences in male relative brain size between
   survivors and controls, nor for any specific relative brain region sizes
   for either sex. Our results corroborate the important, yet complex, role
   of predation as an important driver of variation in brain size.},

Abstract = {What are the relative costs and benefits of mounting immune responses?
   Practitioners of ecoimmunology have grappled with this central question
   since the field's inception with the main tension being how to make
   tractable methodological choices that maintain the ecological relevance
   of induced and measured immune costs. Here, we point out two
   methodological approaches that we feel are underrepresented in the
   field, describe risks associated with neglecting these methods, and
   suggest modern techniques that maximize both the diversity and
   ecological relevance of collected data. First, it is commonly assumed
   that frequently used and experimentally convenient immune stimulants
   will induce ecologically relevant immune responses in study organisms.
   This can be a dangerous assumption. Even if a stimulant's general immune
   response properties are well characterized, it is critical to also
   measure the type and scale of immune responses induced by live
   pathogens. Second, patterns of immune defenses evolve like other traits,
   thus a comparative approach is essential to understand what forces shape
   immune variation. Finally, we describe modern genetic and immunological
   approaches that will soon become essential tools for ecoimmunologists,
   and present case studies that exemplify the utility of our
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {The glossy snake (Arizona elegans) is a polytypic species broadly
   distributed across southwestern North America. The species occupies
   habitats ranging from California's coastal chaparral to the shortgrass
   prairies of Texas and southeastern Nebraska, to the extensive arid
   scrublands of central Mexico. Three subspecies are currently recognized
   in California, one of which is afforded state-level protection based on
   the extensive loss and modification of its preferred alluvial coastal
   scrub and inland desert habitat. We report the first genome assembly of
   A. elegans occidentalis as part of the California Conservation Genomics
   Project (CCGP). Consistent with the reference genome strategy of the
   CCGP, we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Hi-C
   chromatin-proximity sequencing technologies to produce a de novo
   assembled genome. The assembly comprises a total of 140 scaffolds
   spanning 1,842,602,218 base pairs, has a contig NG50 of 61 Mb, a
   scaffold NG50 of 136 Mb, and a BUSCO complete score of 95.9\%, and is
   one of the most complete snake genome assemblies. The A. e. occidentalis
   genome will be a key tool for understanding the genomic diversity and
   the basis of adaptations within this species and close relatives within
   the hyperdiverse snake family Colubridae.},

Abstract = {Dareshouri, Arabian, and Akhal-Teke are 3 Middle Eastern horse breeds
   that have been selected for endurance and adaptation to harsh climates.
   Deciphering the genetic characteristics of these horses by tracing
   selection footprints and copy number of variations will be helpful in
   improving our understanding of equine breeds' development and
   adaptation. For this purpose, we sequenced the whole genome of 4
   Dareshouri horses using Illumina Hiseq panels and compared them with
   publicly available whole-genome sequences of Arabian (n = 3) and
   Akhal-Teke (n = 3) horses. Three tests of FLK, hapFLK, and pooled
   heterozygosity were applied using a sliding window (window size = 100
   kb, step size = 50 kb) approach to detect putative selection signals.
   Copy number variation analysis was applied to investigate copy number of
   variants (CNVs), and the results were used to suggest selection
   signatures involving CNVs. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated 8 837
   950 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in autosomal chromosomes. We
   suggested 58 genes and 3 quantitative trait loci, including some related
   to horse gait, insect bite hypersensitivity, and withers height, based
   on selective signals detected by adjusted P-value of Mahalanobis
   distance based on the rank-based P-values (Md-rank-P) method. We
   proposed 12 genomic regions under selection pressure involving CNVs that
   were previously reported to be associated with metabolism energy
   (SLC5A8), champagne dilution in horses (SLC36A1), and synthesis of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAT2). Only 10 Middle Eastern horses were
   tested in this study; therefore, the conclusions are speculative. Our
   findings are useful to better understanding the evolution and adaptation
   of Middle Eastern horse breeds.},

Title = {Sea-level rise can reverse the conditions that promote the spread of
   ecosystem engineers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Climate change and its consequences such as sea-level rise will modify
   environmental gradients, altering the spatial spread and persistence of
   plant populations. However, ecosystem engineers can also modify
   environmental gradients. To quantify the potential interactive effects
   of climate change and ecosystem engineering on population spread rates,
   we develop a spatial model that explicitly focuses on feedbacks between
   coastal vegetation growth and the environmental gradient of marsh
   elevation. We use the model to determine how sea-level rise could change
   how ecosystem engineering affects the spread rate of marsh populations.
   The model demonstrates that low levels of ecosystem engineering can
   produce the highest population spread rates in the absence of sea-level
   rise in initially low-elevation marshes. However, higher rates of
   ecosystem engineering and initially higher elevation marshes produce the
   highest population spread rates in the presence of sea-level rise.
   Sea-level rise can therefore reverse the conditions that drive high
   rates of spatial spread: engineers with low rates of spatial spread
   prior to sea-level rise may spread faster as sea levels rise. This
   result suggests that sea-level rise may promote the spread of invasive
   ecosystem engineers that previously experienced low rates of spatial
   spread. Moreover, ecosystem engineering can serve as a mechanism for
   adaptation to climate-driven changes in environmental gradients.
   Ecosystem engineering has the potential to rescue both native and exotic
   plant populations from climate-driven decreases in habitat suitability.},

   genetic data to modernize natural resource management at a regional
   scale. We describe the CCGP, including all aspects of project
   administration, data collection, current progress, and future
   challenges. The CCGP will generate, analyze, and curate a single
   high-quality reference genome and 100-150 resequenced genomes for each
   of 153 species projects (representing 235 individual species) that span
   the ecological and phylogenetic breadth of California's marine,
   freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. The resulting portfolio of
   roughly 20 000 resequenced genomes will be analyzed with identical
   informatic and landscape genomic pipelines, providing a comprehensive
   overview of hotspots of within-species genomic diversity, potential and
   realized corridors connecting these hotspots, regions of reduced
   diversity requiring genetic rescue, and the distribution of variation
   critical for rapid climate adaptation. After 2 years of concerted
   effort, full funding (\$12M USD) has been secured, species identified,
   and funds distributed to 68 laboratories and 114 investigators drawn
   from all 10 University of California campuses. The remaining phases of
   the CCGP include completion of data collection and analyses, and
   delivery of the resulting genomic data and inferences to state and
   federal regulatory agencies to help stabilize species declines. The
   aspirational goals of the CCGP are to identify geographic regions that
   are critical to long-term preservation of California biodiversity,
   prioritize those regions based on defensible genomic criteria, and
   provide foundational knowledge that informs management strategies at
   both the individual species and ecosystem levels.},

Abstract = {Despite periodic drops in popularity, Arctic sled dogs continue to play
   a vital role in northern societies, providing both freight transit and
   recreational race activities. In this study, we selected the Mackenzie
   River Husky, a freight dog of complex history, and the Chinook, an
   American Kennel Club recognized freight dog breed whose heritage
   reportedly overlaps that of the MKRH, for detailed population analysis.
   We tested each to determine their component breeds and used admixture
   analysis to ascertain their population structure. We utilized haplotype
   analysis to identify genomic regions shared between each population and
   their founding breeds. Our data show that the Alaskan Malamutes and
   modern Greenland sled dog contributed to both populations, but there are
   also unexpected contributions from the German Shepherd dog and Collie.
   We used haplotype analysis to identify genomic regions nearing fixation
   in population type and identify provocative genes in each region.
   Finally, in response to recent reports regarding the importance of
   dietary lipid genes in Arctic dogs, we analyzed 8 such genes in a
   targeted analysis observing signatures of selection in both populations
   at the MLXIPL gene loci. These data highlight the genetic routes that
   breeds of similar function have taken toward their occupation as
   successful sled dogs.},

Title = {Effects of long-term ethanol storage of blood samples on the estimation
   of telomere length},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {915-931},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Telomeres, DNA structures located at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes,
   shorten with each cellular cycle. The shortening rate is affected by
   factors associated with stress, and, thus telomere length has been used
   as a biomarker of ageing, disease, and different life history
   trade-offs. Telomere research has received much attention in the last
   decades, however there is still a wide variety of factors that may
   affect telomere measurements and to date no study has thoroughly
   evaluated the possible long-term effect of a storage medium on telomere
   measurements. In this study we evaluated the long-term effects of
   ethanol on relative telomere length (RTL) measured by qPCR, using blood
   samples of magpies collected over twelve years and stored in absolute
   ethanol at room temperature. We firstly tested whether storage time had
   an effect on RTL and secondly we modelled the effect of time of storage
   (from 1 to 12 years) in differences in RTL from DNA extracted twice in
   consecutive years from the same blood sample. We also tested whether
   individual amplification efficiencies were influenced by storage time,
   and whether this could affect our results. Our study provides evidence
   of an effect of storage time on telomere length measurements.
   Importantly, this effect shows a pattern of decreasing loss of telomere
   sequence with storage time that stops after approximate 4 years of
   storage, which suggests that telomeres may degrade in blood samples
   stored in ethanol. Our method to quantify the effect of storage time
   could be used to evaluate other storage buffers and methods. Our results
   highlight the need to evaluate the long-term effects of storage on
   telomere measurements, particularly in long-term studies.},

Title = {Body size in Batesian mimicry},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {233-243},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A variety of traits is available for predators to distinguish
   unpalatable prey from palatable Batesian mimics. Among them, body size
   has received little attention as a possible mimetic trait. Size should
   influence predator behaviour if it shows variation between models and
   mimics, is detectable by the predator in question, and is not
   overshadowed by other traits more salient to the predator. Simple
   predictions within mimetic populations are that perfect mimics receive
   the lowest predation rate. However, prey body size is typically tightly
   linked to the nutritional yield and handling time for a successful
   predator, as well as likely being correlated with a model's levels of
   defence. In certain circumstances, these confounding factors might mean
   that (a) selection pressures on a mimic's size either side of the
   model's phenotype are not symmetrical, (b) the optimal body size for a
   mimic is not necessarily equal to that of the model, and/or (c) for
   predators, attacking better mimics of a model's body size more readily
   is adaptive. I discuss promising avenues for improving our understanding
   of body size as a mimetic trait, including the importance of treatments
   that range in both directions from the model's size. Further work is
   required to understand how body size ranks in saliency against other
   mimetic traits such as pattern. Comparative studies could investigate
   whether mimics are limited to resembling only models that are already
   similar in size.},

Title = {Experimental evidence in a poison frog model suggests that tadpole
   transport on the dorsum may affects warning signal effectiveness in
   poison frogs},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-289},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aposematism is an anti-predator strategy where predators learn to
   associate the warning signal on prey with an unpleasant experience, and
   consequently, avoid attacking similar prey in the future. Conspicuous
   coloration in poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) is considered a warning
   signal. During parental care, parents transport their tadpoles on the
   dorsum, which could alter the detectability and recognition of such
   warning coloration by visually oriented predators. We tested this
   hypothesis using domestic chicks trained to avoid and discriminate
   between printed frog models with and without conspicuous-warning
   coloration. We tested whether the chicks recognized the warning
   coloration on printed frog models that varied in the quantity of
   tadpoles on the dorsum. Chicks first attacked frog models without
   warning coloration, whether they had tadpoles on the dorsum or not. In
   contrast, frog models with warning coloration were attacked last by
   chicks. Moreover, the frog models with warning coloration and without
   tadpoles experienced a lower risk of attack by chicks than similar frog
   models with tadpoles. However, aposematic frog models maintained the
   warning function of conspicuous coloration if it was located on parts of
   the parent's body that are not covered by the tadpoles when transported.
   Our results suggest that tadpoles on the dorsum of parents might
   compromise the effectiveness of the warning signal display in poison
   frogs increasing the risk of attack by visually oriented predators.},

Abstract = {Landscape structures drive biogeographic patterns and population
   connectivity of animals distributed across diverse biotopes. Here, we
   provide a fresh insight on the impact of five landscape types in East
   Asia on the phylogeography and acoustic variability of the widespread
   Mongolian Toad, Strauchbufo raddei. For the first time, we reconstructed
   the biogeography of S. raddei over the species' entire range throughout
   East Asia (N = 293; assembled up to 2,613 bp of concatenated CR-COI-12S
   rRNA-16S rRNA) using fossil-based molecular dating and genetic
   connectivity assessments. In addition, we addressed past population
   dynamics in relation to landscape types, and geographic variations in
   release calls for the clades occurring in the steppes of northern
   Mongolia and the Amur River basin (N = 147). Our results recovered two
   separate ancestors of S. raddei in East Asia, supporting a basal split
   between the northeastern and southern lineages in the Middle Miocene, c.
   9.48-13.77 Mya. Ancestral range estimates suggested a Late Miocene
   radiation within the northeastern lineage, likely due to aridity-induced
   vicariance and dispersal from the central Asian steppes, c. 7.89
   (5.25-11.50) Mya. The southern lineage emerged subsequently from glacial
   refugia, c. 6.84 (3.48-2.63) Mya, expanding northward and crossing the
   Gobi Desert and current-day Mongolia, c. 2.60 (1.15-3.72) Mya. At the
   exception of the pre-Tibetan Plateau clade, our reconstruction of
   migration trajectories highlighted the presence of effective gene flow
   across other landscapes, notably among the central and northeastern
   Chinese clades in the habitats defined as steppe, river basin and
   canyon. Significant variation in release calls between the clades in
   northern Mongolia and the Amur River Basin reflected the isolation
   between the two clades, and supported the presence of a northern
   refugium and post-glacial expansion of the southern lineage into
   northwestern Mongolia. In contrast with prior studies, our finding
   indicates that release calls can reflect phylogeographic patterns.},

Abstract = {Seasonal long-distance migratory behaviour of trillions of animals may
   in part have evolved to reduce parasite infection risk, and the fitness
   costs that may come with these infections. This may apply to a diversity
   of vertebrate migration strategies that can sometimes be observed within
   species and may often be age-dependent. Herein we review some common
   age-related variations in migration strategy, discussing why in some
   animal species juveniles preferentially forego or otherwise rearrange
   their migrations as compared to adults, potentially as an either
   immediate (proximate) or anticipatory (ultimate) response to infection
   risk and disease. We notably focus on the phenomenon of
   ``oversummering{''}, where juveniles abstain from migration to the
   breeding grounds. This strategy is particularly prevalent amongst
   migratory shorebirds and has thus far received little attention as a
   strategy to reduce parasite infection rate, while comparative
   intra-specific research approaches have strong potential to elucidate
   the drivers of differential behavioural strategies.},

Abstract = {We present the novel reference genome of the Versatile Fairy Shrimp,
   Branchinecta lindahli. The Versatile Fairy Shrimp is a freshwater
   anostracan crustacean found across the western United States from Iowa
   to Oregon and from Alberta to Baja California. It is an ephemeral pool
   specialist, living in prairie potholes, irrigation ditches, tire treads,
   vernal pools, and other temporary freshwater wetlands. Anostracan fairy
   shrimp are facing global declines with 3 species in California on the
   Endangered Species list. This species was included in the California
   Conservation Genomics Project to provide an easily accessible reference
   genome, and to provide whole-genome resources for a generalist species,
   which may lead to new insights into Anostracan resiliency in the face of
   climate change. The final gapped genome comprises 15 chromosome-length
   scaffolds covering 98.63\% of the 384.8 Mb sequence length, and an
   additional 55 unscaffolded contigs.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We consider the collective motion of animals in time-varying
   environments, using as a case the diel vertical migration of marine
   copepods. The animals are distributed in space such that each animal
   moves optimally, seeking regions which offer high growth rates and low
   mortalities, subject to costs on excessive movements as well as being in
   regions with high densities of conspecifics. The model applies to
   repeated scenarios such as diel or seasonal patterns, where the animals
   are aware of both current and future environmental conditions. We show
   that this problem can be viewed as a differential game of mean field
   type, and that the evolutionary stable solution, i.e., the Nash
   equilibrium, is characterized by partial differential equations, which
   govern the distributions and migration velocities of animals. These
   equations have similarities to equations that appear in the fluid
   dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid
   fluids. If the environment is constant, the ideal free distribution
   emerges as an equilibrium. We illustrate the theory with a numerical
   example of vertical migrations of oceanic copepods, where animals are
   attracted to nutrient-rich surface waters while repulsed from light
   during daytime due to the presence of visual predators, aiming to reduce
   both proximity to conspecifics and swimming efforts. For this case, we
   show that optimal movements are diel vertical migrations in qualitative
   agreement with observations of copepods.},

Title = {Urban Prairie Plots and Gardens Can Sustain Plant-Pollinator
   Interactions Similar to Established Rural Prairies},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},

Abstract = {Urban prairie ``gardens/plots{''} are gaining popularity for providing
   similar ecological services as remnant and restored prairies, which are
   predominantly found in rural areas. However, it is not known to what
   extent small urban prairies can sustain the plant-pollinator
   interactions that are vital to both the insects and the plants. The goal
   of our research was to examine plant/pollinator interactions in three
   urban prairies in southwest Missouri and compare them to rural
   managed/restored prairies using a visit-based approach. Urban prairies
   were all in Springfield, Mo. and shared similar habitat matrices (within
   an area of 8 km(2)); rural prairies were located within 68 km of urban
   prairies, shared similar habitat matrices to each other, and shared soil
   edaphic characteristics with an urban prairie. From May through August
   2018 in all six prairies, we observed the five most abundant forbs in
   bloom, the number of pollinator visits by bees, butterflies/moths,
   wasps, beetles, and flies; and, pollinator fidelity from dawn to dusk.
   The areas observed within a prairie, hereafter ``plot(s){''}, were
   determined randomly by where at least two plants of the same species,
   out of the five most abundant forbs, were located. Using these criteria
   of observations on the five most abundant species across six prairies
   and four months, a total of 66 forb species were identified, with 58 of
   the species native to tallgrass prairies. However, only eight of the 58
   native forb species were shared across urban and rural prairies. Jaccard
   similarity indices indicate lower similarity of the five abundant forbs
   within urban plots (9\%) when compared to rural plots (24\%), and low
   similarity between urban and rural plots (9\%). Insect visitation varied
   by prairie type (rural/urban), month, and insect group; however, urban
   plots received 61\% of the total visits compared to 39\% in rural plots.
   Bees accounted for 5913 visits out of 10,113 visits recorded; high bee
   visits were similar in urban and rural plots. Insect fidelity was over
   97\% and did not significantly differ between rural and urban prairies.
   Therefore, the lack of similarity among and across urban and rural
   prairies in dominant species did not affect insect visitation rates or
   fidelity in our study. Our results suggest that establishment and
   management of urban prairie gardens and plots of various size may
   sustain the same or greater levels of pollinator services as rural
   prairies.},

Abstract = {Recolonization by native species following removal of invasive plant
   species can often be uneven and lead to the rapid increase of one or a
   few native plant species. This can result in the formation of a
   significant resource pulse that may consequently affect populations of
   herbivorous species and their natural enemies. Here we present results
   from observations of parasitism rates during a localized outbreak of the
   Asimina webworm moth, Omphalocera munroei, a locally monophagous
   herbivore of the common paw-paw. Asimina triloba. This outbreak
   initiated from locations of increased understory growth of A. triloba,
   following the removal of Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii ).
   Parasitism rates during the outbreak reached 50\%, with higher
   parasitism rates observed in larvae collected at the end of the local
   outbreak relative to those the year following the peak of the outbreak.
   Parasitism rates remained high 3 y after the end of the local O. munroei
   outbreak, indicating >7 y of high parasitoid densities. O. munroei
   emerges late in the growing season, making it fairly inaccessible as a
   host or prey to many generalist predators/parasitoids, which emerge
   earlier the following year. This suggests the O. munroei outbreak
   potentially contributed to an increase in natural enemy pressure of
   other native species in the community.},

   silvicultural treatment. Treatment reduced tree density and canopy cover
   and increased mean tree diameter, woody stern density, variation in
   woody stem density, and volume of coarse woody debris. Peromyscus and
   northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were dominant
   community members across treatments and years. White-footed mice (P.
   leucopus) outnumbered woodland deer mice (P. maniculatus gracilis)
   before treatment, but declined by almost fifty percent after treatment;
   deer mice and total rodent (i.e., Rodentia) abundances were unchanged.
   Small mammal species diversity increased twofold following treatment.
   Our experiment identified species-specific responses within Peromyscus
   to timber harvest: white-footed mice, the numerically dominant and
   generalist species, were most sensitive to habitat change, and their
   response produced cascading effects to small mammal community
   .structure. Future experiments should assess these small mammal
   responses in a multi-year framework and quantify their effects on the
   broader vertebrate community.},

Title = {Oxbow Restorations for Topeka Shiner (Notropis topeka) Recovery:
   Defining Success},
Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {188},

Pages = {56-73},

Abstract = {Within the Great Plains region of North America, oxbow wetlands were
   lost as streams were channelized and straightened to allow for
   agricultural use of the landscape. Topeka Shiner, which rely on these
   oxbow wetlands, have declined in abundance, currently occupy 20\% of
   their historical geographic range, and are now an endangered species. A
   large emphasis has been placed on restoring oxbow wetlands to recover
   Topeka Shiner populations. As the number of oxbow restorations has
   increased, so has the number of monitoring projects focused on these
   habitats. Currently, conservation practitioners rely on the presence of
   Topeka Shiner to determine the success of an oxbow restoration. Given
   the rarity of the species, this method is likely ineffective. Within
   this study we attempt to create a model that can be used to determine
   the success of an oxbow restoration that will benefit the Topeka Shiner
   without relying on the presence of the species in the wetland. We used
   multiple fish community metrics and modelling strategies to determine
   the best model for predicting Topeka Shiner CPUE and presence/absence
   within oxbows. We determined that the top models were ineffective at
   predicting Topeka Shiner CPUE and presence/absence. Our findings
   illustrate the random nature by which fish communities become
   established within oxbows, and the island-like nature of oxbows in terms
   of how fish communities may become established and change over time.
   These findings indicate that the success of oxbow restoration for Topeka
   Shiner needs to be defined at a larger scale than for individual oxbows.
   Furthermore, our findings corroborate the inability of previous studies
   to determine reproducible associations of Topeka Shiner with various
   fish community metrics.},

Abstract = {Many Antarctic notothenioid fishes have major rearrangements in their
   mitochondrial (mt) genomes. Here, we report the complete mt genomes of 3
   trematomin notothenioids: the bald notothen (Trematomus (Pagothenia)
   borchgrevinki), the spotted notothen (T. nicolai), and the emerald
   notothen (T. bernacchii). The 3 mt genomes were sequenced using
   next-generation Illumina technology, and the assemblies verified by
   Sanger sequencing. When compared with the canonical mt gene order of the
   Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica), we found a large gene
   inversion in the 3 trematomin mt genomes that included tRNA(Ile), ND1,
   tRNA(Leu2), 16S, tRNA(Val), 12S, tRNA(Phe), and the control region. The
   trematomin mt genomes contained 3 intergenic spacers, which are thought
   to be the remnants of previous gene and control region duplications. All
   control regions included the characteristic conserved regulatory
   sequence motifs. Although short-read next-generation DNA sequencing
   technology has allowed the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of a
   large number of complete mt genomes, it is essential in all cases to
   verify the assembly in order to prevent the publication and use of
   erroneous data.},

Abstract = {The once abundant black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii, is a large,
   long-lived grazing marine mollusk that inhabits the rocky intertidal
   along the coast of California. The species has experienced dramatic
   declines since the mid-1980s largely due to the fatal bacterial disease
   called withering syndrome, leading to the collapse of an economically
   important fishery and to its inclusion into the IUCN listing as a
   critically endangered species. In some places impacted by the disease,
   populations of black abalone have declined by more than 90\%, prompting
   population crashes associated with very little recruitment of new
   individuals and changes to intertidal communities. Habitats that were
   dominated by crustose coralline algae and bare rock have become
   dominated instead by fleshy algae and sessile invertebrates. Here, we
   present the first high-quality black abalone reference genome, assembled
   with PacBio HiFi long-reads and assembled with Dovetail Omni-C data to
   generate a scaffold-level assembly. The black abalone reference genome
   will be an essential resource in understanding the evolutionary history
   of this species as well as for exploring its current levels of genetic
   diversity and establishing future management and restoration plans.},

Title = {Sequence Diversity and Differences at the Highly Duplicated MHC-I Gene
   Reflect Viral Susceptibility in Sympatric Pinniped Species},

Abstract = {Differences in disease susceptibility among species can result from
   rapid host-pathogen coevolution and differences in host species ecology
   that affect the strength and direction of natural selection. Among 2
   sympatric pinniped species that differ in sociality and putative disease
   exposure, we investigate observed differences in susceptibility through
   an analysis of a highly variable, duplicated gene family involved in the
   vertebrate immune response. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing,
   we characterize diversity at the 2 exons that encode the peptide binding
   region of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) gene in
   harbor (N = 60) and gray (N = 90) seal populations from the Northwest
   Atlantic. Across species, we identified 106 full-length exon 2 and 103
   exon 3 sequence variants and a minimum of 11 duplicated MHC-I loci. The
   sequence variants clustered in 15 supertypes defined by the
   physiochemical properties of the peptide binding region, including a
   putatively novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I diversity sublineage.
   Trans-species polymorphisms, dN/dS ratios, and evidence of gene
   conversion among supertypes are consistent with balancing selection
   acting on this gene. High functional redundancy suggests particularly
   strong selection among gray seals at the novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I
   diversity sublineage. At exon 2, harbor seals had a significantly
   greater number of variants per individual than gray seals, but fewer
   supertypes. Supertype richness and private supertypes are hypothesized
   to contribute to observed differences in disease resistance between
   species, as consistently, across the North Atlantic and many disease
   outbreaks, gray seals appear to be more resistant to respiratory viruses
   than harbor seals.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {It has been a century since the species-area relationship (SAR) was
   first proposed as a power law to explain how species richness scales
   with area. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of this
   predominant form. Apart from the power law, numerous empirical studies
   also report a semi-log form of the SAR, but very few have addressed its
   incidence. In this work, we test whether these relationships could
   emerge from the assembly of large random communities on island-like
   systems. The clustering of same-species individuals is central to our
   results, which we incorporate by modifying the self-interaction term in
   the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Our analysis demonstrates that
   the two most widely reported relationship forms can emerge due to
   differences in immigration rates and skewness towards weak interactions.
   We particularly highlight the incidence of the semi-log SAR for low
   immigration rates from a source pool, which is consistent with several
   previous empirical studies. The two SAR forms might show good fits to
   data over a large span of areas but a power-law overestimates species
   richness on smaller islands in remote archipelagoes.},

Title = {What's in a resource gradient? Comparing alternative cues for foraging

Abstract = {Consumers must track and acquire resources in complex landscapes. Much
   discussion has focused on the concept of a `resource gradient' and the
   mechanisms by which consumers can take advantage of such gradients as
   they navigate their landscapes in search of resources. However, the
   concept of tracking resource gradients means different things in
   different contexts. Here, we take a synthetic approach and consider six
   different definitions of what it means to search for resources based on
   density or gradients in density. These include scenarios where consumers
   change their movement behavior based on the density of conspecifics, on
   the density of resources, and on spatial or temporal gradients in
   resources. We also consider scenarios involving non-local perception and
   a form of memory. Using a continuous space, continuous time model that
   allows consumers to switch between resource-tracking and random motion,
   we investigate the relative performance of these six different
   strategies. Consumers' success in matching the spatiotemporal
   distributions of their resources differs starkly across the six
   scenarios. Movement strategies based on perception and response to
   temporal (rather than spatial) resource gradients afforded consumers
   with the best opportunities to match resource distributions. All
   scenarios would allow for optimization of resource-matching in terms of
   the underlying parameters, providing opportunities for evolutionary
   adaptation, and links back to classical studies of foraging ecology.},

Abstract = {The first partial derivatives of lambda with respect to demographic
   parameters quantify linear responses of population growth to vital rate
   perturbations, but sensitivity itself is situational and can show
   non-linear responses. We use the second derivative of lambda with
   respect to the demographic parameters to explore this type of responses
   in a population of a root hemiparasite (Castilleja tenuiflora). For
   plants growing with and without hosts, population transition matrices
   were built for the 2016-2018 period, and sensitivities and elasticities
   together with pure derivatives of the Hessian matrix were calculated,
   together with the second derivatives to survival and fecundity. We
   transformed the Hessian matrix to a logarithmic scale to avoid values
   with no biological meaning. Germination showed high sensitivity values,
   while permanence of individuals with dry aerial tissue that re-sprout
   had the highest elasticity. Negative values on the second derivative and
   on the logarithmic representation were obtained for germination with and
   without hosts in both years. Survival and fecundity have a similar
   behaviour in both conditions and periods, with negative values for
   survival for the first category and no negative values for fecundity.
   High negative values of the second derivative of the transition from
   seed to seedling indicate an evolutionary stable strategy and imply
   seeds are important to the permanence of C. tenuiflora population. A
   stochastic analysis of the second derivative of the transition from seed
   to seedling was performed with a Gamma distribution analysis, and showed
   negative values in all cases, corroborating this result.},

Title = {The scale of competition impacts parasite virulence evolution},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-163},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The structure of parasite populations can have important consequences
   for virulence evolution. Both the scale of competition, whether it is
   more intense in the within versus between host environment, and the mode
   of transmission, whether parasites transmit alone or in groups between
   hosts, influence population structure and can select for changes in
   virulence. In a selection experiment, we evolved metapopulations of the
   spider mite parasite Tetranychus urticae, under local (fixed sampling
   per host patch) or global (sampling determined by host patch
   productivity) competition, with either co- (with a female parasite from
   the same host patch) or random (with parasites from different host
   patches) transmission. After 33 generations of evolution, the fecundity
   and virulence of each replicate population was measured. Females from
   the `local-random' regime were more virulent with higher fecundity than
   females from the `global-random' regime. There was no difference in
   virulence or fecundity between females from the `global-random' or
   `global co-transmission' selection regimes. These results show that the
   scale of competition, and not the type of transmission, impacted
   virulence evolution for T. urticae. Local competition may maintain
   higher levels of genetic diversity at the level of the metapopulation.
   As such, intense local, within-host, competition selected for more
   productive individuals better able to exploit their environment and be
   the one to transmit to a new host.},

Abstract = {The Laotian shad (Tenualosa thibaudeaui) belongs to the family Clupeidae
   and is mainly distributed across Lao PRD, Cambodia, and northern
   Thailand. Due to overfishing and dam reconstruction, the Laotian shad is
   on the verge of extinction and currently listed as vulnerable by the
   IUCN. Nanopore and Illumina sequencing data were integrated to generate
   the first high-quality genome assembly for T. thibaudeaui. The assembled
   genome was 638 Mb in size, including 228 scaffolds with a N50 value of
   16.6 Mb. BUSCO analysis revealed the completeness of the assembly to be
   more than 96\%. A total of 24,810 protein-coding genes were predicted.
   According to the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis,
   the effective population size of the Laotian shad sharply declined from
   3 Mya to 20 Kya. We found a significant ratio in contraction of gene
   families that may reflect secondary gene loss. Our high-quality genome
   assembly of the Laotian shad will provide a valuable resource for future
   research in conservation genetics, as well as for investigating the
   phylogenetics and comparative genomics of shads.},

Title = {Do common dispersal influences inform a large lizard's landscape-scale
   gene flow?},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {987-1006},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The dispersal tendencies of individuals can provide an important
   adaptive basis to counter environmental and ecological variation to
   increase fitness and benefit populations. We evaluated whether indirect
   genetic-based measures of dispersal of a large monitor lizard (Varanus
   varius) were sex-biased and further covaried with putative demographic
   and ecological differences across a forest ecotone in Southern
   Australia. The mean corrected assignment index (i.e., mAI(C)) estimated
   that lace monitors had significant male-biased dispersal. There was
   strong evidence that common dispersal promoting influences, including
   lace monitor density and arboreal mammal prey availability, but not the
   overall male-biased sex ratio, differed with forest type across the
   ecotone. These different forest types influenced the extent of
   sex-biased dispersal, with lace monitors captured in banksia woodland
   having a significant male bias in dispersal, whilst lace monitors
   sampled in adjacent eucalypt forest showed no difference in assignment
   values indicating no sex-biased dispersal. However, individual-based
   spatial autocorrelation analyses and mixed effect models indicated no
   spatial mediated genetic structuring nor evidence of sex or
   habitat-related effects. Estimates of recent migration (i.e., < 3
   generations) indicated strong and symmetrical migration between banksia
   woodland and eucalypt forest patches suggesting limited habitat
   resistance to gene flow across an ecotonal landscape. Not discounting
   method-specific evidence for male- and forest-type-biased dispersal, the
   absence of spatial genetic structuring suggests lace monitors retain a
   high dispersal capacity. An absence of landscape-scale genetic structure
   is consistent with this species's high vagility. This landscape-scale
   result is further supported because only the most significant
   biogeographic barriers (e.g., mountain ranges) impede gene flow within
   the species' extensive range distribution, allowing for genetic
   structuring among populations.},

Abstract = {The northwestern pond turtle, Actinemys marmorata, and its recently
   recognized sister species, the southwestern pond turtle, A. pallida, are
   the sole aquatic testudines occurring over most of western North America
   and the only living representatives of the genus Actinemys. Although it
   historically ranged from Washington state through central California,
   USA, populations of the northwestern pond turtle have been in decline
   for decades and the species is afforded state-level protection across
   its range; it is currently being considered for protection under the US
   Endangered Species Act. Here, we report a new, chromosome-level assembly
   of A. marmorata as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project
   (CCGP). Consistent with the reference genome strategy of the CCGP, we
   used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin-proximity
   sequencing technology to produce a de novo assembled genome. The
   assembly comprises 198 scaffolds spanning 2,319,339,408 base pairs, has
   a contig N50 of 75 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 146Mb, and BUSCO complete score
   of 96.7\%, making it the most complete testudine assembly of the 24
   species from 13 families that are currently available. In combination
   with the A. pallida reference genome that is currently under
   construction through the CCGP, the A. marmorata genome will be a
   powerful tool for documenting landscape genomic diversity, the basis of
   adaptations to salt tolerance and thermal capacity, and hybridization
   dynamics between these recently diverged species.},

Abstract = {Pouched lamprey (Geotria australis) or kanakana/piharau is a culturally
   and ecologically significant jawless fish that is distributed throughout
   Aotearoa New Zealand. Despite its importance, much remains unknown about
   historical relationships and gene flow between populations of this
   enigmatic species within New Zealand. To help inform management, we
   assembled a draft G. australis genome and completed the first
   comprehensive population genomics analysis of pouched lamprey within New
   Zealand using targeted gene sequencing (Cyt-b and COI) and restriction
   site-associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq) methods. Employing 16 000
   genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from RADSeq
   (n = 186) and sequence data from Cyt-b (766 bp, n = 94) and COI (589 bp,
   n = 20), we reveal low levels of structure across 10 sampling locations
   spanning the species range within New Zealand. F-statistics, outlier
   analyses, and STRUCTURE suggest a single panmictic population, and
   Mantel and EEMS tests reveal no significant isolation by distance. This
   implies either ongoing gene flow among populations or recent shared
   ancestry among New Zealand pouched lamprey. We can now use the
   information gained from these genetic tools to assist managers with
   monitoring effective population size, managing potential diseases, and
   conservation measures such as artificial propagation programs. We
   further demonstrate the general utility of these genetic tools for
   acquiring information about elusive species.},

Abstract = {Intraspecific variation may be key to coexistence in diverse
   communities, with some even suggesting it is necessary for large numbers
   of competitors to coexist. However, theory provides little support for
   this argument, instead finding that intraspecific variation generally
   makes it more difficult for species to coexist. Here we present a model
   of competition where two species compete for two essential resources and
   individuals within populations vary in their ability to take up
   different resources. We found a range of cases where intraspecific
   variation expands the range of conditions under which coexistence can
   occur, which provides a mechanism that allows the ecologically neutral
   evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to become ecologically stable. We
   demonstrate that this result relies on nonlinearity in the function that
   describes how traits map onto ecological function. A sigmoid mapping
   function is necessary in order to model essential resources because it
   allows for variation in an unbounded trait while maintaining
   biologically realistic boundaries on uptake rates, and differs from
   other kinds of nonlinearity, which only unidirectionally increase or
   decrease ecological function. The sigmoid function's nonlinearity
   spreads individuals unevenly along the growth function, which allows
   positive growth contributions from some individuals to compensate for
   growth loses from others, akin to source-sink dynamics, leading to
   coexistence. In this way, intraspecific trait variation is able to
   amplify niche differences, thereby strengthening coexistence. We discuss
   empirical systems beyond competition for essential resources in which
   piecewise functions (i.e., thresholds) are important.},

Title = {Revisiting and interpreting the role of female dominance in male mate
   choice: the importance of replication in ecology and evolution},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {933-947},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In many species females prefer to mate with socially dominant males,
   often because it elevates their fecundity by providing greater access to
   material resources or lowers offspring mortality due to superior male
   defence. Far fewer studies have tested whether males prefer socially
   dominant females. Intriguingly, an earlier study showed that when the
   sexes freely interact, male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki)
   preferentially attempt to mate with dominant females. Here we replicate
   this study using a slightly modified experimental design to test the
   generality of its finding. In addition, we conducted standard,
   two-choice male mate choice trials to test directly whether males prefer
   dominant over subordinate females. Corroborating the previous study, we
   found that when a male and two females freely interact, males more often
   attempt to mate with the dominant female. However, males did not prefer
   to associate with (i.e., choose) dominant females in two-choice trials
   where females could not interact. We discuss whether greater access to
   males is a benefit of female social dominance, or an epiphenomenon of
   other benefits of dominance.},

Title = {Extremely Low mtDNA Diversity and High Genetic Differentiation Reveal

Abstract = {New Caledonia is home to one of the largest remaining populations of
   dugongs (Dugong dugon) and is located at the southeastern limit of the
   species range. Local knowledge suggests that current levels of removal
   due to anthropogenic pressures are unsustainable, whereas trends suggest
   an ongoing decline in the population. Considering this unfavorable
   conservation context, this study aimed to assess the New Caledonian
   dugong population's resilience by determining its level of genetic
   diversity and degree of isolation relative to other populations.
   Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences (n = 55) collected
   from live and dead dugongs in New Caledonia were compared with a global
   data set of previously published sequences (n = 631) representing dugong
   populations throughout the species range. The New Caledonian dugong
   population displayed the lowest level of mtDNA diversity documented
   worldwide (3 haplotypes with 1-bp difference), suggesting a recent
   origin of the current population through limited colonization events.
   Population structure analyses indicate a strong genetic differentiation
   with all the putative populations represented in the global data set,
   including large neighboring Australian populations. These results show
   that the dugong population in New Caledonia is particularly isolated,
   fragile, and vulnerable to anthropogenic threats and diseases with low
   potential for resilience through incoming gene flow. Our findings call
   for an instant conservation response and consideration for IUCN
   population assessment to support the long-term survival of the New
   Caledonian dugong population.},

Abstract = {Sandblossoms, Linanthus parryae is a widespread annual plant species
   found in washes and sandy open habitats across the Mojave Desert and
   Eastern Sierra Nevada of California. Studies in this species have played
   a central role in evolutionary biology, serving as the first test cases
   of the shifting balance theory of evolution, models of isolation by
   distance, and metrics to describe the genetic structure of natural
   populations. Despite the importance of L. parryae in the development of
   landscape genetics and phylogeography, there are no genomic resources
   available for the species. Through the California Conservation Genomics
   Project, we assembled the first genome in the genus Linanthus. Using
   PacBio HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin conformation capture, we
   assembled 123 scaffolds spanning 1.51 Gb of the 1.96 Gb estimated
   genome, with a contig N50 of 18.7 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 124.8 Mb.
   This assembly, with a BUSCO completeness score of 88.7\%, will allow us
   to revisit foundational ideas central to our understanding of how
   evolutionary forces operate in a geographic landscape. In addition, it
   will be a new resource to uncover adaptations to arid environments in
   the fragile desert habitat threatened by urban and solar farm
   development, climate change, and off-road vehicles.},

Abstract = {The sunburst anemone Anthopleura sola is an abundant species inhabiting
   the intertidal zone of coastal California. Historically, this species
   has extended from Baja California, Mexico to as far north as Monterey
   Bay, CA. However, recently the geographic range of this species has
   expanded to Bodega Bay, CA, possibly as far north as Salt Point, CA.
   This species also forms symbiotic partnerships with the dinoflagellate
   Breviolum muscatinei, a member of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These
   partnerships are analogous to those formed between tropical corals and
   dinoflagellate symbionts, making A. sola an excellent model system to
   explore how hosts will (co)evolve with novel symbiont populations they
   encounter as they expand northward. This assembly will serve as the
   foundation for identifying the population genomic patterns associated
   with range expansions, and will facilitate future work investigating how
   hosts and their symbiont partners will evolve to interact with one
   another as geographic ranges shift due to climate change.},

Abstract = {In studies of molecular ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary
   biology, the current or recent effective size (N-e) of a population is
   frequently estimated from the marker genotype data of two or more
   temporally spaced samples of individuals taken from the population.
   Despite the developments of numerous Bayesian, likelihood, and moment
   estimators, only a couple of them can use both temporally and spatially
   spaced samples of individuals to estimate jointly the effective size
   (N-e) of and the migration rate (m) into a population. In this note, I
   describe new implementations of these joint estimators of N-e and m in
   software MLNe which runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
   with or without a graphical user interface (GUI), and has an integrated
   simulation module to simulate genotype data for investigating the
   impacts of various factors (such as sample size and sampling interval)
   on estimation precision and accuracy, exploits both message passing
   interface (MPI) and openMP for parallel computations using multiple
   cores and nodes to speed up analysis.The program does not require data
   pre-processing and accepts multiple formats of a file of original
   genotype data and a file of parameters as input. The GUI facilitates
   data and parameter inputs and produces publication-quality output
   graphs, while the non-GUI version of software is convenient for batch
   analysis of multiple datasets as in simulations. MLNe will help advance
   the analysis of temporal genetic marker data for estimating N-e of and m
   between populations, which are important parameters that will help
   biologists for the conservation management of natural and managed
   populations. MLNe can be downloaded free from the website

Abstract = {Few doubt that effective population size (N-e) is one of the most
   important parameters in evolutionary biology, but how many can say they
   really understand the concept? N-e is the evolutionary analog of the
   number of individuals (or adults) in the population, N. Whereas
   ecological consequences of population size depend on N, evolutionary
   consequences (rates of loss of genetic diversity and increase in
   inbreeding; relative effectiveness of selection) depend on N-e. Formal
   definitions typically relate effective size to a key population genetic
   parameter, such as loss of heterozygosity or variance in allele
   frequency. However, for practical application to real populations, it is
   more useful to define N-e in terms of 3 demographic parameters: number
   of potential parents (adult N), and mean and variance in offspring
   number. Defined this way, N-e determines the rate of random genetic
   drift across the entire genome in the offspring generation. Other
   evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection)-together with
   factors such as variation in recombination rate-can also affect genetic
   variation, and this leads to heterogeneity across the genome in observed
   rates of genetic change. For some, it has been convenient to interpret
   this heterogeneity in terms of heterogeneity in N-e, but unfortunately,
   this has muddled the concepts of genetic drift and effective population
   size. A commonly repeated misconception is that N-e is the number of
   parents that actually contribute genes to the next generation (N-P). In
   reality, N-P can be smaller or larger than N-e, and the N-P/N-e ratio
   depends on the sex ratio, the mean and variance in offspring number, and
   whether inbreeding or variance N-e is of interest.},

Abstract = {Using a mechanistic spatially explicit trait-based neighborhood-model,
   we quantify the impact of mutations on intraspecific spatial
   interactions to better understand mechanisms underlying the maintenance
   of genetic variation and the potential effects of these evolved
   interactions on the population dynamics of Arabidopsis thaliana. We use
   100 twenty-fifth generation mutation accumulation (MA) lines (genotypes)
   derived from one founder genotype to study mutational effects on
   neighbor responses in a field experiment. We created individual-based
   maps (15,000 individuals), including phenotypic variation, to quantify
   mutational effects within genotypes versus between genotypes on
   reproduction and survival. At small-scale (within 80 cm of the focal
   plant), survival is enhanced but seed-set is decreased when a genotype
   is surrounded by different genotypes. At large-scale (within 200 cm of
   the focal plant), seed set is facilitated by different genotypes while
   the same genotype has either no effect or negative effects. The
   direction of the interactions among MA lines suggests that at small
   scale these interactions may contribute to the maintenance of genetic
   variation and at large scale contribute to the survival of the
   population. This may suggest, that, mutations potentially have immediate
   effects on population and community dynamics by influencing the outcome
   of competitive and faciliatory interactions among conspecifics.},

Abstract = {Surfperches (Family Embiotocidae) are viviparous temperate reef fishes
   that brood their young. This life history trait translates into limited
   dispersal, strong population structure, and an unusually strong
   potential for local adaptation in a marine fish. As part of the
   California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), we sequenced the genome
   of the Black Surfperch, Embiotoca jacksoni, to establish a genomic model
   for understanding phylogeographic patterns of marine organisms in
   California. These patterns, in turn, may inform the design of marine
   protected areas using dispersal models based on genomic data. The genome
   of E. jacksoni is typical of marine fishes at less than 1Gb (genome size
   = 635 Mb), and our assembly is near-chromosome level (contig N50 =
   6.5Mb, scaffold N50 = 15.5 Mb, BUSCO = 98.1\%). Within the context of
   the CCGP, the genome will be used as a reference for future whole genome
   resequencing projects aimed at enhancing our knowledge of the population
   structure of the species, and efficacy of Marine Protected Areas across
   the state.},

Abstract = {The okapi (Okapia johnstoni), or forest giraffe, is the only species in
   its genus and the only extant sister group of the giraffe within the
   family Giraffidae. The species is one of the remaining large vertebrates
   surrounded by mystery because of its elusive behavior as well as the
   armed conflicts in the region where it occurs, making it difficult to
   study. Deforestation puts the okapi under constant anthropogenic
   pressure, and it is currently listed as ``Endangered{''} on the IUCN Red
   List. Here, we present the first annotated de novo okapi genome assembly
   based on PacBio continuous long reads, polished with short reads, and
   anchored into chromosome-scale scaffolds using Hi-C proximity ligation
   sequencing. The final assembly (TBG\_Okapi\_asm\_v1) has a length of
   2.39 Gbp, of which 98\% are represented by 28 scaffolds > 3.9 Mbp. The
   contig N50 of 61 Mbp and scaffold N50 of 102 Mbp, together with a BUSCO
   score of 94.7\%, and 23 412 annotated genes, underline the high quality
   of the assembly. This chromosome-scale genome assembly is a valuable
   resource for future conservation of the species and comparative genomic
   studies among the giraffids and other ruminants.},

Abstract = {Premelanosome protein (pmel) is a key gene for melanogenesis. Mutations
   in this gene are responsible for white plumage in chicken, but its role
   in pigmentation of fish remains to be demonstrated. In this study, we
   found that most fishes have 2 pmel genes arising from the
   teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. Both pmela and pmelb were
   expressed at high levels in the eyes and skin of Nile tilapia. We
   mutated both genes in tilapia using CRISPR/Cas9. Homozygous mutation of
   pmela resulted in yellowish body color with weak vertical bars and a
   hypopigmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to significantly
   reduced number and size of melanophores. In contrast, we observed an
   increased number and size of xanthophores in mutants compared to
   wild-type fish. Homozygous mutation of pmelb resulted in a similar, but
   milder phenotype than pmela(-/-) mutants. Double mutation of pmela and
   pmelb resulted in loss of additional melanophores compared to the
   pmela(-/-) mutants, and also an increase in the number and size of
   xanthophores, producing a golden body color. The RPE pigmentation of
   pmela(-/-);pmelb(-/-) was similar to pmela(-/-) mutants, with much less
   pigmentation than pmelb(-/-) mutants and wild-type fish. Taken together,
   our results indicate that, although both pmel genes are important for
   the formation of body color in tilapia, pmela plays a more important
   role than pmelb. To our knowledge, this is the first report on mutation
   of pmelb or both pmela;pmelb in fish. Studies on these mutants suggest
   new strategies for breeding golden tilapia, and also provide a new model
   for studies of pmel function in vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Keystone species are known to play a critical role in kelp forest
   health, including the well-known killer whales, sea otter, sea urchin,
   kelp trophic cascade in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA. In
   California, a major player in the regulation of sea urchin abundance,
   and in turn, the health of kelp forests ecosystems, is a large wrasse,
   the California Sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher. We present a reference
   genome for this ecologically important species that will serve as a key
   resource for future conservation research of California's inshore marine
   environment utilizing genomic tools to address changes in life-history
   traits, dispersal, range shifts, and ecological interactions among
   members of the kelp forest ecological assemblages. Our genome assembly
   of S. pulcher has a total length of 0.794 Gb, which is similar to many
   other marine fishes. The assembly is largely contiguous (N50 = 31.9 Mb)
   and nearly complete (BUSCO single-copy core gene content = 98.1\%).
   Within the context of the California Conservation Genomics Project

Abstract = {The European polecat (Mustela putorius) is a mammalian predator which
   occurs across much of Europe east to the Ural Mountains. In Great
   Britain, following years of persecution the range of the European
   polecat contracted and by the early 1900s was restricted to unmanaged
   forests of central Wales. The European polecat has recently undergone a
   population increase due to legal protection and its range now overlaps
   that of feral domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). During this
   range expansion, European polecats hybridized with feral domestic
   ferrets producing viable offspring. Here, we carry out population-level
   whole-genome sequencing on 8 domestic ferrets, 19 British European
   polecats, and 15 European polecats from the European mainland. We used a
   range of population genomics methods to examine the data, including
   phylogenetics, phylogenetic graphs, model-based clustering, phylogenetic
   invariants, ABBA-BABA tests, topology weighting, and Fst. We found high
   degrees of genome introgression in British polecats outside their
   previous stronghold, even in those individuals phenotyped as ``pure{''}
   polecats. These polecats ranged from presumed F1 hybrids (gamma = 0.53)
   to individuals that were much less introgressed (gamma = 0.2). We
   quantify this introgression and find introgressed genes containing Fst
   outliers associated with cognitive function and sight.},

Abstract = {Genetic admixture is a biological event inherent to genetic rescue
   programs aimed at the long-term conservation of endangered wildlife.
   Although the success of such programs can be measured by the increase in
   genetic diversity and fitness of subsequent admixed individuals,
   predictions supporting admixture costs to fitness due to the
   introduction of novel deleterious alleles are necessary. Here, we
   analyzed nonsynonymous variation from conserved genes to quantify and
   compare levels of mutation load (i.e. proportion of deleterious alleles
   and genotypes carrying these alleles) among endangered Florida panthers
   and non-endangered Texas pumas. Specifically, we used canonical (i.e.
   non-admixed) Florida panthers, Texas pumas, and F-1 (canonical Florida x
   Texas) panthers dating from a genetic rescue program and Everglades
   National Park panthers with Central American ancestry resulting from an
   earlier admixture event. We found neither genetic drift nor selection
   significantly reduced overall proportions of deleterious alleles in the
   severely bottlenecked canonical Florida panthers. Nevertheless, the
   deleterious alleles identified were distributed into a
   disproportionately high number of homozygous genotypes due to close
   inbreeding in this group. Conversely, admixed Florida panthers (either
   with Texas or Central American ancestry) presented reduced levels of
   homozygous genotypes carrying deleterious alleles but increased levels
   of heterozygous genotypes carrying these variants relative to canonical
   Florida panthers. Although admixture is likely to alleviate the load of
   standing deleterious variation present in homozygous genotypes, our
   results suggest that introduced novel deleterious alleles (temporarily
   present in heterozygous state) in genetically rescued populations could
   potentially be expressed in subsequent generations if their effective
   sizes remain small.},

Title = {Demographic inference provides insights into the extirpation and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEREDITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Number = {5},
Pages = {552-562},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Although eusocial animals often achieve ecological dominance in the
   ecosystems where they occur, many populations are unstable, resulting in
   local extinction. Both patterns may be linked to the characteristic
   demography of eusocial species-high reproductive skew and reproductive
   division of labor support stable effective population sizes that make
   eusocial groups more competitive in some species, but also lower
   effective population sizes that increase susceptibility to population
   collapse in others. Here, we examine the relationship between demography
   and social organization in Synalpheus snapping shrimps, a group in which
   eusociality has evolved recently and repeatedly. We show using
   coalescent demographic modeling that eusocial species have had lower but
   more stable effective population sizes across 100,000 generations. Our
   results are consistent with the idea that stable population sizes may
   enable competitive dominance in eusocial shrimps, but they also suggest
   that recent population declines are likely caused by eusocial shrimps'
   heightened sensitivity to environmental changes, perhaps as a result of
   their low effective population sizes and localized dispersal. Thus,
   although the unique life histories and demography of eusocial shrimps
   have likely contributed to their persistence and ecological dominance
   over evolutionary time scales, these social traits may also make them
   vulnerable to contemporary environmental change.},

Abstract = {Sex determination is a critical element of successful vertebrate
   development, suggesting that sex chromosome systems might be
   evolutionarily stable across lineages. For example, mammals and birds
   have maintained conserved sex chromosome systems over long evolutionary
   time periods. Other vertebrates, in contrast, have undergone frequent
   sex chromosome transitions, which is even more amazing considering we
   still know comparatively little across large swaths of their respective
   phylogenies. One reptile group in particular, the gecko lizards
   (infraorder Gekkota), shows an exceptional lability with regard to sex
   chromosome transitions and may possess the majority of transitions
   within squamates (lizards and snakes). However, detailed genomic and
   cytogenetic information about sex chromosomes is lacking for most gecko
   species, leaving large gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary
   processes at play. To address this, we assembled a chromosome-level
   genome for a gecko (Sphaerodactylidae: Sphaerodactylus) and used this
   assembly to search for sex chromosomes among six closely related species
   using a variety of genomic data, including whole-genome re-sequencing,
   RADseq, and RNAseq. Previous work has identified XY systems in two
   species of Sphaerodactylus geckos. We expand upon that work to identify
   between two and four sex chromosome cis-transitions (XY to a new XY)
   within the genus. Interestingly, we confirmed two different linkage
   groups as XY sex chromosome systems that were previously unknown to act
   as sex chromosomes in tetrapods (syntenic with Gallus chromosome 3 and
   Gallus chromosomes 18/30/33), further highlighting a unique and
   fascinating trend that most linkage groups have the potential to act as
   sex chromosomes in squamates.},

Abstract = {Drastic reductions in population size, or population bottlenecks, can
   lead to a reduction in additive genetic variance and adaptive potential.
   Genetic variance for some quantitative genetic traits, however, can
   increase after a population reduction. Empirical evaluations of
   quantitative traits following experimental bottlenecks indicate that
   non-additive genetic effects, including both allelic dominance at a
   given locus and epistatic interactions among loci, may impact the
   additive variance contributed by alleles that ultimately influences
   phenotypic expression and fitness. The dramatic effects of bottlenecks
   on overall genetic diversity have been well studied, but relatively
   little is known about how dominance and demographic events like
   bottlenecks can impact additive genetic variance. Herein, we critically
   examine how the degree of dominance among alleles affects additive
   genetic variance after a bottleneck. We first review and synthesize
   studies that document the impact of empirical bottlenecks on dominance
   variance. We then extend earlier work by elaborating on 2 theoretical
   models that illustrate the relationship between dominance and the
   potential increase in additive genetic variance immediately following a
   bottleneck. Furthermore, we investigate the parameters that influence
   the maximum level of genetic variation (associated with adaptive
   potential) after a bottleneck, including the number of founding
   individuals. Finally, we validated our methods using forward-time
   population genetic simulations of loci with varying dominance and
   selection levels. The fate of non-additive genetic variation following
   bottlenecks could have important implications for conservation and
   management efforts in a wide variety of taxa, and our work should help
   contextualize future studies (e.g., epistatic variance) in population
   genomics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report on the scaffold-level assembled genome for the
   federally endangered, California endemic crustacean Lepidurus packardi
   (the Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp). L. packardi is a key food source for
   other conserved California species including the California Tiger
   Salamander Ambystoma californiense. It faces significant habitat loss
   and fragmentation as vernal pools are threatened by urbanization,
   agricultural conversion, and climate change. This resource represents
   the first scaffold-level genome of any Lepidurus species. The assembled
   genome spans 108.6 Mbps, with 6 chromosome-length scaffolds comprising
   71\% of total genomic length and 444 total contigs. The BUSCO score for
   this genome is 97.3\%, suggesting a high level of completeness. We
   produced a predicted gene set for this species trained on the Daphnia
   magna set of genes and predicted 17,650 genes. These tools can aid
   researchers in understanding the evolution and adaptive potential of
   alternative reproductive modes within this species.},

Abstract = {The tricolored blackbird, Agelaius tricolor, is a gregarious species
   that forms enormous breeding and foraging colonies in wetland and
   agricultural habitats, primarily in California, USA. Once extremely
   abundant, species numbers have declined dramatically in the past
   century, largely due to losses of breeding and foraging habitats.
   Tricolored blackbirds are currently listed as Endangered by the IUCN,
   and Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. Increased
   genetic information is needed to detail the evolutionary consequences of
   a species-wide bottleneck and inform conservation management. Here, we
   present a contiguous tricolored blackbird reference genome, assembled
   with PacBio HiFi long reads and Dovetail Omni-C data to generate a
   scaffold-level assembly containing multiple chromosome-length scaffolds.
   This genome adds a valuable resource for important evolutionary and
   conservation research on tricolored blackbirds and related species.},

Abstract = {Combining genetic and ecological measures of differentiation can provide
   compelling evidence for ecological and genetic divergence among
   lineages. The rough-footed mud turtle, Kinosternon hirtipes, is
   distributed from the Trans-Pecos region of Texas to the highlands of
   Central Mexico and contains 6 described subspecies, 5 of which are
   extant. We use ddRAD sequencing and species distribution models to
   assess levels of ecological and genetic differentiation among these
   subspecies. We also predict changes in climatically suitable habitat
   under different climate change scenarios and assess levels of genetic
   diversity and inbreeding within each lineage. Our results show that
   there is strong genetic and ecological differentiation among multiple
   lineages within K. hirtipes, and that this differentiation appears to be
   the result of vicariance associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic
   Belt. We propose changes to subspecies designations to more accurately
   reflect the evolutionary relationships among populations and assess
   threats to each subspecies.},

Title = {Little Sharks in a Big World: Mitochondrial DNA Reveals Small-scale
   Population Structure in the California Horn Shark (Heterodontus
   francisci)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEREDITY},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {The California horn shark (Heterodontus francisci) is a small demersal
   species distributed from southern California and the Channel Islands to
   Baja California and the Gulf of California. These nocturnal reef
   predators maintain small home-ranges as adults and lay auger-shaped egg
   cases that become wedged into the substrate. While population trends are
   not well documented, this species is subject to fishing pressure through
   portions of its range and has been identified as vulnerable to
   overexploitation. Here, we present a survey of 318 specimens from across
   the range, using mtDNA control region sequences to provide the first
   genetic assessment of H. francisci. Overall population structure
   (phi(ST) = 0.266, P < 0.001) is consistent with limited dispersal as
   indicated by life history, with two distinct features. Population
   structure along the continuous coastline is low, with no discernable
   breaks from Santa Barbara, CA to Bahia Tortugas (Baja California Sur,
   Mexico); however, there is a notable partition at Punta Eugenia (BCS), a
   well-known biogeographic break between tropical and subtropical marine
   faunas. In contrast, population structure is much higher (max phi(ST) =
   0.601, P < 0.05) between the coast and adjacent Channel Islands, a
   minimum distance of 19 km, indicating that horn sharks rarely disperse
   across deep habitat and open water. Population structure in most
   elasmobranchs is measured on a scale of hundreds to thousands of
   kilometers, but the California Horn Shark has population partitions on
   an unprecedented small scale, indicating a need for localized management
   strategies which ensure adequate protection of distinct stocks.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Territoriality and parental care are complex reproductive behaviors
   found in many taxa from insects to mammals. Parental care can be carried
   out by the female, the male, or both, depending on the species.
   Territoriality, in contrast, is predominantly displayed by males.
   Different selective pressures imposed on individuals from the sex
   performing territorial or parental care behaviors may also lead to
   sexual differentiation in other life-history traits. Due to their
   territorial behavior and their diversity of parental care behaviors,
   Neotropical poison frogs are an excellent study system to investigate
   whether behavioral traits can influence sexual differentiation in
   intrinsic or extrinsic traits of individuals. Here, we evaluate whether
   territorial and parental care behaviors mediate sexual differentiation
   in ecological (habitat use) and phenotypic (coloration, morphology)
   traits in the critically endangered Lehmann's poison frog (Oophaga
   lehmanni), a species in which males defend territories while females
   provide parental care. We found sex differences in habitat use and
   morphological traits, but not in coloration. Males use trunks and green
   leaves as perches more frequently and are found on higher substrates,
   than females. We found no sex differences in body size, but females have
   longer arms than males, which is probably associated with their parental
   duties (climbing trees to feed the tadpoles). Altogether, our results
   provide evidence that selection pressures act differently on male and
   female traits, and that territoriality and parental care may promote the
   evolution of sexual differentiation in dendrobatids. Long-term wildlife
   observations are essential to identify important life-history traits and
   to evaluate hypotheses about the behavioral ecology and conservation of
   this and other vertebrate species.},

Abstract = {Cervids are distinguished by the shedding and regrowth of antlers.
   Furthermore, they provide insights into prion and other diseases.
   Genomic resources can facilitate studies of the genetic underpinnings of
   deer phenotypes, behavior, and disease resistance. Widely distributed in
   North America, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has
   recreational, commercial, and food source value for many households. We
   present a genome generated using DNA from a single Illinois white-tailed
   sequenced on the PacBio Sequel II platform and assembled using Wtdbg2.
   Omni-C chromatin conformation capture sequencing was used to scaffold
   the genome contigs. The final assembly was 2.42 Gb, consisting of 508
   scaffolds with a contig N50 of 21.7 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 52.4 Mb, and a
   BUSCO complete score of 93.1\%. Thirty-six chromosome pseudomolecules
   comprised 93\% of the entire sequenced genome length. A total of 20 651
   predicted genes using the BRAKER pipeline were validated using
   InterProScan. Chromosome length assembly sequences were aligned to the
   genomes of related species to reveal corresponding chromosomes.},

Abstract = {Synthesized chemical defenses have broadly evolved across countless taxa
   and are important in shaping evolutionary and ecological interactions
   within ecosystems. However, the underlying genomic mechanisms by which
   these organisms synthesize and utilize their toxins are relatively
   unknown. Herein, we use comparative transcriptomics to uncover potential
   toxin synthesizing genes and pathways, as well as interspecific patterns
   of toxin synthesizing genes across 10 species of North American true
   toads (Bufonidae). Upon assembly and annotation of the 10
   transcriptomes, we explored patterns of relative gene expression and
   possible protein-protein interactions across the species to determine
   what genes and/or pathways may be responsible for toxin synthesis. We
   also tested our transcriptome dataset for signatures of positive
   selection to reveal how selection may be acting upon potential toxin
   producing genes. We assembled high-quality transcriptomes of the bufonid
   parotoid gland, a tissue not often investigated in other bufonid-related
   RNAseq studies. We found several genes involved in metabolic and
   biosynthetic pathways (e.g., steroid biosynthesis, terpenoid backbone
   biosynthesis, isoquinoline biosynthesis, and glucosinolate biosynthesis)
   that were functionally enriched and/or relatively expressed across the
   10 focal species that may be involved in the synthesis of alkaloid and
   steroid toxins, as well as other small metabolic compounds that cause
   distastefulness in bufonids. We hope that our study lays a foundation
   for future studies to explore the genomic underpinnings and specific
   pathways of toxin synthesis in toads, as well as at the
   macroevolutionary scale across numerous taxa that produce their own
   defensive toxins.},

Title = {Estimating the volume of biological structures from a single 2D image:
   considering apparent cross-sectional area as an alternative to the
   ellipsoid method},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {1061-1076},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The volume of a biological structure may be estimated from photographs
   using its apparent cross-sectional area (ACA), or by measuring its
   dimensions from orthogonal viewpoints and treating it as an ellipsoid.
   With ACA half as many photographs are required to achieve results
   comparable to the ellipsoid method (EM); potentially simplifying data
   collection by reducing specimen handling time. ACA also facilitates the
   collection of additional morphological data for analyzing the shape of
   specimens using geometric morphometrics. To characterize ACA's
   performance relative to EM, we carried out in-silico validations of ACA
   versus EM using virtual objects of known volume; first using a
   diversified set of 21 common objects, and subsequently, a set of 9
   echinoderms scanned from wild-type specimens. The volume of each object
   was estimated twice, using pairs of images with orthogonal viewpoints.
   The relative and absolute performance (percent error) of both methods
   were evaluated. ACA performed comparably to EM across a broad range of
   object shapes and sizes. Both methods were sensitive to objects with low
   solidity and performed equally well for approximate spheres with high
   solidity. ACA tended to work as well or better than EM for objects with
   low circularity. Notably, in most cases, averaged ACA values also
   produced satisfactory or superior results relative to EM. Our results
   suggest that ACA represents a viable alternative to EM for estimating
   the volume of biological structures, especially those which deviate
   substantially from an ellipsoid form. Awareness of ACA's applications
   and limitations, coupled with its ease of implementation, may encourage
   the inclusion of morphological metrics in experimental designs.},

Abstract = {Understanding the short- and long-term consequences of climate change is
   a major challenge in biology. For aquatic organisms, temperature changes
   and drought can lead to thermal stress and habitat loss, both of which
   can ultimately lead to higher mutation rates. Here, we examine the
   effect of high temperature and mutation accumulation on gene expression
   at two loci from the heat shock protein (HSP) gene family, HSP60 and
   HSP90. HSPs have been posited to serve as `mutational capacitors' given
   their role as molecular chaperones involved in protein folding and
   degradation, thus buffering against a wide range of cellular stress and
   destabilization. We assayed changes in HSP expression across 5 genotypes
   of Daphnia magna, a sentinel species in ecology and environmental
   biology, with and without acute exposure to thermal stress and
   accumulated mutations. Across genotypes, HSP expression increased
   similar to 6x in response to heat and similar to 4x with mutation
   accumulation, individually. Both factors simultaneously (lineages with
   high mutation loads exposed to high heat) increased gene expression
   similar to 23x-much more than that predicted by an additive model. Our
   results corroborate suggestions that HSPs can buffer against not only
   the effects of heat, but also mutations-a combination of factors both
   likely to increase in a warming world.},

Abstract = {We present the reference genome of the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp
   Branchinecta lynchi. This branchiopod crustacean is endemic to
   California's freshwater ephemeral ponds. It faces enormous habitat loss
   and fragmentation as urbanization and agriculture have fundamentally

   assembled genome consists of 22 chromosome-length scaffolds that account
   for 96.85\% of the total sequence. One hundred and ninety-five
   unscaffolded contigs comprise the rest of the genome's 575.6 Mb length.
   The genome is substantially complete with a BUSCO score of 90.0\%. There
   is no immediately identifiable sex chromosome, typical for this class of
   organism. This new resource will permit researchers to better understand
   the adaptive capacity of this imperiled species, as well as answer
   lingering questions about anostracan physiology, sex determination, and

Abstract = {The Javan gibbon, Hylobates moloch, is an endangered gibbon species
   restricted to the forest remnants of western and central Java,
   Indonesia, and one of the rarest of the Hylobatidae family. Hylobatids
   consist of 4 genera (Holoock, Hylobates, Symphalangus, and Nomascus)
   that are characterized by different numbers of chromosomes, ranging from
   38 to 52. The underlying cause of this karyotype plasticity is not
   entirely understood, at least in part, due to the limited availability
   of genomic data. Here we present the first scaffold-level assembly for
   H. moloch using a combination of whole-genome Illumina short reads, 10X
   Chromium linked reads, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore long reads and
   proximity-ligation data. This Hylobates genome represents a valuable new
   resource for comparative genomics studies in primates.},

Title = {Genetic Analysis Reveals a Distinct Lineage of Hog Deer (Axis porcinus)

Abstract = {The hog deer (Axis porcinus) is an endangered cervid with drastic
   population declines. There are 2 recognized subspecies of hog deer: A.
   p. porcinus, ranging from Punjab Province in Pakistan, Nepal, and the
   Northern part of India to Myanmar, and A. p. annamiticus found in
   Indo-China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The current
   geographic range of A. p. annamiticus is still ambiguous. We analyzed
   variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) to
   investigate the intra-species structure, differentiation, and
   demographic history of hog deer from Cambodia (Kratie Province), which
   we compared with the populations from India and Thailand. We also
   generated divergence time estimates using a concatenated dataset of
   complete Cyt b and partial CR. The CR data showed that Cambodian hog
   deer are genetically differentiated from the mainland Indian and Thai
   populations, forming a distinct basal clade. The time of divergence
   indicates that the Cambodian lineage split from the other 2 hog deer
   lineages around 0.51 Mya, during the Late Pleistocene. The results also
   suggest strong phylogeographic structure among hog deer: lineage A
   extends from Terai Arc (foothills of the Himalayas) to Assam, India (A.
   p. porcinus), lineage B from Manipur, India to Thailand (A. p.
   annamiticus), and lineage C is only known from Kratie Province,
   Cambodia. Lineage A exhibited a higher level of genetic diversity than
   lineages B and C, with recent demographic stability. Thus, the hog deer
   population in Kratie Province appears to be a distinct lineage that
   should be treated as an evolutionarily significant unit.},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {531-544},

Abstract = {Reproductive interference (RI) is a negative interspecific interaction
   caused by reproductive activities. Previous studies have implied that
   male-male competition increases RI capability, consisting of the male
   harm-inflicting capability of RI by males (RI infliction) and the female
   susceptibility to heterospecific male harm (RI resistance). Geographical
   populations show variations in the intensity of male-male competition
   and sexual conflict due to the influence of biotic/abiotic factors. We
   made two predictions: (1) RI capability would vary among conspecific
   populations, and (2) the degree of RI infliction by males would match
   that of female RI resistance in geographical strains. To test these
   predictions, we measured the fecundity of once-mated females in two
   scenarios: housed with heterospecific males and without males. We
   performed experiments using six strains from each of two bean weevil
   species, Callosobruchus maculatus and C. chinensis. The results
   demonstrated intraspecific variation in RI capability within both
   Callosobruchus species, but the RI infliction of males and RI resistance
   of females within a geographical strain did not consistently coincide.
   Our results suggest that RI varies depending on geographical strains,
   even within species, but we did not obtain evidence that sexual conflict
   molds RI capability, indicating traits driving RI do not follow the
   sexual conflict in both Callosobruchus species.},

Title = {Intraspecific competition and temperature drive habitat-based resource
   polymorphism in brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {967-986},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Intra- and interspecific competition, two density-dependent processes,
   are the two main driving forces suggested to promote habitat-based
   resource polymorphism, but very few studies have provided empirical
   support for this hypothesis. Furthermore, external drivers like
   temperature, an important environmental constraint in ectotherms, are
   often omitted when studying density-dependent habitat selection.
   Specifically, ambient temperature may have important effects on
   habitat-based resource polymorphism in ectotherms. Using mixed-effects
   modelling and isodar analyses, we quantified the effects of water
   temperature as well as intra- and interspecific competition on abundance
   and density-dependent habitat selection of brook charr (Salvelinus
   fontinalis) between littoral and pelagic habitats in 27 Canadian Shield
   lakes. We found that interspecific competition with white sucker
   (Catostomus commersonii) reduced brook charr abundances in both habitats
   but did not affect their density-dependent habitat selection. In
   contrast, the isodar analysis showed density-dependent habitat
   selection, confirming that intraspecific competition is a driver of
   brook charr habitat use in this system. Furthermore, brook charr
   preferred the littoral habitat at water temperatures below 20.8 degrees
   C, but dramatically reduced their used of this habitat when its
   temperature was above similar to 22.2 degrees C. By incorporating an
   external driver in the density-dependent habitat selection model, we
   show how the littoral temperature can shape brook charr distribution
   patterns between the littoral and pelagic habitats by acting as a
   thermal barrier and thus limiting the willingness of fish to use
   resources in the littoral habitat. This result suggests that global
   warming could constrain the diversifying effect of intraspecific
   competition and prevent resource polymorphism, a phenomenon that
   promotes adaptive radiation and speciation.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {753-766},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {All adaptive alleles in existence today began as mutations, but a common
   view in ecology, evolution, and genetics is that non-neutral mutations
   are much more likely to be deleterious than beneficial and will be
   removed by purifying selection. By dramatically limiting the
   effectiveness of selection in experimental mutation accumulation lines,
   multiple studies have shown that new mutations cause a detectable
   reduction in mean fitness. However, a number of exceptions to this
   pattern have now been observed in multiple species, including in highly
   replicated, intensive analyses. We briefly review these cases and
   discuss possible explanations for the inconsistent fitness outcomes of
   mutation accumulation experiments. We propose that variation in the
   outcomes of these studies is of interest and understanding the
   underlying causes of these diverse results will help shed light on
   fundamental questions about the evolutionary role of mutations.},

Title = {Aggressive behaviour in the skyhoppers of the Australian Alps},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {663-681},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution of male-male aggression is of interest because at its
   extreme it can be very energetically costly, leave males vulnerable to
   preadtors, and give rise to weaponry such as exaggerated traits. In
   grasshoppers (Acrididae), one group stands out as exceptionally
   aggressive, the skyhoppers (Kosciuscola) in which males bite, kick,
   mandible flare, and wrestle each other for access to females or when
   females are laying eggs. In this study we asked whether there is
   variation in aggressive behaviour among four skyhopper species and aimed
   to determine whether the traits used in fighting bear signatures of
   sexual selection in their size, variability, and allometric scaling. We
   found clear differences in the numbers and types of aggressive
   behaviours among species. Kosciuscola tristis and K. usitatus were the
   most aggressive, K. cognatus was the least aggressive, and K. tristis
   was the only species that performed the `mandible flare' behaviour.
   Mandible size was larger among the three species that showed aggressive
   behaviour, all except K. cognatus, and was negatively allometric for all
   species possibly suggesting a functional size constraint. Pronotum size
   was different among most species and K. tristis' pronotum was the
   largest and borderline positively allometric perhaps suggesting that
   pronotum size is related to aggressive behaviour but the nature of that
   relationship remains obscured. Our study suggests that further work
   investigates skyhoppers' aggressive behaviour and how it varies with
   ecology, and paves the way for establishing them as a model system in
   the evolution of aggressive behaviour.},

Title = {Ontogenetic shift in diet of a large elapid snake is facilitated by

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {As snakes are limbless, gape-limited predators, their skull is the main
   feeding structure involved in prey handling, manipulation and feeding.
   Ontogenetic changes in prey type and size are likely to be associated
   with distinct morphological changes in the skull during growth. We
   investigated ontogenetic variation in diet from stomach contents of 161
   Dugite specimens (Pseudonaja affinis, Elapidae) representing the full
   range of body size for the species, and skull morphology of 46 specimens
   (range 0.25-1.64 m snout-vent-length; SVL). We hypothesised that changes
   in prey type throughout postnatal ontogeny would coincide with distinct
   changes in skull shape. Dugites demonstrate a distinct size-related
   shift in diet: the smallest individuals ate autotomised reptile tails
   and reptiles, medium-sized individuals predominantly ate mammals, and
   the largest individuals had the most diverse diet, including large
   reptiles. Morphometric analysis revealed that similar to 40\% of the
   variation in skull shape was associated with body size (SVL). Through
   ontogeny, skulls changed from a smooth, bulbous cranium with relatively
   small trophic bones (upper and lower jaws and their attachments), to
   more rugose bones (as a likely reflection of muscle attachment) and
   relatively longer trophic bones that would extend gape. Individual shape
   variation in trophic bone dimensions was greater in larger adults and
   this likely reflects natural plasticity of individuals feeding on
   different prey sizes/types. Rather than a distinct morphological shift
   with diet, the ontogenetic changes were gradual, but positive allometry
   of individual trophic bones resulted in disproportionate growth of the
   skull, reflected in increased gape size and mobility of jaw bones in
   adults to aid the ingestion of larger prey and improve manipulation and
   processing ability. These results indicate that allometric scaling is an
   important mechanism by which snakes can change their dietary niche.},

Abstract = {The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a medium-sized carnivore well adapted to
   various environments and an indicator species for landscape
   connectivity. It is one of the 4 species within the extant Lynx genus in
   the family Felidae. Because of its broad geographic distribution and
   central role in food webs, the bobcat is important for conservation.
   Here we present a high-quality de novo genome assembly of a male bobcat
   located in Mendocino County, CA, as part of the California Conservation
   Genomics Project (CCGP). The assembly was generated using the standard
   CCGP pipeline from a combination of Omni-C and HiFi technologies. The
   primary assembly comprises 76 scaffolds spanning 2.4 Gb, represented by
   a scaffold N50 of 142 Mb, a contig N50 of 66.2 Mb, and a BUSCO
   completeness score of 95.90\%. The bobcat genome will be an important
   resource for the effective management and conservation of this species
   and comparative genomics exploration.},

Title = {Interspecific Hybridization and Island Colonization History, not Rarity,
   Most Strongly Affect the Genetic Diversity in Diospyros a Clade of
   Mascarene-Endemic Trees},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEREDITY},

Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Many factors shape the genetic diversity of island-endemic trees, with
   important implications for conservation. Oceanic island-endemic lineages
   undergo an initial founding bottleneck during the colonization process
   and subsequently accumulate diversity following colonization. Moreover,
   many island endemics occur in small populations and are further
   threatened by anthropogenic factors that cause population declines,
   making them susceptible to losses in genetic diversity through genetic
   drift, inbreeding, and bottlenecks. However, life-history traits
   commonly found in trees, such as outcrossing mechanisms, long lifespans,
   and a propensity for interspecific hybridization, may help buffer
   against losses of genetic variation. To assess the relative importance
   of colonization history, rarity, and distribution in shaping genetic
   diversity of island-endemic trees, we conducted a comparative population
   genomic analysis of 13 species of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) endemic to the
   Mascarene Islands that differ in island colonization history,
   distribution, population size, and IUCN threat status. We genotyped 328
   individuals across the islands using 2b-RADseq, compared genetic
   diversity both among and within species, and assessed patterns of
   genetic structure. Genetic diversity did not vary significantly by IUCN
   status, but we found that species that co-occur with others on the same
   intermediate-aged island (Mauritius) had much greater genetic diversity
   than those that occur solitarily on an island (Reunion and Rodrigues),
   likely because of greater interspecific hybridization among species with
   overlapping distributions and processes related to time since island
   colonization. Results presented here were used to determine priority
   localities for in situ and ex situ conservation efforts to maximize the
   genetic diversity of each Mascarene Diospyros species.},

Abstract = {R/glmnet has been successfully applied to jointly mapped multiple
   quantitative trait loci for linkage analysis, along with statistical
   inference for quantitative trait loci candidates with nonzero genetic
   effects using R/lm for normally distributed traits, R/glm for discrete

   R/glmnet to a genome-wide association study by means of parallel
   computation. A multi-locus genome-wide association study for
   high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphisms was implemented in the
   ``Multi-Runking{''} software written within the R workspace. This
   software can better detect common and large quantitative trait
   nucleotides and more accurately estimate than genome-wide mixed model
   analysis for one single-nucleotide polymorphism at a time and linear
   mixed models-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Its
   applicability and utility were demonstrated by multi-locus genome-wide
   association studies for the simulated and real traits distributed
   normally, binary traits, and survival times.},

Abstract = {Heteroplasmy in the mitochondrial genome offers a rare opportunity to
   track the evolution of a newly arising maternal lineage in populations
   of non-model species. Here, we identified a previously unreported
   mitochondrial DNA haplotype while assembling an integrated database of
   DNA profiles and photo-identification records from humpback whales in
   southeastern Alaska (SEAK). The haplotype, referred to as A8, was shared
   by only 2 individuals, a mature female with her female calf, and
   differed by only a single base pair from a common haplotype in the North
   Pacific, referred to as A-. To investigate the origins of the A8
   haplotype, we reviewed n = 1,089 electropherograms (including replicate
   samples) of n = 710 individuals with A- haplotypes from an existing
   collection. From this review, we found 20 individuals with clear
   evidence of heteroplasmy for A-/A8 (parental/derived) haplotypes. Of
   these, 15 were encountered in SEAK, 4 were encountered on the Hawaiian
   breeding ground (the primary migratory destination for whales in SEAK),
   and 1 was encountered in the northern Gulf of Alaska. We used genotype
   exclusion and likelihood to identify one of the heteroplasmic females as
   the likely mother of the A8 cow and grandmother of the A8 calf,
   establishing the inheritance and germ-line fixation of the new haplotype
   from the parental heteroplasmy. The mutation leading to this
   heteroplasmy and the fixation of the A8 haplotype provide an opportunity
   to document the population dynamics and regional fidelity of a newly
   arising maternal lineage in a population recovering from exploitation.},

Abstract = {Long-term sustainability of breeds depends on having sufficient genetic
   diversity for adaptability to change, whether driven by climatic
   conditions or by priorities in breeding programs. Genetic diversity in
   Suffolk sheep in the United States was evaluated in four ways: 1) using
   genetic relationships from pedigree data {[}(n = 64 310 animals recorded
   in the US National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP)]; 2) using molecular
   data (n = 304 Suffolk genotyped with the OvineHD BeadChip); 3) comparing
   Australian (n = 109) and Irish (n = 55) Suffolk sheep to those in the
   United States using molecular data; and 4) assessing genetic
   relationships (connectedness) among active Suffolk flocks (n = 18) in
   NSIP. By characterizing genetic diversity, a goal was to define the
   structure of a reference population for use for genomic selection
   strategies in this breed. Pedigree-based mean inbreeding level for the
   most recent year of available data was 5.5\%. Ten animals defined 22.8\%
   of the current gene pool. The effective population size (N-e) ranged
   from 27.5 to 244.2 based on pedigree and was 79.5 based on molecular
   data. Expected (H-E) and observed (H-O) heterozygosity were 0.317 and
   0.306, respectively. Model-based population structure included 7
   subpopulations. From Principal Component Analysis, countries separated
   into distinct populations. Within the US population, flocks formed
   genetically disconnected clusters. A decline in genetic diversity over
   time was observed from both pedigree and genomic-based derived measures
   with evidence of population substructure as measured by F-ST. Using
   these measures of genetic diversity, a framework for establishing a

Abstract = {Understanding how environmental variation influences population genetic
   structure can help predict how environmental change influences
   population connectivity, genetic diversity, and evolutionary potential.
   We used riverscape genomics modeling to investigate how climatic and
   habitat variables relate to patterns of genetic variation in 2 stonefly
   species, one from mainstem river habitats (Sweltsa coloradensis) and one
   from tributaries (Sweltsa fidelis) in 40 sites in northwest Montana,
   USA. We produced a draft genome assembly for S. coloradensis (N50 =
   0.251 Mbp, BUSCO > 95\% using ``insecta\_ob9{''} reference genes). We
   genotyped 1930 SNPs in 372 individuals for S. coloradensis and 520 SNPs
   in 153 individuals for S. fidelis. We found higher genetic diversity for
   S. coloradensis compared to S. fidelis, but nearly identical genetic
   differentiation among sites within each species (both had global loci
   median F-ST = 0.000), despite differences in stream network location.
   For landscape genomics and testing for selection, we produced a less
   stringently filtered data set (3454 and 1070 SNPs for S. coloradensis
   and S. fidelis, respectively). Environmental variables (mean summer
   precipitation, slope, aspect, mean June stream temperature, land cover
   type) were correlated with 19 putative adaptive loci for S.
   coloradensis, but there was only one putative adaptive locus for S.
   fidelis (correlated with aspect). Interestingly, we also detected
   potential hybridization between multiple Sweltsa species which has never
   been previously detected. Studies like ours, that test for adaptive
   variation in multiple related species are needed to help assess
   landscape connectivity and the vulnerability of populations and
   communities to environmental change.},

Abstract = {Despite much research on mimicry, little is known about the ecology of
   dynamic mimetic signals involving mimicry of multiple species. Some of
   the most conspicuous examples of phenotypically plastic mimicry are
   produced by oscine passerines, where vocal production learning enables
   some species to mimic multiple models and flexibly adjust what they
   mimic and when. While singing from a perch, male superb lyrebirds
   (Menura novaehollandiae) accurately imitate multiple songs and calls of
   over 20 species of bird. However, at key moments within their multimodal
   displays performed on display arenas on the forest floor, males mimic a
   small number of mobbing-alarm calls creating the acoustic illusion of a
   mixed-species mobbing flock ('D-song'). Using observations from camera
   footage and a field-based playback experiment, we tested six hypotheses
   for alarm call model selection within D-song. Mimicked species were
   remarkably invariant, with 79\% of D-song made up of imitations of just
   three different bird species. Males did not mimic the most common
   species in their general environment, but neither did they mimic rare
   species. Instead, males imitated the mobbing-alarm calls of
   heterospecific birds that foraged on or near the forest floor. Indeed,
   males primarily mimicked the alarm calls of heterospecific species that
   foraged alongside lyrebirds and were likely to appear together in
   experimentally-induced, terrestrial mobbing flocks. These findings
   support the hypothesis that males mimic a cue of a terrestrial predatory
   threat to lyrebirds, most likely to exploit the antipredator behaviour
   of female lyrebirds. Our study illustrates the importance of
   investigating the drivers of model selection in dynamic multi-model
   mimicry.},

Title = {Niche conservatism limits the distribution of Medicago in the tropics},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increase in species number from poles to the equator is one of the
   most fundamental patterns in ecology. Although several hypotheses have
   been proposed, there is a lack of consensus on the mechanisms underlying
   this pattern. While most hypotheses provide plausible explanation for
   high tropical diversity of tropical clades, it is unclear if similar
   mechanisms drive the diversity of extra-tropical clades. Here, we
   investigated the environmental drivers influencing the diversity pattern
   of a Mediterranean plant genus Medicago and dissect their effects across
   continents and biomes. We compiled a comprehensive dataset on the
   distribution of all Medicago species and mapped their distribution at
   the spatial resolution of 100 x 100 km(2). We used generalized linear
   models to quantify the relative effects of environmental factors on the
   richness patterns of Medicago and its two life forms. Next, using
   geographically weighted regression, we explored the variation in
   richness-environment relationship across latitude. We found that
   Quaternary climate change and environmental energy were important
   explanatory variables, and their effects were consistent at global,
   continental and biome scales. However, we found contrasting effect of
   environmental energy in temperate and tropical regions, with species
   richness increasing with energy in the temperate and decreasing in the
   tropics. We also found strong affinity of Medicago species to its
   ancestral Mediterranean climatic niche. Our results suggest that the
   spatial variation in Medicago richness patterns may be strongly
   influenced by heat tolerance as opposed to the tropical clades that
   depend upon cold tolerance. This dependency on heat tolerance can be
   attributed to strong niche conservatism exhibited by Medicago species.
   Our findings provide new insights into the richness-energy hypothesis
   and suggest that high environmental energy may not necessarily yield
   high species diversity but may also lower species diversity, especially
   of extra-tropical clades towards the tropics.},

Title = {Phylogenetic composition of native island floras influences naturalized

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Islands are hotspots of plant endemism and are particularly vulnerable
   to the establishment (naturalization) of alien plant species.
   Naturalized species richness on islands depends on several
   biogeographical and socioeconomic factors, but especially on remoteness.
   One potential explanation for this is that the phylogenetically
   imbalanced composition of native floras on remote islands leaves
   unoccupied niche space for alien species to colonize. Here, we tested
   whether the species richness of naturalized seed plants on 249 islands
   worldwide is related to the phylogenetic composition of their native
   floras. To this end, we calculated standardized effect size (ses)
   accounting for species richness for three phylogenetic assemblage
   metrics (Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD), PDses; mean pairwise
   distance (MPD), MPDses; and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), MNTDses)
   based on a phylogeny of 42 135 native island plant species and related
   them to naturalized species richness. As covariates in generalized
   linear mixed models, we included native species richness and
   biogeographical, climatic and socioeconomic island characteristics known
   to affect naturalized species richness. Our analysis showed an increase
   in naturalized species richness with increasing phylogenetic clustering
   of the native assemblages (i.e. native species more closely related than
   expected by chance), most prominently with MPDses. This effect, however,
   was smaller than the influence of native species richness and
   biogeographical factors, e.g. remoteness. Further, the effect of native
   phylogenetic structure (MPDses) on naturalized species richness was
   stronger for smaller islands, but this pattern was not consistent across
   all phylogenetic assemblage metrics. This finding suggests that the
   phylogenetic composition of native island floras may affect naturalized
   species richness, particularly on small islands where species are more
   likely to co-occur locally. Overall, we conclude that the composition of
   native island assemblages affects their susceptibility to plant
   naturalizations in addition to other socioeconomic and biogeographical
   factors, and should be considered when assessing invasion risks on
   islands.},

Title = {Integrating physiology into correlative models can alter projections of
   habitat suitability under climate change for a threatened amphibian},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rapid global change has increased interest in developing ways to
   identify suitable refugia for species of conservation concern.
   Correlative and mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) represent
   two approaches to generate spatially-explicit estimates of climate
   vulnerability. Correlative SDMs generate distributions using statistical
   associations between environmental variables and species presence data.
   In contrast, mechanistic SDMs use physiological traits and tolerances to
   identify areas that meet the conditions required for growth, survival
   and reproduction. Correlative approaches assume modeled environmental
   variables influence species distributions directly or indirectly;
   however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are rarely
   verified empirically. We compared habitat suitability predictions
   between a correlative-only SDM, a mechanistic SDM and a correlative
   framework that incorporated mechanistic layers ('hybrid models'). Our
   comparison focused on green salamanders Aneides aeneus, a priority
   amphibian threatened by climate change throughout their disjunct range.
   We developed mechanistic SDMs using experiments to measure the thermal
   sensitivity of resistance to water loss (r(i)) and metabolism. Under
   current climate conditions, correlative-only, hybrid and mechanistic
   SDMs predicted similar overlap in habitat suitability; however,
   mechanistic SDMs predicted habitat suitability to extend into regions
   without green salamanders but known to harbor many lungless salamanders.
   Under future warming scenarios, habitat suitability depended on climate
   scenario and SDM type. Correlative and hybrid models predicted a 42\%
   reduction or 260\% increase in area considered to be suitable depending
   on the climate scenario. In mechanistic SDMs, energetically suitable
   habitat declined with both climate scenarios and was driven by the
   thermal sensitivity of r(i). Our study indicates that correlative-only
   and hybrid approaches produce similar predictions of habitat
   suitability; however, discrepancies can arise for species that do not
   occupy their entire fundamental niche, which may hold consequences of
   conservation planning of threatened species.},

Title = {Rapid recovery of boreal rove beetle (Staphylinidae) assemblages 16
   years after variable retention harvest},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Post-harvest recovery of biodiversity is one of important goals in
   modern forestry. A variable retention (VR) approach has been of
   particular interest in North America because it promotes rapid faunal
   recovery, while minimizing negative lasting impacts of logging on the
   natural fauna. We studied responses of rove beetles (Coleoptera:
   Staphylinidae) to a broad range of retention harvests (2, 10, 20, 50 and
   75\% retention) in comparison to uncut controls as part of the Ecosystem
   Management Emulating Natural Disturbance (EMEND) experiment in the
   boreal mixedwood forest of western Canada. We sampled beetles using
   pitfall traps 1, 2, 11 and 16 years post-harvest in replicated (n=3)
   stands representing four cover types (deciduous-dominated, deciduous
   with spruce understory, mixed and coniferous-dominated). We collected 74
   263 individuals distributed across 99 species (excluding Aleocharinae).
   Estimated species richness was highest in clear-cuts until year 11, but
   by year 16 species richness was similar among treatments. Species
   composition initially varied strongly in relation to intensity of
   harvest treatments, but overall variation decreased with time, and by
   year 16, species composition overlapped among most treatment
   combinations. Assemblages recovered more quickly in early successional
   (deciduous-dominated) than in late successional (mixed and
   conifer-dominated) stands. Overall, our results show that rove beetle
   assemblages in stands harvested to all VR prescriptions converged more
   rapidly toward those in fire-origin mature stands than did assemblages
   in clear-cuts over the first 16 years post-harvest. Thus, it
   demonstrates that even modest levels of forest retention can facilitate
   the recovery of staphylinid assemblages in managed landscapes.},

Title = {Green infrastructure can promote plant functional connectivity in a
   grassland species around fragmented semi-natural grasslands in NW-Europe},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Species may benefit from green infrastructure, i.e. the network of
   natural and anthropogenic habitat remnants in human-dominated
   landscapes, if it helps isolated populations in remaining habitat
   patches to be functionally connected. The importance of green
   infrastructure is therefore increasingly emphasized in conservation
   policy to counter biodiversity loss. However, there is limited evidence,
   particularly in plants, that green infrastructure promotes functional
   connectivity, i.e. supports the colonization of habitat patches across a
   landscape. We applied landscape genetics to test whether the green
   infrastructure supports structural and functional connectivity in the
   grassland perennial Galium verum, in 35 landscapes in Belgium, Germany
   and Sweden. We used multivariate genetic clustering techniques,
   nestedness analyses and conditional inference trees to examine
   landscape-scale patterns in genetic diversity and structure of plant
   populations in the green infrastructure surrounding semi-natural
   grasslands. Inferred functional connectivity explained genetic variation
   better than structural connectivity, yielding positive effects on
   genetic variation. The road verge network, a major structural component
   of the green infrastructure and its functional connectivity, most
   effectively explained genetic diversity and composition in G. verum.
   Galium verum ramets occupying the surrounding landscape proved to be
   genetic subsets of focal grassland populations, shaping a nested
   landscape population genetic structure with focal grasslands,
   particularly ancient ones, harbouring unique genetic diversity. This
   nested pattern weakened as road network density increased, suggesting
   road verge networks enable high landscape occupancy by increased habitat
   availability and facilitates gene flow into the surrounding landscape.
   Our study proposes that green infrastructure can promote functional
   connectivity, providing that a plant species can survive outside of core
   habitat patches. As this often excludes habitat specialist species,
   conservation practice and policy should primarily focus on ancient,
   managed semi-natural grasslands. These grasslands both harbour unique
   genetic diversity and act as primary gene and propagule sources for the
   surrounding landscape, highlighting their conservation value.},

Title = {Spatial uncertainty in herbarium data: simulated displacement but not

   in a widespread California wildflower},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Herbarium records provide a broad spatial and temporal range with which
   to investigate plant responses to environmental change. Research on
   plant phenology and its sensitivity to climate has advanced with the
   increasing availability of digitized herbarium specimens, but
   limitations of specimen-derived data can undermine the inferences
   derived from such research. One issue that has received little attention
   is collection site uncertainty (i.e. error distance), a measure of
   confidence in the location from which a specimen was collected. We
   conducted comparative analyses of phenoclimatic models to determine
   whether spatial deviations of 2, 5, 15 or 25 km between recorded and
   simulated collection sites, as well as the error distance reported in
   digitized records, affect estimates of the phenological sensitivity of
   flowering time to annual temperature and precipitation in a widespread
   annual California wildflower. In this approach, we considered both
   spatial and interannual variation in climatic conditions. Simulated site
   displacements led to increasingly weak estimates of phenological
   sensitivity to temperature and precipitation anomalies with increasing
   distances. However, we found no significant effect of reported error
   distance magnitude on estimates of phenological sensitivity to climate
   normals or anomalies. These findings suggest that the spatial
   uncertainty of collection sites among specimens of widely collected
   plant species may not adversely affect estimates of phenological
   sensitivity to climate, even though real discrepancies and
   georeferencing inaccuracy can negatively impact such estimates.
   Collection site uncertainty merits further attention as a potential
   source of noise in herbarium data, especially for research on how plant
   traits respond to spatial and interannual climatic variation.},

Abstract = {Species inventories are the building blocks of our assessment of
   biodiversity patterns and human impact. Yet, historical inventories
   based on visual observations are often incomplete, impairing subsequent
   analyses of ecological mechanisms, extinction risk and management
   success. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an emerging tool that
   can provide wider biodiversity assessments than classical visual-based
   surveys. However, eDNA-based inventories remain limited by sampling
   effort and reference database incompleteness. In this study, we propose
   a new framework coupling eDNA surveys and sampling-theory methods to
   estimate species richness in under-sampled and hyper-diverse regions
   where some species remain absent from the checklist or undetected by
   visual surveys. We applied this framework to the coastal fish diversity
   in the heart of the coral triangle, the richest marine biodiversity
   hotspot worldwide. Combining data from 279 underwater visual censuses,
   92 eDNA samples and an extensive custom genetic reference database, we
   show that eDNA metabarcoding recorded 196 putative species not detected
   by underwater visual census including 37 species absent from the
   regional checklist. We provide an updated checklist of marine fishes in
   the `Raja Ampat Bird's Head Peninsula' ecoregion with 2534 species
   including 1761 confirmed and 773 highly probable presences. The Chao
   lower-bound diversity estimator, based on the incidence of rare species,
   shows that the region potentially hosts an additional 123 fish species,
   including pelagic, cryptobenthic and vulnerable species. The extended
   and hidden biodiversity along with their asymptotic estimates highlight
   the ability of eDNA to expand regional inventories and species
   distributions to better guide conservation strategies.},

Title = {Rapid diversification of the Australian Amitermes group during late
   Cenozoic climate change},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Late Cenozoic climate change led to the progressive aridification of
   Australia over the past 15 million years. This gradual biome turnover
   fundamentally changed Australia's ecosystems, opening new niches and
   prompting diversification of plants and animals. One example are
   termites of the Australian Amitermes group (AAG), consisting of the
   Australian Amitermes and affiliated genera. Although the most speciose
   and diverse higher termite group in Australia, little is known about its
   evolutionary history. We used ancestral range reconstruction and
   diversification analyses to illuminate 1) phylogenetic relationships of
   the AAG, 2) biogeographical processes leading to the current
   continent-wide distribution and 3) timing and pattern of diversification
   in the context of late Cenozoic climate change. By estimating the
   largest time-calibrated phylogeny for this group to date, we demonstrate
   monophyly of the AAG and confirm that their ancestor arrived in
   Australia similar to 11-10 million years ago (Mya) from Southeast Asia.
   Ancestral range reconstruction indicates that Australia's monsoon region
   was the launching point for a continental radiation shaped by dispersal
   and within-biome speciation rather than vicariance. We found that
   multiple arid-zone species diversified from mesic and tropical ancestors
   in the Plio-Pleistocene, but also observed diversification in the
   opposite direction. Finally, we show that diversification steadily
   increased from similar to 8 to 9 Mya during the `Hill Gap' and
   accelerated from similar to 4 ya in concert with major ecological change
   during the Pliocene. Consistent with rapid diversification, species
   accumulation then slowed down into the present, likely caused by
   progressive niche saturation. This study provides a stepping stone for
   predicting future responses of Australia's termite fauna in the face of
   human-mediated climate change.},

Title = {Spatial patterns and climatic drivers of phylogenetic structure for
   ferns along the longest elevational gradient in the world},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many biodiversity hotspots are located in montane regions, thus,
   understanding the underlying mechanisms driving species assembly along
   elevational gradients is of major interest in ecology and biogeography.
   Here, we assess spatial patterns and climatic drivers, and the effects
   of clade age, on patterns of phylogenetic structure of ferns along the
   world's longest elevational gradient in the central Himalaya. We used
   correlation and regression analyses to relate metrics of phylogenetic
   structure reflecting both shallow (tip-weighted) and deep
   (basal-weighted) evolutionary histories of ferns, and their two major
   groups reflecting different ages (polypods representing a young clade,
   all other ferns representing old clades), in fifty 100-m vertical bands
   to climatic factors representing different aspects of climatic
   conditions (mean climate, stressful climate and climate seasonality).
   Variation partitioning analysis was used to determine the relative
   importance of each group of climatic factors on phylogenetic structure.
   We find that the composition of fern assemblages along the Himalayan
   elevational gradient in Nepal shows strong signatures of evolutionary
   processes. In a simplified way, species-rich assemblages at
   mid-elevations are likely the result of recent radiations in combination
   with low extinction rates, whereas species-poor assemblages at low
   elevations are composed of numerous lineages with limited radiations,
   and those at high elevations of few lineages, also with limited
   signature of recent radiations. Variables related to temperature and
   climatic extremes tended to play a more important role than
   precipitation- and seasonality-related variables, respectively, in
   driving fern phylogenetic structure. Combining the results of ferns and
   angiosperms suggests that there are a few generally consistent
   evolutionary processes that apply to all plant groups (e.g. niche
   conservatism and environmental filtering), but that the specific
   outcomes of these processes vary with elevation, clade age and taxon.},

Title = {Snow cover dynamics: an overlooked yet important feature of winter bird
   occurrence and abundance across the United States},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Snow cover dynamics (i.e. depth, duration and variability) are dominant
   drivers of ecological processes during winter. For overwintering
   species, changes and gradients in snow cover may impact survival and
   population dynamics (e.g. facilitating survival via thermal refugia or
   limiting survival via reduced resource acquisition). However, snow cover
   dynamics are rarely used in species distribution modelling, especially
   for overwintering birds. Currently, we lack understanding of how snow
   cover gradients affect overwintering bird distributions and which
   functional traits drive these associations at regional and continental
   scales. Using observations from eBird, a global community science
   network, we explored the effects of snow cover dynamics on continental
   patterns of occurrence and counts for 150 bird species. We quantified
   the relative importance, species-specific responses and trait-based
   relationships of bird occurrence and abundance patterns to ecologically
   relevant snow cover dynamics across the United States. Snow cover
   dynamics were important environmental predictors in species
   distributions models, ranking within the top three predictors for most
   species occurrence (> 90\%) and count (> 79\%) patterns across the
   contiguous United States. Species exhibited a gradient of responses to
   snow cover from snow association to snow avoidance, yet most birds were
   limited by long, persistent snow seasons. Duration of winter and percent
   frozen ground without snow structured species distributions in the
   eastern USA, whereas snow cover variability was a stronger driver in the
   western USA. Birds associated with long, persistent snow seasons had
   traits associated with greater dispersal capacity and dietary diversity,
   whereas birds inhabiting regions with variable snow cover were generally
   habitat generalists. Our results suggest that various snow cover
   dynamics are important ecological filters of species distributions
   during winter. Global climate change is rapidly degrading key
   characteristics of seasonal snow cover. A changing cryosphere may elicit
   variable distributional changes for many overwintering birds,
   potentially accelerating range shifts and novel community assemblages.},

Title = {Testing the assumption of environmental equilibrium in an invasive plant
   species over a 130 year history},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Invasive plants are an increasing threat to global biodiversity.
   Effective management depends on accurate predictions of their spread.
   However, modelling the geographic distribution of invasive species,
   particularly with correlative species distribution models (SDMs), is
   challenging. SDMs assume that species are in equilibrium with their
   environment (i.e. they occur in all suitable environments); this
   assumption is likely to be violated for a species that is actively
   invading new environments. This assumption is rarely assessed, and when
   violated can have consequences for model reliability. Using the invasive
   vine Vincetoxicum rossicum, we tested the hypotheses that: 1) invasive
   species' distribution in environmental and geographic space increase to
   a plateau over time; 2) this plateau is a useful proxy for equilibrium
   distribution, a key assumption underlying SDMs. We compare V. rossicum's
   expansion in environmental and geographic space between historical and
   current time periods and infer equilibrium when its distribution has
   remained stable for an extended period. We also compare the performance
   of SDMs from historical time periods in predicting the current
   geographic distribution of V. rossicum. We found that V. rossicum has
   reached equilibrium in environmental space, but is still expanding its
   geographic distribution. SDM performance was poor in the first 30 years
   following introduction, but improved as V. rossicum approached
   environmental equilibrium. Our findings demonstrate the power of
   including temporal dynamics and the need to consider environmental and
   geographic equilibrium separately when modelling the distribution of
   invasive species. In light of our findings, we address shortcomings of
   the current approach to defining an equilibrium distribution and present
   a new perspective for reconciling the potentially confounding influence
   of dispersal limitation when assessing equilibrium distribution.},

Title = {Climatic filtering and temporal instability shape the phylogenetic
   diversity of European alpine floras},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity despite their cold
   climates. Here we investigate spatial patterns in the phylogenetic
   diversity (i.e. the degree of species relatedness) of European alpine
   floras and quantify the influence of climatic conditions since the late
   Pleistocene and historical climatic instability in shaping these
   patterns. We collected species-pool data for 22 alpine regions in
   central and southern Europe and calculated phylogenetic diversity within
   and between regions using two metrics sensitive to terminal branching in
   the phylogeny. We regressed phylogenetic diversity against macroclimatic
   variables representing seasonal extremes between the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM; 21 000 years BP) and the present at 1000-year intervals.
   We found the lowest phylogenetic diversity in the Carpathians and the
   central Alps, and the highest in the north-eastern and southern Iberian
   Peninsula. Phylogenetic diversity decreased with temperature seasonality
   and low winter temperature. While the effect of temperature seasonality
   was relatively constant over time, the influence of winter temperature
   decreased after the LGM. We also found that phylogenetic diversity
   decreased with historical climatic instability. Between regions,
   phylogenetic diversity was mainly explained by current climatic distance
   rather than geographic distance, suggesting that alpine floras were
   primarily driven by species sorting along climatic gradients. Our
   results confirm the role of environmental filtering in shaping the
   current phylogenetic diversity of alpine floras, resulting in more
   closely related lineages in regions with relatively cold and unstable
   climates. We also highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating
   climatic variation through time to better understand the processes
   structuring the current biodiversity of alpine floras.},

Title = {forestexplorR: an R package for the exploration and analysis of
   stem-mapped forest stand data},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Stem-mapped forest stands offer important opportunities for
   investigating the fine-scale spatial processes occurring in forest
   ecosystems. These stands are areas of the forest where the precise
   locations and repeated size measurements of each tree are recorded,
   thereby enabling the calculation of spatially-explicit metrics of
   individual growth rates and of the entire tree community. The most
   common use of these datasets is to investigate the drivers of variation
   in forest processes by modeling tree growth rate or mortality as a
   function of these neighborhood metrics. However, neighborhood metrics
   could also serve as important covariates of many other spatially
   variable forest processes, including seedling recruitment, herbivory and
   soil microbial community composition. Widespread use of stem-mapped
   forest stand datasets is currently hampered by the lack of standardized,
   efficient and easy-to-use tools to calculate tree dynamics (e.g. growth,
   mortality) and the neighborhood metrics that impact them. We present the
   forestexplorR package that facilitates the munging, exploration,
   visualization and analysis of stem-mapped forest stands. By providing
   flexible, user-friendly functions that calculate neighborhood metrics
   and implement a recently-developed rapid-fitting tree growth and
   mortality model, forestexplorR broadens the accessibility of stem-mapped
   forest stand data. We demonstrate the functionality of forestexplorR by
   using it to investigate how the species identity of neighboring trees
   influences the growth rates of three common tree species in Mt Rainier
   National Park, WA, USA. forestexplorR is designed to facilitate
   researchers to incorporate spatially-explicit descriptions of tree
   communities in their studies and we expect this increased diversity of
   contributors to develop exciting new ways of using stem-mapped forest
   stand data.},

Title = {WiBB: an integrated method for quantifying the relative importance of
   predictive variables},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1557-1567},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A fundamental goal of scientific research is to identify the underlying
   variables that govern crucial processes of a system. This is especially
   difficult in ecology, which is intrinsically rich in candidate
   predictors. An efficient statistical procedure to evaluate the relative
   importance of predictors in regression models is highly desirable.
   However, previous studies criticised the most universally applicable
   method, by pointing out the low discriminating power of the importance
   index in simulated datasets. Here we proposed a new index, WiBB, which
   integrates the merits of several existing methods. WiBB combines a
   model-weighting method from information theory (Wi), a standardised
   regression coefficient method measured by beta{*} (B), and bootstrap
   resampling technique (B). We applied the WiBB in simulated datasets with
   known correlation structures, for both linear models (LM) and
   generalized linear models (GLM), to evaluate its performance. We also
   applied it to an empirical dataset of a plant genus Mimulus to select
   bioclimatic predictors of species' presence across the landscape.
   Results in the simulated datasets showed that the bootstrap resampling
   technique significantly improved the discriminant ability by correctly
   sorting the orders of relative importance of predictors. The WiBB method
   outperformed the beta{*} and the relative sum of weights (SWi, a
   standardised version of sum of weights) methods in scenarios with small
   and large sample sizes, respectively. When testing WiBB in the empirical
   dataset with GLM, it sensibly identified four important predictors with
   high credibility out of six candidates in modelling geographical
   distributions of 71 Mimulus species. This integrated index has great
   advantages in evaluating predictor importance and hence reducing the
   dimensionality of data, without losing interpretive power. The
   simplicity of calculation of the new metric over more sophisticated
   statistical procedures makes it a handy method in the statistical
   toolbox.},

Title = {Resolution in species distribution models shapes spatial patterns of
   plant multifaceted diversity},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical tools that relate
   species observations to environmental conditions to retrieve ecological
   niches and predict species' potential geographic distributions. The
   quality and robustness of SDMs clearly depend on good modelling
   practices including ascertaining the ecological relevance of predictors
   for the studied species and choosing an appropriate spatial resolution
   (or `grain size'). While past studies showed improved model performance
   with increasing resolution for sessile organisms, there is still no
   consensus regarding how inappropriate resolution of predictors can
   impede understanding and mapping of multiple facets of diversity. Here,
   we modelled the distribution of 1180 plant species across the European
   Alps for two sets of predictors (climate and soil) at resolutions
   ranging from 100-m to 40-km. We assessed predictors' importance for each
   resolution, calculated taxonomic (TD), relative phylogenetic (rPD) and
   functional diversity (rFD) accordingly, and compared the resulting
   diversities across space. In accordance with previous studies, we found
   the predictive performance to generally decrease with decreasing
   predictor resolution. Overall, multifaceted diversity was found to be
   strongly affected by resolution, particularly rPD, as exhibited by weak
   to average linear relationships between 100-m and 1-km resolutions (0.13
   <= R-2 <= 0.57). Our results demonstrate the necessity of using highly
   resolved predictors to explain and predict sessile species
   distributions, especially in mountain environments. Using coarser
   resolution predictors might cause multifaceted diversity to be strongly
   mispredicted, with important consequences for biodiversity management
   and conservation.},

Title = {The Darwinian shortfall in plants: phylogenetic knowledge is driven by
   range size},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Darwinian shortfall, i.e. the lack of knowledge of phylogenetic
   relationships, significantly impedes our understanding of evolutionary
   drivers of global patterns of biodiversity. Spatial bias in the
   Darwinian shortfall, where phylogenetic knowledge in some regions is
   more complete than others, could undermine eco- and biogeographic
   inferences. Yet, spatial biases in phylogenetic knowledge for major
   groups - such as plants - remain poorly understood. Using data for 337
   023 species (99.7\%) of seed plants (Spermatophyta), we produced a
   global map of phylogenetic knowledge based on regional data and tested
   several potential drivers of the observed spatial variation. Regional
   phylogenetic knowledge was defined as the proportion of the regional
   seed plant flora represented in GenBank's nucleotide database with
   phylogenetically relevant data. We used simultaneous autoregressive
   models to explain variation in phylogenetic knowledge based on three
   biodiversity variables (species richness, range size and endemism) and
   six socioeconomic variables representing funding and accessibility. We
   compared observed patterns and relationships to established patterns of
   the Wallacean shortfall (the lack of knowledge of species
   distributions). We found that the Darwinian shortfall is strongly and
   significantly related to the macroecological distribution of species'
   range sizes. Small-ranged species were significantly less likely to have
   phylogenetic data, leading to a concentration of the Darwinian shortfall
   in species-rich, tropical countries where range sizes are small on
   average. Socioeconomic factors were less important, with significant but
   quantitatively small effects of accessibility and funding. In
   conclusion, reducing the Darwinian shortfall and smoothen its spatial
   bias will require increased efforts to sequence the world's small-ranged
   (endemic) species.},

Title = {Island area and historical geomorphological dynamics shape multifaceted
   diversity of barrier island floras},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The influence of island dynamics and characteristics on taxonomic
   diversity, particularly species richness, are well studied. Yet, our
   knowledge on the influence of island dynamics and characteristics on
   other facets of diversity, namely functional and phylogenetic diversity,
   is limited, constraining our understanding of assembly processes on
   islands (e.g. biogeographic history, dispersal and environmental
   filtering and species interactions). Using barrier islands, a highly
   dynamic and so far, understudied island type, we investigate how
   multiple facets of vascular plant diversity (functional, phylogenetic
   and taxonomic diversity) are shaped by island geomorphology, modern and
   historic area, and habitat heterogeneity. In line with our expectation,
   historical dynamics in island geomorphology affected phylogenetic and
   taxonomic diversity via habitat heterogeneity. However, island area was
   the best predictor across all facets of diversity. Specifically, larger
   islands had higher functional and phylogenetic diversity than expected
   by chance while most of the smaller islands had lower diversity. The
   influence of area on functional diversity acted via habitat
   heterogeneity, with habitat heterogeneity influencing negatively
   functional diversity. Our results suggest that larger islands accumulate
   functionally and phylogenetically unique species. Further, results for
   functional diversity pointed towards potential area-heterogeneity
   trade-offs, with these trade-offs likely resulting from increased
   interspecific competition favoring a specific set of trait values (of
   stronger competitors), particularly on smaller islands. Together, these
   results demonstrate that going beyond taxonomic diversity contributes to
   identifying underlying processes shaping diversity-area relationships.},

Title = {Functional traits and metacommunity theory reveal that habitat filtering
   and competition maintain bird diversity in a human shared landscape},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Human-shared landscapes cover much of Earth, yet their conservation
   value is contested. This controversy may persist because previous
   studies have examined species diversity, rather than the processes
   through which such diversity is maintained. For example, a site
   exhibiting high diversity may not actually bolster populations if the
   diversity is only maintained through net immigration. Recent research
   has begun to isolate the processes that maintain metacommunities and
   develop functional trait methods to identify these processes. However,
   the processes underlying bird communities remain obscure. Here, we
   leverage metacommunity theory, functional trait partitioning and a
   Bayesian multispecies abundance model to assess whether a shared
   landscape - woody perennial polyculture farms - bolsters bird diversity.
   Such farms grow multiple species of food-producing woody perennials
   together with vegetative groundcover. We surveyed birds and their in
   situ functional traits across the US Midwest in traditional agriculture,
   woody perennial polyculture, prairie and woods. We found that woody
   perennial polycultures exhibited the highest bird diversity and were the
   most preferred by many species (including threatened ones). Moreover,
   our functional trait analysis suggests that this diversity is maintained
   through habitat filtering and competition, rather than merely
   immigration. Thus, shared landscapes can likely conserve birds by
   providing a distinct habitat. These results suggest that woody perennial
   polyculture farms offer substantial potential to support bird
   populations in the US Midwest. Our study demonstrates the utility of in
   situ functional trait partitioning within a Bayesian framework to unmask
   ecological processes and help assess the conservation value of
   landscapes.},

Title = {Patterns and drivers of plant diversity across Australia},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Biodiversity analyses across continental extents are important in
   providing comprehensive information on patterns and likely drivers of
   diversity. For vascular plants in Australia, community-level diversity
   analyses have been restricted by the lack of a consistent plot-based
   survey dataset across the continent. To overcome these challenges, we
   collated and harmonised plot-based vegetation survey data from the major
   data sources across Australia and used them as the basis for modelling
   species richness (alpha-diversity) and community compositional
   dissimilarity (beta-diversity), standardised to 400 m(2), with the aim
   of mapping diversity patterns and identifying potential environmental
   drivers. The harmonised Australian vegetation plot (HAVPlot) dataset
   includes 219 552 plots, of which we used 115 083 to analyse plant
   diversity. Models of species richness and compositional dissimilarity
   both explained approximately one-third of the variation in plant
   diversity across Australia (D-2 = 33.0\% and 32.7\%, respectively). The
   strongest environmental predictors for both aspects of diversity were a
   combination of temperature and precipitation, with soil texture and
   topographic heterogeneity also important. The fine-resolution
   (approximate to 90 m) spatial predictions of species richness and
   compositional dissimilarity identify areas expected to be of particular
   importance for plant diversity, including south-western Australia,
   rainforests of eastern Australia and the Australian Alps. Arid areas of
   central and western Australia are predicted to support assemblages that
   are less speciose or unique; however, these areas are most in need of
   additional survey data to fill the spatial, environmental and taxonomic
   gaps in the HAVPlot dataset. The harmonised data and model predictions
   presented here provide new insight into plant diversity patterns across
   Australia, enabling a wide variety of future research, such as exploring
   changes in species abundances, linking compositional patterns to
   functional traits or undertaking conservation assessments for selected
   components of the flora.},

Title = {Coupling eco-evolutionary mechanisms with deep-time environmental
   dynamics to understand biodiversity patterns},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pioneer naturalists such as Whewell, Lyell, Humboldt, Darwin and Wallace
   acknowledged the interactions between ecological and evolutionary
   forces, as well as the roles of continental movement, mountain formation
   and climate variations, in shaping biodiversity patterns. Recent
   developments in computer modelling and paleo-environmental
   reconstruction have made it possible for scientists to study in silico
   how biodiversity emerges from eco-evolutionary and environmental dynamic
   processes and their interactions. Simulating emergent biodiversity
   enables the experimentation of multiple interconnected hypotheses in a
   largely fragmented scientific landscape, with the final objective of
   successfully approximating natural mechanisms (i.e. hypothetical
   spatio-temporally unrestricted generalizations that hold across multiple
   empirical biodiversity patterns). This new interdisciplinary approach
   opens unprecedented scientific pathways, facilitating the communication
   and contemplation of causal implications of complex eco-evolutionary and
   environmental interactions. In this review I provide a comprehensive
   overview of the available population-based spatially explicit
   mechanistic eco-evolutionary models (MEEMs) that rely on
   paleo-environmental reconstructions, critically discussing their
   relevance and limitations for our understanding of biodiversity. To
   achieve this, I first introduce diverse biodiversity models and
   contextualize MEEMs. Second, I define MEEMs and synthesize the major
   insights from studies using MEEMs combined with deep-time environmental
   dynamics (> 0.1 Ma). Lastly, I discuss the challenges and perspectives
   of solving long-standing biodiversity enigmas by coupling
   eco-evolutionary mechanisms with deep-time environmental dynamics.
   Studies show that linking dynamic environments and eco-evolutionary
   processes is necessary to reproduce multiple large-scale biodiversity
   patterns simultaneously. Mechanisms related to adaptations (e.g. niche
   evolution), dispersal abilities and other eco-evolutionary interactions
   (e.g. those resulting in speciation or extinction events) show universal
   importance, although their signatures across spatial and temporal scales
   remain largely unknown. Investigations with MEEMS spanning multiple
   levels of complexity in space and time foster interdisciplinary
   cooperation across the natural sciences and show promise for solving
   some of the enigmas in Earth's biodiversity.},

Title = {Life history consequences of climate change in hibernating mammals: a
   review},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climatic shifts to warmer and often drier conditions are challenging
   terrestrial species worldwide. These shifts are occurring more rapidly
   at higher elevations and latitudes, likely causing disproportionate
   effects to mammalian hibernators there. While there is some information
   about how these species' ranges are responding to climatic shifts, we
   lack an understanding of how climate components are affecting species'
   life history variation, which is key to individual success and
   population-level resilience. We reviewed the literature to identify the
   direction of life history responses to climate change in mammalian
   hibernators along three axes: latitudinal, elevational and temporal. We
   found 39 studies involving 27 species that reported climate effects on
   our four target life history traits - phenology, body mass/condition and
   growth, reproduction and survival. We found warmer temperatures are
   advancing hibernator phenology and increasing reproductive success. By
   contrast, warming and drying trends are having uncertain effects on body
   condition, and complex effects on survival - depending on season, age
   class, latitude and elevation. We found no pattern of significant
   climate-trait outcomes by duration or decade of study. More research on
   drought conditions - particularly in relation to resource availability -
   would help inform hibernator susceptibility to increased drying trends
   expected to intensify globally. Notably, our results are highly biased
   towards small mammal hibernators in Northern Hemisphere alpine/mountain
   ecosystems, with few long-term studies conducted on Southern Hemisphere
   hibernators. This review highlights that phenological shifts constitute
   one of the most obvious consequences of climate change, yet, the timing
   of life history events (e.g. timing of migration, reproduction,
   hibernation) remains poorly understood. Further integration of insights
   from physiologists, evolutionary biologists and population ecologists
   working on wild populations will improve our collective understanding of
   the effects of seasonal climatic shifts on mammalian hibernator life
   history traits, key drivers of their population-level persistence.},

Title = {spectre: an R package to estimate spatially-explicit community
   composition using sparse data},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An understanding of how biodiversity is distributed across space is key
   to much of ecology and conservation. Many predictive modelling
   approaches have been developed to estimate the distribution of
   biodiversity over various spatial scales. Community modelling techniques
   may offer many benefits over single species modelling. However,
   techniques capable of estimating precise species makeups of communities
   are highly data intensive and thus often limited in their applicability.
   Here we present an R package, spectre, which can predict regional
   community composition at a fine spatial resolution using only sparsely
   sampled biological data. The package can predict the presences and
   absences of all species in an area, both known and unknown, at the
   sample site scale. Underlying the spectre package is a min-conflicts
   optimisation algorithm that predicts species' presences and absences
   throughout an area using estimates of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity.
   We demonstrate the utility of the spectre package using a
   spatially-explicit simulated ecosystem to assess the accuracy of the
   package's results. spectre offers a simple to use tool with which to
   accurately predict community compositions across varying scales,
   facilitating further research and knowledge acquisition into this
   fundamental aspect of ecology.},

Title = {European mushroom assemblages are phylogenetically structured by
   temperature},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent global warming affects species compositions at an unprecedented
   rate. To predict climate-induced changes in species assemblages, a
   better understanding of the link between species occurrence and climate
   is needed. Macrofungal fruit body assemblages are correlated with the
   thermal environment at the European scale. However, it is still unknown
   whether macrofungal communities are also phylogenetically structured by
   thermal environments. Thermal environments are characterized by annual
   temperature means but also by intra-annual temperature variability
   (hereafter termed temperature seasonality), which are both considered in
   this study. Here, we used distribution data of 2882 species based on
   fruit body records across Europe to address two main questions: 1) are
   mushroom assemblages at the extremes of the mean (warm and cold) and
   seasonal (high intra-annual variability, i.e. continental) climate
   gradient phylogenetically more similar than expected (phylogenetic alpha
   diversity); 2) are mushroom assemblages, that are subject to different
   mean and seasonal temperature conditions, composed of different lineages
   (phylogenetic beta diversity). Our phylogenetic alpha diversity analysis
   shows that mushroom assemblages are phylogenetically structured by warm
   and cold environments, indicating that phylogenetically related species
   with similar traits thrive under more extreme conditions. In contrast,
   assemblages are phylogenetically more dissimilar (overdispersed) in
   temperature seasonal environments, indicating limiting similarity.
   Phylogenetic beta diversity was significantly correlated with mean and
   seasonal temperature differences, a response mainly driven by a few
   genera. Our results show that macrofungal assemblages are
   phylogenetically structured by temperature across Europe, suggesting
   phylogenetically constrained specialization towards temperature
   extremes. Predicted anthropogenic warming is likely to affect species
   composition and phylogenetic diversity with additional consequences for
   the carbon- and nutrient cycles.},

Title = {Spatial confounding in Bayesian species distribution modeling},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1) Species distribution models (SDMs) are currently the main tools to
   derive species niche estimates and spatially explicit predictions for
   species geographical distribution. However, unobserved environmental
   conditions and ecological processes may confound the model estimates if
   they have direct impact on the species and, at the same time, they are
   correlated with the observed environmental covariates. This, so-called
   spatial confounding, is a general property of spatial models and it has
   not been studied in the context of SDMs before. 2) We examine how the
   estimation accuracy of SDMs depends on the type of spatial confounding.
   We construct two simulation studies where we alter spatial structures of
   the observed and unobserved covariates and the level of dependence
   between them. We fit generalized linear models with and without spatial
   random effects applying Bayesian inference and recording the bias
   induced to model estimates by spatial confounding. After this we examine
   spatial confounding also with real vegetation data from northern Norway.
   3) Our results show that model estimates for coarse scale covariates,
   such as climate covariates, are likely to be biased if a species
   distribution depends also on an unobserved covariate operating on a
   finer spatial scale. Pushing higher probability for a relatively weak
   and smoothly varying spatial random effect compared to the observed
   covariates improved the model's estimation accuracy. The improvement was
   independent of the actual spatial structure of the unobserved covariate.
   4) Our study addresses the major factors of spatial confounding in SDMs
   and provides a list of recommendations for pre-inference assessment of
   spatial confounding and for inference-based methods to decrease the
   chance of biased model estimates.},

Title = {Herbarium specimens provide reliable estimates of phenological responses
   to climate at unparalleled taxonomic and spatiotemporal scales},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Understanding the effects of climate change on the phenological
   structure of plant communities will require measuring variation in
   sensitivity among thousands of co-occurring species across regions.
   Herbarium collections provide vast resources with which to do this, but
   may also exhibit biases as sources of phenological data. Despite general
   recognition of these caveats, validation of herbarium-based estimates of
   phenological sensitivity against estimates obtained using field
   observations remains rare and limited in scope. Here, we leveraged
   extensive datasets of herbarium specimens and of field observations from
   the USA National Phenology Network for 21 species in the United States
   and, for each species, compared herbarium- and field-based estimates of
   peak flowering dates expected under standardized temperature conditions,
   and of sensitivity of peak flowering time to geographic and interannual
   variation in mean minimum temperatures (TMIN). We found strong agreement
   between herbarium- and field-based estimates for standardized peak
   flowering time (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) and for the direction and magnitude
   of sensitivity to both geographic TMIN variation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001)
   and interannual TMIN variation (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). This agreement was
   robust to substantial differences between datasets in 1) the long-term
   TMIN conditions observed among collection and phenological monitoring
   sites and 2) the interannual TMIN conditions observed in the time
   periods encompassed by both datasets for most species. Our results show
   that herbarium-based sensitivity estimates are reliable among species
   spanning a wide diversity of life histories and biomes, demonstrating
   their utility in a broad range of ecological contexts, and underscoring
   the potential of herbarium collections to enable phenoclimatic analysis
   at taxonomic and spatiotemporal scales not yet captured by observational
   data.},

Abstract = {Curated databases of species interactions are instrumental to exploring
   and understanding the spatial distribution of species and their biotic
   interactions. In the process of conducting such projects, data
   development and curation efforts may give rise to a data product with
   utility beyond the scope of the original work, but which becomes
   inaccessible over time. Data describing insect host-pathogen
   interactions are fairly rare, and should thus be preserved and curated
   with appropriate metadata. Here, we introduce the insectDisease R
   package, a mechanism for curating, updating and distributing data from
   the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens, a database of
   insect host-pathogen associations, including attempted inoculations and
   infection outcomes for insect hosts and pathogens (bacteria, fungi,
   nematodes, protozoans and viruses). This dataset has been utilized for
   several projects since its inception, but without a well-defined,
   curated and permanent repository, its existence and access have been
   limited to word-of-mouth connections. The current effort presented here
   aims to provide a means to preserve, augment and disseminate the
   database in a documented and versioned format. This project is an
   example of the type of effort that will be necessary to maintain
   valuable databases after the original funding disappears.},

Title = {Changes in the climate suitability and growth rates of trees in eastern
   North America},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {According to the `fitness-suitability' hypothesis, ongoing changes in
   climate are expected to affect habitat suitability and hence species'
   fitness. In trees, differences in fitness may manifest as changes in
   growth rates, which will alter carbon uptake. Using tree-ring data, we
   calculated > 1.5 million annual stem growth rate estimates (standardized
   for tree size) for 15 677 trees representing 37 species from 558
   populations throughout eastern North America. We used collections data
   and species distribution models to estimate each population's climatic
   suitability from 1900 to 2010. We then assessed the relationships
   between growth, suitability and time using linear mixed-effects models.
   We found that stem growth rates decreased significantly through time
   independent of changes in climate suitability and that relationships
   between growth rates and climate suitability were highly variable across
   species. Contrary to expectations, we found that growth rates were
   negatively correlated with species' climate suitability, a relationship
   that was consistent over time for gymnosperms and became more negative
   through time for angiosperms. These results may suggest that stem growth
   rates are not a good proxy for fitness and/or that unidentified factors
   may be slowing tree growth and outweighing any potential benefits of
   climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Regardless
   of the cause, this finding indicates that we should not count on the
   increased growth of eastern North American trees to help offset
   anthropogenic carbon emissions.},

Title = {Advancing statistical models to reveal the effect of dissolved oxygen on
   the spatial distribution of marine taxa using thresholds and a
   physiologically based index},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The rapid pace of ocean change has prompted a need to forecast likely
   future species distributions. Species distribution models are often
   categorized as either correlative (statistical) or mechanistic, and each
   has limitations both for advancing understanding and for prediction.
   Here we sought to benefit from mechanistic understanding of how and why
   low dissolved oxygen affects species' distributions by applying
   physiologically informed statistical models to the spatial distribution
   of sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, a deep-dwelling commercially important
   groundfish. We fit spatial models to trawl-survey data on catch rate,
   local temperature and dissolved oxygen, and estimated parameters of the
   metabolic index, which provided a way to express the
   temperature-dependence of oxygen tolerance. We fit generalized linear
   mixed effects models with Gaussian random fields to capture the latent
   spatially fixed variables, and included both linear and breakpoint
   functions for pO(2) and the metabolic index. The best fitting models all
   included breakpoint effects of pO(2), and the estimated threshold value
   of 0.05 atm is close to levels in laboratory studies where metabolism
   begins to decline. Models based on the metabolic index were not as well
   supported as those that included pO(2), likely because of the decrease
   in temperature and slight increase in pO(2) at deep (> 800 m) depths.
   These findings illustrate that statistical models of species
   distributions can be improved by incorporating knowledge of how
   physiological mechanisms operate. Furthermore, they illustrate that even
   species with high tolerance for low dissolved oxygen may undergo species
   distribution shifts in the face of growing oxygen depletion in coastal
   ocean ecosystems.},

Title = {Plant species richness on the Tibetan Plateau: patterns and determinants},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Whether current hypotheses for geographic patterns of species richness
   (SR) have a strong explanatory power for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with
   extreme climatic conditions remains unclear. In comparison with the
   classic `water-energy dynamics hypothesis', the unique climate factors
   (e.g. extreme low temperature and low oxygen partial pressure) on the TP
   likely significantly affect the spatial variation of SR. Here, we
   investigate geographic patterns and determinants of SR on the TP through
   a systematic field investigation. We systematically analyzed a total of
   2013 plant communities covering 11 different vegetation types on the TP.
   To compare this SR with that of other sites across the globe, we
   compiled a global database containing information on 87 forest and 3660
   grassland plots. The SR per 400 m(2) in the forests and shrubs and that
   per 1 m(2) in alpine grasslands and deserts was 62.76 (+/- 1.80 SE),
   44.53 (+/- 7.57 SE), 16.84 (+/- 0.39 SE) and 3.62 (+/- 0.55 SE),
   respectively. The SR of forests and shrubs decreased with latitude and
   altitude, whereas that of alpine grasslands and deserts showed a
   unimodal pattern along the altitudinal gradient. Unique climate factors,
   such as extreme low temperature, mean diurnal temperature and oxygen
   partial pressure, act synergistically with water-energy dynamics and
   influence the spatial pattern of SR on the TP. Furthermore, the tree SR
   on the TP was lower than that of global tropical and subtropical
   broadleaf forests but higher than that of temperate conifer forests.
   Alpine meadows had a higher SR than other sites; however, the SR in
   alpine desert grasslands and alpine deserts was lower. Our findings
   provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the spatial
   variation in plant diversity, especially on plateaus and in
   high-latitude regions. Our findings and the SR map with 1 km resolution
   provide important benchmarks for biodiversity conservation and may help
   to improve predictions of the effect of climate change on biodiversity.},

Title = {Disturbance-driven alteration of patch connectivity determines local
   biodiversity recovery within metacommunities},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the capacity of ecological systems to withstand and
   recover from disturbances is a major challenge for ecological research
   in the context of environmental changes. Past research has mostly
   focused on the local effects of disturbances on biodiversity recovery,
   while alterations of inter-patch connectivity induced by disturbances
   have received comparatively less attention. Here, we investigated the
   effect of disturbances on local biodiversity recovery within
   metacommunities. Our specific focus was on drying river networks, which
   are characterised by a high variability of patch connectivity. We found
   marked variations of local biodiversity recovery among sites and among
   groups of organisms with contrasting dispersal modes, which were
   explained by the amount of patch connectivity loss due to drying events.
   Local communities of flying organisms recovered more efficiently from
   drying events than organisms with strictly aquatic dispersal due to the
   capacity of the former group to overcome hydrological connectivity loss.
   As a general rule, loss of patch connectivity decreases community
   recovery, regardless of patch location in the river network, dispersal
   mode or drying spatial extent. The relationship between patch
   connectivity loss and community recovery we found in river networks is
   general and applicable to any spatial network with a high variability of
   patch connectivity.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {The Southern Ocean is showing one of the most rapid responses to
   human-induced global change, thus acting as a sentinel of the effects on
   marine species and ecosystems. Ocean warming and acidification are
   already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the
   magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely
   unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to
   date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and
   important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for
   monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve
   our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and
   acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns
   of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with
   temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new
   mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that
   the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase
   significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater
   temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that
   seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in
   bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale.},

Title = {Seasonality modulates habitat cover effects on avian cross-boundary
   responses and spillover},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Species cross-boundary response is a key mechanism affecting species
   spillover into agricultural fields. However, temporal changes in edge
   permeability, which may depend on the seasonal availability of resources
   in both matrix and native habitats, remain poorly understood. Here we
   tested how edge crossing behavior and the associated spillover of birds
   into sun coffee plantations respond to landscape structure and
   seasonality. We monitored the movement of six insectivorous understory
   bird species (four forest specialists and two forest generalists) using
   an automated telemetry system along a gradient of forest cover (7-60\%)
   during two seasons (dry versus wet) at nine sampling sites at the
   Brazilian Atlantic forest. We monitored 116 individuals and obtained a
   total of 15 129 bird detections across seasons. Bird resistance to
   crossing edges was strongly driven by an interaction between seasonality
   and forest cover in the surrounding landscape, with higher resistance to
   crossing edges along the dry season and in landscapes with lower amount
   of forest cover. Furthermore, spillover patterns in plantations were
   driven by an interaction between forest cover and distance from forest
   edges, but this was most pronounced for forest-specialist bird species.
   Forest specialists moved more intensively and farther from edges in more
   forested landscapes, whereas forest generalists showed similar patterns
   of occupation regardless of forest cover and isolation. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of avian cross-boundary responses
   and spillover in response to landscape structure across seasons, and the
   factors driving bird movement decisions in anthropogenic landscapes.
   There are a myriad of possible mechanisms governing movement decisions,
   and these mechanisms may interact in complex ways and remain important
   foci for research within the fields of tropical ecology and evolution.},

Title = {Using citizen science to parse climatic and land cover influences on
   bird occupancy in a tropical biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Disentangling associations between species occupancy and its
   environmental drivers -- climate and land cover -- along tropical
   mountains is imperative to predict species distributional changes in the
   future. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying such
   associations in temperate mountain systems. Using 1.29 million robustly
   processed citizen science observations contributed to eBird between 2013
   and 2021, we examined the role of climatic and landscape variables and
   its association with bird species occurrence within a tropical
   biodiversity hotspot, the southern Western Ghats in India. Using an
   occupancy modeling framework, we found that temperature seasonality,
   precipitation seasonality, and the proportion of evergreen forests were
   significantly associated with species-specific probabilities of
   occupancy for 78\% (n=43 birds), 38\% (n=21 birds), and 27\% (n=15
   birds) of bird species examined, respectively. Our study shows that
   several forest birds (n=18 species) were negatively associated with
   temperature seasonality, highlighting narrow thermal niches for such
   species. The probability of occupancy of six forest species and eight
   generalist species was positively associated with precipitation
   seasonality, indicating potential associations between rainfall and
   resource availability, and thereby, species occurrence. A smaller number
   of largely generalist species (n=9 birds) were positively associated
   with human-modified land cover types -- including the proportion of
   agriculture/settlements and plantations. Our study shows that rigorously
   filtered citizen science observations can be used to identify
   associations between environmental drivers and species occupancy on
   tropical mountains. Though current distributions of tropical montane
   birds of the Western Ghats are strongly associated with climatic factors
   (mainly, temperature seasonality), naturally occurring land cover types
   (forests) are critical to sustaining montane avifauna across
   human-modified landscapes in the long run.},

Title = {The environmental drivers of tree cover and forest-savanna mosaics in
   Southeast Asia},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Forest-savanna mosaics exist across all major tropical regions. Yet, the
   influence of environmental factors on the distribution of these mosaics
   is not well explored, limiting our understanding of the environmental
   constraints on savannas especially in Southeast Asia, where most
   savannas exist in mosaics. Despite clear structural and functional
   characteristics indicative of savannas, most SE Asian savannas continue
   to be classified as forest. This designation is problematic because SE
   Asian savannas are threatened by both fragmentation and forest-centric
   management practices. By studying forest-savanna mosaics across SE Asia,
   we aimed to parse out how landscape mosaics of forest and savanna may be
   constrained by fire, climate and soil characteristics. We used remotely
   sensed data to characterize the distribution of tree cover and
   forest-savanna mosaics. Using regression models, we quantified the
   relative effects of precipitation, fire frequency, seasonality and soil
   characteristics on average tree cover and landscape patchiness. We found
   that low tree cover, indicative of savannas, occurs in drier, seasonal
   subregions that experience frequent fire. Further, our results
   demonstrate that fire and precipitation strongly shape landscape
   patchiness. Landscapes were patchiest in subregions with low
   precipitation and intermediate fire frequency. These results demonstrate
   that the environmental factors important in delineating the distribution
   of savannas globally shape the distribution of tree cover and landscape
   patchiness across SE Asia. Fire especially drives patterns of tree cover
   across scales. In a region where fire suppression is a common management
   strategy, our results suggest that further research studying vegetation
   response to fire and fire suppression is needed to improve management
   and conservation of these mosaic landscapes. More broadly, this work
   demonstrates a useful approach for studying the environmental drivers
   that influence the distribution of forest-savanna mosaics.},

Abstract = {The interactive effects of multiple threats are one of the main causes
   of biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of what predisposes species
   to be impacted by multiple threats remains limited. Here we analyse a
   global dataset of over 7000 marine, freshwater and terrestrial
   vertebrate populations, alongside trait, threat and geographical data,
   to identify the factors influencing the number of threats a species is
   subjected to at the population level. Out of a suite of predictors
   tested, we find that body mass and latitude both are broadly available
   for vertebrate species and influence the number of threats a population
   is subjected to. Larger-bodied species and those nearer the equator are
   typically affected by a higher number of threats. However, whilst this
   pattern broadly holds across ecosystems for most taxa, amphibians and
   reptiles show opposing trends. We suggest that latitude and body mass
   should be considered as key predictors to identify which vertebrate
   populations are likely to be impacted by multiple threats. These general
   predictors can help to better understand the impacts of the Anthropocene
   on global vertebrate biodiversity and design effective conservation
   policies.},

Title = {Choice of prioritization method impacts recommendations for
   climate-informed bird conservation in the United States},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate-informed spatial planning is urgently needed to guide
   initiatives aimed at both conserving biodiversity as a whole (e.g.
   protection of 30\% of lands and waters by 2030) and recovering North
   American avifauna in particular. Various methods for prioritizing
   conservation areas exist, yet alternative methods may direct managers to
   different lands for protection, and thus varying recommendations for
   meeting area-based targets. Here, we used bird species distribution
   models and landcover projections to systematically evaluate two widely
   used methods for prioritizing areas most likely to facilitate the
   persistence of multiple species under climate change: 1) in situ
   macrorefugia, identified as areas of high predicted species retention;
   and 2) complementarity-based optimizations, identified using the
   Zonation conservation planning software. For 17 biogeographical groups
   in the continental United States, we compared priority areas for bird
   conservation derived from these two alternatives with respect to their
   spatial distributions and consensus (i.e. overlap), expected
   conservation outcomes (e.g. species and functional diversity), predicted
   climate change exposure, habitat characteristics, landscape
   configurations and degree of formal protection. Spatial distributions of
   priority areas differed by biogeographical group and method, with 40.5\%
   consensus on average across groups. Consensus was extensive within
   mountainous and coastal regions, and limited at high latitudes (e.g.
   Alaska) and in flat, interior regions (e.g. grasslands). As expected,
   complementarity-based optimizations more efficiently represented species
   than retention-based in situ macrorefugia, especially for forest groups,
   and had greater overall biodiversity value and better habitat condition.
   Conversely, in situ macrorefugia encompassed higher elevations and
   larger contiguous patches and were expected to experience less
   winter-season warming. Formal protection averaged < 50\% across
   biogeographical groups, regardless of prioritization method. Our
   findings illustrate the value of complementarity-based optimizations for
   bird conservation under climate change. More broadly, comparing
   approaches for prioritizing areas for long-term species persistence can
   reveal critical trade-offs in recommendations for climate-informed
   protected area planning.},

Title = {Shifting fish distributions impact predation intensity in a sub-Arctic
   ecosystem},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An abundance of studies in marine systems have documented species range
   shifts in response to climate change, and many more have used species
   distribution models to project species ranges under future conditions.
   However, there is increasing interest in moving beyond a single-species
   focus to understand how species redistribution alters ecosystem dynamics
   via changes in trophic interactions. We employed spatiotemporal models
   to characterize decadal-scale changes in spatial overlap between the
   distribution of juvenile walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and the
   distributions of four of its groundfish predators: arrowtooth flounder
   Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Pacific halibut
   Hippoglossus stenolepis and adult walleye pollock. These fishes
   represent ecologically and commercially important species in a rapidly
   changing sub-Arctic ecosystem, the eastern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We
   then examined whether changes in spatial overlap corresponded to changes
   in predation, using spatiotemporal models of predator stomach contents.
   We found marked shifts in spatial overlap between juvenile pollock and
   two predators (arrowtooth flounder and Pacific halibut) over 34 years,
   with changes in overlap corresponding to increases in population-scale
   predation pressure. By contrast, we did not find clear relationships
   between spatial overlap and predation for Pacific cod and adult pollock,
   the two predators for which juvenile pollock constitute a much smaller
   diet proportion. Our findings highlight the complexity of predicting
   predation dynamics for generalist marine species and suggest a need for
   better process-based methods for understanding the potential future
   ecological impacts of coupled species range shifts. However, simple
   metrics of spatial overlap between relatively specialized predators and
   their prey offer promise as a means to integrate predictions from
   species distribution models into ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of vegetation fires is essential for
   understanding changes in the climate and ecosystem in mountainous

   burned by vegetation fires declined globally from over 4.27 million
   km(2) to less than 3.52 million km(2) annually during 2001-2021. In
   contrast, global high mountains higher than 3000 m have experienced an
   overall increase in their burned area and suffered record-breaking
   wildfires from August to December 2020. Although high mountains
   accounted for less than 0.03\% of the global burned area during
   2001-2021, this proportion had more than tripled by 2020. This
   unprecedented wildfire record in 2020 could be mainly caused by
   favorable fire weather conditions such as low relative humidity, low
   soil water and high temperature.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic degradation and climate change on
   global carbon cycling is hindered by a lack of clear, flexible and
   easy-to-use productivity models along with scarce trait and productivity
   data for parameterizing and testing those models. We provide a simple
   solution: a mechanistic framework (RS-CFM) that combines remotely-sensed
   foliar-trait and canopy-structural data with trait-based metabolic
   theory to efficiently map productivity at large spatial scales. We test
   this framework by quantifying net primary productivity (NPP) at
   high-resolution (0.01-ha) in hyper-diverse Peruvian tropical forests
   (30040 hectares) along a 3322-m elevation gradient. Our analysis
   captures hotspots and elevational shifts in productivity more accurately
   and in greater detail than alternative empirical- and process-based
   models that use plant functional types. This result exposes how
   high-resolution, location-specific variation in traits and light
   competition drive variability in productivity, opening up possibilities
   to fully harness remote sensing data and reliably scale up from traits
   to map global productivity in a more direct, efficient and
   cost-effective manner.},

Title = {Uncertainty matters: ascertaining where specimens in natural history
   collections come from and its implications for predicting species
   distributions},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Natural history collections (NHCs) represent an enormous and largely
   untapped wealth of information on the Earth's biota, made available
   through GBIF as digital preserved specimen records. Precise knowledge of
   where the specimens were collected is paramount to rigorous ecological
   studies, especially in the field of species distribution modelling.
   Here, we present a first comprehensive analysis of georeferencing
   quality for all preserved specimen records served by GBIF, and
   illustrate the impact that coordinate uncertainty may have on predicted
   potential distributions. We used all GBIF preserved specimen records to
   analyse the availability of coordinates and associated spatial
   uncertainty across geography, spatial resolution, taxonomy, publishing
   institutions and collection time. We used three plant species across
   their native ranges in different parts of the world to show the impact
   of uncertainty on predicted potential distributions. We found that 38\%
   of the 180+ million records provide coordinates only and 18\%
   coordinates and uncertainty. Georeferencing quality is determined more
   by country of collection and publishing than by taxonomic group.
   Distinct georeferencing practices are more determinant than implicit
   characteristics and georeferencing difficulty of specimens. Availability
   and quality of records contrasts across world regions. Uncertainty
   values are not normally distributed but peak at very distinct values,
   which can be traced back to specific regions of the world. Uncertainty
   leads to a wide spectrum of range sizes when modelling species
   distributions, potentially affecting conclusions in biogeographical and
   climate change studies. In summary, the digitised fraction of the
   world's NHCs are far from optimal in terms of georeferencing and quality
   mainly depends on where the collections are hosted. A collective effort
   between communities around NHC institutions, ecological research and
   data infrastructure is needed to bring the data on a par with its
   importance and relevance for ecological research.},

Title = {Contrasting influence of seascape, space and marine reserves on genomic
   variation in multiple species},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine reserves are being established worldwide to conserve and manage
   marine resources, and are also often assumed to conserve the
   evolutionary potential of marine populations. However, comparisons of
   genomic patterns inside and outside marine reserves in multiple species
   are scarce. Here, we aim to fill this gap by 1) comparing genomic
   variation in protected versus unprotected areas in a network of eight
   reserves in the Mediterranean Sea, and 2) disentangling the effect of
   seascape, space and marine reserves on this genomic variation in 1297
   individuals from four species genotyped at more than 10 000 SNPs each.
   We report homogeneous patterns of local genetic diversity within and
   outside reserves in three of the four species (the white seabream
   Diplodus sargus, the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus and the
   European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas). Surprisingly, the comber
   Serranus cabrilla shows lower genetic diversity in protected areas,
   highlighting an apparent conservation paradox that may be due to
   increased predation by protected fishes in the reserves. Multivariate
   analyses reveal that seascape factors (salinity, temperature and
   chlorophyll) and space exert a significant influence on genomic
   variation in some cases, while protection status has no detectable
   effect. Nevertheless, four marine reserves (Cabo de Palos,
   Cerbere-Banyuls, Cap de Creus and Illes Columbretes) harbor singular
   genetic variation in one or two species. This pattern, observed in the
   four species, suggests that reserves contribute to preserve genetic
   variation locally. Our study illustrates that we can document key
   aspects of the genetic variation of marine species and their interaction
   with seascape factors, space and protection status in multiple species.
   It stresses the need for a multi-species approach to inform marine
   conservation planning, opening up new perspectives at the community
   level.},

Title = {Temporal change in the contribution of immigration to population growth
   in a wild seabird experiencing rapid population decline},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The source-sink paradigm predicts that populations in poorer-quality
   habitats ('sinks') persist due to continued immigration from
   more-productive areas ('sources'). However, this categorisation of
   populations assumes that habitat quality is fixed through time.
   Globally, we are in an era of wide-spread habitat degradation, and
   consequently there is a pressing need to examine dispersal dynamics in
   relation to local population change. We used an integrated population
   model to quantify immigration dynamics in a long-lived colonial seabird,
   the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, that is classified as
   globally `Vulnerable'. We then used a transient life table response
   experiment to evaluate the contribution of temporal variation in vital
   rates, immigration rates and population structure to realised population
   growth. Finally, we used a simulation analysis to examine the importance
   of immigration to population dynamics. We show that the contribution of
   immigration changed as the population declined. This study demonstrates
   that immigration is unlikely to maintain vulnerable sink populations
   indefinitely, emphasising the need for temporal analyses of dispersal to
   identify shifts that may have dramatic consequences for population
   viability.},

Title = {Huge spring migrations of insects from the Middle East to Europe:
   quantifying the migratory assemblage and ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Migratory insects are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems, but
   understanding their full contribution is challenging as they are
   difficult to track, and migration often takes place at high altitude.
   Migration hotspots offer an exceptional opportunity to study these
   otherwise indiscernible movements as migration can be visible at ground
   level; however these events are often also ephemeral and reported only
   from chance encounters. It is therefore often difficult to fully
   characterise the range and number of species involved, the drivers of
   migration or to appreciate the potential interactions and ecological
   roles of the migrants. Here we pursue field evidence suggesting that the
   Karpaz peninsula in northeast Cyprus is a suitable location to
   systematically collect data on migratory insects. In the spring of 2019,
   using a combination of timed-counts, migration-camera traps and netting
   we documented over 39 million day-flying insects from eight orders
   arriving on Cyprus at rates of up to 5900 insects m(-1) min(-1). Mass
   arrivals were correlated with higher temperatures and easterly winds.
   Wind direction and normalised vegetation difference index (NDVI) data
   suggest that these insects had their natal origins in locations
   including Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. It is estimated that many
   billions of insects left the coast of the Middle East heading west into
   Europe during the study period. While the migrant assemblage was
   diverse, Diptera were by far the most numerous insect order (86\%)
   followed by Lepidoptera (10\%). These migrating insects play a range of
   vital ecological roles including cross-continental pollination and the
   transfer of important nutrients. We believe that the very infrequently
   explored processes described in this manuscript have important
   consequences for ecosystems in the destinations of these migratory
   insects across Europe.},

Title = {Neutral processes related to regional bee commonness and dispersal

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding how niche-based and neutral processes contribute to the
   spatial variation in plant-pollinator interactions is central to
   designing effective pollination conservation schemes. Such schemes are
   needed to reverse declines of wild bees and other pollinating insects,
   and to promote pollination services to wild and cultivated plants. We
   used data on wild bee interactions with plants belonging to the four
   tribes Loteae, Trifolieae, Anthemideae and either spring- or
   summer-flowering Cichorieae, sampled systematically along a 682 km
   latitudinal gradient to build models that allowed us to 1) predict
   occurrences of pairwise bee-flower interactions across 115 sampling
   locations, and 2) estimate the contribution of variables hypothesized to
   be related to niche-based assembly structuring processes (viz. annual
   mean temperature, landscape diversity, bee sociality, bee phenology and
   flower preferences of bees) and neutral processes (viz. regional
   commonness and dispersal distance to conspecifics). While neutral
   processes were important predictors of plant-pollinator distributions,
   niche-based processes were reflected in the contrasting distributions of
   solitary bee and bumble bees along the temperature gradient, and in the
   influence of bee flower preferences on the distribution of bee species
   across plant types. In particular, bee flower preferences separated bees
   into three main groups, albeit with some overlap: visitors to
   spring-flowering Cichorieae; visitors to Anthemideae and
   summer-flowering Cichorieae; and visitors to Trifolieae and Loteae. Our
   findings suggest that both neutral and niche-based processes are
   significant contributors to the spatial distribution of plant-pollinator
   interactions so that conservation actions in our region should be
   directed towards areas: near high concentrations of known occurrences of
   regionally rare bees; in mild climatic conditions; and that are
   surrounded by heterogenous landscapes. Given the observed niche-based
   differences, the proportion of functionally distinct plants in
   flower-mixes could be chosen to target bee species, or guilds, of
   conservation concern.},

Abstract = {Managing over-abundant nuisance species in anthropogenic environments
   typically depends on the removal of individuals, even though theoretical
   and empirical studies suggest that limiting environmental resources can
   be more effective. However, quantifying resources to be manipulated in
   order to achieve a desired reduction in target species can be difficult,
   which complicates cost estimation for a given management target. We
   present CEAMEC 1.0 (cost-effective animal management via environmental
   capacity), a `Shiny' application in the HTML user interface (available
   at <>) programmed in the R language, as a tool to provide managers with
   optimal management strategies based on cost estimates of manipulating
   different environmental resources. Based on user-defined targets and
   periods of management, CEAMEC calculates an optimal combination and
   quantity of different resources to be manipulated at the lowest cost to
   achieve a desired reduction level of a target population. CEAMEC
   provides stakeholders with a user-friendly decision support tool for
   integrated management plans targeting nuisance species in man-made
   environments.},

Abstract = {Species with broader niches may have the opportunity to occupy larger
   geographic areas, assuming no limitations on dispersal and a relatively
   homogeneous environmental space. Here, we use data on a large set of
   mammal (n = 1225), bird (n = 1829) and tree (n = 341) species to examine
   the 1) relationship between geographic range size and climatic niche
   area, 2) influence of species traits on species departures from this
   relationship and 3) sensitivity of these relationships to how species
   range size and climatic niche area are estimated. We find positive
   geographic range size-climatic niche area relationships for all taxa,
   with residual variation dependent on latitude, and differing from a null
   model for mammals and birds, but not for trees. Together, we provide
   support for this general macroecological relationship which is dependent
   on space, weakly influenced by species traits, and different enough from
   a null model to suggest that geographic and demographic processes are
   important.},

Title = {A large-scale assessment of ant diversity across the Brazilian Amazon
   Basin: integrating geographic, ecological and morphological drivers of
   sampling bias},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {Tropical ecosystems are often biodiversity hotspots, and invertebrates
   represent the main underrepresented component of diversity in
   large-scale analyses. This problem is partly related to the scarcity of
   data widely available to conduct these studies and the lack of
   systematic organization of knowledge about invertebrates' distributions
   in biodiversity hotspots. Here, we introduce and analyze a comprehensive
   data compilation of Amazonian ant diversity. Using records from 1817 to
   2020 from both published and unpublished sources, we describe the
   diversity and distribution of ant species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin.
   Further, using high-definition images and data from taxonomic
   publications, we build a comprehensive database of morphological traits
   for the ant species that occur in the region. In total, we recorded 1067
   nominal species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, with sampling locations
   strongly biased by access routes, urban centers, research institutions
   and major infrastructure projects. Large areas where ant sampling is
   non-existent represent about 52\% of the basin and are concentrated
   mainly in the northern, southeastern and western Brazilian Amazon. We
   found that distance to roads is the main driver of ant sampling in the
   Amazon. Contrary to our expectations, morphological traits had lower
   predictive power in predicting sampling bias than purely geographic
   variables. However, when geographic predictors were controlled, habitat
   stratum and traits contribute to explain the remaining variance. More
   species were recorded in better-sampled areas, but species richness
   estimation models suggest that areas in southern Amazonian edge forests
   are associated with especially high species richness. Our results
   represent the first trait-based, large-scale study for insects in
   Amazonian forests and a starting point for macroecological studies
   focusing on insect diversity in the Amazon Basin.},

Abstract = {Much of Antarctica's highly endemic terrestrial biodiversity is found in
   small ice-free patches. Substantial genetic differentiation has been
   detected among populations across spatial scales. Sampling is, however,
   often restricted to commonly-accessed sites and we therefore lack a
   comprehensive understanding of broad-scale biogeographic patterns, which
   could impede forecasts of the nature and impacts of future change. Here,
   we present a synthesis of published genetic studies across terrestrial
   Antarctica and the broader Antarctic region, aiming to identify current
   biogeographic patterns, environmental drivers of diversity and future
   research priorities. A database of all published genetic research from
   terrestrial fauna and flora (excl. microbes) across the Antarctic region
   was constructed. This database was then filtered to focus on the most
   well-represented taxa and markers (mitochondrial COI for fauna, and
   nuclear ITS for flora). The final dataset comprised 7222 records,
   spanning 153 studies of 335 different species. There was strong
   taxonomic bias towards flowering plants (52\% of all floral data sets)
   and springtails (54\% of all faunal data sets), and geographic bias
   towards the Antarctic Peninsula and Victoria Land. Recent connectivity
   between the Antarctic continent and neighbouring landmasses, such as
   South America and the Southern Ocean Islands (SOIs), was inferred for
   some groups, but patterns observed for most taxa were strongly
   influenced by sampling biases. Above-ground wind speed and habitat
   heterogeneity were positively correlated with genetic diversity indices
   overall though environment was a generally poor predictor of genetic
   diversity. The low resolution and variable coverage of data may also
   have reduced the power of our comparative inferences. In the future,
   higher-resolution data, such as genomic SNPs and environmental
   modelling, alongside targeting sampling of remote sites and under
   sampled taxa, will address current knowledge gaps and greatly advance
   our understanding of evolutionary processes across the Antarctic region.},

Title = {Modelling seasonal dynamics of secondary growth in R},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The monitoring of seasonal radial growth of woody plants addresses the
   ultimate question of when, how and why trees grow. Assessing the growth
   dynamics is important to quantify the effect of environmental drivers
   and understand how woody species will deal with the ongoing climatic
   changes. One of the crucial steps in the analyses of seasonal radial
   growth is to model the dynamics of xylem and phloem formation based on
   increment measurements on samples taken at relatively short intervals
   during the growing season. The most common approach is the use of the
   Gompertz equation, while other approaches, such as general additive
   models (GAMs) and generalised linear models (GLMs), have also been
   tested in recent years. For the first time, we explored artificial
   neural networks with Bayesian regularisation algorithm (BRNNs) and show
   that this method is easy to use, resistant to overfitting, tends to
   yield s-shaped curves and is therefore suitable for deriving temporal
   dynamics of secondary tree growth. We propose two data processing
   algorithms that allow more flexible fits. The main result of our work is
   the XPSgrowth() function implemented in the radial Tree Growth (rTG) R
   package, that can be used to evaluate and compare three modelling
   approaches: BRNN, GAM and the Gompertz function. The newly developed
   function, tested on intra-seasonal xylem and phloem formation data, has
   potential applications in many ecological and environmental disciplines
   where growth is expressed as a function of time. Different approaches
   were evaluated in terms of prediction error, while fitted curves were
   visually compared to derive their main characteristics. Our results
   suggest that there is no single best fitting method, therefore we
   recommend testing different fitting methods and selection of the optimal
   one.},

Title = {Magnitude-duration relationships of physiological sensitivity and
   environmental exposure improve climate change vulnerability assessments},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Integrating thermal physiology with environmental temperature is
   essential to understanding distributions of species and vulnerability to
   climate change. Warming tolerance - the difference between an organism's
   maximum thermal tolerance (T-max) and maximum habitat temperature
   (T-hab) - is frequently used to integrate organismal sensitivity and
   environmental exposure. Traditionally, applications of warming tolerance
   define T-max and T-hab as invariable magnitudes, yet tolerance magnitude
   depends on exposure duration, and diel temperature cycles expose
   organisms to a range of temperature magnitudes and durations. How
   traditional (i.e. acute) estimates of warming tolerance compare to
   estimates from prolonged exposures remains poorly understood. In this
   study, magnitude-duration curves for tolerances of one cold-water, two
   cool-water and one warm-water species of freshwater fish were compiled
   from the literature and compared to magnitude-duration exposures from 66
   streams across the eastern United States. Warming tolerances were
   estimated for exposure durations spanning 0.01-24 h. Current acute (0.01
   h) warming tolerances ranged from median 6.30 degrees C for the
   cold-water species to 9.68 degrees C for the warm-water species. The
   lowest warming tolerances corresponded to prolonged exposures lasting
   median 3.85-5.30 h among species and were 2.51-4.38 degrees C lower than
   acute estimates. Although acute estimates remained positive in
   historically occupied and unoccupied streams (6.30 versus 2.33 degrees
   C), estimates based on prolonged exposure were positive at occupied
   streams of the cold-water species but transitioned to negative in
   unoccupied streams (2.19 versus -1.12 degrees C). Acute warming
   tolerances for the cold-water species also remained positive under
   future climate (6.29-4.23 degrees C) but approached zero at prolonged
   durations (2.19-0.09 degrees C) and transitioned to negative for 47.2\%
   of streams. Results demonstrate that acute measures of T-max and T-hab
   overestimate warming tolerances and therefore underestimate climate
   change vulnerability. Integrating magnitude-duration relationships into
   warming tolerance estimates can elucidate physiological mechanisms
   underlying species distributions and can improve accuracy of climate
   change vulnerability assessments.},

Title = {Origin of the central European steppe flora: insights from
   palaeodistribution modelling and migration simulations},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The biogeographic origin of the species-rich steppe grasslands in
   central Europe has long been debated. The alternative hypotheses are
   long-term species persistence in situ versus immigration from the
   south-east, either after the last glacial maximum (LGM) or after the
   Neolithic landscape deforestation. We ask whether macroclimate-based
   models of habitat suitability support either of these hypotheses and
   search for macroclimatically suitable `source areas' from which species
   could colonise the areas occupied in Europe today. We modelled habitat
   suitability for 104 species of the central European steppes and
   projected these models to 10 periods between the LGM and the present
   using downscaled CCSM3 simulations. By simulating postglacial migration,
   we identified potential source areas for each species in the LGM and
   mid-Holocene and examined whether their location differed among three
   ecological and five chorological species groups. The central European
   macroclimate during the cold phases of the Late Pleistocene was suitable
   for species now typical of Asian desert steppes, whereas the warmer
   Bolling-Allerod and Holocene macroclimates supported the occurrence of
   present-day central European steppe flora. The models suggest that the
   LGM source areas of these species ranged from south-eastern France
   through the Adriatic region and the Balkan Peninsula to the Black-Sea
   region but extended to central Europe in the mid-Holocene. Their
   locations differed considerably among ecological and chorological groups
   in both periods. Therefore, our models support the hypothesis that
   during the Pleistocene cold periods, the largest populations of these
   species occurred in southern and south-eastern Europe and some of them
   may have later colonised central Europe. If some populations occurred in
   central Europe during the LGM, as suggested by recent genetic analyses,
   they were likely restricted to microrefugia embedded in the landscape
   matrix of species-poor cold steppe. The precipitation-rich mid-Holocene
   climate had no direct negative impact on the central European steppe
   flora.},

Title = {Local hydrological conditions influence tree diversity and composition
   across the Amazon basin},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tree diversity and composition in Amazonia are known to be strongly
   determined by the water supplied by precipitation. Nevertheless, within
   the same climatic regime, water availability is modulated by local
   topography and soil characteristics (hereafter referred to as local
   hydrological conditions), varying from saturated and poorly drained to
   well-drained and potentially dry areas. While these conditions may be
   expected to influence species distribution, the impacts of local
   hydrological conditions on tree diversity and composition remain poorly
   understood at the whole Amazon basin scale. Using a dataset of 443 1-ha
   non-flooded forest plots distributed across the basin, we investigate
   how local hydrological conditions influence 1) tree alpha diversity, 2)
   the community-weighted wood density mean (CWM-wd) - a proxy for
   hydraulic resistance and 3) tree species composition. We find that the
   effect of local hydrological conditions on tree diversity depends on
   climate, being more evident in wetter forests, where diversity increases
   towards locations with well-drained soils. CWM-wd increased towards
   better drained soils in Southern and Western Amazonia. Tree species
   composition changed along local soil hydrological gradients in
   Central-Eastern, Western and Southern Amazonia, and those changes were
   correlated with changes in the mean wood density of plots. Our results
   suggest that local hydrological gradients filter species, influencing
   the diversity and composition of Amazonian forests. Overall, this study
   shows that the effect of local hydrological conditions is pervasive,
   extending over wide Amazonian regions, and reinforces the importance of
   accounting for local topography and hydrology to better understand the
   likely response and resilience of forests to increased frequency of
   extreme climate events and rising temperatures.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Understanding how environmental filtering and biotic interactions
   structure communities across elevational and latitudinal gradients is
   still a matter of debate. To provide insight into their relative
   importance, we explore the mismatch between three dimensions of
   biodiversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic), and compare their
   patterns to null models of random community assembly. We focus on a
   highly diverse tropical group: the tree frogs (hylids) of the Atlantic
   Forest of Brazil. For that, we combined geographic distribution data
   with phylogenetic and trait information for 158 species to produce maps
   of the three dimensions of diversity. We show that communities of tree
   frogs of the Hylidae family tend to have high functional richness along
   the Atlantic Forest, potentially driven by niche partitioning. However,
   environmental filtering gains importance in extreme environments, both
   at high elevations and higher latitudes. In these areas of the forest,
   clustering of both functional and phylogenetic diversity is observed.
   Trait overdispersion is found in areas of contact between vegetation
   types, or of adjacent biomes, reflecting the encounter of amphibian
   species adapted to distinct environmental conditions and landscape
   configurations. Considering all three dimensions of diversity along with
   multiple axes of environmental variation allows for a more comprehensive
   understanding of the processes shaping amphibian community assembly in
   this biodiversity hotspot.},

Title = {Hurricane disturbance accelerated the thermophilization of a Jamaican
   montane forest},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Thermophilization - changes in community composition towards greater
   relative abundances of species associated with warmer environments - has
   been described for plants and animals in many locations around the
   world. Disturbances of various kinds have increased rates of
   thermophilization in temperate sites, and this has been proposed, but
   not demonstrated, for some tropical environments. In this study, we
   tested whether disturbance by a category 4 hurricane in 1988 (Hurricane
   Gilbert) increased thermophilization in a Jamaican montane forest by
   using pre- and post-hurricane data collected over four decades
   (1974-2014). We analysed tree species composition in permanent plots at
   ca 1580 m above sea level in Jamaica's Blue Mountains. There were 66
   tree species with stem diameters >= 3 cm at breast height. We used
   published data on the altitudinal distribution of 62 species (94\% of
   genetic individuals (genets)) to calculate the mean community altitude
   scores (MCAS) of the trees recorded in each census, as well as the MCAS
   of the survivors, recruits and dead trees after each decade. We found
   that thermophilization did occur (i.e. MCAS decreased significantly over
   time), and that this was due both to a decreasing MCAS of recruits
   through the four decades (significantly lower than expected in the last
   three decades) as well as a high MCAS of trees that died.
   Thermophilization was fastest in the post-hurricane decade, during which
   time there was marked and significant increase in the MCAS of dead
   trees; this change was above and beyond expectations of long-term
   successional dynamics. The rate of compositional change equates to an
   overall decrease in MCAS of 1.6 m yr(-1) over the forty-year study
   period. We conclude that this Jamaican montane forest is undergoing
   thermophilization (likely due to rising temperature) and that the
   hurricane-caused disturbance accelerated thermophilization through
   differential mortality.},

Title = {Circum-Arctic distribution of chemical anti-herbivore compounds suggests
   biome-wide trade-off in defence strategies in Arctic shrubs},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Spatial variation in plant chemical defence towards herbivores can help
   us understand variation in herbivore top-down control of shrubs in the
   Arctic and possibly also shrub responses to global warming. Less
   defended, non-resinous shrubs could be more influenced by herbivores
   than more defended, resinous shrubs. However, sparse field measurements
   limit our current understanding of how much of the circum-Arctic
   variation in defence compounds is explained by taxa or defence
   functional groups (resinous/non-resinous). We measured circum-Arctic
   chemical defence and leaf digestibility in resinous (Betula glandulosa,
   B. nana ssp. exilis) and non-resinous (B. nana ssp. nana, B. pumila)
   shrub birches to see how they vary among and within taxa and functional
   groups. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
   metabolomic analyses and in vitro leaf digestibility via incubation in
   cattle rumen fluid, we analysed defence composition and leaf
   digestibility in 128 samples from 44 tundra locations. We found
   biogeographical patterns in anti-herbivore defence where mean leaf
   triterpene concentrations and twig resin gland density were greater in
   resinous taxa and mean concentrations of condensing tannins were greater
   in non-resinous taxa. This indicates a biome-wide trade-off between
   triterpene- or tannin-dominated defences. However, we also found
   variations in chemical defence composition and resin gland density both
   within and among functional groups (resinous/non-resinous) and taxa,
   suggesting these categorisations only partly predict chemical herbivore
   defence. Complex tannins were the only defence compounds negatively
   related to in vitro digestibility, identifying this previously neglected
   tannin group as having a potential key role in birch anti-herbivore
   defence. We conclude that circum-Arctic variation in birch
   anti-herbivore defence can be partly derived from biogeographical
   distributions of birch taxa, although our detailed mapping of plant
   defence provides more information on this variation and can be used for
   better predictions of herbivore effects on Arctic vegetation.},

Abstract = {Predicting the viability of species exposed to increasing climatic
   stress requires an appreciation for the mechanisms underpinning the
   success or failure of marginal populations. Rather than traditional
   metrics of long-term population performance, here we illustrate that
   short-term (i.e. transient) demographic characteristics, including
   measures of resistance, recovery and compensation, are fundamental in
   the poleward range expansion of hard corals, facilitating the
   establishment of coral populations at higher latitudes. Through the
   annual census of subtropical and temperate Acropora spp. colonies in
   Japan between 2017 and 2019, we show how enhanced transient
   amplification (i.e. short-term increases in population growth following
   disturbance) supports the persistence of coral assemblages within more
   variable high-latitude environments. The transient dynamics of both the
   subtropical and temperate assemblages were strongly influenced by their
   corresponding recruitment patterns. However, we demonstrate that
   variation in colony survival and fragmentation patterns between the two
   assemblages determines their relative capacities for transient
   amplification. This latitudinal variation in the transient dynamics of
   Acropora spp. assemblages emphasizes that coral populations can possess
   the demographic plasticity necessary for exploiting more variable,
   marginal conditions.},

Title = {Climate-informed models benefit hindcasting but present challenges when
   forecasting species-habitat associations},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to
   hindcast fine-scale population metrics, there remains a paucity of
   information about how well these models predict future responses to
   climate. Many conventional SDMs rely on spatially-explicit but
   time-invariant conditions to quantify species distributions and
   densities. We compared these status quo `static' models with more
   climate-informed `dynamic' SDMs to assess whether the addition of
   time-varying processes would improve hindcast performance and/or
   forecast skill. Here, we present two groundfish case studies from the
   Bering Sea - a high latitude system that has recently undergone
   considerable warming. We relied on conventional statistics (R-2, \%
   deviance explained, UBRE or GCV) to evaluate hindcast performance for
   presence-absence, numerical abundance and biomass of arrowtooth flounder
   Atheresthes stomias and walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus. We then
   used retrospective skill testing to evaluate near-term forecast skill.
   Retrospective skill testing enables direct comparisons between forecasts
   and observations through a process of fitting and forecasting nested
   submodels within a given time series. We found that the inclusion of
   time-varying covariates improved hindcasts. However, dynamic models
   either did not improve or decreased forecast skill relative to static
   SDMs. This is likely a result of rapidly changing temperatures within
   the ecosystem, which required models to predict species responses to
   environmental conditions that were outside the range of observed values.
   Until additional model development allows for fully dynamic predictions,
   static model forecasts (or persistence forecasts from dynamic models)
   may serve as reliable placeholders, especially when anomalous conditions
   are anticipated. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate support for the
   use of retrospective skill testing rather than selecting forecast models
   a priori based on their ability to quantify species-habitat associations
   in the past.},

Title = {The predictive performance of process-explicit range change models
   remains largely untested},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ecological models used to forecast range change (range change models;
   RCM) have recently diversified to account for a greater number of
   ecological and observational processes in pursuit of more accurate and
   realistic predictions. Theory suggests that process-explicit RCMs should
   generate more robust forecasts, particularly under novel environmental
   conditions. RCMs accounting for processes are generally more complex and
   data hungry, and so, require extra effort to build. Thus, it is
   necessary to understand when the effort of building a more realistic
   model is likely to generate more reliable forecasts. Here, we review the
   literature to explore whether process-explicit models have been tested
   through benchmarking their temporal predictive performance (i.e. their
   predictive performance when transferred in time) and model
   transferability (i.e. their ability to keep their predictive performance
   when transferred to generate predictions into a different time) against
   simpler models, and highlight the gaps between the rapid development of
   process-explicit RCMs and the testing of their potential improvements.
   We found that, out of five ecological processes (dispersal, demography,
   physiology, evolution, species interactions) and two observational
   processes (sampling bias, imperfect detection) that may influence
   reliability of forecasts, only the effects of dispersal, demography and
   imperfect detection have been benchmarked using temporally-independent
   datasets. Only nine out of twenty-nine process-explicit model types have
   been tested to assess whether accounting for processes improves temporal
   predictive performance. We found no benchmarks assessing model
   transferability. We discuss potential reasons for the lack of empirical
   validation of process-explicit models. Considering these findings, we
   propose an expanded research agenda to properly test the performance of
   process-explicit RCMs, and highlight some opportunities to fill the gaps
   by suggesting models to be benchmarked using existing historical
   datasets.},

Title = {A protocol for reproducible functional diversity analyses},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The widespread use of species traits in basic and applied ecology,
   conservation and biogeography has led to an exponential increase in
   functional diversity analyses, with > 10 000 papers published in
   2010-2020, and > 1800 papers only in 2021. This interest is reflected in
   the development of a multitude of theoretical and methodological
   frameworks for calculating functional diversity, making it challenging
   to navigate the myriads of options and to report detailed accounts of
   trait-based analyses. Therefore, the discipline of trait-based ecology
   would benefit from the existence of a general guideline for standard
   reporting and good practices for analyses. We devise an eight-step
   protocol to guide researchers in conducting and reporting functional
   diversity analyses, with the overarching goal of increasing
   reproducibility, transparency and comparability across studies. The
   protocol is based on: 1) identification of a research question; 2) a
   sampling scheme and a study design; 3-4) assemblage of data matrices; 5)
   data exploration and preprocessing; 6) functional diversity computation;
   7) model fitting, evaluation and interpretation; and 8) data, metadata
   and code provision. Throughout the protocol, we provide information on
   how to best select research questions, study designs, trait data,
   compute functional diversity, interpret results and discuss ways to
   ensure reproducibility in reporting results. To facilitate the
   implementation of this template, we further develop an interactive
   web-based application (stepFD) in the form of a checklist workflow,
   detailing all the steps of the protocol and allowing the user to produce
   a final `reproducibility report' to upload alongside the published
   paper. A thorough and transparent reporting of functional diversity
   analyses ensures that ecologists can incorporate others' findings into
   meta-analyses, the shared data can be integrated into larger databases
   for consensus analyses, and available code can be reused by other
   researchers. All these elements are key to pushing forward this vibrant
   and fast-growing field of research.},

Title = {Remotely-sensed slowing down in spatially patterned dryland ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Regular vegetation patterns have been predicted to indicate a system
   slowing down and possibly desertification of drylands. However, these
   predictions have not yet been observed in dryland vegetation due to the
   inherent logistic difficulty to gather longer-term in situ data. Here,
   we evaluate the theoretical prediction that regular vegetation patterns
   are associated with empirically derived temporal indicators
   (autocorrelation, variance, responsiveness) of critical slowing down in
   a dryland ecosystem in Sudan using different remote sensing products. We
   use recently developed methods using remote-sensing EVI time-series in
   combination with classified regular vegetation patterns along a rainfall
   gradient in Sudan to test the predicted slowing down. We tested our
   empirical findings against theoretical predictions from a stochastic
   version of a spatial explicit model that has been used to describe
   vegetation dynamics in drylands under aridity stress. Overall, three
   temporal indicators (responsiveness, temporal autocorrelation, variance)
   show slowing down as vegetation patterns change from gaps to labyrinths
   to spots towards more arid conditions, confirming predictions. However,
   this transition exhibits non-linearities, specifically when patterns
   change configuration. Model simulations reveal that the transition
   between patterns temporarily slows down the system affecting the
   temporal indicators. These transient states when vegetation patterns
   reorganize thus affect the systems resilience indicators in a non-linear
   way. Our findings suggest that spatial self-organization of dryland
   vegetation is associated with critical slowing down, but this transition
   towards reduced resilience happens in a non-linear way. Future work
   should aim to better understand transient dynamics in regular vegetation
   patterns in dryland ecosystems, because long transients make regular
   vegetation patterns of limited use for management in anticipating
   critical transitions.},

Abstract = {Understanding the role of traits in dispersal is necessary to improve
   our knowledge of historical biogeography, community assembly processes
   and predictions of species' future movements. Here we aimed to determine
   the relationship between three traits (coastal distribution, body size,
   position on the fast/slow life history continuum) and past dispersal
   probability on an evolutionary timescale in chameleons (Chamaeleonidae).
   Using species' distribution data we identified the nine most important
   biogeographic regions for all included chameleons (181/217 species). We
   compiled life history trait data and used phylogenetic factor analysis
   to infer independent body size and fast/slow life history trait axes.
   Finally, we tested whether traits and trait combinations related to
   biogeographic dispersal success in the past, using trait-dependent
   biogeographic models. All three traits were associated with past
   biogeographical movements. Lineages having coastal distributions and
   those with large bodies had higher dispersal probabilities.
   Interestingly, chameleons with either a very fast or very slow life
   history were more successful dispersers than species with an
   intermediate strategy. Together, the three traits - coastal,
   large-bodied and extreme life history - form a dispersal syndrome.
   Traits have played an important role in the biogeographic history of
   chameleons. While only fast traits have been linked to present-day
   invasion success in reptiles, both extremes of the life history spectrum
   were likely advantageous for dispersal and establishment during past
   biogeographic movements. Fast-living species may be less susceptible to
   stochastic extinction in the first phases of a colonization (due to
   rapid population growth), and slow-living species may be less vulnerable
   to environmental stochasticity (due to low demographic variability). Our
   results call for broader analyses testing the general influence of life
   history strategy in biogeographic dispersal success, which would help
   explain species distribution patterns on Earth.},

Title = {Spatial patterns and life histories of Macrotermes michaelseni termite
   mounds reflect intraspecific competition: insights of a temporal

Abstract = {Termite mounds contribute to the heterogeneity and productivity of many
   semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. Regular spatial patterns of termite
   mounds are well documented but the underlying pattern-building
   mechanisms remain to be clarified. This study analysed a comprehensive
   data set of Macrotermes michaelseni mound metrics, spatial patterns and
   dynamics, recorded 12 years apart within 1 km(2) of Namibian thornbush
   savanna. We used both unmarked and marked point pattern analyses to
   assess spatial distributions of termite mounds. We recorded 485 termite
   mounds in 2007 and 2019. Out of the investigated 142 active termite
   mounds in 2007, 81 were active 12 years later. Only 2\% (n = 3/129) of
   remnant mound sites in 2007 were newly colonised in 2019. All mounds
   were distributed at regular distances. Mounds higher than 2 m and
   long-term active mounds (active in 2007 and 2019) showed high
   regularity. Mounds up to 0.7 m height and new mounds occurred in
   clusters and showed a spatial repulsion to large and long-term active
   colonies. The spatial distribution of Boscia albitrunca trees generally
   clustered around termite mounds, but did not cluster around young
   colonies. The results contradict the hypothesis of preferred colony
   settlement on previously inhabited mound sites. Remnant mounds are
   relatively unlikely to be recolonised when recently abandoned. The
   observed spatial patterns show that intraspecific competition between
   large colonies is the decisive factor for regular spatial patterns of
   termite colonies, whereas small and young colonies are limited to
   unoccupied patches. Surrounding trees are a pattern-building factor of
   only secondary importance. The spatio-temporal scale in our study
   reveals general trends of termite mound life histories and spatial
   pattern-building mechanisms. Availability of not previously inhabited
   sites form the patterns of founding new colonies. Well-established
   mounds are highly regulated by intraspecific competition. This
   highlights that termites contribute to ecosystem heterogeneity through
   self-organised spatial regularity.},

Title = {Altitudinal dispersal process drives community assembly of montane small
   mammals},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Montane small mammals are subjected to strong forces of dispersal
   limitation and habitat filtering that mainly operate on their community
   structures along the altitudinal direction. However, so far little is
   known about the relative contributions of dispersal and niche processes
   to their community assembly. By applying the newly proposed
   PER-SIMPER/DNCI (dispersal-niche continuum index) framework to small
   mammal occurrence data collected from 21 extensive altitudinal
   gradients, we quantitatively assessed the relative importance of
   dispersal and niche processes on mammalian community assembly in a large
   mountainous region of southwestern China. We compared the pairwise DNCI
   values among assemblages from low, middle and high altitudinal zones and
   overall DNCI values between glires and insectivores that differ in
   dispersal abilities to test three explicit (altitudinal connectivity,
   environmental difference and dispersal ability) hypotheses. The overall
   DNCI values for all small mammal species combined (-12.7 +/- 0.4, 90
   species), glires (-12.8 +/- 0.5, 56 species) and insectivores (-13.5 +/-
   1.4, 34 species) values were all negative, while insectivores showed a
   lower value than glires. For both all species combined and glires, we
   found a lower pairwise DNCI value between the low and high altitudinal
   zones than that between the other two pairs of altitudinal zones. Our
   study indicated that an altitudinal dispersal process dominates the
   taxonomic composition of small mammal assemblages in this region.
   Importantly, the results reinforced the idea that community structures
   of less vagile taxa are more subject to dispersal limitation; and yet
   another idea that assemblages from further altitudinal areas are more
   differentiated by dispersal process was only supported in glires and all
   species combined. Community biologists should, therefore, pay attention
   to recent climate-induced upward range shifts by montane species, which
   may dramatically alter their community structures in different
   altitudinal zones through dynamics of immigration and mountaintop
   extinction.},

Abstract = {Understanding what drives non-native species naturalization (the
   establishment of a self-sustainable population outside its native range)
   is a central question in invasion science. Plant capacity for
   long-distance dispersal (LDD) is likely to influence the spread and
   naturalization of non-native species differently according to their
   introduction pathways. These pathways include intentional introductions
   (for economic use, e.g. for agriculture), unintentional introductions
   (e.g. seed contaminants), plant dispersal via human infrastructures
   (e.g. roads) and plant spread from an adjacent region where the species
   was previously introduced. We tested the relationship between sets of
   LDD traits (syndromes) of 10 308 European plant species and their global
   naturalization incidence (i.e. whether a species has become naturalized
   or not) and extent (i.e. the number of regions where a species has
   become naturalized) using the most comprehensive database of naturalized
   plants worldwide (GloNAF). Diaspore traits allowed the identification of
   four traditional LDD syndromes, namely those with specializations for
   dispersal by: wind (anemochorous), animal ingestion (endozoochorous),
   attached to animals (epizoochorous) and sea currents (thalassochorous).
   These evolutionary specializations have been historically interpreted by
   biologists even though actual dispersal is not always related to
   diaspore syndromes. We found that while epizoochorous and
   thalassochorous traits are positively associated with global plant
   naturalization incidence, anemochorous and endozoochorous traits show a
   negative relationship. Species' residence time outside their native
   range, their economic use and presence of epizoochorous traits (such as
   hooks, hairs and adhesive substances) are positively associated with
   global naturalization extent. Furthermore, we found that plant economic
   use reduces the influence of LDD syndromes on the naturalization
   incidence of intentionally introduced plants. While the success of
   non-native plants is influenced by a broad array of species- and
   context-specific factors, LDD syndromes play an important role in this
   context depending on the economic use of plants.},

   performance, particularly when populations experience exceptional
   environmental conditions that may place them outside of the species
   niche. Here, we use data of co-occurring species' decay, gathered after
   an extreme drought event occurring in the southeast of the Iberian
   Peninsula which highly affected rich semiarid shrubland communities, to
   compare the relationship between population decay (mortality and
   remaining green canopy) and 1) distances between populations' location
   and species niche margin and centroid in the environmental space, and 2)
   climatic suitability estimated from frequently used SDMs (here MaxEnt)
   considering both the extreme climatic episode and the average reference
   climatic period before this. We found that both SDMs-derived suitability
   and distances to species niche properly predict populations performance
   when considering the reference climatic period; but climatic suitability
   failed to predict performance considering the extreme climate period. In
   addition, while distance to niche margins accurately predict both
   mortality and remaining green canopy responses, centroid distances
   failed to explain mortality, suggesting that indexes containing
   information about the position to niche margin (inside or outside) are
   better to predict binary responses. We conclude that the location of
   populations in the environmental space is consistent with performance
   responses to extreme drought. Niche distances appear to be a more
   efficient approach than the use of climate suitability indices derived
   from more frequently used SDMs to explain population performance when
   dealing with environmental conditions that are located outside the
   species environmental niche. The use of this alternative metrics may be
   particularly useful when designing conservation measures to mitigate
   impacts of shifting environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Connectivity underpins the persistence of life; it needs to inform
   biodiversity con-servation decisions. Yet, when prioritising
   conservation areas and developing actions, connectivity is not being
   operationalised in spatial planning. The chal-lenge is the translation
   of flows associated with connectivity into conservation objectives that
   lead to actions. Connectivity is nebulous, it can be abstract and mean
   different things to different people, making it difficult to include in
   conser-vation problems. Here, we show how connectivity can be included
   in mathemat-ically defining conservation planning objectives. We provide
   a path forward for linking connectivity to high-level conservation
   goals, such as increasing species' persistence. We propose ways to
   design spatial management areas that gain biodiversity benefit from
   connectivity.},

Abstract = {Plant life-history variation reflects different outcomes of natural
   selection given the strictures of resource allocation trade-offs.
   However, there is limited theory of selection predicting how leaves,
   stems, roots, and reproductive organs should evolve in concert across
   environments. Here, we synthesize two optimality theories to offer a
   general theory of plant carbon economics, named as Gmax theory, that
   shows how life-history variation is limited to phenotypes that have an
   approximately similar lifetime net carbon gain per body mass. In
   consequence, fast-slow economics spectra are the result of trait
   combinations obtaining similar lifetime net carbon gains from leaves and
   similar net carbon investment costs in stems, roots, and reproductive
   organs. Gmax theory also helps explain ecosystem and crop productivity
   and even helps guide carbon conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {Diverse plants and animals have evolved specialized structures to filter
   and house beneficial microbes. These symbiotic organs form crucial
   points of exchange between host and symbiont, are often shaped by both
   partners, and exhibit features that facilitate a suite of microbial
   services. While symbiotic organs exhibit varied function, morphology,
   and developmental plasticity, they share core features linked to the
   evolutionary maintenance of beneficial symbiosis. Moreover, these organs
   can have a significant role in altering the demographic forces that
   shape microbial genomes, driving population bottlenecks and horizontal
   gene transfer (HGT). To advance our understanding of these `joint
   phenotypes' across varied systems, future research must consider the
   emergent forces that can shape symbiotic organs, including fitness
   feedbacks and conflicts between interacting genomes.},

Abstract = {One of landscape ecology's main goals is to unveil how biodiversity is
   impacted by habitat transformation. However, the discipline suffers from
   significant context dependency in observed spatial and temporal trends,
   hindering progress towards understanding the mechanisms driving species
   declines and preventing the development of accurate estimates of future
   biodiversity change. Here, we discuss recent evidence that populations'
   and species' responses to habitat change at the landscape scale are
   modulated by factors and processes occurring at macroecological scales,
   such as historical disturbance rates, distance to geographic range
   edges, and climatic suitability. We suggest that placing landscape
   ecology studies in a macroecological lens will help to explain seemingly
   inconsistent results and will ultimately create better predictive models
   to help mitigate the biodiversity crisis.},

Abstract = {Urban environments are one of the fastest growing habitats in the world.
   We collected ants to study community composition in three urban
   engineered habitats; city parks, green rooftops, and street medians in
   Chicago. We addressed two questions about how ant communities respond to
   the urban mosaic based on the observation that human disturbance
   increases from green rooftops to urban parks to street medians; first we
   studied if ant communities on green rooftops, urban parks, and street
   medians differed or if different types of urban greenspace have similar
   communities. We determined that different habitats contain distinct
   communities. Second, we predicted that area would impact species
   richness in the same way in different habitats. We found that the area
   of a habitat predicts species richness and community composition but the
   pattern was not the same in each habitat. Street medians had more ant
   species than urban parks, which had more species than green rooftops. On
   average urban parks were larger than street medians which were larger
   than green rooftops. Ant community composition on green rooftops
   differed from city parks and street medians, and showed the greatest
   variability within a given habitat. After accounting for area, isolation
   from other sites was also a significant predictor of variation in ant
   community structure. These findings reinforce that urban ecosystems
   cannot be considered as one large habitat, but would be better
   approached as a mosaic of interconnected habitats.},

Title = {Differential response of migratory guilds of birds to park area and
   urbanization},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks
   and greenspaces ({''}parks{''}) is often substantial. Understanding why
   differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally
   affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48
   undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the
   contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition
   surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local
   habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance
   migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds
   responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of
   long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small
   (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also
   increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and
   short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area,
   and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape,
   connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or
   density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high
   tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of
   forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was
   the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and
   long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to
   variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and
   that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park
   shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and
   their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were
   estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance
   migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.},

Abstract = {The expansion of urban environments and how animals may be affected by
   them are being increasingly investigated, leading to a surge in urban
   ecology studies. Many urban ecology studies involve a direct comparison
   between rural and urban populations, or the use of urban gradients along
   a continuum from rural to urban areas. The implicit, although not
   properly investigated, assumption in these rural vs urban comparisons is
   that the rural populations offer a control that represents a lack of the
   anthropogenic stressors affecting the urban populations. Here we used
   museum skulls from 14 rodent species to conduct two separate studies,
   measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a proxy of developmental stress
   to assess the effect of anthropogenic disturbance. First, we compared
   urban and rural specimens of Mus musculus (house mouse) to validate our
   methodological approach. Second, we compared rural specimens from 14
   rodent species collected during the last two centuries across Austria.
   We hypothesised that FA in rural populations has not increased over the
   last two centuries, which would support the use of rural populations as
   a proper control in rural vs urban comparisons. We found higher
   morphological asymmetry in urban populations of Mus musculus compared to
   rural populations, which is consistent with similar studies in other
   species. However, we did not find any significant increase in FA over
   time in rural populations for any of the studied species. This offers
   some support to the common practice of using rural populations as a
   control in rural vs urban comparisons when assessing the effects of
   urbanisation.},

Abstract = {Traits are inherent properties of organisms, but how are they defined
   for organismal networks such as mycorrhizal symbioses? Mycorrhizal
   symbioses are complex and diverse belowground symbioses between plants
   and fungi that have proved challenging to fit into a unified and
   coherent trait framework. We propose an inclusive mycorrhizal trait
   framework that classifies traits as morphological, physiological, and
   phenological features that have functional implications for the
   symbiosis. We further classify mycorrhizal traits by location - plant,
   fungus, or the symbiosis - which highlights new questions in trait-based
   mycorrhizal ecology designed to charge and challenge the scientific
   community. This new framework is an opportunity for researchers to
   interrogate their data to identify novel insights and gaps in our
   understanding of mycorrhizal symbioses.},

   (especially those defining size-shape and resource economics spectra)
   vary both within individual trees and shrubs and across woody species,
   thereby together boosting ecosystem multifunctionality. While we focus

Abstract = {Reduction of functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD)
   likely affects ecosystem functions and reduces the potential of
   communities to respond to changes, such as climate change. Mutualistic
   interactions are essential for main-taining diversity, but their role
   has largely been ignored in conservation planning. We propose using a
   species' interaction niche - the diversity of its interaction partners -
   to measure a species' contribution to the maintenance of FD and PD via
   mutualistic interactions, and thus identify species and interspecific
   interactions that are particularly important for the conservation of
   ecosystem functions and evolutionary lineages in ecological communities.
   Our approach represents a switch in perspective that allows a direct
   assessment of the importance of mutualistic interactions for the
   maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

Journal = {TRENDS IN ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {9},
Pages = {777-788},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Extensive evidence shows that regional (gamma) diversity is often lower
   across restored landscapes than in reference landscapes, in part due to
   common resto-ration practices that favor widespread species through
   selection of easily-grown species with high survival and propagation
   practices that reduce genetic diver-sity. We discuss approaches to
   counteract biotic homogenization, such as reintroducing species that are
   adapted to localized habitat conditions and are unlikely to colonize
   naturally; periodically reintroducing propagules from rem-nant
   populations to increase genetic diversity; and reintroducing higher
   trophic level fauna to restore interaction networks and processes that
   promote habitat heterogeneity. Several policy changes would also
   increase regional diversity; these include regional coordination amongst
   restoration groups, financial incen-tives to organizations producing
   conservation-valued species, and experimental designations for rare
   species introductions.},

Abstract = {Earth's most speciose biomes are in the tropics, yet tropical plant
   phenology remains poorly understood. Tropical phenological data are
   comparatively scarce and viewed through the lens of a `temperate
   phenological paradigm' expecting phenological traits to respond to
   strong, predictably annual shifts in climate (e.g., between subfreezing
   and frost-free periods). Digitized herbarium data greatly expand
   existing phenological data for tropical plants; and circular data,
   statistics, and models are more appropriate for analyzing tropical (and
   temperate) phenological datasets. Phylogenetic information, which
   remains seldom applied in phenological investigations, provides new
   insights into phenological responses of large groups of related species
   to climate. Consistent combined use of herbarium data, circular
   statistical distributions, and robust phylogenies will rapidly advance
   our understanding of tropical - and temperate - phenology.},

Abstract = {The process of rapid urbanization in China has led to various impacts on
   the urban ecological environment and one of these significant effects is
   the urban heat island (UHI). Pursuing the construction of a ecological
   city is recognized as an important direction to relieve the
   contradictions between environmental protection and city development.
   Yet how the landcape configuation and composition in such city
   development influences the UHI has not been well understood. This paper
   attempted to evaluate the spatial patterning of land surface temperature
   (LST) and to discuss the effects of source and sink landscape patterns
   upon LST in a smart city demonstrated at the local level in China. The
   results revealed that the UHI was spatially associated with the land use
   changes driven by rapid urbanization and gradually declines along the
   urban-rural gradient. When the urban-rural gradient reached the range of
   7.5 to 8.75 km from the city center, there exhibited a tipping point
   where the combinative effects of source and sink landscapes on UHI
   significantly decreased. Through exploring the impact of source-sink
   landscape area ratio on UHI, we also found a tipping point that when
   source-sink area ratio in a patch was smaller than the golden separation
   value (1.30), UHI effect was almost mitigated because the warming effect
   of source area would be weaker than the cooling effect of sink area.
   Overall, this study highlights that controlling the optimal area ratio
   of source-sink landscape are very important strategy for mitigating the
   UHI effect during urban development and planning.},

   security and sustainability in intensified agriculture, but a
   large-scale policy implementation is lacking. As a leading agricultural
   producer, the integration of diversification in major policies in China

Abstract = {In an era of mass extinction, predicting the consequences of species
   loss has become a priority for ecologists. Extinction of one species can
   trigger the loss of dependent species, sometimes leading to cascades of
   extinctions. Simulations predict that cascading extinctions should be
   commonplace, but empirical observations of extinction cascades rarely
   match those predicted by simulation. By contrast, species-removal field
   experiments have yielded surprises, such as novel interactions following
   removals. Thus, given this mismatch, the true predictive value of
   extinction simulation studies is unknown. We explore the value of
   validating extinction simulations with observational and experimental
   studies. We propose a new framework that unites both approaches to
   studying extinction cascades, and which reveals new opportunities to
   couple theory and data.},

Abstract = {Human settlements, including cities, may provide wildlife with new
   ecological niches, in terms of habitat types and food availability, thus
   requiring plasticity for adaptation. The crested porcupine Hystrix
   cristata is a habitat-generalist, large-sized rodent, also recorded in
   some suburban areas, but no information is available on its habitat use
   in metropolitan landscapes. Here, we assessed the land-use factors
   influencing the presence of crested porcupines in a metropolitan area of
   Central Italy. We collected data on the occurrence of crested porcupines
   from the metropolitan area of Rome, following an observer-oriented
   approach to record occurrences and retreive pseudo-absences. We then
   related the presence/absence of H. cristata to landscape composition.
   Occupancy models showed that cultivations and scrubland were positively
   related to porcupine presence, most likely as they provide food
   resources and shelter sites, respectively. Although the crested
   porcupine has been confirmed as a ``generalist{''} species in terms of
   habitat selection, a strong preference for areas limiting the risk of
   being killed and providing enough food and shelter was observed. We
   therefore suggest that the crested porcupine may adapt to deeply
   modified landscapes such as large cities by selecting specific
   favourable land-use types.},

Abstract = {As urbanisation continues to reduce the available habitat for wildlife,
   some species, including the black-and-gold howler monkey (Alouatta
   caraya) in Pilar, southwest Paraguay, are making their homes in
   anthropogenic environments. Understanding an animal's home range is an
   important step to understanding its ecological needs, and an essential
   requirement for the creation of robust conservation plans. In this
   study, we determined the home ranges and core areas of five groups of
   urban dwelling A. caraya using Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) and Kernel
   Density Estimation (KDE) Analysis. We used a Spearman's Correlation to
   explore the relationship between home range size and group size. All
   five groups had home ranges of less than 10 ha and used core areas of
   less than 1 ha. Group size had no significant relationship to home range
   size. We provide the first estimates of home range for A. caraya in an
   urban environment in Paraguay. Though the home ranges of the urban A.
   caraya in Pilar, Paraguay fall at the smaller end of the spectrum of
   range sizes in Alouatta, they are not abnormal for a species in this
   genus.},

Abstract = {Green walls are a traditional system that has been rediscovered for
   addressing and combating effects of climate change on the urban
   environment. The greening of walls is one of the sustainable techniques
   towards green architecture, and it has become a significant part of the
   passive design. This research employed an integrated approach to create
   healthy urban spaces and improve people's overall quality of life
   through introducing the concept of biofacades to make a city more
   sustainable. Today, accelerated growth in urban development is occurring
   in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, including in large-scale urban
   developments and architecture and infrastructure projects, causing
   significant changes to the built environment. This paper assesses the
   performance of biofacades in Doha's hot and arid climate. For this
   purpose, four biofacade walls were installed on the campus of Qatar
   University, with plant species that are suitable for this region. These
   walls were regularly monitored to observe the adaptation of the
   biofacades to prevailing climatic conditions in Qatar. The project had
   three main steps. Step 1 involved the selection of suitable plants that
   could survive in Doha; Step 2 entailed the distribution of plants in
   four different orientations across the building; and Step 3 included
   monitoring, testing, measurement, observation, and analysis to determine
   the most suitable plants for the biofacade. The findings of this
   research will enable architects and engineers to formulate guidelines
   for the selection of appropriate plants to improve energy performance
   and reduce the urban heat island effect in the arid climate of Qatar.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {A lot of what we know about past speciation and extinction dynamics is
   based on statistically fitting birth-death processes to phylogenies of
   extant species. Despite their wide use, the reliability of these tools
   is regularly questioned. It was recently demonstrated that vast
   `congruent' sets of alternative diversification histories cannot be
   distinguished (i.e., are not identifiable) using extant phylogenies
   alone, reanimating the debate about the limits of phylogenetic
   diversification analysis. Here, we summarize what we know about the
   identifiability of the birth- death process and how identifiability
   issues can be addressed. We conclude that extant phylogenies, when
   combined with appropriate prior hypotheses and regularization
   techniques, can still tell us a lot about past diversification dynamics.},

Title = {Valuation of ecosystem services of a nascent urban park in east Los
   Angeles, California},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1787-1795},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {People protect what they value, yet different people assign value to
   nature in different ways. The monetary valuation of ecosystem services
   (ES) is a strategy to estimate the worth of benefits provided by nature
   to humans and is increasingly common in cities where human populations
   are densest. Most ES valuation of urban areas are at the city scale with
   few studies at the parcel level, yet urban land decisions are typically
   made at the parcel level. Here we approximated the monetary value of
   ecosystem services for a single nascent urban park in the United States'
   second most populous city, Los Angeles. Acknowledging no single method
   can capture the entire ES value of a location, we use four approaches to
   approximate a value range for this site. Using a combination of
   unoccupied aerial vehicle imagery and ground-truthing surveys, the park
   was partitioned by dominant land cover types to assess values derived
   from literature estimates, tree canopy features, and collected
   field-based metrics of all individual trees over 1.5 m height using the
   ecosystem service valuation functions of the i-Tree software suite. We
   also applied a more novel market-based approach to approximate the
   park's overall value. We found calculated dollar values across and
   within the land cover types varied by orders of magnitude between
   assessment approaches yet were generally low due to limited mature
   vegetation cover. The present study is unique in providing a baseline
   assessment for a recently opened, highly urban park in a low-income,
   park-poor neighborhood of Los Angeles. More broadly, it provides ES
   valuation at the data-lacking parcel scale which is needed to better
   understand the ecological role and function of green spaces in cities.},

Title = {A systematic review of Rat Ecology in Urban Sewer Systems},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 28},
Abstract = {Rats are abundant in the urban ecosystem, posing concerns for public
   health, infrastructural damage, and negative impacts for other urban
   wildlife. Sewers are considered to be one of the main reservoirs for
   urban rat populations, and rats may migrate between sewers and other
   surface areas in search of food and harbouring sites. Yet the ecology of
   rats in sewers has received little attention. To address this knowledge
   gap, this review identifies a number of sewer ecosystem characteristics
   that have been associated with rat activity. We demonstrate that sewers
   with narrower pipes, lower flow rates, and construction materials, such
   as brick and clay, are associated with more rat activity. Further, this
   review suggests that poorly maintained sewers may contain more crevices
   and cracks for rats to burrow, leading to greater levels of infestation.
   Finally, we find that sewers located in residential areas, or closer to
   food establishment, are more prone to rat presence. Together, these
   findings uncovered several significant implications for management of
   rats in sewers, as well as highlight the need for these characteristics
   to be considered in the urban planning process. Future work is needed to
   explore how rats in sewers and their management impact above ground
   populations of rats and other urban wildlife.},

Title = {How close can we get? Tolerance to human approximation of invasive doves
   vs. native doves},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Human disturbance might be perceived as a threat by animals and
   interfere in their vital activities. Urbanisation generates changes in
   habitat structure that allows only a low number of species to adapt,
   which results in a decrease of species richness and an increase of the
   abundance of a few dominant species. To survive in urbanised areas,
   animals need to be highly tolerant to human approximation. One key
   characteristic of successful invasive species is their high behavioural
   plasticity. This plasticity could translate to higher chances of
   surviving in urbanised areas and becoming tough competitors for native
   species. The Eurasian collared-dove is a successful invader in Europe,
   it arrived to Mexico during the nineties and has been spreading in the
   country since. We compared its tolerance to human approximation to that
   of the already well-established feral pigeon and other native species in
   agricultural and urban sites. We found the Eurasian collared-dove is
   less tolerant to humans than the feral pigeon, but more tolerant than
   native species. Also, we observed that birds showed higher tolerance to
   humans in urban areas than in agricultural sites, regardless of the
   species. Interestingly, feral pigeons restrained their distribution to
   human settlements, and acting as a counterpart, common ground doves were
   only found in rural sites. However, the Eurasian collared-dove was
   present also in agricultural areas, which could suggest the Eurasian
   collared-dove represents a higher threat than the feral pigeon for
   native species in our study area. We highlight the importance to further
   understand the behavioural traits that could promote the Eurasian
   collared-dove invasion to better design management plans for dove
   diversity in urban areas.},

Title = {Foxes at your front door? Habitat selection and home range estimation of
   suburban red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one of the most adaptable carnivorans,
   thriving in cities across the globe. We used GPS-tracking of five
   suburban foxes across high-density residential suburbs of Perth, Western
   Australia to quantify (1) their habitat selection and (2) home range
   area. All five foxes showed statistically significant avoidance of
   residential locations (p <0.001) and preference for parkland (p <0.001),
   with native vegetation reserves, golf courses, and water reserves
   showing disproportionately greater use. Landuse category also influenced
   their movements, with foxes moving quickest (i.e., commuting) in
   proximity to roads and slowest (i.e., foraging) when they were further
   from roads. Three females had core home ranges (50\%
   autocorrelated-corrected kernel density estimate; AKDE(c)) averaging 37
   +/- 20 ha or 95\% AKDE(c) averaging 208 +/- 196 ha. One male had a 95 ha
   core home range and 349 ha 95\% AKDE(c) but the other male covered an
   area-20 times this: using a 371 ha core home range and 7,368 ha 95\%
   AKDE(c). The extensive movement patterns we describe are likely to be
   common for urban foxes, with half of published home range estimates for
   urban foxes (principally based on VHF data) excluding data for `lost'
   individuals or animals that showed `excursions'. It is likely that the
   home range estimates for these urban exploiters have therefore been
   grossly underestimated to date. Further application of GPS trackers that
   allow remote download will vastly improve our understanding of habitat
   preference and exploitation of resources by urban foxes.},

Abstract = {Human activities have more than doubled reactive nitrogen (N) deposited
   in ecosystems, perturbing the N cycle and considerably impacting plant,
   animal, and microbial communities. However, biotic responses to N
   deposition can vary widely depending on factors including local climate
   and soils, limiting our ability to predict ecosystem responses. Here, we
   synthesize reported impacts of elevated N on grasslands and draw upon
   evidence from the globally distributed Nutrient Network experiment
   (NutNet) to provide insight into causes of variation and their relative
   importance across scales. This synthesis highlights that climate and
   elevated N frequently interact, modifying biotic responses to N. It also
   demonstrates the importance of edaphic context and widespread
   interactions with other limiting nutrients in controlling biotic
   responses to N deposition.},

Title = {Landscape -scale predictors of persistence of an urban stock dove
   Columba oenas population},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 4},
Abstract = {While a few species may thrive in urban areas, urban expansion is a
   major driver of biodiversity loss. Columbids such as feral Rock Doves
   (Columba livia domestica) and Common Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus) have
   adapted extremely well to the urban environment in Europe and beyond,
   but the Stock Dove (Columba oenas), a bird of farmland and woodland edge
   in the UK and of national conservation concern, is encountered
   infrequently in urban areas. Here we explore the multi-scale landscape
   associations of the little-studied Stock Dove within the urban matrix of
   Greater Manchester, UK, in order to identify its habitat requirements.
   We built a pilot model from historical citizen science records to
   identify potentially occupied sites within the city, and then surveyed
   these sites for Stock Dove during Spring 2019. We combined the survey
   results with citizen science records from the same period and described
   the habitat and landscape characteristics of sites occupied by Stock
   Dove using four variables at different scales plus twelve unscaled
   variables. We used a three-stage random forest approach to identify a
   subset of these variables for interpretation and a subset for prediction
   for the presence of Stock Dove within these sites. Key variables for
   predicting Stock Dove presence were their relative abundance in the
   landscape immediately beyond the core urban area, the greenness (NDVI)
   of the environment around sites, and the canopy cover of individual
   trees over 20 m high within sites. Stock Doves tended to be associated
   with habitats with more surface water during the non-breeding season
   than the breeding season. Our results highlight the importance of large
   trees within urban greenspace for this cavity-nesting species, softer
   boundaries around urban sites for Stock Doves and stock dove presence in
   nearby areas. While Stock Dove share many traits with species that are
   successful in the urban environment, they remain relatively poor urban
   adapters.},

Abstract = {Plasticity-led evolution is central to evolutionary theory. Although
   challenging to study in nature, this process may be particularly
   apparent in novel environments such as cities. We document abundant
   evidence of plastic behavioral changes in urban animals, including
   learning, contextual, developmental, and transgenerational plasticities.
   Using behavioral drive as a conceptual framework, our analysis of
   notable case studies suggests that plastic behaviors, such as altered
   habitat use, migration, diurnal and seasonal activity, and courtship,
   can have faciliatory and cascading effects on urban evolution via
   spatial, temporal, and mate-choice mechanisms. Our findings highlight
   (i) the need to incorporate behavioral plasticity more formally into
   urban evolutionary research and (ii) the opportunity provided by urban
   environments to study behavioral mechanisms of plasticity-led processes.},

Abstract = {While decision-making can benefit from considering positive and negative
   out-comes of change, over the past half-century, research on non-native
   species has focused predominately on their negative impacts. Here we
   provide a frame-work for considering the positive consequences of
   non-native species relative to relational, instrumental, and intrinsic
   values. We demonstrate that their beneficial outcomes are common and
   profoundly important for human well-being. Identi-fied benefits include
   social cohesion, cultural identity, mental health, food and fuel
   production, regulation of clean waters, and attenuation of climate
   change. We argue that long-standing biases against non-native species
   within the litera-ture have clouded the scientific process and hampered
   policy advances and sound public understanding. Future research should
   consider both costs and benefits of non-native species.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ecology and evolutionary biology have focused on how organisms fit the
   environment. Less attention has been given to the idea that organisms
   can also modify their environment, and that these modifications can feed
   back to the organism, thus providing a key factor for their persistence
   and evolution. There are at least three independent lines of evidence
   emphasizing these biological feedback processes at different scales:
   niche construction (population scale); alternative biome states
   (community scale); and the Gaia hypothesis (planetary scale). These
   feedback processes make us rethink traditional concepts like niche and
   adaptation. We argue that organism-environment feedbacks must become a
   regular part of ecological thinking, especially now that the Earth is
   quickly changing.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {507-516},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Polyploidy is a major driver of evolutionary change in plants, but many
   aspects of polyploidy in natural systems remain enigmatic. We argue that
   urban landscapes present an unprecedented opportunity to observe
   polyploidy in action. Integrating polyploid biology and urban
   evolutionary ecology, we discuss multiple factors expected to promote
   polyploid formation, establishment, and persistence in urban systems. We
   develop a predictive framework for the contemporary ecology and
   evolution of polyploid plants in cities, and through this novel
   perspective propose that studying polyploidy in an urban context could
   lead to breakthroughs in understanding fundamental processes in
   polyploid evolution. We conclude by highlighting the potential
   consequences of polyploidy in urban environments, and outline a roadmap
   for research into this currently unexplored field.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {8},
Pages = {694-705},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Individual differences in growth and size of vertebrates often represent
   adaptive, plastic responses to contrasts in ecological conditions.
   Recent studies show that vertebrates can also modify their growth and
   size in an adaptive fashion in response to fine-grain changes in social
   conditions (which we refer to as strategic growth). Here, we review
   experimental evidence for strategic growth in social vertebrates. We
   describe a set of conditions under which strategic growth commonly
   occurs, and highlight potential examples of convergent evolution of
   strategic growth across the tree of life. This synthesis has
   implications for the way we think about organismal growth and size,
   because it underscores that the size of individuals can often be
   fine-tuned to their social environment.},

Title = {Is urban stream restoration really a wicked problem?},

Abstract = {The many impacts of increasing human populations and urban expansion on
   streams in the urban environment, collectively described as the urban
   stream syndrome, is well documented. Urban streams are dynamic
   environments, with complex interrelationships between stressor and
   response variables. There is a growing recognition that the social
   context of urban environments, in addition to the hydrological and
   ecological contexts, must be accounted for more completely if urban
   stream restoration projects are to be successful. The characteristic
   challenges inherent in restoring urban streams may satisfy the
   definition of a wicked problem. Overwhelmingly, participants at the
   Fifth Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology in Austin, Texas, in
   2020, identified urban stream restoration as a wicked problem. The
   approach to successfully resolving a wicked problem differs markedly
   from conventional approaches used to solve less complex problems. Thus,
   if urban stream restoration is truly a wicked problem, the unique
   management methods needed for wicked problems must be applied correctly
   for restoration efforts to be considered successful. We assess the
   literature describing the urban stream syndrome and urban stream
   restoration projects against the defining criteria of a wicked problem
   and conclude that urban stream restoration has elements of a wicked
   problem, but is not fully a wicked problem. Using social science
   literature, we offer recommendations to approaching the resolution of
   the urban stream syndrome using a collaborative governance structure to
   manage value disagreement and scientific uncertainty.},

Title = {Urbanisation and land-cover change affect functional, but not

Abstract = {Land-use and land-cover change strongly affect biodiversity patterns and
   are assumed to be growing threats in the future. Particularly increasing
   urbanisation may affect species turnover and functional composition of
   biological communities. This study aimed to assess the characteristics
   of land-cover change in a medium-sized urban municipality from 2011 to
   2018, and the effects of urbanisation on avian species- and functional
   diversity. The study was performed in Trondheim (Norway), using local
   land-cover maps and GBIF bird species occurrence records. GLMMs were
   used to model species turnover as a function of urbanisation, and the
   probability of species appearance and disappearance based on
   urbanisation and species traits. The extent of bird species turnover
   within a municipality-wide 500 x 500m(2) grid was not predicted by a
   changes in developed area, but the probability of disappearance and
   appearance of bird species varied with urbanisation and bird functional
   traits. Species associated with urban- or open areas showed a decreasing
   probability of disappearing and an increasing probability of appearing
   with increasing amount of developed area within grid cells. Similarly,
   granivorous species showed a decreasing probability of disappearing.
   Species feeding above ground-level showed positive responses to changes
   in land-cover. The probability of both appearance and disappearance,
   thus species turnover, increased with increasing longevity. Most
   functional groups respond negatively to increasing urbanisation,
   indicating a potential impoverishment of local avifauna with future
   land-cover modifications. Considering planned future land-cover changes
   within the municipality, the local avian communities are in danger of
   homogenisation. The recommendations for local management are to minimise
   conversion of vulnerable habitats, such as wetlands and woodlands, in
   particular if these are converted to developed area.},

Abstract = {The restoration of riparian habitats aims to provide habitat for birds
   and other environmental benefits; yet the evaluation of long-term
   outcomes is rare. To address this knowledge gap, we used bird and
   vegetation data from Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS), in the southern
   San Francisco Bay Area, to assess the progress of two riparian
   revegetation projects (1987 Revegetation, 1993 Revegetation) over nearly
   two decades. Restoration success was measured by changes in 1)
   vegetation structure and composition, and 2) avian abundance, diversity,
   and community composition. We compared the two revegetated areas to a
   remnant riparian reference site and a managed floodplain overflow
   channel in three time periods (1996-1998, 2004-2006, 2012-2014) using
   ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and beta diversity analysis of avian community
   composition. Over time, the restored areas became more similar to the
   remnant riparian reference site in four of seven indices. The avian
   community became more similar across the habitat areas over time,
   although differences remained. Migratory birds declined across all
   habitat areas, while resident and wintering birds declined in one
   revegetated habitat only. Overall we found that different types of data
   told different stories, indicating both convergence with the reference
   site and ongoing differences. Our findings highlight the need for
   multifaceted approaches to evaluating restoration success.},

Abstract = {Increasing plant diversity is often suggested as a way of overcoming
   some of the challenges faced by managers of intensive pasture systems,
   but it is unclear how to design the most suitable plant mixtures. Using
   innovative design theory, we identify two conceptual shifts that foster
   potentially beneficial design approaches. Firstly, reframing the goal of
   mixture design to supporting ecological integrity, rather than
   delivering lists of desired outcomes, leads to flexible design
   approaches that support context-specific solutions that should operate
   within identifiable ecological limits. Secondly, embracing, rather than
   minimising uncertainty in performance leads to adaptive approaches that
   could enhance current and future benefits of diversifying pasture. These
   two fundamental shifts could therefore accelerate the successful
   redesign of intensive pastures.},

Abstract = {Chemical pollution is among the fastest-growing agents of global change.
   Synthetic chemicals with diverse modes-of-action are being detected in
   the tissues of wildlife and pervade entire food webs. Although such
   pollutants can elicit a range of sublethal effects on individual
   organisms, research on how chemical pollutants affect animal groups is
   severely lacking. Here we synthesise research from two related, but
   largely segregated fields - ecotoxicology and behavioural ecology - to
   examine pathways by which chemical contaminants could disrupt processes
   that govern the emergence, self-organisation, and collec-tive function
   of animal groups. Our review provides a roadmap for prioritising the
   study of chemical pollutants within the context of sociality and
   highlights important methodological advancements for future research.},

Title = {Effect of urbanization on the dynamics of ecosystem services: An
   analysis for decision making in Kolkata urban agglomeration},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Urbanization has profound influence on the changes of land use and land
   cover, which on the other hand exert significant impact on ecosystem
   services and their values, especially in the urban agglomerations.
   Kolkata urban agglomeration of India has been selected to determine the
   causes in changes of ecosystem services under present and projected land
   use land cover scenario. Land use land cover maps of 1990, 2000, 2010
   and 2020 were prepared by support vector machine method, using LANDSAT
   satellite imageries and projected up-to 2040 using CA-Markov model.
   Built-up land was increased by 65.39\% during 1990-2020 and will further
   increase to 76.88\% by 2040. Built-up lands are mainly encroaching crop
   lands and wetlands. During the period of fifty years (1990-2040), the
   ecosystem service value will decrease from \$38,486.49 to \$28,060.79,
   with annual rate of decrement of 0.54\%. During the same period, the
   spatial extent of very low ecosystem service value will be increased
   from 16.60 to 58.88\%; whereas, the area coverage of very high ecosystem
   service value will be decreased from 2.69 to 2.35\%. Water supply
   contributed highest ecosystem service value followed by disturbance
   regulation and nutrient cycling; whereas, lacking in soil formation,
   pollination and biological control services contributed lowest. The
   study will help in decision making process for sustainable management of
   natural resources and also provide useful guideline for the quality
   improvement in urban ecosystems.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sessile invertebrates are frequently sampled and processed whole for
   down-stream analyses. However, their apparent structural simplicity is
   deceptive as these organisms often harbour discrete compartments. These
   compartments have physicochemical conditions that differ markedly from
   neighbouring tissues, and that have likely evolved to support specific
   functions. Here, we argue that such compartments should be specifically
   targeted when characterising sessile invertebrate biology and we use the
   coral gastrovascular cavity to support our argument. This complex
   compartment displays steep and dynamic chemical gradients, harbours
   distinct microorganisms, and presumably plays a key role in coral
   biology. Disentangling the functions played by (and amongst)
   compartments will likely provide transformative insight into the biology
   of sessile invertebrates and their future under environmental change.},

Journal = {TRENDS IN ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1104-1115},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most studies in the field of ecology and evolution aiming to connect
   genotype to phenotype rarely validate identified loci using functional
   tools. Recent develop-ments in RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered
   regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas genome editing
   have dramatically increased the feasibility of functional validation.
   However, these methods come with specific challenges when applied to
   emerging model organisms, including limited spatial control of gene
   silencing, low knock-in efficiencies, and low throughput of functional
   validation. Moreover, many functional studies to date do not
   recapitulate eco-logically relevant variation, and this limits their
   scope for deeper insights into evolutionary processes. We therefore
   argue that increased use of gene editing by allelic replacement through
   homology-directed repair (HDR) would greatly benefit the field of
   ecology and evolution.},

Abstract = {The nature of domestication is often misunderstood. Most definitions of
   the process are anthropocentric and center on human intentionality,
   which minimizes the role of unconscious selection and also excludes
   non-human domesticators. An overarching, biologically grounded
   definition of domestication is discussed, which emphasizes its core
   nature as a coevolutionary process that arises from a specialized
   mutualism, in which one species controls the fitness of another in order
   to gain resources and/or services. This inclusive definition encompasses
   both human-associated domestication of crop plants and livestock as well
   as other non-human domesticators, such as insects. It also calls into
   question the idea that humans are themselves domesticated, given that
   evolution of human traits did not arise through the control of fitness
   by another species.},

Title = {Infectious disease and cognition in wild populations},
Journal = {TRENDS IN ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {10},
Pages = {899-910},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Infectious disease is linked to impaired cognition across a breadth of
   host taxa and cognitive abilities, potentially contributing to variation
   in cognitive performance within and among populations. Impaired
   cognitive performance can stem from direct damage by the parasite, the
   host immune response, or lost opportunities for learning. Moreover,
   cognitive impairment could be compounded by factors that simultaneously
   increase infection risk and impair cognition directly, such as stress
   and malnutrition. As highlighted in this review, however, answers to
   fundamental questions remain unresolved, including the frequency,
   duration, and fitness consequences of infection-linked cognitive
   impairment in wild animal populations, the cognitive abilities most
   likely to be affected, and the potential for adaptive evolution of
   cognition in response to accelerating emergence of infectious disease.},

Journal = {TRENDS IN ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {8},
Pages = {645-654},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Organisms with external phosphatic shells diversified and became
   abundant at the beginning of the Early Paleozoic but gradually declined
   and were rare by its end. The decreasing availability of phosphorus in
   oceans is thought to be responsible for this evolutionary trend.
   Responses of organisms to changes in the phosphorus cycle can be traced
   to the late Neoproterozoic, and likely had a significant role in the
   Cambrian explosion, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event
   (GOBE), and the Devonian nekton revolution. Effective use of phosphorus
   by vertebrates during the Devonian nekton revolution caused the
   phosphorus pool to shift from benthic external shells to the skeletons
   of pelagic vertebrates, and moved the marine faunas toward the dominance
   patterns and ecological structure of the Modern Evolutionary Fauna.},

Abstract = {Extreme environments on Earth are typically devoid of macro life forms
   and are inhabited predominantly by highly adapted and specialized
   microorganisms. The discovery and persistence of these extremophiles
   provides tools to model how life arose on Earth and inform us on the
   limits of life. Fungi, in particular, are among the most
   extreme-tolerant organisms with highly versatile lifestyles and stunning
   ecological and morphological plasticity. Here, we overview the most
   notable examples of extremophilic and stress-tolerant fungi,
   highlighting their key roles in the functionality and balance of extreme
   ecosystems. The re-markable ability of fungi to tolerate and even thrive
   in the most extreme environ-ments, which preclude most organisms, have
   reshaped current concepts regarding the limits of life on Earth.},

Title = {Castanea dentata Interactions and Ectomycorrhizal Colonization in Novel
   Ecosystems},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Trial plantings of Castanea dentata (American chestnut) are currently
   underway using reclaimed surface mines as reintroduction sites for
   hybrids bred for disease resistance to canker causing Cryphonectria
   parasitica (chestnut blight). Coalfields of the eastern US coincide with
   the species range, but little is known of its ecological interactions as
   it had largely been extirpated from the landscape by the 1940s.
   Non-native species such as Lespedeza cuneata (sericea lespedeza) have
   been planted extensively in the region for both agriculture and mine
   reclamation and often dominate disturbed sites to form novel systems in
   place of native forests. We investigated the influence of herbaceous
   species on BC2F3 chestnut hybrid establishment and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   root colonization on three surface mines in eastern Tennessee that were
   restored using methods to avoid soil compaction. Hybrid chestnut growth,
   vegetation density, and species composition surrounding each seedling
   was assessed after eight growing seasons. ECM fungi present on root
   samples was quantified and identified by DNA sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Sites differed significantly in
   herbaceous cover and seedling growth. Larger seedlings were found on the
   site that was comprised primarily of L. cuneata. Average ECM
   colonization was similar across sites, and groundcover vegetation
   diversity or L. cuneata did not influence ECM species richness. There
   was a difference in ECM community composition among the three sites with
   some fungi displaying subtle changes in species rank. Results suggest
   that in the absence of soil compaction, L. cuneata does not impede
   hybrid chestnut establishment or ECM root colonization in Appalachian
   afforestation projects.},

Title = {Comparison of the Absolute and Relative Difference Spectral Indices to
   Estimate Burn Severity: The Case of Endangered Nothofagus alessandrii
   (ruil)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accurate information is needed about burn severity caused by fires to
   design strategies for ecosystem recovery. The Mediterranean zone of
   Chile holds a high level of plant endemism. In summer 2017, nearly half
   a million hectares were severely burnt by fire in this zone. In this
   paper, we assessed the performance of three spectral indices used in
   mapping burn severity (difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}dNBR],
   Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}RdNBR], and Relativized
   Burn Ratio {[}RBR]) on fragmented populations of the endangered ruil
   tree Nothofagus alessandrii, an endemic species of central Chile. The
   indices were obtained from Sentinel 2 images and their results
   contrasted with field measurements of severity recorded using the
   Composite Burn Index (CBI). The indices estimated the severity
   categories with a high overall accuracy obtained from error matrices and
   reaching values of 77.3, 76.0 and 69.3\% for RdNBR, RBR, and dNBR,
   respectively. The surface estimated for the categories without damage
   (ND), low (L), and medium (M) were greater for the RdNBR and RBR indices
   than for the dNBR, while an opposite tendency was observed for the high
   severity category (H). Our results properly described the spatial
   variability of burn severity. This information may be useful for
   creating and managing plans for the recovery of highly fragmented and
   threatened deciduous ecosystems such as those dominated by ruil. We
   suggest that strategies for recovery or restoration should be oriented
   to the high fire severity zones, where reproductive individuals were
   lost, and the successful seedling recruitment is expected to diminish.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {9},
Pages = {749-758},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Grasses fuel most fires on Earth and strongly influence local fire
   behaviour through traits that determine how flammable they are.
   Therefore, grass communities that differ in their species and trait
   compositions give rise to significant spatial variation in savanna fire
   regimes across the world, which cannot be otherwise explained. Likewise,
   fire regimes are continuously modified by alterations to savanna grass
   community traits, through species introductions and climatic changes.
   However, current representation of grassy fuels in global fire models
   misses important varia-tion and therefore limits predictive power. The
   inclusion of grass trait diversity in models, using remotely sensed
   trait proxies, for example, will greatly improve our ability to
   understand and project savanna fires and their roles in the Earth
   system.},

Title = {Estimating the pollination supply of urban green spaces to determine
   suitable areas for urban agriculture in the city of Tehran},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 20},
Abstract = {Identifying urban areas with a high potential for providing pollination
   is essential for the management of urban agriculture. Urban green spaces
   have a vital role in providing nesting and foraging habitats for
   pollinators, and they act as pollinator refuges in cities. Therefore,
   regions adjacent to green spaces can host agricultural products in dire
   need of pollinators for their produce. To determine the suitable areas
   for urban agriculture according to the proximity to urban green spaces,
   we used two models, the Lonsdorf and the graph theory models. The
   Lonsdorf model focuses more on the capacity of the patches to support
   pollinators but graph theory methods on the connectivity between the
   patches. According to graph theory, a set of patches with functional
   connectivity for pollinators can lead to the formation of clusters
   around them. Each of these clusters has a certain potential for
   supplying pollination for urban agricultural products. Both models
   estimate the capacity of patches in supplying pollination services based
   on the distances at which bees can fly. To test the robustness of the
   results of each model, we perform both models at distances of 500, 700,
   1000, and 1500 m as maximum foraging distances of bees. Our results
   suggested that both models showed similar results in determining
   suitable areas for urban agriculture. Both models showed that the
   northern and northeastern regions of Tehran were the most suitable areas
   for urban agriculture and have a high potential to support the
   pollinator population. In contrast, the central regions had a low
   capacity to maintain pollinators for urban agriculture, and had little
   support from wild bees for pollination. Our results also showed that the
   conversion of bare lands into green spaces could significantly increase
   the pollination level in Tehran city.},

Title = {Characteristics of the urban sewer system and rat presence in Seattle},

Abstract = {Rats are abundant and ubiquitous in urban environments. There has been
   increasing attention to the need for evidence-based, integrated rat
   management and surveillance approaches because rats can compromise
   public health and impose economic costs. Yet there are few studies that
   characterize rat distributions in sewers and there are no studies that
   incorporate the complexity of sewer networks that encompass multiple
   sewer lines, all comprised of their own unique characteristics. To
   address this knowledge gap, this study identifies sewer characteristics
   that are associated with rat presence in the city of Seattle's urban
   sewer system. We obtained sewer baiting data from 1752 geotagged
   manholes to monitor rat presence and constructed generalized additive
   models to account for spatial autocorrelation. Sewer rats were unevenly
   distributed across sampled manholes with clusters of higher rat presence
   at upper elevations, within sanitary pipes, narrower pipes, pipes at a
   shallower depth, and older pipes. These findings are important because
   identifying features of urban sewers that promote rat presence may allow
   municipalities to target areas for rat control activities and sewer
   maintenance. These findings suggest the need to evaluate additional
   characteristics of the surface environment and identify the factors
   driving rat movement within sewers, across the surface, and between the
   surface and the sewers.},

Abstract = {Indicators to predict ecosystem state change are urgently needed to cope
   with the degradation of ecosystem services caused by global change. With
   the development of new technologies for measuring ecosystem function
   with fine spatiotemporal resolution over broad areas, we are in the era
   of `big data'. However, it is unclear how large, emerging datasets can
   be used to anticipate ecosystem state change. We propose the
   construction of indicators based on functional variables (flows) and
   state variables (pools) to predict future ecosystem state changes. The
   indicators identified here may be useful signals for doing so. In
   addition, functional indicators have explicit ecological meanings that
   can identify the ecological mechanism that is causing state changes, and
   can thus be used to improve ecosystem models.},

Abstract = {Urban environments pose many challenges to wildlife, not least for
   insectivorous passerines. Numerous studies have reported on the negative
   effects of urbanization on reproduction in these species. However,
   depending on the taxa and cities studied, no particular or positive
   effects have been reported. This may be related to the different levels
   of urban environmental stressors. As unfavorable weather can have
   deleterious effects on birds (e.g. lower prey availability and higher
   costs of pollutants), annual variations in the differences observed
   between sites could be related to synergetic effects between the urban
   environment and weather conditions. In this context, we studied the
   reproduction of great tit (Parus major) at two sites (urban and forest)
   over four years. First, we quantified pollution, prey availability, and
   vegetal cover at each site to characterize each environment. Second, we
   measured the effects of site and weather conditions on tit reproductive
   success to determine if the influence of weather is higher in the city.
   Except for the fledging rate, reproductive parameters were lower in the
   city than in the forest whatever the year probably because of poorer
   food availability and a predominance of non-vegetated areas in cities.
   The fledging rate and the nestling number in the urban environment were
   positively correlated to temperatures during rearing whereas there was
   no significant correlations in the forest. These results support the
   hypothesis of additive effects of urban constraints and weather that
   limit bird productivity in cities.},

Title = {College squirrels gone wild? Using Sciurus carolinensis behavior to
   assess the ecosystem value of urban green spaces},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 23},
Abstract = {Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating
   biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that
   promotes, rather than displaces, native plants and animals. One approach
   for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of ``green
   infrastructure{''}. Although research has explored urban-rural gradients
   and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have
   investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban
   greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving
   up-densities (GUDs), to compare foraging costs for a common urban
   wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
   among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college
   campuses, and residential yards. We found that GUDs for gray squirrels
   did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling
   for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with
   significantly higher GUDs in all locations. In an explicit test, we also
   found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated
   with higher GUDs. We also found that maximum distance from roads was
   significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards,
   indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is
   ``away from roads{''} compared to residential yards. Our results
   indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an ``urban
   landscape of fear{''} for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and
   park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat
   quality for squirrels and possibly other animals.},

Abstract = {Andean rivers support an amazing biodiversity and provide important
   environmental services for Andean landscapes like water for agriculture
   and human consumption. Urban areas in Andean countries have grown at an
   accelerated rate in the last decades. As a consequence, a lack of
   wastewater treatment and riparian preservation have threatened these
   streams. We studied urban, agricultural, and well-preserved streams in
   the Upper Guayllabamba River Basin, where Quito, the capital city of
   Ecuador, is located. We found an aquatic insect richness loss of 78\% in
   urban impacted streams. Urbanization extent within a watershed was
   strongly related to pollution and water quality decline, and aquatic
   insect community composition shifts to less diverse assemblages. Urban
   streams in Quito have lost most of their biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. However, they are important green areas for citizens and
   deserve better attention. Well-preserved streams in the area need
   protection since they host a rich biodiversity that we are starting to
   describe.},

Title = {Hurricane driven changes in vegetation structure and ecosystem services

Abstract = {Urban forests are valuable spaces for species conservation, protection
   of local biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. However, they
   are also vulnerable to the impact of extreme climate events like
   hurricanes. Understanding how urban forests are responding to hurricane
   disturbances is crucial to improve their design, management, and
   resilience. Here we analyzed pre-and post-hurricane vegetation surveys
   in 52 residential yards in San Juan to assess urban forest responses
   after Hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted Puerto Rico in 2017. We used
   these surveys to compare vegetation structure and composition (including
   species-specific mortality and damage rates) and to quantify changes in
   the ecosystem services provided by these yards. We found that hurricane
   disturbances significantly altered the structure but not the composition
   of yard vegetation. We detected a 27\% reduction and 31\% mortality of
   standing stems, and a significant reduction in plants health. Yard
   species composition was dominated by non-native species and this trend
   did not change with hurricane disturbance. Changes in vegetation
   structure translated into substantial reductions in ecosystem services.
   Food provision, an important service provided by a large proportion of
   yards before the hurricane, reported the highest reduction (41.9\%)
   while carbon storage was the service that changed the least (9\%). Our
   combined results emphasize the key role played by residential yards
   providing ecosystem services in tropical cities and call for further
   efforts to manage private and public urban forests in ways that may
   ensure their resilience to mitigate extreme climate events, provide
   multiple ecosystem services, and promote long-term urban sustainability.},

Abstract = {Urban ecosystems are dynamic and complex, with human disturbances that
   lead to biotic homogenization. We consider the changes suffered by the
   diversity of tardigrades in Santa Rosa city (Argentina) under different
   intensity of vehicular traffic (high, medium and low), evaluating
   whether there are biotic and abiotic factors that can influence the
   structuring of their communities. Moss and lichen samples were extracted
   and studied, and different environmental variables, microhabitat, and
   substrate were measured. Eight species were recorded. Habitat with high
   vehicular traffic contained the highest tardigrade abundance; while low
   vehicular traffic had the highest species richness. The assemblages of
   the three urban communities were different, with a strong dominance of
   three species: Milnesium quiranae, Ramazzottius oberhaeuseri and
   Macrobiotus kristenseni. Milnesium kogui turned out to be an indicator
   species for high vehicular traffic community. Ordination analysis showed
   a nesting pattern in the studied urban habitats, showing a high turnover
   of species in the high vehicular traffic community, while in medium
   vehicular traffic community a high nesting. There was a high loss of
   species in habitat with low vehicular traffic, while in the habitat with
   medium and high vehicular traffic there was a high turnover of species.
   The observed nesting pattern could be explained by the loss of
   microhabitat due to the replacement of urban trees.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal assessment of land surface temperature and vegetation in
   tropical urban areas},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 21},
Abstract = {Land use intensification and expansion in urban areas increases land
   surface temperature (LST). Several studies have developed to evaluate
   the LST and its drivers in the world, but few of them have addressed the
   annual and seasonal effects in urban areas located in tropical regions.
   This study assesses the spatiotemporal relationship between LST, green
   vegetation cover, and built-up areas in Brasilia, Federal District,
   Brazil. We used time series of Landsat images (2000-2019) to retrieve
   the LST and compare it with the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and surface urban
   heat island (SUHI). Based on our results, the NDVI values increased from
   0.46 to 0.58 between 2000 and 2019. A similar increasing trend was
   observed for LST (24.9 degrees C in 2000; 32.4 degrees C in 2019), which
   indicates that the magnitude of increase of urban vegetation cover was
   not able to reduce LST. The highest average LST and SUHI values were
   observed during local spring season (September to December; 41.9 degrees
   C and -3.2 degrees C, respectively). During the autumn (March to June)
   and winter (June to September) seasons, we observed a progressive
   increasing trend of the LST values. The NDVI explained 80\% of the
   surface temperature variation within areas of native vegetation and 53\%
   in urban areas. Based on our assessment of the spatiotemporal changes of
   the LST as a function of normalized difference vegetation and urban
   spectral indices, we provided crucial information to support urban green
   cover planning and management that, ultimately, will improve the
   population's well-being.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation has increasingly encroached on numerous bird species'
   natural habitats, generally negatively affecting their persistence.
   Furthermore, increased human-wildlife interactions may benefit or be
   detrimental to the long term persistence of these species. The Spotted
   Thick-knee (Burhinus capensis), a ground-nesting species, persists in
   some mosaic urban landscapes in South Africa. We, therefore, assessed
   the presence of Spotted Thick-knees and their interactions with humans
   in the fragmented natural and human-modified landscape of
   Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. We conducted presence-only surveys at
   52 locations between July 2019 and December 2020. `Presence' locations
   for Spotted Thick-knee were identified via active surveying and public
   participation. Newspaper articles were distributed in June 2019,
   requesting information on Spotted Thick-knee sightings. Questionnaires
   were also sent to respondents to collect qualitative information
   regarding their perceptions and observations of this species in
   Pietermaritzburg. We established that the presence of Spotted
   Thick-knee's at known locations was not random. They were present at 30
   out of 52 sites for 75\% of this study's duration. Fewer sites had
   Spotted Thick-knees present during non-breeding months than breeding
   months. Respondents' feedback highlighted the pressures associated with
   Spotted Thick-knees persistence in human-modified mosaic landscapes,
   particularly predation and disturbance by domestic pets. Our study
   highlights that some ground-nesting birds, such as Spotted Thick-knees,
   persist in mosaic urban landscapes, despite the anthropogenic pressures.
   This study highlights the need to address the paucity of studies on
   ground-nesting birds in mosaic urban landscapes to determine general
   trends.},

Title = {How urbanization and industrialization shape breeding bird species
   occurrence in coastal Mediterranean oasis system},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 17},
Abstract = {Urban sprawl and atmospheric pollution have a tremendous impact on the
   environment and threatenthe survival of wildlife. Understanding the
   response of birds to these pressing threats is imperative to plan
   relevant management policies. Here, we investigated the responses of 17
   breeding bird species to urbanization and industrialization on 11
   South-Eastern Tunisian coastal oases. The generalized linear mixed model
   analysis revealed that six species, namely Rufous-tailed Scrub-Robin,
   Woodchat Shrike, European turtle-dove, European Serin, Common Chaffinch
   and Orphean Warbler, were urban avoiders. Among these species, the
   Rufous-tailed Scrub-Robin has the lowest affinity for oases close to
   urban areas. However, the Eurasian Collared-Dove was the largest user of
   oases localized near urban areas. Our results showed that eight species,
   namely Great grey shrike, European Turtle-dove, Eurasian Collared-Dove,
   Common Chaffinch, Common Blackbird, European Serin, Laughing Dove and
   Orphean Warbler, had more occurrences far away from highly
   industrialized areas. For the remaining species (n = 9), the effect of
   proximity to the industrial complex was not significant. Furthermore,
   our results highlighted the robustness of the distance to the industrial
   complex in shaping the occurrences of the breeding birds compared to

Title = {Effects of urban land-use types on avifauna assemblage in a rapidly
   developing urban settlement in Ghana},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 22},
Abstract = {Given that rates of urbanization are rising globally, the need to
   maintain and enhance urban biodiversity has become important. This study
   examines the relative influence of different land-use types as well as
   environmental resources (trees, flowering trees, fruiting trees, shrubs,
   telecommunication mast, pylons, electric poles, buildings) on bird
   diversity indicators in a rapidly developing urban settlement in Ghana.
   Remote sensing was used to estimate the extent of conversion of natural
   habitats into urban settlements. Using point count surveys, bird species
   were recorded and compared in randomly selected plots of four land-use
   types of farmlands, remnant forest, residential and commercial areas. We
   further evaluated the relative influence of habitat resources on bird
   diversity indicators. We found a significant expansion of built-up areas
   into natural habitats in the study area. Also, there has been a
   significant increase in sparse vegetation coupled with a drop in the
   area covered by dense vegetation over the last three decades. Avifauna
   diversity indicators differ significantly across the four land-use types
   with urban farmlands being the most species diverse, followed by urban
   remnant forests, then residential and finally commercial areas. Our
   findings suggest that avian species diversity indicators decreased
   significantly with increasing land-use intensity and revealed that the
   study area still possesses significant conservation potentials for urban
   birds and by extension biological diversity as long as vegetation
   fragments are maintained within a sustained urban expansion framework.
   We propose increasing the quantity and complexity of the vegetation
   cover in residential areas by supporting citizens to establish private
   yards to increase the city's green network.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1577-1588},

Abstract = {The popularity and use of green infrastructure measures such as green
   roofs, green walls, and curb extensions is growing, especially in dense
   urban areas. At the same time, from an ecosystem services perspective,
   interest in urban nature and reconciliation ecology is underlined.
   Attempts to introduce more biodiverse vegetation in cities can conflict
   with the responses of some urbanites to the appearance of ``wild{''}
   vegetation. Through semi-structured interviews with 47 randomly picked
   bypassers in Copenhagen, Denmark, this study explored urbanites'
   aesthetical perceptions of wild vegetation, especially of three green
   infrastructure types employed in landscape-based stormwater management:
   green roofs, green walls and curb extensions. The results confirm the
   importance of the physical plant properties, especially the color of
   plants and the presence of flowers; they point also to the strong
   influence of cultural factors, especially familiarity with a site or a
   similar project, and knowledge of the project's environmental value.
   Interestingly, the results indicate that cultural factors might be
   capable of garnering support for a project among people whose initial
   impression of its appearance was negative. Additionally, affective and
   emotive responses were found to be of significance. Compared to other
   studies, perceptions of wild vegetation in green infrastructure elements
   prove to be perceived more positively than reported previously.},

Title = {Detecting nestedness in city parks for urban biodiversity conservation},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1839-1850},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental
   and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban
   areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant
   metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using
   ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among
   16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental
   factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant
   nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated
   strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for
   sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use
   had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles,
   frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should
   consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation
   guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of
   woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure.
   Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related
   to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and
   the neighbouring parks. Moreover, the exotic species were found to
   affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the
   current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic
   species on the native biotasassemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to
   be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation
   due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that
   conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large
   areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and
   increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various
   vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of
   urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of
   metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation
   in urban areas.},

Title = {Using crushed waste bricks for urban greening with contrasting grassland

Abstract = {Ecological restoration aims at supporting biodiversity and ecosystem
   services, and urban greening is a great opportunity to achieve this
   goal. This is facilitated by species-rich seed mixtures based on local
   provenances, which are designed for certain nutrient and moisture
   regimes based on functional plant traits. Such grassland mixtures might
   be cultivated on crushed waste bricks, which would be a new component of
   water-holding urban substrates. Thus, we studied the effects of brick
   quantity and quality, acid pre-treatment of bricks, soil type and
   moisture on biomass of designed seed mixtures. Three greenhouse
   experiments were conducted, with substrates consisting of different
   brick ratios (5\% vs. 30\%), brick types (clean production waste vs.
   demolition material), and brick treatments (acid vs. control) tested on
   three trait-based mixtures and a non-regional commercial standard
   mixture. The trait-based mixtures included information on specific leaf
   area, seed mass and grass-to-legume ratio. There were no negative
   effects of demolition bricks, soil texture and moisture on grassland
   biomass. Acid-treated clean porous bricks improved biomass production of
   the standard and intermediate mixtures, while the effect was minimal
   with demolition bricks. Designed seed mixtures had a biomass similar to
   the standard mixture under dry conditions but did not benefit from high
   moisture like the standard mixture. In conclusion, waste bricks are a
   useful additive for urban restoration substrates to save raw material,
   and specifically designed regional mixtures can replace commercial
   grassland types on these substrates.},

Abstract = {Tree cover is an important aspect of environmental quality and quality
   of life, but is declining in many metropolitan regions. This study
   examines tree cover and its relationship with scale in a type of
   suburban green space that is common in the United States, residential
   open space. A variety of urban and residential tree cover studies exist,
   but none examine the factors that explain the tree cover in these small
   open spaces, which have the potential to support significant
   conservation value in developed and developing areas. This study uses
   remote sensing, GIS analysis, and spatial statistics to examine the
   characteristics and configuration of 1,900 parcels of residential open
   space in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the
   northeastern United States. As no appropriate scale has yet been
   established, it examines two, the subdivision-scale and census
   tract-scale, in this initial exploration. Results indicate that tree
   cover is strongly positively associated with regional residential tree
   cover and the presence of waterways and negatively correlated with
   attached dwelling units and farmland. But while these variables have the
   most explanatory power, open space connectivity and local government
   ownership, both positively associated with tree cover, are also
   significant and have clearer implications for open space planners and
   decision-makers. Findings also highlight the benefits of examining
   multiple scales of effect in complex suburban landscapes.},

Abstract = {Green Infrastructure (GI) is gaining wide recognition in cooperative
   research projects seeking to find solutions for climate adaptation in
   urbanized areas. However, the potential effects of co-produced GI plans
   and the underlying preparation process are rarely evaluated. To bridge
   this gap, the aim of this article is to examine what works in addressing
   environmental burdens in the urban neighborhood of Dortmund Marten,
   Germany. As part of a larger transdisciplinary process, selective GI
   measures were delineated in the case study area through a cooperative
   workshop between scientists and urban planners. Workshop ideas were
   incorporated into a mitigative scenario considering a hot summer day to
   quantify the effects of the derived GI measures on thermal comfort and
   particulate matter dispersion (PM10 and PM2.5). To evaluate the
   experiences of the science-practice collaboration, the viewpoints of
   researchers and urban planners on learning effects, knowledge
   integration, and GI planning were summarized and compared via an online
   survey. The results indicate that the proposed GI measures could reduce
   physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 25 degrees C. At the same
   time, additional roadside trees could increase PM10 concentrations by up
   to 36 mu g/m(3) due to wind blocking effects. Reflections on the
   science-practice workshop show that learning effects were higher for the
   participating researchers than for planning practitioners, while the
   integration of individual expertise during the workshop was more
   difficult for academics. These findings point to the importance of
   continuous reflections on individual understandings in cooperating
   stakeholder groups and the value of the evaluation of outcomes in
   transdisciplinary GI planning.},

Abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements trigger speciation by acting as barriers to
   gene flow. However, the underlying theory was developed with monocentric
   chromosomes in mind. Holocentric chromosomes, lacking a centromeric
   region, have repeatedly evolved and account for a significant fraction
   of extant biodiversity. Because chromosomal rearrangements may be more
   likely retained in holocentric species, holocentricity could provide a
   twist to chromosomal speciation. Here, we discuss how the abundance of
   chromosome-scale genomes, combined with novel analytical tools, offer
   the opportunity to assess the impacts of chromosomal rearrangements on
   rates of speciation by outlining a phylogenetic framework that aligns
   with the two major lines of chromosomal speciation theory. We further
   highlight how holocentric species could help to test for causal roles of
   chromosomal rearrangements in speciation.},

Title = {Soil properties that differentiate urban land use types with different
   surface geology in Southwest Nigeria},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 5},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities associated with urbanization directly and
   indirectly impact soil properties. We evaluated the influence of five
   urban land uses (commercial, institutional, residential, wetland and
   urban agriculture) and surface geology (basement complex granite and
   gneiss, and sedimentary sandstone) on soil physical, chemical, and
   biological properties at 0-20 cm depth in Akure and Okitipupa, southwest
   Nigeria. There were significant differences in the main effect of land
   use and surface geology on soil properties. In general, wetland
   properties were significantly different from other urban land uses.
   Wetlands had the lowest bulk density (BD) (1.24 +/- 0.06 Mg m(- 3))
   which was significantly different from agriculture (1.34 +/- 0.04 Mg m(-
   3)), institutional (1.39 +/- 0.05 Mg m(- 3)), residential (1.44 +/- 0.03
   Mg m(- 3)) and commercial (1.45 +/- 0.02 Mg m(- 3)). When compared with
   wetlands, available phosphorus (AvP) was lower by 64, 50, 28 and 43\%
   respectively under institutional, commercial, agriculture and
   residential plots, while the corresponding values in microbial biomass
   nitrogen (MBN) were 24, 23, 9 and 29\% respectively. Sodium (Na) and
   cadmium (Cd) in soils formed from the basement complex was almost twice
   as high than sedimentary sandstone. Soils formed from sedimentary
   sandstone had significantly lower electrical conductivity (EC) (0.18 +/-
   0.01 dS m(- 1)) and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) (16.6 +/-
   0.4 mg N kg(- 1) soil) than from the basement complex (EC: 0.37 +/- 0.03
   dS m(- 1)) and (PMN: 36.7 +/- 1.1 mg N kg(- 1) soil). Analysis of
   variance showed significant interaction effect of land use and surface
   geology on BD, MBN, PMN and AvP. Canonical discriminant analysis
   revealed that MBN, BD, Cd and AvP explained 80\% of the variance
   observed in the urban land use soil properties while, sand, silt, Na,
   PMN and pH explained most of the variation in soil properties with
   surface geology. Results have shown that the distribution of urban soil
   properties in Akure and Okitipupa are influenced by the
   non-anthropogenic background geology, and that the soils are susceptible
   to physical disturbance and heavy metal contamination that can impact
   negatively their ability to perform ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of current research is to quantify multiple Ecosystem
   Services (ESs) for the Ilam dam watershed, Western Iran. In this sense,
   the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)
   was applied to quantify water yield, sediment retention, and habitat
   quality, and Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) to model recreation
   for the current landscape (here 2021). Due to the inevitable exchanges
   between different types of ESs, in this study, Getis-ord Gi {*}
   statistics were also used to describe the characteristics of service
   bundles spatial variation. This tool is used to measure spatial clusters
   - i.e. hotspots and coldspot -within the grid, which helps prioritize
   conservation measures. The results show that changes in water yield are
   mainly influenced by changes in precipitation, sediment retention and
   other actions of multiple factors such as Land use/cover (LULC) type,
   precipitation and temperature, while changes in recreation and habitat
   quality have the most dominant influence by LULC type. Moreover, the
   results of the spatial ESs bundle indicate that the hotspots show high
   value for a wide variety of services, which are occupied by high forests
   and grassland proportions. Otherwise, the ESs coldspots bundle has
   shallow values for most of the services. The low percentage of current
   hotspots indicates the difficulty of obtaining multiple ESs from one
   area, suggesting a protective priority to stop the loss of various
   services. Given that the increasing demand for ESs has put a lot of
   pressure on natural ecosystems, politicians and urban decision makers
   need to focus on the sustainable use of ecosystems so that the supply of
   ESs is not disrupted. Hence, this research can be crucial as detailed
   instructions to raise politician's awareness and design a policy on ESs.},

Title = {Public perception of urban wildlife during a COVID-19 stay-at-home
   quarantine order in Chicago},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 30},
Abstract = {Reduced human activity to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic
   was accompanied by reports of unusual wildlife sightings in highly
   developed areas. Such experiences with urban nature may have helped
   residents cope with the stress of the pandemic and increased public
   interest in urban wildlife; however, this may depend on the species
   residents encountered. In this study, we surveyed Chicago, Illinois, USA
   residents during a stay-at-home order to understand if residents in more
   affluent or greener neighborhoods saw more wildlife species. We also
   evaluated whether encounters with pest and non-pest species were
   associated with residents' values about wildlife. Of 593 responses
   included in our analyses, respondents in higher-income and greener
   neighborhoods were more likely to perceive increased wildlife sightings
   and respondents in higher-income areas reported observing a higher
   number common birds and mammals. Support for seeing wildlife in
   residential areas was associated with seeing passerine birds and not
   seeing rats during the stay-at-home order. Our results suggest that
   perceived increases in wildlife sightings were common during a
   stay-at-home order, especially for affluent residents, and that
   residents' perceptions depended on the species encountered.
   Understanding how changes in human behavior modifies human-wildlife
   interactions can help mitigate human-wildlife conflict and foster
   positive engagement with local wildlife.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation drives overall declines in insect pollinators. Although
   urban green spaces can provide suitable habitat for pollinators much
   remains to be learned about how urban landscapes either promote or
   negatively impact pollinators. We investigated how backyard design,
   local (100 m) and landscape (500 m) scale vegetation cover and human
   population density were associated with non-eusocial native bee species,
   eusocial bees (Apis mellifera and Tetragonula spp.), and hoverflies, in
   residential green spaces of the subtropical city Brisbane, Australia. We
   found that associations between bee abundance and vegetation cover were
   moderated by human density, but the direction of this effect differed
   for non-eusocial and eusocial species. Non-eusocial bee abundance was
   positively associated with tree cover at local and landscape scales when
   human densities were low, but negatively so at high human population
   densities. We suggest this may be because the quality of vegetation for
   non-eusocial bees deteriorates as human density increases. In contrast,
   abundance of eusocial bees was negatively associated with increasing
   local cover of grass and shrubs at low levels of human density, but
   positively associated at high densities. This affinity to humans could
   partly be explained by domesticated ``kept{''} hives. We found no effect
   of urban gradients on bee species richness. Hoverfly abundance was
   negatively related to human density and positively related to vegetation
   cover at local and landscape scales. At the backyard scale, both bee
   species richness and bee and hoverfly abundances were positively
   associated to flower abundance. Backyards with more vegetation cover had
   higher densities of non-eusocial bees. Our results thus support the idea
   that urban greening in densely populated areas at multiple spatial
   scales can benefit a range of insect pollinators.},

Abstract = {Soil microbes play important roles in many terrestrial ecological
   processes. Rapid urbanization causes drastic changes in land use and
   land cover, thus forming a heterogeneous environmental gradient and
   directly or indirectly affecting the composition and function of soil
   microbial communities. To investigate the effects of rapid urbanization
   on soil microbial community composition and function, we analyzed soil
   microbial communities by quantifying phospholipid fatty acids among the
   land cover categories (rural forests, urban low-impacted forest
   fragments, urban high-impacted forest fragments, and urban parks) in
   Guangzhou. We found that soil microbial communities differed across this
   urbanization gradients. Specifically, compared to the rural forest
   ecosystems, the biomass of Actinobacteria and gram-positive bacteria in
   urban high-impacted forest fragments ecosystems were 53.8\% and 31.23\%
   greater, respectively, while the biomass of Actinobacteria and
   gram-positive bacteria in urban park ecosystems were 67.8\% and 37.45\%
   greater respectively. Microbial communities of rural forests and urban
   low-impacted forest fragments, characterized by lower urbanization
   intensity, were dominated by the microbial groups, 19:0cy, i16:0, i15:0,
   15:0, 18:0 (bacterial biomarkers), 18:2 omega 6c (fungal biomarkers),
   and 10Me17:0 (Actinobacterial biomarkers), whereas the urban park and
   urban high-impacted forest fragments, characterized by higher
   urbanization intensity were dominated by the microbial groups, 18:1
   omega 5c, 18:1 omega 7c, cy17:0, i17;0, a17:0, 16:1 omega 9c, a15:0,
   i14:0 (bacterial biomarkers), 16:1 omega 5c (fungal biomarkers), and
   10Me16:0 (Actinobacterial biomarkers). Fungal biomass was positively
   correlated with soil pH and the metal comprehensive index, whereas
   bacteria were only positively correlated with soil organic matter. Soil
   pH, organic matter, total nitrogen content and the heavy metal
   comprehensive index were all positively correlated with total soil
   microbial biomass and Actinobacterial biomass. These results suggest
   that rapid urbanization caused land use and land cover changes that
   significantly affect soil microbial community composition, and
   urbanization impacts soil properties which then affect soil microbes.},

Abstract = {Pollination services are a frequently overlooked component of urban
   ecosystems. As cities look to become more sustainable and incorporate
   more urban green spaces, these pollinator services are coming to the
   forefront, and educating the public about the habitat and foraging needs
   of urban pollinators is becoming more important. Increasingly popular
   features in urban gardens are ``bug hotels{''}, which are artificial
   structures that humans can install to create habitat or shelter for
   urban insect pollinators. In a college-level Urban Ecology class, we use
   a structured classroom activity to teach students about pollinator
   needs, but also place the activity in a larger context of a discussion
   about the value of urban landscapes, as well as the importance of
   evaluating sources of information. Here we describe the steps of a
   research activity that students undertake to design a ``bug hotel{''},
   as well as suggestions for how to extend the activity beyond the
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The field of paleolimnology has made tremendous progress in
   reconstructing past biotic and abiotic environmental conditions of
   aquatic ecosystems based on sediment records. This, together with the
   rapid development of molecular technologies, provides new opportunities
   for studying evolutionary processes affecting lacustrine communities
   over multicentennial to millennial timescales. From an evolutionary
   perspective, such analyses provide important insights into the
   chronology of past environmental conditions, the dynamics of phenotypic
   evolution, and species diversification. Here, we review recent advances
   in paleolimnological, paleogenetic, and molecular approaches and
   highlight how their integrative use can help us better understand the
   ecological and evolutionary responses of species and communities to
   environmental change.},

Abstract = {In an increasingly urbanized world, there is a need to study urban areas
   as their own class of ecosystems as well as assess the impacts of
   anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. However, collecting a sufficient
   number of species observations to estimate patterns of biodiversity in a
   city can be costly. Here we investigated the use of community
   science-based data on species occurrences, combined with species
   distribution models (SDMs), built using MaxEnt and remotely-sensed
   measures of the environment, to predict the distribution of a number of
   species across the urban environment of Los Angeles. By selecting
   species with the most accurate SDMs, and then summarizing these by
   class, we were able to produce two species richness models (SRMs) to
   predict biodiversity patterns for species in the class Aves and
   Magnoliopsida and how they respond to a variety of natural and
   anthropogenic environmental gradients. We found that species considered
   native to Los Angeles tend to have significantly more accurate SDMs than
   their non-native counterparts. For all species considered in this study
   we found environmental variables describing anthropogenic activities,
   such as housing density and alterations to land cover, tend to be more
   influential than natural factors, such as terrain and proximity to
   freshwater, in shaping SDMs. Using a random forest model we found our
   SRMs could account for approximately 54\% and 62\% of the predicted
   variation in species richness for species in the classes Aves and
   Magnoliopsida respectively. Using community science-based species
   occurrences, SRMs can be used to model patterns of urban biodiversity
   and assess the roles of environmental factors in shaping them.},

Title = {Phenology of grassland plants responds to urbanization},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Understanding phenological responses of plants to changing temperatures
   is important because of multiple associated ecological consequences.
   Cities with their urban heat island can be used as laboratories to study
   phenological adaptation to climate change. However, previous phenology
   studies focused on trees and did not disentangle the role of
   micro-climate and urban structures. We studied reproductive phenology of
   dry grassland species in response to micro-climate and urbanization in
   Berlin, Germany. Phenological stages were recorded weekly at the
   individual plant level for five native grassland species across 30 dry
   grassland sites along an urbanization and temperature gradient. We
   estimated 50\% onset probabilities for flowering and seed maturation of
   populations, and analysed variation in onset dates using regression
   models. Early flowering species significantly advanced flowering
   phenology with increasing mean air temperature but were little
   influenced by urbanization. By contrast, late-flowering species showed
   significant phenological responses to both air temperature and
   urbanization, possibly because micro-climate was most affected by
   urbanization in late summer. Surprisingly, not all grassland species
   showed an advanced phenology with increasing intensity of urbanization.
   This contradicts observed patterns for urban trees, indicating that
   phenological shifts in urban areas cannot be generalized from the
   observation of one growth form or taxonomic group. Growth form appears
   as a possible determinant of phenological responses. Results suggest
   that the phenology of dry grassland species may directly respond to the
   urban heat island, albeit with variable direction and magnitude. This
   has implications for ecosystem services, shifted allergy seasons,
   changes of biogeochemical cycles and potential ecological mismatches.},

Title = {Categorization of green and grey infrastructure complexity in the
   rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India: an unsupervised volumetric
   approach with relevance for urban quality},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Trees are key elements of urban green infrastructure and provide
   multiple ecosystem services that are essential for the quality of life
   of people in urban environments. Grey infrastructure is made up of
   buildings or built-up area, generally characterized by imperviousness of
   the surface. The complexity of urban green and grey infrastructure and
   their interactions co-define the quality of urban life and the
   ecological value of urban areas. Using conventional dichotomies by
   separation into ``urban{''} and ``rural{''} contexts does hardly allow
   to comprehensively assess the situation in rapidly urbanizing
   environments of the Global South. We present an unsupervised remote
   sensing-based approach that integrates 3D information to objectively
   categorize the complexity of green and grey infrastructure. Using the
   rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India, as a case example, we
   distinguished five categories that describe the composition and
   configuration of green and grey infrastructure, where three variables
   served as indicators for categorization into five clusters. We argue
   that such integrated 3D assessment of green and grey infrastructure is
   particularly useful for understanding and classifying ``rurban{''}
   environments, where a distinction between urban and rural is often no
   longer possible. Our final map allows to quantitatively characterize
   such rurban configurations.},

Title = {Attitudes and preferences of wildlife and their relationship with

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1939-1948},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How people relate to biodiversity and whether they are supportive of
   conservation programs and policies has implications on global and local
   biodiversity conservation efforts. Nature experiences in childhood has
   been shown to be strongly correlated to positive attitudes towards
   nature and wildlife in adulthood. In this study, we examined wildlife
   experience, attitudes and willingness to coexist with 26 vertebrates and
   invertebrates amongst residents in a highly urbanized tropical city,
   Singapore. A total of 1004 respondents were surveyed and their childhood
   nature experience and various socioeconomic variables were obtained. The
   animals were grouped by their likeability and preferred habitat from the
   respondents' answers. Three main groups of animals were discerned -
   unfavorable animals, mammals, and favorable animals. Singapore residents
   generally had high direct experiences of animals that are common in
   urban settings, for both favorable and unfavorable animals, such as
   butterflies, dragonflies, crows and bees, but low direct experiences of
   forest-dependent wildlife. Animals that were well-liked and acceptable
   near homes include the common urban ones and some forest-dependent ones,
   while animals that were disliked included stinging insects (bees and
   hornets) and reptiles (snakes and water monitors). Structured equation
   modelling showed that both childhood nature experience and wildlife
   experience had strong effects on wildlife likeability and habitat
   preference. The apparent mismatch between greening policies and people's
   willingness to coexist with wildlife may be problematic as urban
   development further encroaches on forest habitats, and this study
   highlights the importance of preserving forest habitats so that young
   children and adults have opportunities to be exposed to them.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Although growing evidence suggests that natural and sexual selection
   pressures may differ between natural and urban habitats, their
   consequences in terms of morphological differentiation, extent of sexual
   dimorphism and sex ratio remain poorly studied. Anolis lizards are an
   ideal model to study the phenotypic effects of urbanization, as they are
   well known for the existence of ecomorphs adapted to particular
   microhabitats. However, so far most studies of urban populations of
   anoles have considered invasive species and largely focused on males.
   Here, we compared morphological differentiation, sexual dimorphism and
   sex ratio between suburban and forest populations of the native A.
   homolechis, in western Cuba, based on large sample size (n > 800) and a
   balanced nested design. Overall, both male and female individuals from
   suburban populations were larger and in better body condition than
   individuals from forest populations. In addition, evidence of caudal
   autotomy was more than twice more frequent in suburban populations
   compared to forest ones, with no sex effect. Habitat type and season of
   the year had additive effects on sex ratios, with a significant excess
   of males in suburban habitats and during the non-reproductive season.
   Accordingly, the extent of sexual dimorphism in size was more pronounced
   in suburban populations compared to forest ones. Our results suggest
   that the shape and direction of natural selection may differ between
   urban and natural populations of anoles.},

Abstract = {Geographic ranges are a fundamental unit of biogeography and
   macroecology. Increasingly, paleontologists and ecologists alike are
   reconstructing geographic ranges of species from fossils, in order to
   understand the long-term processes governing biogeographic and
   macroevolutionary patterns. As these reconstructions have become
   increasingly common, uncertainty has arisen over the equivalency of
   paleo-ranges and modern ranges. Here, we argue geographic ranges are
   time-averaged at all temporal scales, and reflect the biotic and abiotic
   processes operating across the equivalent range of time and space
   scales. This conceptual framework integrates the study of geographic
   ranges reconstructed using modern and ancient data, and highlights the
   potential for ranges to illuminate processes responsible for diversity
   patterns over intervals spanning days to tens of millions of years of
   Earth history.},

Abstract = {Virtually all organisms are colonized by microbes. Average temperatures
   are rising because of global climate change - accompanied by increases
   in extreme climatic events and heat shock - and symbioses with microbes
   may determine species persistence in the 21st century. Although parasite
   infection typically reduces host upper thermal limits, interactions with
   beneficial microbes can facilitate host adaptation to warming. The
   effects of warming on the ecology and evolution of the microbial
   symbionts remain understudied but are important for understanding how
   climate change might affect host health and disease. We present a
   framework for untangling the contributions of symbiosis to predictions
   of host persistence in the face of global change.},

Journal = {TRENDS IN ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},

Volume = {37},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {590-598},

Abstract = {Our understanding of host influence on microbial evolution has focused
   on symbiont specialization and the genomic streamlining that often
   accompanies it. However, a vast diversity of symbiotic lineages
   facultatively interact with hosts or associate with multiple hosts. Yet,
   there are no clear expectations for how host association influences the
   niche of these symbionts or their evolution. Here, we discuss how weak
   or variable selection on microbial symbiotic associations, horizontal
   transmission, and low costs of adaptation to novel host habitats are
   predicted to promote the expansion or maintenance of microbial niches.
   This broad perspective will aid in developing better and more general
   predictions for evolution in microbial symbioses.},

Abstract = {Insects are the most diverse group of animals on Earth, but their small
   size and high diversity have always made them challenging to study.
   Recent technological advances have the potential to revolutionise insect
   ecology and monitoring. We describe the state of the art of four
   technologies (computer vision, acoustic monitoring, radar, and molecular
   methods), and assess their advantages, current limitations, and future
   potential. We discuss how these technologies can adhere to modern
   standards of data curation and transparency, their implications for
   citizen science, and their potential for integration among different
   monitoring programmes and technologies. We argue that they provide
   unprecedented possibilities for insect ecology and monitoring, but it
   will be important to foster international standards via collaboration.},

Abstract = {Several decades of research across disciplines have overturned
   historical perspectives of symbioses dominated by binary
   characterizations of highly specific species-species interactions. This
   paradigm shift has unlocked the previously underappreciated and
   overlooked dynamism of fungal mutualisms such as mycorrhizae. Lichens
   are another example of important fungal mutualisms where
   reconceptualization is urgently needed to realize their potential as
   model systems. This reconceptualization requires both an objective
   synthesis of new data and envisioning a revised integrative approach
   that unifies the spectrum of ecology and evolution. We propose a
   ten-theme framework that if pursued would propel lichens to the vanguard
   of symbiotic theory.},

Abstract = {Global urbanization has resulted in local habitat fragmentation,
   influencing ecological processes and biodiversity conservation. However,
   little is known about the diversity and distribution of microbial
   communities across urban biotopes. Here, we compared testate amoeba
   communities in Moscow (63 samples from five urban parks) and Xiamen (69
   samples from six urban parks) across four biotopes (tree hole, moss,
   soil, and sediment) to better understand microbial diversity and
   ecological processes shaping microbial communities. A total of 116
   morphospecies (31 genera), corresponding to 90 in Moscow and 84 in
   Xiamen, were identified using light microscopy. The species richness per
   sample (mean +/- standard error) was higher in Moscow parks (14 +/- 1
   species, n = 63) than Xiamen parks. The mean species richness per
   biotope was highest in the mosses (13 +/- 1 species, n = 33). 13-26\% of
   the total species richness was shared by all biotopes, indicating the
   ubiquitous distribution of testate amoeba morphospecies. The community
   composition in different biotopes markedly differed in both Moscow and
   Xiamen regions. Community connectivity varied among biotopes, and
   community complexity and dynamics were substantially stronger in soil
   and sediment. The stochastic processes explained a significantly high
   percentage of community composition in all biotopes (57-81\%) in 11
   parks. The standardized effect size for C-score in all biotopes changed
   from 1.48 to 6.92, indicating the enhanced significance of deterministic
   processes for the testate amoeba communities. The different relative
   importance of stochastic or deterministic processes in four studied
   biotopes suggests that factors influencing the testate amoeba
   communities greatly vary across heterogeneous urban environments.},

Abstract = {Given the rapid pace of urbanization and resulting pressures on water
   supplies in many regions, landscape water conservation has become
   increasingly important for many communities. To achieve this goal,
   programs incentivizing partial or complete removal of turfgrass lawns
   have been developed by many municipalities. While prior studies have
   been published examining effects of urban land change on stormwater
   runoff, few have addressed how the transition from traditional home
   lawns to alternative water-efficient landscapes alters runoff water
   quality. The objective of this 13-month study was to compare differences
   in stormwater runoff quality attributes among five commonly used urban
   residential mesocosms including established St. Augustinegrass lawn and
   four alternative residential mesocosms including xeriscaping, mulch,
   artificial turf, and sand-capped lawn. Runoff quality parameters
   including pH, electrical conductivity, nitrate-N, ammonium-N, dissolved
   organic N, total dissolved N, orthophosphate-P, total suspended solids,
   and dissolved organic carbon were monitored. Results demonstrated that
   export of nutrients via runoff, specifically N and P, were influenced by
   mesocosm type. In particular, artificial turf showed elevated runoff
   nitrate-N relative to other mesocosms, possibly due to minimal plant
   absorption of inorganic N coming onto plots as dry and wet deposition.
   However, an additional layer of compacted decomposed granite used for
   xeriscapes and artificial turf seems to have protected legacy soil P
   from leaving the system as runoff. Collectively, the findings of this
   study demonstrate that there is no one specific landscape that is best
   suited for mitigating runoff quality, but rather, alternative mesocosms
   should be selected based on local climate and environmental concerns.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services are an important, but often invisible component of
   the urban landscape. Humans have altered the environment in cities,
   leading to degraded or missing ecosystem services in many cases. To
   enhance or replace these services, many urban municipalities are
   integrating green spaces and infrastructure into urban planning. We have
   designed an activity to help undergraduate students: 1) recognize the
   importance of urban ecosystem services, 2) identify when they are
   degraded or missing, and 3) integrate ``green{''} ideas from multiple
   sources to propose improvements to them. To help students achieve these
   goals, we asked them to evaluate an underutilized space on their own
   campus, and propose a redesign of that space to support ecosystem
   services. While many students struggled initially to link urban
   ecosystem services with specific proposed improvements, we found that
   having students work together in groups for a second redesign often
   improved understanding and also resulted in more creative and
   interdisciplinary designs. The exercise also helped students to better
   identify ecosystem services and allowed them to practice integrating
   multiple viewpoints while proposing solutions to local environmental
   problems.},

Title = {An improved method for the identification and setting of ecological
   corridors in urbanized areas},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 10},
Abstract = {Ecological corridors are an effective tool for mitigating the
   fragmentation of habitats and populations. Due to limited space in
   highly urbanized areas, identifying the suitable width of urban
   ecological corridors (UECs), while taking ecological, social, and
   economic benefits into account, is important. However, the
   identification of UEC range is subjective and imprecise in existing
   studies and practices. To solve this problem, an impact index system for
   UEC width was established, and a simulation and evaluation model for
   determining the suitable construction width of UECs developed. The
   objective of this study is to reflect the dynamic quantitative
   relationship between the relevant impact factors and suitable UEC
   widths, and to propose clear and quantitative width suggestions as well
   as corresponding functional positioning and construction approaches for
   UECs in different environments. To eliminate the probable constraints
   brought by the overconfidence results, this study also grouped the
   simulation results into six flexible ranges, thus providing a specific
   width for an individual UEC as a benchmark, while also presenting UECs
   with a construction reference that accepts variation within a given
   range for specific environments and local situations. Our improved
   method for the identification of UEC width in rapidly urbanized areas
   promotes a completer and more dynamic path for UEC planning and design,
   and the conclusions can provide effective support for landscape and
   urban planning decisions.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the relationships among species
   composition, diversity, distribution, growth status, and habitats of
   venerable trees (VTs) in Wuzhishan City, Hainan, China. VT are defined
   as venerable tree. VTs bear witness to changes in human society and
   culture; VTs that once occurred in open or forested areas are now often
   surrounded by or adjacent to new infrastructure and urban development.
   In spite of urban development, protecting VTs is important for
   preserving the history they contain as a part of their carbon
   sequestration, maintaining their unique ecological services, and
   continuing to appreciate and advance their cultural symbolism and
   meaning. We studied VTs and their habitats based on literature reviews,
   field surveys, interviewing local people, and tree-age determination in
   the laboratory. Our results revealed 216 VTs in Wuzhishan City of 100 or
   more years old, belonging to nine families, 13 genera and 21 species.
   Among families, Sapindaceae comprised the largest number of VTs with 79
   species and was especially represented by the fruit tree, Litchi
   chinensis Sonn (Lychee). Perhaps unsurprisingly, we also found that
   older VTs were rarer than younger ones with the age structure being 192
   VTs 100-299 years old, 21 trees 300-499 years old, and only three trees
   500 years old or older. The average age was 163 years. Tree height,
   trunk girth, and crown width had normal distributions, with means of
   mean 32.1 m, 423 cm, 17 m, respectively. Overall, VTs were more-or-less
   evenly distributed across the study area, though there were biases in
   location when age was taken into account with older trees tending to
   occur at mid-elevations within the study area, but at higher elevations
   than other VTs. We applied a general linear model (GLM) to analyze the
   association between attributes of VTs and environmental data. The models
   revealed significant correlations between tree height and precipitation
   of the wettest month (p = 8.69 x 10(-4)), trunk girth and mean annual
   temperature (p = 9.30 x 10(-4)) and precipitation of the coldest quarter
   (p = 3.06 x 10(-4)), and crown width and mean temperature of the warmest
   quarter (p = 8.28 x 10(-3)). In conclusion, Wuzhishan City is home to
   diverse VTs with distributions driven at least in part by environmental
   factors (e.g.,temperature, precipitation, elevation, etc.). VTs can be
   maintained through enhanced conservation measures that acknowledge their
   cultural, ecological, and historical value.},

   traits but not a programmed adaptive process. Alternatively, the
   pathogen control hypothesis posits that defense against infectious
   diseases may provide a strong selection force for restriction of
   lifespan. Aging might have evolved to remove older individuals who carry
   chronic diseases that may transmit to their younger kin. Thus, selection
   for shorter lifespans may benefit kin's fitness. The pathogen control
   hypothesis addresses arguments typically raised against adaptive aging
   concepts: it explains the benefit of shorter lifespan and the absence of
   mu-tant variants that do not age. We discuss the consistency and
   explanatory power of this hypothesis and compare it with classic
   hypotheses of aging.},

Abstract = {In animal societies, control over resources and reproduction is often
   biased towards one sex. Yet, the ecological and evolutionary
   underpinnings of male-female power asymmetries remain poorly understood.
   We outline a comprehensive framework to quantify and predict the
   dynamics of male-female power relationships within and across mammalian
   species. We show that male-female power relationships are more nuanced
   and flexible than previously acknowledged. We then propose that enhanced
   reproductive control over when and with whom to mate predicts social
   empowerment across ecological and evolutionary contexts. The framework
   explains distinct pathways to sex-biased power: coercion and male-biased
   dimorphism constitute a co-evolutionary highway to male power, whereas
   female power emerges through multiple physiological, morphological,
   behavioural, and socioecological pathways.},

Title = {Assessment of four urban forest as environmental indicator of air
   quality: a study in a brazilian megacity},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 18},
Abstract = {Vehicular emissions comprise a main source of air pollutants, especially
   particulate matter (PM), which contains toxic compounds. Brazil has been
   restricting vehicular emissions for more than 30 years to minimize the
   impacts of fleet vehicles, but despite the restrictive legislation,
   several Brazilian cities still suffer from the effects of atmospheric
   pollution. The adoption of nature-based solutions (NbS) is being hailed
   as a sound alternative for improving urban air quality. In this sense,
   trees are a true reflection of the NbS concept since they can directly
   decrease PM levels by intercepting and resuspending particles, as well
   as altering pollution dispersion patterns. We wanted to understand the
   practical outcome of urban forest fragments as an NbS. Therefore, using
   litterfall in urban forest fragments, this study reported the role of
   green areas in reducing air pollution concentrations in 4 urban parks in
   Sao Paulo Megacity, Brazil. Air contaminants (Cd, Cu and Pb) varied from
   the edge to the core of urban forests. Multivariate analysis revealed
   that areas with different vehicle fleets influenced the input of air
   pollutants into these forest fragments. Our study further showed that
   trees serve as a natural barrier against PM. It can be concluded that
   this low-cost NbS alternative can reduce air pollution and has a
   potential to improve human health and well-being, and should be
   incorporated into municipal policies and programs, especially in
   critical locations of high human density. and poorly managed green
   areas.},

Abstract = {The ecology of zoonotic, including vector-borne, diseases in urban
   social-ecological systems is influenced by complex interactions among
   human and environmental factors. Several characteristics contribute to
   the emergence and spread of infectious diseases in urban places, such as
   high human population densities, favorable habitat for vectors, and
   humans' close proximity to animals and their pathogens. On the other
   hand, urban living can contribute to the improvement of public health
   through better access to health services and creation of ecological and
   technological infrastructure that reduces disease burdens. Therefore,
   urbanization creates a disease ecology paradox through the interplay of
   urban health penalties and advantages for individual and community
   outcomes. To address this contradiction, we advocate a holistic Urban
   One Health perspective for managing urban systems, especially their
   green spaces and animal populations, in ways that more effectively
   control the spread of zoonotic diseases. This view should be coupled
   with an Ecology with Cities approach which emphasizes actionable science
   needed for urban planning, management and policymaking; developing
   disease and vector surveillance programs using citizen and community
   science methods; and improving education and communication actions that
   help diverse stakeholders understand the complexities of urban disease
   ecology. Such measures will enable scholars from many disciplines to
   collaborate with professionals, government officials, and others to
   tackle challenges of the urban disease paradox and create more
   sustainable, health-promoting environments.},

Abstract = {Dogs have been recognized as a conservation concern for wildlife.
   Increasing dog populations have led to a rise in health and ecological
   problems for humans and wildlife. Dog demography and husbandry practices
   of dog ownership are key factors for planning population and disease
   management programs. We conducted a cross-sectional dog demography study
   in five towns near remnant patches of forest in Central Mexico. The
   results from surveys applied to 267 households showed high dog ownership
   (83\%). The human dog ratio was 2:1, 2.3 +/- SE 1.5 dogs per dog owning
   household. Mean fecundity rate was 0.8 +/- 0.5, with only 11\% of the
   dogs sterilized. Mortality rate was higher in pups than dogs surpassing
   the year (1.3 vs. 0.12). Overall, vaccination coverage against rabies
   was higher (81\%) than against distemper virus and canine parvovirus
   (26\%). Average dog density for all sites was 1,777 dogs/km(2).
   Free-roaming was allowed to 82\% of the dogs. Regarding wildlife
   interactions, 64\% of owners have observed wildlife near their houses
   and 23\% have observed a negative interaction, such as predation or
   chasing of dogs over native fauna. The high densities and high rates of
   free-roaming dogs found in the study suggest that is likely that dogs
   harass, compete or predate on wildlife. A high density of dogs and the
   low vaccination coverage against some pathogens of animal health
   concern, increases the risk of cross-species transmission between
   domestic and wild carnivores. Awareness-raising campaigns for dog owners
   and a dog population management program are required.},

Title = {Management is more important than urban landscape parameters in shaping
   orthopteran assemblages across green infrastructure in a metropole},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Urbanisation significantly shapes species abundance, diversity, and
   community structure of invertebrate taxa but the impact on orthoptera
   remains widely understudied. We investigated the combined effects of
   spatial, urban landscape and management-related parameters.
   Additionally, we discussed different sampling strategies. We sampled
   orthopteran assemblages on green infrastructure associated with the
   public transport system of Vienna, Austria. Sampled areas include
   railroad embankments, recreational areas or fallows. Using LMs, (G)LMMs
   and nMDS, we compared quantitative sampling using transect counts and
   semi-quantitative sampling which also included observations made
   off-transects. We found that vegetation type was the most important
   parameter, whereby structure-rich fallows featured highest species
   diversities and, together with extensive meadows, highest abundances,
   while intensive lawns were less suitable habitats. The semi-quantitative
   data set revealed an underlying species-area-relationship (SAR). Other
   important but highly entangled parameters were the mowing intensity,
   vegetational heterogeneity and cover of built-up area in a 250 m radius.
   Most found species have high dispersal abilities. Urban assemblages are
   most significantly shaped by management-related parameters on the site
   itself, which highlights the potential of conservation efforts in urban
   areas through suitable management. Sites of different vegetation types
   differ greatly and need adjusted management measures. Urban landscape
   parameters, such as the degree of soil sealing, appeared less important,
   likely due to the high dispersal abilities of most observed orthoptera
   species. The indicated species-area-relationship could be used to
   prioritize sites for conservation measures.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity is declining through human activities and urbanisation is
   often seen as a particular concern. Urban settings, however, provide
   diverse microclimatic conditions for plants and pollinating insects, and
   therefore may be significant habitats for the conservation of solitary
   and primitively eusocial bees, a major group of pollinators. This study
   analysed the interactions between these bees and the plants on which
   they forage, using a network approach. We compared urban habitats
   (gardens, roadsides, and open vegetation) in a large British town with
   nearby nature reserves. One native plant Taraxacum officinale
   (dandelion) was a core generalist species visited in all habitat types.
   Other core plant species restricted to particular habitats include
   species of Geranium, Bellis, Crepis, and Ranunculus. Two generalist bee
   species, Anthophora plumipes and Osmia bicornis were the core visitor
   species within the networks. The networks were comparatively more nested
   in urban habitat types than nature areas, suggesting more frequent
   interactions between generalist and specialist species in urban areas.
   Network connectance, network level specialisation (H-2' index), and
   plant generality (network level) were not significantly different in
   urban and nature areas. However, visitor generality was found to be
   significantly higher in urban gardens than in nature areas. Careful
   management of common urban vegetation would be beneficial for supporting
   urban wild pollinators.},

Abstract = {Temporal variation of airborne fern spore concentrations in Bratislava
   during the three years (2019-2021) was studied using a Hirst-type
   aerospore sampler. Fern spores were frequently present in the air but at
   low concentrations. The total annual spore concentration recorded was
   523 spores/m(3), belonging to eight spore types of fern plants
   (Asplenium sp., Athyrium sp., Botrychium sp., Cystopteris sp.,
   Dryopteris sp., Matteuccia struthiopteris and Polypodium sp. of ferns
   and Equisetum sp. of horsetails). The taxa contributing the highest
   spore concentration were Dryopteris (52\% of the total; mean value for
   the three analysed years) and Athyrium (26\% of the total). Species of
   these two genera are abundant in the fragments of natural woodland
   within the city. The season period from July to August shows the most
   intense airborne spore dispersal process in each analysed year. Although
   the average daily spore concentration did not exceed 1 spore/m(3) during
   the period analysed, we recorded values of up to 15 spores/m(3) on
   several days. Since fern spores are one of the allergenic airborne
   bioparticles, it is assumed that their inhalation at this concentration
   may already induce inhalation allergy symptoms in sensitive individuals.
   The relationships between selected weather variables and mean daily fern
   spore concentrations for Dryopteris and Athyrium were evaluated through
   Spearman's correlation test. The spore concentrations were positively
   associated with air temperature and/or sunshine and negatively with
   relative air humidity.},

Abstract = {The Southern Hemisphere differs from the Northern Hemisphere in many
   aspects. However, most ecological and evolutionary research is conducted
   in the Northern Hemisphere and its conclusions are extrapolated to the
   entire globe. Therefore, unique organismal and evolutionary
   characteristics of the south are overlooked. We use ornithology to show
   the importance of including a southern perspective. We present examples
   of plumage pigmentation, brood -parasitic nestling ejection,
   flightlessness, female song, and female aggression modulated by
   progesterone as complementary models for investigating funda-mental
   biological questions. More research in the Southern Hemisphere, together
   with increased cooperation among researchers across the hemispheres and
   within the Southern Hemisphere, will provide a greater global outlook
   into ecology and evolution.},

Abstract = {A major challenge in modern biology is to understand extinction risk
   from climate change across all realms. Recent research has revealed that
   physiological tolerance, behavioral thermoregulation, and small
   elevation shifts are dominant coping strategies on land, whereas
   large-scale latitudinal shifts are more important in the ocean.
   Freshwater taxa may face the highest global extinction risks.
   Nevertheless, some species in each realm face similar risks because of
   shared adaptive, dispersal, or physiological tolerances and abilities.
   Taking a cross-realm perspective offers unique research opportunities
   because confounding physical factors in one realm are often
   disaggregated in another realm. Cross-realm, across taxa, and other
   forms of climate change biology synthesis are needed to advance our
   understanding of emergent patterns of risk across all life.},

Abstract = {To forecast extinction risks of natural populations under climate change
   and direct human impacts, an integrative understanding of both
   phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution is essential. To date, the
   evidence for whether, when, and how much plasticity facilitates adaptive
   responses in changing environments is contradictory. We argue that
   explicitly considering three key environmental change components - rate
   of change, variance, and temporal autocorrelation - affords a unifying
   framework of the impact of plasticity on adaptive evolution. These
   environmental components each distinctively effect evolutionary and
   ecological processes underpinning population viability. Using this
   framework, we develop expectations regarding the interplay between
   plasticity and adaptive evolution in natural populations. This framework
   has the potential to improve pre-dictions of population viability in a
   changing world.},

Abstract = {Destruction of natural habitats for tree plantations is a major threat
   to wildlife. These novel environments elicit behavioural changes that
   can either be detrimental or beneficial to survival and reproduction,
   with population - and community - level consequences. However, compared
   with well-documented changes following other forms of habitat
   modification, we know little about wildlife behavioural responses to
   tree plantations, and even less about their associated fitness costs.
   Here, we highlight critical knowledge gaps in understanding the
   ecological and evolutionary consequences of behavioural shifts caused by
   tree plantations and discuss how wildlife responses to plantations could
   be critical in determining which species persist in these highly
   modified environments.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {The landscape of fear (LOF) concept posits that prey navigate spatial
   heterogeneity in perceived predation risk, balancing risk mitigation
   against other activities necessary for survival and reproduction. These
   proactive behavioral responses to risk can affect individual fitness,
   population dynamics, species interactions, and coexistence. Yet,
   antipredator responses in free-ranging prey often contradict
   expectations, raising questions about the generality and scalability of
   the LOF framework and suggesting that a purely spatial, static LOF
   conceptualization may be inadequate. Here, we outline a `dynamic' LOF
   framework that explicitly incorporates time to account for predictable
   spatiotemporal variation in risk-resource trade-offs. This integrated
   approach suggests novel predictions about predator effects on prey
   behaviors to refine understanding of the role predators play in
   ecological communities.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {529-540},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Mesozoic is a key era for the rise of the modern insect fauna. Among
   the most important evolutionary events in Mesozoic insects are the
   radiation of holometabolous insects, the origin of eusocial and
   parasitoid insects, diversification of pollinating insects, and
   development of advanced mimicry and camouflage. These events are closely
   associated with the diversification of insect ecological behaviors and
   colonization of new ecospaces. At the same time, insects had evolved
   more complex and closer ecological associations with various plants and
   animals. Mesozoic insects played a key and underappreciated ecological
   role in reconstructing and maintaining terrestrial ecosystems. A greater
   understanding of the history of insects may help to mitigate future
   changes in insect diversity and abundance.},

Title = {The wintering ecology of the Rook Corvus frugilegus in Northern Kyushu,

Abstract = {Factors affecting the choice of breeding and non-breeding grounds in
   migratory birds are important in order to understand the mechanism
   determining their distribution areas and climate adaptations. The rook,
   Corvus frugilegus (Passeriformes: Corvidae), predominantly resides in
   Europe but exhibits migratory habits in the eastern Palearctic region.
   East Asian populations of rook migrate from breeding grounds in the
   Eurasian continent around the Amur river basin to wintering grounds in
   central and south China, the Korean peninsula, and Japan. In Japan, the
   wintering grounds of C. frugilegus have been gradually expanding since
   the 1980s. In addition, rook populations that have previously roosted in
   secondary forests have recently moved to urban areas in several cities,
   resulting in urban fecal pollution. To clarify the wintering ecology of
   rooks roosting in urban areas in northern Kyushu, we surveyed seasonal
   trends in abundance, daily behavior, and dietary habit of rooks in two
   cities, Saga and Kumamoto. Wintering rooks gradually increased from
   November to December and decreased from January to March. In the
   daytime, the rooks foraged at croplands at mean distances of 6.3 and 9.7
   km from the roosts, in groups averaging approximately 150 and 90
   individuals in Saga and Kumamoto, respectively. Examinations of
   regurgitation pellets and stomach contents revealed the rooks fed mainly
   on spilled rice grains, supplemented with wheat and barley grains,
   Toxicodendron succedaneum and Triadica sebifera fruits, insects
   (beetles), and the apple snail. The rooks formed communal roosts with
   carrion crows and large-billed crows in both cities by joining their
   autumn communal roosts.},

Title = {Callout analysis in relation to wild birds in a tropical city:

Abstract = {Urbanisation is changing landscapes at an unprecedented rate, which
   consequently changes species compositions. We investigate problems faced
   by urban birds in a neotropical city by analysing the responses made to
   callouts by the environmental police of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais,
   Brazil from 2002 to 2008. The environment police responded to two types
   of callouts: solicitation, where a person called to report an issue (n =
   560); and reports of hurt or injured birds (n = 399). On average, three
   callouts per week were made relating to urban birds, with more than half
   concerning birds of prey. There were significantly more callouts in the
   wet season, coinciding with peak breeding times for most endemic
   Brazilian avifauna. We found no effect of caller gender, age or
   associated socioeconomic factors. Most callouts resulted in birds being
   forwarded on to Government-managed institute for processing wildlife (n
   = 584). Only a relatively small number of cases resulted in the birds
   being released into forested areas within the city (n = 152). Sick birds
   were sent to veterinary clinics (n = 136) and be released if
   successfully treated. We suggest how this information could be used to
   improve urban bird species management in neotropical cities. Our data
   evidences different guilds to have different relationships with people
   and birds of prey are less well-understood. The rise in callouts during
   breeding supports the need for better informed species management, and
   avoidance of a ``one size fits all{''} approach.},

Abstract = {Wetlands physical and biological processes are fundamental to the
   distribution and structuring of organic matter in sediments. This study
   investigated spatial and temporal changes in organic matter sources in
   sediments within the Nylsvley Wetland, South Africa across two seasons,
   five sites and three wetland zones and identified pertinent contributors
   to sediment organic matter. Results showed distributions were uneven
   throughout the wetlands, with the seasonal zone having slightly high
   sediment organic matter in the cool-dry season and the permanent zone
   had high sediment organic matter in the hot-wet season, whereas the
   temporary zone had low SOM concentrations. Significant differences in
   nutrient concentrations were observed across wetland zones and seasons
   for Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium, with the seasonal
   zone tending to be the most nutrient-rich in the cool-dry season, and
   with permanent zone nutrient levels rising substantially in the hot-wet
   season. Sediment delta C-13 differed significantly among wetland zones,
   whereas delta N-15 was statistically similar. Autochthonous plants were
   the main sources of organic matter in sediments overall across sites and
   zones. This study's findings help to better understand the distribution
   of organic matter in wetland ecosystems and the role wetland zones play
   in the seasonal provisioning of allochthonous inputs.},

Title = {Urbanization and a green corridor influence reproductive success and
   pollinators of common milkweed},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 21},
Abstract = {Urbanization exerts many pressures on species, yet little is known about
   how these pressures impact species interactions. Studies of urban
   plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization
   impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the
   consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear.
   In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of
   organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate
   plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To
   examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence
   plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the
   native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community
   structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural
   transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a
   green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e.,
   pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per
   inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of
   follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased
   pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a
   green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased
   reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while
   pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably,
   there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community
   structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence,
   and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the
   complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and pollinator
   communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native
   plant populations.},

Abstract = {The relationship between urbanization and different bird diversity
   facets, such as taxonomic and functional diversity, may depend on the
   biome where cities are located. We analyzed the impact of urbanization
   on bird taxonomic and functional diversity in two contrasting biomes of
   Argentina: desert and subtropical forests. A total of five cities and
   five natural areas were surveyed in each biome during the breeding
   season. Taxonomic diversity was measured as the bird species richness in
   each sampling unit, whereas functional diversity was compared with null
   models that controlled for differences in species richness. Taxonomic
   diversity increased in periurban areas located in the desert and in
   natural areas of forests. Natural areas of the desert biome had similar
   functional diversity to that of urban areas, whereas natural areas of
   the forest biome had lower functional diversity than expected for a
   given number of species. Urban core areas in both biomes were dominated
   by species that eat seeds and plant materials, and by ground foragers.
   Natural areas in both biomes were dominated by species that eat
   invertebrates, and by understory and midstory foragers. Our results
   showed contrasting relationships between different bird diversity facets
   and urbanization in desert and forest biomes. Moreover, the results
   found highlighted the importance of considering different urban habitats
   in large-scale comparisons and the need for particular management
   actions in different biomes.},

Title = {Floristic changes of vascular flora in the city of Rome through
   grid-cell census over 23 years},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Cities are considered important areas for biodiversity and host a high
   plant species richness. However, many factors, such as urbanisation or
   changes in land use, can affect the presence of spontaneous flora and,
   consequently, represent a threat for biodiversity. How species respond
   to these factors of change in cities over time is a relevant and current
   issue and spatiotemporal analyses represent an essential step forward to
   better understand these dynamic systems and to fill gaps of knowledge.
   In this paper we present a comparison between a floristic survey carried
   out in 1995 on a grid-cell for the city of Rome and a new survey,
   performed between 2015 and 2018, in order to verify if the species
   composition significantly changed over time and to which drivers this
   change was related to. For 76 grid-cells of the raster, each of which of
   1.6 km(2), we recorded all spontaneous vascular species. We analysed the
   differences between the two surveys by means of statistical tests on
   species richness, by species turnover, by generalised linear models
   (GLMs) and by Ellenberg indicator values. The patterns of species
   richness are similar between the two surveys, although an increase in
   the number of species per grid-cell, on average, was observed. This
   increase regarded both native and alien richness, with significant
   differences only for aliens. Many species significantly reduced or
   increased their frequencies, comparing the two surveys. A set of
   environmental variables, among which the presence of protected areas,
   are relevant for explaining the pattern of species' frequencies and its
   change over time. Our results suggest that the flora of the city,
   notwithstanding the steady human pressure and the increase in alien
   species, maintained a high level of heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {Niche partitioning reduces interspecific competition, facilitating
   coexistence. In urban ecosystems, however, habitat loss reduces species'
   ability to spatially partition activity. Temporal partitioning may thus
   increase in urban areas as species, unable to avoid each other
   spatially, partition time to avoid competition. In Midwestern US cities,
   eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and fox squirrels (S.
   niger) co-occur and compete for resources. We identified urban gray and
   fox squirrel activity patterns and how they vary with season, land
   cover, and among sites where they do and do not co-occur using
   camera-trap data. Both species' activity patterns varied with season and
   canopy and impervious surface cover. Gray squirrel activity patterns
   varied in the presence of fox squirrels only in the fall, providing
   limited support for our temporal partitioning hypothesis. Temporal niche
   partitioning may thus play a role in supporting these species
   co-existence when competition is seasonally-elevated (e.g., fall
   hording), but appears less important in other seasons.},

Abstract = {Understanding the ecology of the often dense white-tailed deer
   populations in urban and suburban landscapes is important for mitigating
   a variety of conflicts that arise with dense human populations, such as
   issues surrounding zoonotic disease mitigation. We collared white-tailed
   deer in highly suburban areas of Howard County, Maryland with
   high-resolution GPS collars. Then, we created autocorrelated kernel
   density home ranges for broader land use analyses and concurrently used
   general additive models to characterize fine-scale hourly measures of
   speed, activity, and proximity to residential buildings. Suburban deer
   home ranges encompassed approximately 35\% direct residential land, and
   an average of 71 and 129 residential properties were found within female
   and male core ranges, respectively. Sex, time of day, and day of year
   all influenced fine-scale speeds, activity levels, and proximity to
   residential property buildings. Deer moved into residential areas
   nightly, especially in winter, and exhibited bouts of increased speed
   and activity shortly after sunrise and sunset, with distinctive seasonal
   changes. We discuss how variation in home ranges and movements may
   influence population management success and explore year-round periods
   of increased risk of deer transporting ticks to residential areas. These
   findings focus our broad understanding of deer movements in suburban and
   urban landscapes to improve deer population management and to mitigate
   the spread of ticks into residential areas.},

Abstract = {In this study, surface sediments along the mainstream of the Kapuas
   River were determined for sedimentary phosphorus (P) species, which
   include exchangeable-P (Ex-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), apatite P (Ca-P),
   detrital P (De-P), and organic P (OP). The objective of this study was
   to determine the dynamics of sedimentary P species in the world's
   longest river on an island. The results showed that the composition of
   sedimentary P species of the river to total P (TP) was in this order:
   Ca-P (57\% of TP) > Ex-P (21\%) > Fe-P (11\%) > OP (6\%) > De-P (5\%).
   As the bioavailable P (BAP), which includes Ex-P, Fe-P, and OP,
   represents around 38\% of TP, this could indicate the river sediments'
   potential to release P. The sedimentary BAP showed an overall decreasing
   trend from the upper river to downstream of the river. In contrast, Ca-P
   showed an increasing trend from the upper river to downstream of the
   river. All these indicate the dynamics of a localised P cycle along a
   river, as the BAP released to the overlying water could contribute to
   Ca-P formation.},

Abstract = {Safe levels of extractable heavy metals in land-uses urban soil have not
   been universally established. The pollution of land-uses soils in
   ancient Pundranagar, Bangladesh arouses growing interest because of
   severe anthropogenic stress, urbanization, ecotourism, overexploitation
   of natural resources, and discharges of industrial as well as municipal
   waste. Our study unfolds the extent of heavy metal pollution in the
   land-uses surface soil of this ancient terrestrial ecosystem and also
   investigates the contamination status, source, and ecological risks
   using pollution indices techniques. Total 90 soil samples were collected
   from six different land-uses and heavy metals were analyzed by
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The concentration ranges
   of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd),
   lead (Pb), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) in land-uses soils
   were 5.04-73.06, 18.26-313.2, 25.51-370.6, 4.83-36.30, 0.54-17.25,
   8.60-187.9, 1128-8155, 35.04-129.1 and 8.60-187.9 mg/kg, respectively.
   Multivariate principal component analysis showed that Ni, Pb, Mn, Cu,
   and Zn in soil mainly from anthropogenic sources while As from
   lithogenic or natural sources. Considering the potential ecological
   risk, soil from all land uses showed moderate to high ecological risk.
   Analysis of the results indicates the alarming condition of this ancient
   terrestrial ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Recent research uncovering extraordinary organismal complexity (e.g.,
   extent of symbiotic associations, genetic exchange between organisms)
   has led to empirical challenges concerning the recognition of
   individuality in biological organisms. Our ability to distinguish
   between organisms, parts of organisms, and groups of organisms is now
   more problematic. Further, this has led to philosophical challenges
   concerning the concept of biological individuality. The holobiont, or
   metaorganism, can be characterized as a host organism having important
   associations with numerous species of organismal exo- and endosymbionts,
   many of which are required for the proper function of the complex whole.
   The holobiont (indeed, all organisms) are also exposed to potential
   horizontal gene exchange throughout their life cycle. The blurring of
   organismality continues to the level of colonial organisms and other
   socially cooperating entities. Epistemologically, we recognize the
   metaorganism as a processual system subject to continuous change in
   itself and in relation to its environment. Whereas the metaorganism
   resists individuation in terms of its intrinsic properties of mixed
   origin, it acts as an individual by engaging in causal interactions that
   are predicated on its integrative nature and emergent properties. In
   terms of the biological individuality debate, the question is not ``is
   the metaorganism a biological individual?{''} The question is rather
   ``what individuating processes does the metaorganism (or any organism)
   engage in?{''} When explained in terms of the causal properties and
   propensities of its parts (which are of potentially mixed origin), the
   underlying conception of the metaorganism is that of a homeostatic
   property cluster. Thus, for metaorganisms, a hierarchical dialectic
   between natural kindness and individuality exists, depending on the
   epistemic project being pursued. A process ontology of organisms
   recognizes their fuzzy boundaries and life's dynamic nature while
   preserving the organism as a fundamental explanatory concept in biology.},

Abstract = {Crocidura, white-toothed shrews, is the most species rich genus among
   mammals. Phylogeny at the species-level is still unresolved, especially
   for Turkey and its adjacent regions. To understand phylogenetic
   relationships and mitogenomic features of Turkey's Crocidura, we aimed
   to (i) sequence whole mitogenomes of Turkish shrews, (ii) determine
   phylogenetic relationships among/within the Crocidura suaveolens group
   and C. leucodon from Turkey by using mitogenomes minus D-loop; (iii)
   contribute to resolving the phylogenetic position of populations within
   the C. suaveolens group in a phylogeographical context by using
   mitochondrial CYTB gene alone, and (iv) discuss the role of possible
   glacial refugia that may have driven the diversification of some taxa
   within Crocidura. Based on two data sets, all analyses revealed that the
   Turkish shrews were divided into three major lineages: C. mimula, C.
   gueldenstaedtii, and C. leucodon. This was in agreement with results of
   previous studies, suggesting (i) that the taxa within the C. suaveolens
   group such as C. caspica, C. cypria, C. gueldenstaedtii, C. iculisma, C.
   mimula, and C. shantungensis were separate species. However, the
   existence of C. sibirica could not be confirmed. We also proposed (i)
   Carpathian and Caucasian refugia for C. mimula and C. gueldenstaedtii,
   respectively, and (ii) the existence of a new refugium for C. leucodon
   that covers Uludag-Bursa and its adjacent surroundings in the southern
   Marmara region. Moreover, the Turkish samples of C. leucodon were
   clustered into two sublineages, and mimula shrews from Lesvos-Greece and
   Western Anatolia-Turkey might represent an undetermined or undescribed
   taxon.},

Abstract = {The widespread human commensal blindsnake species Indotyphlops braminus
   is currently the only known obligate parthenogenetic snake species. It
   is also known to be triploid. However, much of these data is from
   specimens collected outside India which is the native range of this
   species. Polyploidy and parthenogenesis are often associated with
   hybridization in amphibians and lizards. In this study, we generated
   nuclear and mitochondrial data from multiple Indotyphlops lineages from
   across peninsular India and investigated the possible hybrid origin of
   I. braminus. Species delimitation suggested three putative species, one
   of which was I. pammeces and the other two morphologically matched I.
   braminus. One of these was confined to the wet zone (high rainfall
   areas) while the other was largely distributed in the dry zone. There
   was wide discordance in the relationships between these lineages across
   markers and different tree building approaches suggesting past or
   ongoing geneflow. The statistical test for hybridization also implied
   geneflow across these three lineages. Furthermore, the dry zone I.
   braminus appears to be true I. braminus as the topotypic material falls
   within this clade. These results suggest that the widespread, commensal,
   and parthenogenetic Indotyphlops is a separate species from I. braminus,
   and further investigation is required to determine diagnostic
   morphological characters for a species description.},

Title = {Simultaneous reduction of available arsenic and cadmium in contaminated
   soil by iron-modified fly ash},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {7},
Pages = {602-616},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) co-contamination in the soil is a serious
   global health concern. Three iron-modified fly ash (FA) composites were
   synthesised, including FA-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron
   (FA-nZVI), FA-supported FeCI3 (FA-FeCI3) and FA-supported
   Fe-oxyhydroxide sulphate (FA-FeOS) for remediation of As and Cd
   co-contaminated soil. Soil incubation experiments were conducted to
   evaluate the effects of iron-modified FA on the soil pH, availability
   and geochemical fractions of As and Cd. The results showed that FA and
   FA-nZVI significantly (P < 0.05) increased the soil pH, but FA-FeCI3 and
   FA-FeOS decreased the soil pH in general. FA, FA-nZVI, FA-FeCI3 and
   FA-FeOS decreased the concentration of available As by 15.13 similar to
   21.22\%, 46.20 similar to 46.66\%, 30.02 similar to 38.09\% and 12.05
   similar to 30.50 \%, respectively. However, only FA and FA-nZVI
   decreased the concentration of available Cd by 4.85 similar to 26.09\%
   and 37.74 similar to 52.18\%, respectively. The results showed that
   FA-nZVI was the most effective amendment for simultaneous immobilisation
   of As and Cd. Besides, FA-nZVI stimulated the transformation of As and
   Cd from reactive states to less reachable states to decrease the
   toxicity of As and Cd in soil. In conclusion, FA-nZVI is a potential
   amendment for soil remediation in As and Cd co-contaminated soil.},

Abstract = {The effect of three plant biomasses and two pyrolysis temperatures were
   investigated on physical and structural properties of biochar. Biochars
   produced from woody species (lantana and pine needles) had higher mass

   humin-like C component (486.8-536.4 mg g(-1)), B (14.5-42.5 mg kg(-1))
   and Mo (1.3-2.4 mg kg(-1)) contents than wheat straw biochar. Wheat
   straw biochar had higher ash content (23.01\%-36.14\%), specific density
   (1.45-1.70 g cc(-1)), surface area (295.0-397.4 m(2) g(-1)), O
   (672.1-753.2 g kg(-1)) content and CEC (0.93-1.43 m.e. g(-1)) compared
   to biochars from woody species. Compared to 300 degrees C pyrolysis
   temperature of 450 degrees C significantly increased apparent- and
   specific-density, ash content, pH, EC, O, P, K, water-soluble C, fulvic
   acid-like C, humic acid-like C, and carbonyl group contents and the
   content of all micronutrients except Mo, but decreased mass yield,
   surface area and the contents of humin-like C and some O-containing
   functional groups and CEC. The interaction effect between biomass
   sources and temperature influenced all investigated properties of
   biochars except H, N, S, Cu, Mo and C:N contents. Different carbon
   components and functional groups in biochar were correlated with biochar

Abstract = {In this period of climate change, it is of major importance to increase
   knowledge about the mechanisms by whose plants adapt to their
   environment. Tandem gene arrays (TAG) are overrepresented in the pool of
   tandem duplicates involved in stress response and are consequently of
   special interest. Nevertheless, until recently, addressing questions
   about individual genes or fine regulations in such structures was very
   difficult due to the close arrangement of the genome, almost preventing
   the production of targeted simple or multiple mutants. The CRISPR/Cas9
   new tool offers new opportunities as the setting of gene deletion
   strategies in various genetic backgrounds. Here, we used this technology
   on the cold acclimation CBF pathway in different accessions of
   Arabidopsis thaliana with the same set of guide RNAs. Deleted lines free
   of T-DNA have been produced for simple or multiple copies of CBF genes
   and evaluated for cold tolerance after acclimation. Expression levels of
   CBF genes and five COR genes have also been analyzed. Our data suggest
   first that two or three missing CBF genes are necessary to induce a
   strong reduction in cold tolerance and secondly that most deletions have
   a low impact on the expression of remaining CBF copies which contradicts
   the previous hypothesis in the literature. Our results thus show that
   the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion strategy is a useful performance tool to
   investigate how tandem gene arrays work.},

   indicates a considerable seasonal variation of metal fraction
   concentrations. Igeo values have indicated considerable seasonal
   variation of pollution sources in the sediment of YLC. The temporal

Abstract = {The purification of wastewater is preferred using the adsorption by
   column due to the process's high efficiency. Column investigations are
   performed to remove hazardous pollutants and demonstrate the adsorption
   efficiency of the pollutants in the wastewater treatment process.
   Cadmium and zinc exist in radioactive and industrial wastes. Therefore,
   this work is interested in zinc and cadmium removal from wastewater
   utilising a fixed-bed column. Zirconia-silicate composite (ZrO2-SiO2)
   was synthesised utilising the sol-gel technique and analyzed for this
   purpose. The influence of some parameters as bed depth (2.0, 3.0 and 5.0
   cm), flow rate (2.0 and 3.0 mL/min) and initial ions concentrations
   (50-200 mg/L) was investigated. The column performance was computed to
   be 80.3 and 79.3\% for Zn2 + and Cd2+, respectively, at the optimum
   conditions (3.0 cm bed depth, 2.0 mL/min flow rate and 100 mg/L ions
   concentration). Thomas, Adams-Bohart and Yoon-Nelson theories were
   performed to assess breakthrough curves and determine the parameters of
   column models which are essential for scale-up design. Thomas theory
   exhibited the highest R-2 values (0.84-0.97) and gave the most accurate
   computation of the adsorption process.},

Abstract = {Melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), which is expressed in the terminally
   differentiated sebaceous gland, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).
   MC5R exists mostly in mammals but is completely lost in whales; only the
   relic of MC5R can be detected in manatees, and phenotypically, they have
   lost sebaceous glands. Interestingly, whales and manatees are both
   aquatic mammals but have no immediate common ancestors. The loss of MC5R
   and sebaceous glands in whales and manatees is likely to be a result of
   convergent evolution. Here, we find that MC5R in whales and manatees are
   lost by two different mechanisms. Homologous recombination of MC5R in
   manatees and the insertion of reverse transcriptase in whales lead to
   the gene loss, respectively. On one hand, in manatees, there are two
   ``TTATC{''} sequences flanking MC5R, and homologous recombination of the
   segments between the two ``TTATC{''} sequences resulted in the partial
   loss of the sequence of MC5R. On the other hand, in whales, reverse
   transcriptase inserts between MC2R and RNMT on the chromosome led to the
   loss of MC5R. Based on these two different mechanisms for gene loss in
   whales and manatees, we finally concluded that MC5R loss might be the
   result of convergent evolution to the marine environment, and we
   explored the impact on biological function that is significant to
   environmental adaptation.},

Abstract = {The release of cesium ions in the environment is considered to be a
   dangerous pollutant. The present work deals with the gamma irradiation
   synthesis of novel adsorbent sustainable hydrogel from polyvinyl alcohol
   (PVA)/beeswax (BW) and its investigation for the uptake of cesium (I)
   from aqueous solutions. The characterization of synthesized PVA/BW
   hydrogel was provided by FTIR, SEM, XRD and gel content in addition to
   the water absorbency. The obtained results indicated that the prepared
   composite provides advantages over conventional preparation techniques.
   The batch technique experiments were occurred to investigate the
   adsorption kinetics, capacity, and optimum conditions for the uptake of
   cesium (I) by PVA/BW. The obtained data show that the maximum adsorption
   capacity of PVA/BW for cesium ion was estimated and it was provided at a
   contact time of 1.0 hr, pH = 3, and adsorbed dose of 0.10 g. The
   calculated thermodynamic parameters show that the adsorption of cesium
   ions by PVA/BW was an endothermic and spontaneous process.},

Abstract = {Studies on Vanadium (V) adsorption in aqueous systems employing
   biomaterials friendly to the environment are rare. This study
   investigated the adsorption performance of the living and non-living
   Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) for V from aquatic systems. Vanadium
   inhibited the growth of living C. vulgaris. The results of isothermal
   equations showed that the non-living C. vulgaris biomass was favourable
   for V adsorption. At 400 mg L-1 V, 50 mg algae biomass, 40 degrees C,
   and 0.01 M ionic strength for 24 h, the maximum adsorption capacity
   reached 94.00 mg g(-1). The results of the kinetic studies indicated
   that chemisorption dominated the V adsorption process. Analysis on the
   surface of non-living C. vulgaris biomass revealed that hydroxyl groups,
   carboxylate groups, amide groups, aromatic carbons, and organic
   halogenated hydrocarbon groups played crucial roles in V biosorption.
   Vanadium was bound to the active sites on the surface of C. vulgaris
   through ion exchange action as opposed to redox reaction. Desorption
   experiments were conducted by eluting the non-living C. vulgaris biomass
   with 1 M NaOH solution, and the maximum desorption rate of V reached
   98\%. The results demonstrate that C. vulgaris is a green and highly
   effective biosorbent for vanadium removal from aquatic systems.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the planktonic composition (phytoplankton,
   protozooplankton and zooplankton) in Oreochromis niloticus culture in
   low salinity (10 g L-1) biofloc with different molasses application
   rates. Fingerlings of Nile tilapia (3.15 +/- 0.5 g) were cultured for 70
   days in a randomised design with two application rates: 30\% and 50\%
   molasses application of the total daily feed. Chlorella vulgaris was
   supplemented every 5 days (5 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)) and plankton samples
   were collected weekly. Evaluating planktonic data, diversity was
   considered low, and there was no significant difference (p < 0.05)
   between liquid molasses application rates. However, in the analysis of
   similarities, a difference was observed in relation to time. Cluster
   analysis identified two groups for phytoplankton and zooplankton.
   Chlorophyta group was the most abundant (>40\%), with Chlorella genus
   being the main responsible for this dominance. In the zooplankton and
   protozooplankton communities, the genera with the highest abundance
   were: Anuraeopsis (42.60-76.96\%) and Paramecium (70.15-81.25\%),
   respectively. For zootechnical performance, the treatment with molasses
   application rates of 30\% showed lower feed conversion ratio (2.06 +/-
   0.17). The results suggest that there were significant changes in the
   plankton composition throughout the culture of Nile tilapia in the
   biofloc system, however, without any influence of the molasses
   application rates.},

Abstract = {The core molecular mechanisms of dorsal organizer formation during
   gastrulation are highly conserved within the chordate lineage. One of
   the key characteristics is that Nodal signaling is required for the
   organizer-specific gene expression. This feature appears to be
   ancestral, as evidenced by the presence in the most basally divergent
   chordate amphioxus. To provide a better understanding of the evolution
   of organizer-specific gene regulation in chordates, we analyzed the
   cis-regulatory sequence of amphioxus Chordin in the context of the
   vertebrate embryo. First, we generated stable zebrafish transgenic
   lines, and by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, characterized in
   detail the expression pattern of GFP driven by the cis-regulatory
   sequences of amphioxus Chordin. Next, we performed a 5'deletion analysis
   and identified an enhancer sufficient to drive the expression of the
   reporter gene into a chordate dorsal organizer. Finally, we found that
   the identified enhancer element strongly depends on Nodal signaling,
   which is consistent with the well-established role of this pathway in
   the regulation of the expression of dorsal organizer-specific genes
   across chordates. The enhancer identified in our study may represent a
   suitable simple system to study the interplay of the evolutionarily
   conserved regulatory mechanisms operating during early chordate
   development.},

Title = {Exploring the roles of FGF/MAPK and cVG1/GDF signalling on mesendoderm
   induction and convergent extension during chick primitive streak
   formation},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {During primitive streak formation in the chick embryo, cells undergo
   mesendoderm specification and convergent extension at the same time and
   in the same cells. Previous work has implicated cVG1 (GDF3) as a key
   factor for induction of primitive streak identity and positioning the
   primitive streak, whereas FGF signalling was implicated in regulating
   cell intercalation via regulation of components of the WNT-planar cell
   polarity (PCP) pathway. FGF has also been reported to be able to induce
   a primitive streak (but lacking the most axial derivatives such as
   notochord/prechordal mesendoderm). These signals emanate from different
   cell populations in the embryo, so how do they interact to ensure that
   the same cells undergo both cell intercalation and acquire primitive
   streak identity? Here we begin to address this question by examining in
   more detail the ability of the two classes of signals in regulating the
   two developmental events. Using misexpression of inducers and/or
   exposure to inhibitors and in situ hybridisation, we study how these two
   signals regulate expression of Brachyury (TBXT) and PRICKLE1 as markers
   for the primitive streak and the PCP, respectively. We find that both
   signals can induce both properties, but while FGF seems to be required
   for induction of the streak by cVG1, it is not necessary for induction
   of PRICKLE1. The results are consistent with cVG1 being a common
   regulator for both primitive streak identity and the initiation of
   convergent extension that leads to streak elongation.},

Abstract = {Domestic waste landfills have been regarded as the main source of
   antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which are considered to be emerging
   environmental contaminants. Fluorescent quantitative PCR detection was
   used to determine the occurrence and abundance of ARGs in a landfill
   leachate treatment system. Fourteen ARGs were detected initially in the
   leachate influents. The most abundant ARGs were IntI1, followed by sulI,
   sulII, sulIII, tetC and tetW. The abundance of ARGs increased in the
   biological treatment unit and then decreased in the effluent of
   ultrafiltration membrane treatment. The absolute abundance of ARGs in
   effluent was 1.05-1.94 orders of magnitude lower than that in influent.
   There was a very significant strong correlation between various ARGs and
   heavy metals, especially Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd and As, indicating that there
   may be obvious co-selection between heavy metals and ARGs. Although the
   leachate treatment process could effectively reduce the abundance of
   ARGs, its effect on reducing the number of species of ARGs was
   relatively limited, which may have potential environmental health risks
   to the urban sewage plant receiving leachate effluent and the final
   receiving water body.},

Abstract = {Riparian vegetation and built-up density along the urbanised section of
   the Calabar river were estimated using NDVI (Normalised Differential
   Vegetation Index) and NDBI (normalised differential built-up index),
   respectively. Four sampling stations representing riparian density and
   built-up gradients i.e. Station 1 (sparse riparian + high-density
   built-up), 2 (sparse riparian + high to intermediate-density built-up),
   3 (moderate riparian + intermediate to low-density built-up) and station
   4 (moderate riparian + low-density built-up) were selected.
   Station-specific variations of metal (Pb, Cd, Cr, Fe and Cu) in surface
   water and benthic macro-invertebrate communities were examined between
   January and December 2013 and correlated using redundancy analysis
   (RDA). Buffer analysis revealed that stations having low NDBI with over
   120 m dense riparian areas showed a marked abundance of muddy/coarse
   substrate while sparse riparian areas showed siltier and sandier
   substrate. Redundancy analysis revealed a marked delineation of
   macroinvertebrate occurrence with the riparian density of stations. High
   diversity macroinvertebrate assemblages showed a strong positive
   association with alkaline pH, the density of riparian vegetation and
   substrate type. This first report highlights the critical relationship
   between riparian density, water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates
   in a tropical river.},

Abstract = {Cypermethrin is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the Lake Van
   Basin of Turkey. In this study, the effects of a sublethal dose (0.05 mu
   g/L) of cypermethrin for 96 h on the gills of Lake Van fish (Alburnus
   tarichi), the only vertebrate species living in Lake Van, were
   investigated. Levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Na,K-ATPase, and
   DNA damage (8-OHdG) were determined immunohistochemically in the gills.
   In addition, changes in gill mucous cells and histopathological changes
   in gill tissues after 96 h were investigated. At the end of the
   cypermethrin administration, an increase was observed in the numbers of
   mitochondria-rich cells, HSP70-positive cells, and 8-OHdG-positive cells
   in the gills. A decrease in both the number and volume of mucous cells
   was detected. The expansion of blood vessels, aneurysms, lamellar
   lifting, hypertrophy, lamellar fusion, and necrosis were observed in
   gill tissues. It was concluded that the 96-h sublethal application of
   cypermethrin caused stress, deterioration of osmoregulation, DNA damage,
   and histopathological damage in the gills of Lake Van fish.},

Title = {Effect of CaO and SO2 on the distribution of arsenic species during coal

Abstract = {Arsenic emission from coal combustion is of great concern due to its
   high toxicity and ecological environment hazards. Toxicity of arsenic is
   related to its speciation. Effects of CaO and SO2 on arsenic emission
   during SH and HLH coal combustion at high temperature were obtained
   through thermodynamic calculation. It indicates that the volatilisation
   ratio of arsenic in the form of As4O6 (g) increases as the combustion
   temperature increasing. Coal type and content of CaO significantly
   affect the transition temperature of arsenic volatilisation. During SH
   combustion, with the addition of 10 wt \% CaO, the inhibition rate of
   arsenic volatilisation is gradually increased to its maximum value of
   30.46\% at 900 degrees C. The transition temperature of arsenic
   volatilisation is 1100 degrees C and the inhibition rate is 42.74\% with
   20 wt \% CaO added. As for HLH, either 10 wt \% or 20 wt \% CaO is
   added, the transition temperature are both 1200 degrees C, with the
   inhibition rate of 36.46\% and 48.37\%, respectively. Moreover,
   competition is existed between SO2 and arsenic during coal combustion.
   When the temperature is above 1100 degrees C, for the preferential
   reaction between CaSO4 and As4O6, the competition of SO2 on arsenic
   volatilisation is weakened.},

Abstract = {Petroleum contamination of our biosphere particularly soil and water is
   due to the release of petroleum products from petrochemical industries.
   The aim of the present study was to isolate hydrocarbon-utilising and
   metal-tolerant bacteria capable of hydrocarbon degradation and metal
   remediation. Petroleum contaminated soil from which the bacteria were
   isolated had a total hydrocarbon concentration of 3538 mg/kg and several
   metals. The soil was also observed for the total bacterial population
   which was observed as 2.23 x 10(6) CFU/g of soil. Among different
   strains, strain YSA-9 showed the highest potential for
   hydrocarbon-utilisation with an absorbance of 0.920. Strain YSA-9 also
   displayed high tolerance to Cr (VI) and Cu up to 900 mu g/ml to each
   metal. Strain YSA-9 was identified by 16S rRNA as Klebsiella pneumoniae.
   Strain YSA-9 showed a wide range of hydrocarbon degradation, degrading
   many hydrocarbons with the formation of new compounds and remedying
   higher amounts of metals. Klebsiella pneumoniae YSA-9 significantly
   removed Cr (VI) and Cu by biosorption at different pH, metal
   concentrations, temperature and the time of incubation. A wide range of
   hydrocarbon degradation and higher metal remediation by strain YSA-9
   makes strain YSA-9 a super bio-inoculant for the remediation of polluted
   soils.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in tardigrade taxonomy have been greatly enhanced by the
   redescriptions of the type species for particular taxa or species
   groups. De novo characterisation of these key taxa now allows to
   describe tardigrade species diversity with improved precision and at
   higher rate, increasing the momentum towards resolving the taxonomic
   impediment in these micro-invertebrates. Since its description,
   Diaforobiotus islandicus (Richters, 1904) has been reported from many
   distinct localities around the world. This suggested, perhaps falsely, a
   cosmopolitan nature of the species. However, potential erroneous
   assignment of newly found populations to this species could be a result
   of the very general and superficial original description. In order to
   properly recognise and name species diversity within the genus, I
   provide here an integrative redescription of the type species (D.
   islandicus) with a neotype designation, a description of a new species,
   Diaforbiotus svalbardicus sp. nov, and dichotomous key for the genus.
   Both descriptions are based on detailed morphological and morphometric
   data associated with standard DNA sequences of four genetic markers (18S
   rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS-2, and COI). The genus composition and diagnosis
   amendments of the family Richtersiuside are also discussed. The
   presented study constitutes a starting point for further systematic
   studies on the genus Diaforobiotus and new taxa discoveries.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric contamination by metallic trace elements emitted by various
   human activities constitutes an important threat to human and
   environmental health. This study aims to determine metal accumulation
   and the sources of air metallic pollution in the Safi urban-industrial
   area using lichens as biomonitors. Ten trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr,
   Cu, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn) concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 and
   Pb-208/Pb-207 isotopic ratios were analyzed by ICP-MS in four lichen
   species: Xanthoria Parietina, Ramalina Lacera, Xanthoria Calcicola and
   Ramalina Pollinaria. The results showed significant differences among
   study sites for most elements with higher concentrations in the
   industrial, urban and peri-urban sites compared to the reference site
   chosen as a natural rural area far from any human activities.
   Significant differences were found between saxicolous and corticolous
   species especially for Cd, Cu and Zn. The values of Zn/Cu, Zn/Pb and Pb
   isotope ratios measured in lichens revealed that vehicular traffic and
   industrial emissions are the main sources of atmospheric Pb
   contamination. Other anthropic activities (waste incineration, artisanal
   pottery horizontal ellipsis ) might be the source of other trace metal
   elements accumulated by lichens. Airborne contaminants in Safi appear to
   be exported from their sources by air mass movements driven by the
   regional wind profile.},

Abstract = {We examined the cranial morphology and cranial kinesis of the common
   toads Bufo bufo and B. spinosus with micro-computed tomography and
   geometric morphometrics and compared the results with published data for
   related species in a phylogenetic context. The species significantly
   diverge in skull shape. The skull of B. spinosus is shorter and higher,
   with a ventral arm of the squamosal bone and the jaw articulation point
   positioned perpendicular to the braincase, in comparison with a more
   lateral position in B. bufo. In either species, females have a shorter
   snout and a higher and wider skull at the jaw articulation point that is
   positioned more posteriorly, in comparison with conspecific males. High
   variation in the amount of bone ossification was recorded in both
   species, ranging from scarcely ossified and loosely connected bones to
   highly ossified and firmly connected bones. We also found that skull
   shape and inferred kinetic properties of the skull are highly variable
   across the Bufonini tribe. However, sample sizes are mostly small and
   intraspecific variation is high, which might compromise the analyses.
   Overall, the results suggest that developmental plasticity produces high
   variation in ossification and cranial kinesis, affecting individuals'
   feeding performances. At the population level, this variation supports
   an efficient exploitation of the habitat and may promote morphological
   adaptation in a changing environment.},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of speciation and extinction events is one of
   the most interesting subjects in evolutionary biology that relates to
   all life forms, even the smallest ones. Tardigrades are microscopic
   invertebrates that attracted public and scientific attention mostly due
   to their ability to enter into the diapause stage called cryptobiosis
   and in such stage resist extremely harsh environmental conditions.
   However, although recent research solved a considerable number of
   phylogenetic uncertainties and further uncovered physiological
   mechanisms of cryptobiosis, not much attention is given to the
   evolutionary forces shaping tardigrade diversity. Here, we investigated
   the effect of reproductive mode on diversification rates in tardigrades
   using three groups: macrobiotids, echiniscids and milnesids, which
   represent low, moderate and high levels of parthenogenesis,
   respectively. Our results showed a decreasing tempo of diversification
   events for each of the studied groups without any differences that could
   be ascribed to reproductive mode. We discussed the observed lack of
   effect in tardigrades acknowledging deficiencies in available data sets
   and encouraging further studies to understand whether our results can be
   considered reliable.},

Title = {A mosaic of conserved and novel modes of gene expression and

Abstract = {The mesoderm gives rise to several key morphological features of
   bilaterian animals including endoskeletal elements and the musculature.
   A number of regulatory genes involved in mesoderm and/or muscle
   formation (e.g., Brachyury (Bra), even-skipped (eve), Mox, myosin II
   heavy chain (mhc)) have been identified chiefly from chordates and the
   ecdysozoans Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, but data for
   non-model protostomes, especially those belonging to the ecdysozoan
   sister clade, Lophotrochozoa (e.g., flatworms, annelids, mollusks), are
   only beginning to emerge. Within the lophotrochozoans, Mollusca
   constitutes the most speciose and diverse phylum. Interestingly,
   however, information on the morphological and molecular underpinnings of
   key ontogenetic processes such as mesoderm formation and myogenesis
   remains scarce even for prominent molluscan sublineages such as the
   bivalves. Here, we investigated myogenesis and developmental expression
   of Bra, eve, Mox, and mhc in the quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis,
   an invasive freshwater bivalve and an emerging model in invertebrate
   evodevo. We found that all four genes are expressed during mesoderm
   formation, but some show additional, individual sites of expression
   during ontogeny. While Mox and mhc are involved in early myogenesis, eve
   is also expressed in the embryonic shell field and Bra is additionally
   present in the foregut. Comparative analysis suggests that Mox has an
   ancestral role in mesoderm and possibly muscle formation in bilaterians,
   while Bra and eve are conserved regulators of mesoderm development of
   nephrozoans (protostomes and deuterostomes). The fully developed
   Dreissena veliger larva shows a highly complex muscular architecture,
   supporting a muscular ground pattern of autobranch bivalve larvae that
   includes at least a velum muscle ring, three or four pairs of velum
   retractors, one or two pairs of larval retractors, two pairs of foot
   retractors, a pedal plexus, possibly two pairs of mantle retractors, and
   the muscles of the pallial line, as well as an anterior and a posterior
   adductor. As is typical for their molluscan kin, remodelling and loss of
   prominent larval features such as the velum musculature and various
   retractor systems appear to be also common in bivalves.},

Abstract = {Nile tilapia, one of the most popular aquaculture species worldwide, has
   been introduced into the Congo Basin several times for aquaculture
   purposes. Previous studies based on morphological features showed that
   some of the monogenean gill parasites were co-introduced with Nile
   tilapia and some spilled over to native Congolese cichlids. In this
   study, we genetically investigated the co-introduced monogeneans of Nile
   tilapia from three major parts of the Congo Basin: Upper, Middle and
   Lower Congo. We sequenced 214 specimens belonging to 16 species of
   Monogenea, collected from native and introduced tilapia species from
   Congo, Madagascar and Burundi. We evaluate their position in a phylogeny
   including 38 monogenean species in total. Our results confirm the
   co-introductions in the Congo Basin and suggest one unreported parasite
   transmission from introduced Nile tilapia to native Mweru tilapia in
   Upper Congo, which was undetectable with a morphological study alone.
   Shared parasite COI haplotypes between Madagascar and the Congo Basin
   illustrate how anthropogenic introduction events homogenize parasite
   communities across large geographical distances and thereby disrupt
   isolation by distance patterns. Contrary to our expectation, the
   parasite populations co-introduced in the Congo Basin reveal a high COI
   diversity, probably resulting from multiple Nile tilapia introductions
   from different geographic origins. Additionally, we tested the barcoding
   gap and the performance of mitochondrial COI and nuclear ribosomal
   ITS-1, 28S and 18S markers. We found a significant barcoding gap of 15\%
   for COI, but none for the other markers. Our molecular results reveal
   that Cichlidogyrus halli, C. papernastrema, C. tiberianus, C. cirratus
   and C. zambezensis are in need of taxonomic revision.},

Abstract = {Air pollution is an increasing challenge for modern society globally,
   and it is a very common problem in Kosovo. In this work, the atmospheric
   deposition of Tl, Hg and As was studied using mosses as natural
   samplers. Moss samples (Homalothecium sericeum (Hedw.) Schimp. 1851,
   Hypnum cupressiforme Hedwig. 1801, and Pseudoscleropodium purum (Hedw.)
   M.Fleisch) were collected, cleaned, digested and then analysed by
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Statistical
   analysis and spatial distribution maps were performed to explain the
   obtained results. Median concentrations in mg/kg were 0.017 mg/kg for
   Tl, 0.088 mg/kg for Hg and 0.172 mg/kg for As. There were also extreme
   concentrations for Tl and As related to the industrial pollution sources
   such as the Trepca mine facilities in the town of Mitrovica, a
   thermoelectric coal power plant in the town of Obiliq and a cement
   factory in the town of Hani i Elezit. This indicates that the main
   industries causing pollution in Kosovo are mining processes and thermal
   power plant operations.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a steep rise in the use of SRB and IRB for
   the remediation of heavy metal contamination. This study investigated
   the effects of SRB and IRB on the physical and chemical properties of
   copper tailings. Besides, altered microbial community structure during
   the remediation process and the remediation mechanism were also
   explored. The results showed that bioremediation using SRB and IRB
   increased the pH of copper tailing and permeation time, and reduced ORP
   and the concentration of heavy metals, resulting in a friendly
   environment. The biological sealing was created from insoluble
   precipitates secreted by microbes in blocked seepage channels. This
   biological sealing prevented the infiltration of rain and oxygen and
   prevented the leaching of heavy metals. These findings have never been
   reported previously. In the exudates, the bioremediation resulted in the
   change of the dominant microorganisms from oxidised bacteria to SRB and
   IRB. In the copper mine tailings, the effect of bioremediation on
   microbial community varied with the depths of tailings. In addition, the
   species of microorganisms were also significantly different at different
   depths of tailings, and the key SRB, including Desulfosporosinus,
   Desulfotomaculum and Desulfovibrio, mainly existed in the middle and low
   part of mine tailings.},

Abstract = {The effect of green synthesis approaches in NP synthesis and their
   possible toxicity in aquatic environments has been very limitedly
   studied. In this study, VA-Ag / AC NPs were synthesised using Viscum
   album plant as a reducing agent and Chenopodium album (CA) plant as an
   active carbon source. TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and XRD
   (X-ray crystallography) analysis of the synthesised VA-Ag / AC NPs were
   performed to detect their morphological and chemical properties. The
   inducing of oxidative stress and the effectiveness of VA-Ag/AC NPs in
   neurotoxic pathways and teratogenic changes in aquatic organisms have
   been investigated. In addition, a modelling was created to elucidate the
   toxicity mechanism. The results revealed that green synthesised VA-Ag/AC
   NPs nanoparticles are approximately 1600 times less toxic than
   nanoparticles synthesised by different methods. It had been determined
   that only high doses of VA-Ag/AC NPs nanoparticles cause neurological,
   histopathological and morphological changes. The findings in this study
   for VA-Ag/AC NPs, which are the evidence of the complexity of their mode
   of action at the cellular level, are a first in the aquatic ecosystem
   and require different findings regarding the stability and safety of
   such synthesis products.},

Abstract = {The structural characteristics of soil organic matter (SOM) play an
   important role in improving soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration
   capacity and maintaining soil fertility levels. This study selected
   saline - alkaline abandoned farmland as a control (0a), and cotton
   fields were continuously planted for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years after
   reclamation. The results showed that the lowest soil electrical
   conductivity and total nitrogen are found in 0a, the highest pH (5a) and
   Available potassium content are found in 0a. SOC and humus contents were
   significantly increased by reclamation, which showed a trend of first
   increase and then decrease, and the highest value was observed in
   continuous cropping cotton 10a. In addition, the SOM is basically
   aliphatic. When the cotton field was continuously planted for 15a. Alkyl
   C: O-alkyl C and hydrophobicity index were the highest, indicating that
   the alkylation degree of SOM was high, the decomposition ability was
   strong, and the stability was improved. These results provide guidance
   for our study of SOM in different cotton continuous cropping systems and
   will provide insights into the dynamics pathways of humus substances
   stabilisation in northwest China.},

Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been identified widely in aquatic
   environments, while there are few reports detailing the environmental
   risk of wood vinegar (WV) on freshwater ecosystems. The freshwater
   planarians, Dugesia japonica, were used to evaluate the combined effects
   of PFOA and WV by examining the adverse influence of enzymatic
   activities, DNA damage and gene transcription on planarians. Compared
   with control and PFOA groups, the malonaldehyde content was lower in
   planarians treated with WV. In addition, WV enhanced the activities of
   antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial enzymes, relieving the toxicity
   effects of PFOA. We also studied the genotoxicity of PFOA and WV on
   planarians using the comet assay. WV decreased the proportion of DNA in
   the tail and the olive tail moment. Furthermore, expression of gpx, gst
   and gr genes in planarians was significantly altered following exposure
   to both PFOA and WV, compared with individual exposure. Our results
   suggest that WV could alleviate the adverse effects of PFOA on the
   aquatic environment, but ecological risk assessments and toxicological
   safety evaluations of WV are necessary.},

Abstract = {Copper is required in plant tissues at small concentrations for several
   physiological processes; however, excess metal can cause toxicity. The
   main objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate Pinus resinosa
   resistance to different concentrations of copper, and (2) assess changes
   induced by copper ions on gene expression. The targeted genes include
   the Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) and Copper-transporting
   ATPase-RAN1 (RAN1). P. resinosa seedlings were treated with different
   concentrations of copper sulphate and corresponding salt controls in
   growth chamber screening tests. These concentrations include 13, 130 mg
   and 1300 mg of copper per 1 kg of dry soil. Potassium sulfate and water
   were used as controls. The expression of MRP4 and RANI genes was
   assessed using RT-qPCR. All the genotypes tested were resistant to
   copper. There was a significant suppression of the MRP4 and RANI genes
   at the lowest concentration of copper (13 mg/kg) in comparison to the
   water control. Further increases in the copper concentrations (130 mg
   /kg and 1300 mg/kg) did not induce any significant change in gene
   expression. Overall, this study showed that P. resinosa is in general
   resistant to copper contaminants. However, copper ions affect gene
   expression, even at low concentrations.},

Abstract = {Due to global warming, drought, population growth and industrialisation,
   existing water resources are rapidly being depleted and polluted.
   Pollution caused by millions of plastic waste reaching water resources
   seriously threatens the aquatic environment. This manuscript reviews the
   current state of knowledge about microplastics in the aquatic ecosystem,
   their analysis and detection methods, and their effects on aquatic
   organisms. In addition to the measurement methods, alternative new
   methods and the relevant findings for MPs, including abundance, size,
   shapes, colours and polymer types are summarised considering the
   literature. In addition, the effects of microplastics on the aquatic
   ecosystem especially fish had been evaluated. In the light of the
   completed researches, it is understood that abundance and size of MP s
   are connected with fish species, tissue type and feeding regime. KOH for
   the digestion in tissues and fenton reagent for sediment samples were
   found as more suitable techniques. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were more
   advantaged because they are not only fast - easy but also have
   repeatable specifications.},

Abstract = {Rivers are the critical link between soil, the atmosphere, and the
   ocean's extensive carbon reservoirs, but the discharge of sewage into
   rivers has not only increased the content of organic matter but also
   significantly altered the geochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in
   the land, water, and atmosphere. However, few studies have been
   conducted to establish the relationship between the changes and
   distribution of river pollutants and the river carbon cycle. In this
   study, twenty water samples were collected from sixteen rivers in the
   middle reaches of the Yellow River (YR). The results showed that the
   concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in the mainstream decreased from north to south, while DIC
   and DOC in tributaries showed the opposite trend in the middle reaches
   of YR during summer. The distribution of pCO(2) and the C: N ratio had
   prominent regional distribution patterns in this study area, in which
   pCO(2) tended to decrease from south to north, and the C: N ratio varied
   increasingly from south to north. The source or sink state of CO2 maybe
   can be judged by the variation of the C: N ratio in this study area
   during summer.},

Title = {Lipid biomarkers as organic matter source indicators of estuarine

Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {564-585},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Surface sediments from three mangrove forests and three adjoining
   stations of the Cochin estuary were analysed for lipid biomarkers along
   with bulk parameters to delineate organic matter (OM) sources.
   Fine-grained sediments dominated in mangrove forests due to low
   hydrodynamic energy conditions compared to estuaries. The
   protein/carbohydrate ratio >1 at most of the sites implied that a major
   fraction of OM was freshly originated. Lipid/carbohydrate ratios >1
   indicated the better food quality of OM. Depleted delta C-13, higher
   organic carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (>20), tannin and lignin content and
   lipid biomarkers implied OM inputs from mangrove vegetation. Occurrence
   of unique mangrove biomarkers like taraxerol in estuarine sediments
   reflected mangrove input via tidal export of OM. Prominent relative
   abundance of steroidal ketones, triterpenoid ketones and other degraded
   triterpenoids pointed towards active diagenetic transformations of
   sedimentary OM. Significantly higher content of biochemical components
   and biomarkers in mangrove systems was due to the dominance of
   fine-grained sediments and better preservation of OM under anoxic
   conditions. The study could provide baseline information on the
   significance of OM sequestration and preservation potential of mangrove
   ecosystems, and hence it is recommended to formulate sustainable
   management strategies to conserve the existing mangrove forest cover
   along the Kerala coast.},

Title = {Limited plankton community shifts over winter inundation events in
   Austral temporary wetlands},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {586-601},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Plankton are key components of wetland ecosystems, comprising different
   food web levels. In the present study, we assessed temporal plankton
   diversity patterns in three temporary wetland systems over winter
   inundation periods. We examined taxon relationships with environmental
   variability associated with wetland inundation phase changes, over six
   consecutive sampling events (i.e. T1-T6; or until the ponds dried).
   Fifty-nine phytoplankton species belonging to 36 genera were identified
   across the three wetlands, with 21, 22 and 19 taxa being identified for
   Wetlands 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Twenty-five zooplankton taxa were
   also identified across the three wetlands. Significant differences in
   environmental variables were found across sampling events. Ammonium,
   conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, turbidity, nitrates
   (NO3-N) and zooplankton abundances were identified as important
   variables structuring phytoplankton communities, whereas, NO3-N,
   phosphates and chlorophyll-a concentration were identified as important
   environmental variables for zooplankton. No significant differences
   were, however, observed in plankton community structure over time or
   among wetlands. Accordingly, hydroperiod phases did not have any
   significant influence on the plankton taxa richness in this study, in
   contrast to other seasons in the region and other parts of the world.
   The present study highlights that where temporary wetlands are
   characterised by both summer and winter inundation events, community
   succession dynamics may be seasonally distinct and require sampling in
   both periods to fully understand propagule and emergent community
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {The Andes are an example of how geographical events, climatic and
   ecological conditions drive speciation and evolution of species.
   However, the processes leading to this diversity, such as the
   relationships between related lineages, are still poorly understood.
   Studying the phylogeography of endemic and widely distributed species in
   the Neotropical region is an effective method to describe the
   evolutionary processes underlying the appearance and the maintenance of
   species. The two related lineages, Embiratermes neotenicus and its
   supposed sister species, E. chagresi (Termitidae: Syntermitinae), have
   been observed in sympatry in the west of the Andes although the
   literature suggests their geographic separation. To better understand
   the biogeographical processes and to gain insight into the evolutionary
   history of these species in this region, we collected the two termite
   species all around the sympatry zone (Panama, West and East Colombia,
   Ecuador) and analysed morphological features, mitochondrial (COI, COII,
   16S) and nuclear (ITS2, Wg, microsatellite loci) DNA variation. We found
   mito-nuclear incongruences and admixed individuals in the sympatry zone
   and few morphometrical differences between lineages. Our analyses of the
   reproductive system suggest that E. chagresi is also able to reproduce
   through Asexual Queen Succession like E. neotenicus. We proposed that
   the two lineages diverged because of the Andes uplift and then
   reconnected due to climatic and geographic changes, northwestern
   Colombia being considered as a secondary contact zone.},

Abstract = {Species are the fundamental category and the key to formulate
   conservation efforts. DNA and ecological niche modeling have become
   valuable tools for species delimitation. Wolf spiders include few
   web-living species, such as Aglaoctenus lagotis (Holmberg, 1876), a
   priority species for conservation in Uruguay. Behavioral and body
   coloration patterns of this species have allowed us to distinguish two
   groups (forms I and II). Here, we combine information from gene trees
   and multispecies coalescent analyses on mitochondrial (cox1, 12S, 16S +
   L1 + nad1) and nuclear (intron tif5A) DNA sequences, as well as from
   ecological niches comparisons, in order to clarify their taxonomic
   identity. We worked with localities in Uruguay and Argentina, including
   sympatric and allopatric areas. Gene trees were inferred with Maximum
   Likelihood, Bayesian, and statistical parsimony analyses. Molecular
   species delimitation analyses were conducted, and the species tree and
   divergence times were co-estimated. Characterization and comparison of
   the climatic requirements of both forms throughout annual and sexual
   periods were analyzed. Species delimitation and species tree analyses
   recovered three main lineages (Form I, Form IIa, and Form IIb). Form I
   is restricted to Uruguay and is closely related and sympatric with Form
   IIa. Form IIb is located in Argentina and in the Uruguayan west coast,
   generating a sympatric area of the three forms. Regarding to the sexual
   climatic niche, the three main lineages differ and do not overlap. Our
   results support the existence of more than one lineage within what is
   nowadays Aglaoctenus lagotis. Possible evolving processes explaining
   this scenario and the conservation consequences are discussed.},

Title = {Cryptic subterranean diversity: regional phylogeography of the sand

Abstract = {Psammotermes allocerus Silvestri, 1908 is the only described species
   representing the genus Psammotermes Desneux, 1902 in Southern Africa.
   The large geographical range of this subterranean termite covers both
   summer and winter rainfall regimes. Deadwood is the preferred food when
   available, but in more arid habitats, both live and dead grasses form
   the major dietary component. Along the Namib Desert margins, the
   species' localised herbivory creates circular bare patches known as
   fairy circles. For a regional phylogeographic study of this species, we
   sampled 65 sand termite populations within drier parts of Namibia, South
   Africa, and Angola. Based on combined molecular and ecological data, we
   found considerable genetic diversification within P. allocerus. Analyses
   of two mitochondrial markers (COI, COII), including a Bayesian inference
   tree, haplotype analysis and genetic distances suggest a delineation
   into seven highly differentiated genetic groups. The `Succulent Karoo'
   group is additionally characterised by unique features of the royal
   chamber, nest and tunnel system. In conclusion, our data suggest that P.
   allocerus should be not regarded as one species but as a species
   complex. Termites of each analysed group `Northern Namib', `Western
   Kalahari Basin', `Nama', `Southwestern Kalahari', `East Gariep',
   `Southern Namib' and `Succulent Karoo' should be considered as distinct
   species. The species name P. allocerus should be used for termites of
   the `Succulent Karoo'.},

Title = {Introgression at the emerging secondary contact zone of magpie Pica pica

Abstract = {Zones of secondary contact provide a good opportunity to investigate the
   origin and dynamics of reproductive isolation between related
   populations. We analyzed genetic and phenotypic patterns and gene flow
   between two subspecies of the Eurasian magpie Pica pica s.l. which
   recently came into contact after presumably long periods of isolation.
   We describe the distribution of subspecies in a young contact zone at
   Argun' river basin in southern Siberia where populations occur in
   parapatry and an older hybrid population in eastern Mongolia. Based on
   genome-wide SNP data, we analyzed patterns and strength of gene flow
   between the subspecies. Our results indicate occasional hybridization
   with backcrossing and asymmetric introgression along a wide range in
   Transbaikalia and locally in eastern Mongolia. Males of P. p. jankowskii
   apparently exhibit higher dispersal ability towards the west compared to
   P. p. leucoptera (towards the east). The former occasionally migrates to
   eastern Mongolia and Transbaikalia where introgression of nuclear, but
   not mitochondrial DNA was evident. Bioacoustic investigations showed
   differences between the subspecies in speed and structure of
   vocalization. We discovered intermediate calls of hybrid magpies and
   bilingual birds alternating calls that are typical for the two taxa.
   Furthermore, we found dramatically decreased reproductive success in
   hybridogeneous populations. By complementing our results with
   established phylogeographic patterns of P. pica s.l. based on a
   mitochondrial marker sequence, and considering indications of sterility
   of hybrids in the contact zone, we propose to elevate the two
   corresponding subspecies to species level: P. pica for the western form
   and P. serica for the eastern form.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Environmental pollution is a global concern, and anthropogenic
   activities have contaminated natural water sources. Pesticides are one
   of the most recognised pollutants worldwide. Carbamates are a widely
   used pesticide family, and bendiocarb is a broad-spectrum carbamate
   insecticide detected in surface and groundwater. In the present work,
   acute lethal and chronic effects of bendiocarb on the early life stages
   of freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis were investigated. 24-h LC50 of
   bendiocarb on L. stagnalis embryos and juveniles was estimated at 20.39
   (18.30-22.71) mg/L and 38.35 (29.58-52.89) mg/L, respectively. Chronic
   tests were conducted for 21-d to evaluate the potential effects of the
   environmentally realistic concentrations of bendiocarb (5 and 100 mu
   g/L) on the embryos. Mortality, development, growth (embryo: egg ratio
   and shell height), heart rate, and hatching success were investigated.
   The test results showed that mortality, developmental progression,
   embryo: egg ratio, shell height measurements and cumulative hatching
   rate were not significantly impaired by chronic bendiocarb exposure
   compared to the control. However, bendiocarb induced increased heart
   rate in the exposed snails.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate trace metal contents in
   soils, to determine their spatial distribution, and to identify their
   potential natural either anthropogenic sources using multivariate
   statistical approaches. Soils were taken in the industrial area of El
   Hadjar (NE-Algeria) at 0-10 and 10-20 cm. The results revealed an order
   of Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr, whatever the depth. Mean concentrations of
   Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu and Cr were 31191, 219.87, 96.76, 47.87, 28.27 mu g/g,
   respectively, at 0-10 cm, and 29,792, 304.09, 115.45, 49.08, 28.16 mu
   g/g, at 10-20 cm. Cr and Fe mean concentrations were below or close to
   soils worldwide backgrounds. These metals perhaps principally derive
   from natural sources. The percentages of sites with Zn, Pb and Cu
   contents over the background values were: 88.23\% (Zn) > 82.35\% (Pb) >
   52.94\% (Cu) at 0-10 cm, and 94.11\% (Zn) > 88.23\% (Pb) > 41.17\% (Cu)
   at 10-20 cm. Hotspot areas of metal contamination were mainly
   concentrated around the Arcelor Mittal complex which seems to be the
   strongest effect factor influencing the spatial distributions of these
   metals. Results of this study suggest that Cr and Fe are predominantly
   derived from natural sources; Pb and Zn from industrial sources; and Cu
   from agricultural and industrial ones.},

Abstract = {Increasing exposure to Arsenic pollution is one of the biggest concerns
   regarding public health, water quality and ecosystem conservation.
   Arsenic pollution, in particular, has recently attracted attention, due
   to the contamination of drinking water. In recent years, Chitosan-based
   adsorbents have been used in the treatment of contaminated water.
   However, there are some disadvantages that resist the practical
   applications of chitosan, such as low solubility in acidic media,
   mechanical strength, selectivity and adsorption capacity. Thus
   functional modifications on chitosan are carried out to improve its
   properties. This review provides information on As contamination in
   complex environmental settings. It mainly describes the applications of
   the radiation-induced grafted biopolymer in the removal of arsenic from
   contaminated water. It also highlights the adsorbent's regeneration,
   disposal methods and its cost evaluation.},

Abstract = {In this study, the Cu(II) biosorption potential of the raw (RTP) and
   modified Thymus pannonicus (MTP) leaves was investigated in batch and
   continuous systems. FTIR, SEM, SEM-EDX and Zeta potential analyses were
   used for the characterisation of biomass. In the batch system, pH,
   amount of biosorbent, initial heavy metal concentration, contact time
   and temperature parameters were studied. According to the optimum pH and
   biosorbent amount determined in the batch system, the effect of the flow
   rate and column bed height on the biosorption was investigated by MTP in
   the continuous mode. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used
   to explain the biosorption mechanism, and it was seen that both
   biomasses conformed to the Langmuir isotherm. Pseudo-first-order and
   pseudo-second-order kinetic models were used in kinetic studies, and
   both RTP and MTP followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. While
   the equilibrium was established in 20 min in the removal of Cu(II) with
   RTP, this value increased to 30 min with MTP. The maximum monolayer
   biosorption capacity was determined as 46.21 mg/g for RTP and 82.70 mg/g
   for MTP. Column studies showed that the MTP was successful in removing
   Cu(II) from the solution in the continuous system.},

Title = {An unknown segment number in centipedes: a new species of
   Scolopocryptops (Chilopoda: Scolopendromorpha) from Trinidad with 25
   leg-bearing segments},

Abstract = {A new species of the widely distributed centipede genus Scolopocryptops
   Newport, 1845 is described from Trinidad based on light microscopic
   documentation. Scolopocryptops sukuyan n. sp. is remarkable for being
   the only centipede known to have 25 leg-bearing segments in the trunk.
   The new species resembles Scolocryptops melanostoma Newport, 1845 in the
   shape of the cephalic plate and the coxosternal tooth plates and
   resembles S. miersii Newport, 1845 in the process of the forcipular
   trochanteroprefemur. It differs from both by the number of leg-bearing
   trunk segments (25 vs 23) and lengths of the thickened chitinous bands
   on the tooth plates, coxopleural process, and spinous prefemoral
   processes. Its systematic position within Scolopendromorpha, in which
   all but one of ca 700 species have either 21 or 23 segments and this
   number is mostly constant within families, indicates a trend of segment
   addition from 21 to 23 to 25 in the lineage leading to the new species.
   A review of patterns of variation in segment numbers in centipedes
   suggests that the 23 to 25 shift in Scolopocryptops is a consequence of
   the production of one extra body unit prior to the duplication of
   primary trunk segmental units common to all centipedes. This differs
   from the dramatic difference (39 or 43 vs. 21 or 23 leg-bearing
   segments) separating the most polypodous scolopendromorph,
   Scolopendropsis duplicata Chagas-Kinior et al. (Zootaxa 1888:36-46,
   2008), from its closest relative, likely due to duplication (or
   splitting) of the whole set of trunk segments prior to duplication of
   the primary trunk segmental units.},

Title = {Finding a home for the ram's horn squid: phylogenomic analyses support
   Spirula spirula (Cephalopoda: Decapodiformes) as a close relative of

Abstract = {The molluscan clade Decapodiformes (Cephalopoda) comprises a diverse and
   enigmatic assemblage including inshore and offshore squids, bobtails,
   cuttlefishes, and the ram's horn squid (Spirulida: Spirula spirula). The
   latter species is of particular interest to paleontologists because it
   is the only living cephalopod with an internal chambered, spiral-shaped,
   calcareous shell resembling those seen in some fossil cephalopod taxa.
   Spirulida has been difficult to place phylogenetically, in part because
   it shares different features with sepiolids, sepiids, and oegopsids,
   creating conflict in morphological analyses. Unlike morphological
   assumptions of a close relationship with sepiids, previous molecular
   studies have found support for Spirulida as a close relative of
   Bathyteuthida and Oegopsida. Identifying the correct phylogenetic
   placement of Spirulida could allow alternative hypotheses of phragmocone
   evolution, e.g., retention of an ancestral phragmocone in Spirulida and
   Sepiida vs. independent reacquisition of the phragmocone in these taxa,
   to be evaluated. In the present study, we combined new, high-quality
   transcriptome data for a specimen of Spirula spirula with additional new
   and previously published transcriptome data for decapodiform
   cephalopods. Phylogenetic analyses of several matrices yielded trees in
   which Spirula spirula was recovered as the sister group of the oceanic
   open-eyed squids (Oegopsida). This close relationship of Spirula to
   oceanic squids, rather than to nearshore, demersal/benthic decapodiform
   lineages, provides further support for an ``onshore to offshore{''}
   model of decapodiform evolution.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the heavy metals (Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd,
   and Pb) accumulation and speciation in the mangrove and lagoon sediments
   in the Yundang Lagoon. This also investigates the phytoremediation
   capacity of the mangrove species in the forestation areas. The result
   showed that significantly (P < 0.05) higher amount of organic carbon in
   the mangrove forestation sediments than lagoon sediments. Mangrove
   forestation increased the accumulation of Cr, Mn, Cu, As, and Zn in the
   mangrove sediments than lagoon sediments. According to chemical
   speciation, it revealed that acid-soluble fraction decreased and
   oxidisable fraction increased in the mangrove sediments than lagoon
   sediments. Cu, Ni, Cr, and As has considerably increased in oxidisable
   fraction, and Cd and Pb have increased in the reducible fraction in the
   mangrove sediment. The bio-concentration factor and translocation factor
   values indicate that these species of mangroves are not efficient
   accumulators of heavy metals from the surrounding environment but
   potential metals translocators. These results suggest that mangrove
   forestation can increase the circulation of heavy metals resulting in
   stabilise the polluted environment. Moreover, this study suggests that
   mangrove forestation has enhanced metals accumulation but decreased
   their bioavailability and mobility in the sediment.},

Abstract = {While airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution is a serious problem
   for urban environments, it can be reduced through uptake by plant
   leaves. In this study, we investigated and compared the uptake of
   PM-bound toxic metals by different plant species. Enrichment factor (EF)
   and correlation analyses across different sample types indicated
   anthropogenic origins of these toxic metals with airborne source
   signatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of both leaf
   surfaces (adaxial and abaxial) suggested that the micro-morphological
   properties of the leaf surface (e.g. stomata, trichomes, epicuticular
   wax, and epidermal appendages) control the accumulation of PM and
   associated metals in plant leaves. Senna siamea leaves showed the most
   micro-morphological variation as well as the maximum concentration of
   toxic metals. It was found that foliar uptake of PM-bound toxic metals
   is affected by leaf surface morphological characteristics. Our results
   imply that plant speciation strategies can be used to help decrease PM
   pollution.},

Abstract = {The origin, diversification, and secondary loss of sexually dimorphic
   characters are common in animal evolution. In some cases, structurally
   and functionally similar traits have evolved independently in multiple
   lineages. Prominent examples of such traits include the male-specific
   grasping structures that develop on the front legs of many dipteran
   insects. In this report, we describe the evolution and development of
   one of these structures, the male-specific ``sex brush.{''} The sex
   brush is composed of densely packed, irregularly arranged modified
   bristles and is found in several distantly related lineages in the
   family Drosophilidae. Phylogenetic analysis using 250 genes from over
   200 species provides modest support for a single origin of the sex brush
   followed by many secondary losses; however, independent origins of the
   sex brush cannot be ruled out completely. We show that sex brushes
   develop in very similar ways in all brush-bearing lineages. The dense
   packing of brush hairs is explained by the specification of bristle
   precursor cells at a near-maximum density permitted by the lateral
   inhibition mechanism, as well as by the reduced size of the surrounding
   epithelial cells. In contrast to the female and the ancestral male
   condition, where bristles are arranged in stereotypical, precisely
   spaced rows, cell migration does not contribute appreciably to the
   formation of the sex brush. The complex phylogenetic history of the sex
   brush can make it a valuable model for investigating coevolution of
   sex-specific morphology and mating behavior.},

Abstract = {Aphids are hemimetabolous insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis
   without pupation. The annual life cycle of most aphids includes both an
   asexual (viviparous) and a sexual (oviparous) phase. Sexual reproduction
   only occurs once per year and is followed by many generations of asexual
   reproduction, during which aphids propagate exponentially with
   telescopic development. Here, we discuss the potential links between
   viviparous embryogenesis and derived developmental features in the pea
   aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, particularly focusing on germline
   specification and axis determination, both of which are key events of
   early development in insects. We also discuss potential evolutionary
   paths through which both viviparous and oviparous females might have
   come to utilize maternal germ plasm to drive germline specification.
   This developmental strategy, as defined by germline markers, has not
   been reported in other hemimetabolous insects. In viviparous females,
   furthermore, we discuss whether molecules that in other insects
   characterize germ plasm, like Vasa, also participate in posterior
   determination and how the anterior localization of the hunchback
   orthologue Ap-hb establishes the anterior-posterior axis. We propose
   that the linked chain of developing oocytes and embryos within each
   ovariole and the special morphology of early embryos might have driven
   the formation of evolutionary novelties in germline specification and
   axis determination in the viviparous aphids. Moreover, based upon the
   finding that the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is closely associated
   with germ cells throughout embryogenesis, we propose presumptive roles
   for B. aphidicola in aphid development, discussing how it might regulate
   germline migration in both reproductive modes of pea aphids. In summary,
   we expect that this review will shed light on viviparous as well as
   oviparous development in aphids.},

Abstract = {The new insecticide broflanilide, which possesses high insecticidal
   activity against agricultural pests, acts on the gamma-aminobutyric acid
   receptor in the insect nervous system. At present, few studies assessed
   its effect on the nervous system of zebrafish, especially its
   sub-chronic toxicity on the zebrafish brain. In this study, the
   sub-chronic toxicity of broflanilide on the zebrafish brain was
   assessed. After 21 days of exposure at 36.3 mu g/L, broflanilide caused
   oxidative damage to the zebrafish brain, increased the levels of
   reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and inhibited the
   activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione
   peroxidase. Overall, these changes result in brain cell apoptosis, and
   inhibited growth and development. Moreover, broflanilide affects the
   release of acetylcholinesterase, gamma-aminobutyric acid, 5-hydroxy
   tryptamine, and dopamine as well as the expression of related genes in
   the brain, leading to abnormal zebrafish behaviour. These results
   corroborate the sub-chronic toxicity of broflanilide on zebrafish brain,
   which helps the further understanding of the potential environmental
   risk of broflanilide.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of a
   laboratory-scale Hybrid Constructed Wetland (HCW) planted with different
   macrophytes, at different hydraulic retention times (HRT), for

   efficiency of HCW planted with Phragmites Australis and Lemna Minor was
   kept on increasing with the increase in hydraulic retention time.
   Maximum efficiency of HCW was observed with a 12-day HRT, that is, 82.6,
   .90.9, 78.3, 92.1, 80.2, 93.5, 99.6, 99.3, and 100\% reduction from the
   zero-time value for, TSS, BOD5, COD TKN, OP, TC, FC, MF, and FS,
   respectively. Interestingly, we found a strong negative relationship
   between pH and the majority of microbiological parameters which
   demonstrates its role in the phytoremediation process, especially in
   terms of mesophilic flora and faecal coliform removal.},

Title = {Co-precipitation synthesis of non-cytotoxic and magnetic cobalt ferrite

Abstract = {Owing to unique physical and chemical properties, nanostructured
   magnetic materials have proved their efficacy in treating heavy metals
   from the aqueous system. In this study, oleic acid-coated cobalt ferrite
   is synthesised by the co-precipitation method for the remediation of
   Pb(II) ions from an aqueous solution. The synthesised CoFe2O4@OA was
   characterised by various analytical techniques including X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample
   magnetometry (VSM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and
   dynamic light scattering (DLS). The non-cytotoxic behaviour of
   CoFe2O4@OA suggests it a risk-free adsorbent for the aquatic
   environment. The mechanism of adsorption reveals that electrostatic
   interaction, inner-sphere complex formation within Pb(II) ions and
   CoFe2O4@OA are responsible for the removal. The kinetics experiment
   followed the pseudo-second-order model with a regression coefficient
   (R-2) of 0.999. In the isothermal study, equilibrium data were well
   tuned with the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption
   capacity of 16.7 mg g(-1). The desorption experiment with a series of
   acid (HCl, HNO3) and alkali (NaOH, KOH) solvents informs the high
   dependency of desorption efficiency on the solvent type and
   concentration. Pb(II) ions removal efficiency using 0.5M HCL and 0.6M
   NaOH was attainted 98\% and 82\%, respectively, after three cycles.
   Thus, CoFe2O4@OA maintains sustainable development by reusing and saving
   the aquatic ecosystem by eliminating Pb(II) ions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effluent treatment
   from Nile tilapia farming in a biofloc system with a consortium of
   microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) and zooplankton (Daphnia similis). Thus,
   integrated cultures of C. vulgaris and D. similis were performed in two
   forms of wastewater treatment: sedimentation (S) and non-sedimentation
   (NS), in four different salinities (1, 2, 3 and 4 g L-1). Water quality,
   growth of D. similis, behaviour of C. vulgaris, efficiency of removal of
   nitrogen compounds, orthophosphate, and total suspended solids (TSS)
   were measured. D. similis had higher density in 3NS (p < 0.05), while
   population die-off occurred in 4S and 4NS. The 2S and 1NS combinations
   stood out in bioremediation, achieving removal of up to 70.37\% nitrate,
   75.74\% orthophosphate, and 90.74\% TSS. 2S and 3S cultures became
   self-sufficient from day 21. Thus, the Chlorella-Daphnia consortium
   using 3NS allowed better production of D. similis, whereas salinities 2
   g L-1 (S) and 1 g L-1 (NS) provided better bioremediation, and the use
   of S wastewater improved the sustainability of the system. These results
   contribute to a better evaluation of cultures in consortia of organisms
   for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater and the production of live
   feed for aquaculture.},

Title = {Contributions to Trachelyopterus (Siluriformes: Auchenipteridae) species
   diagnosis by cytotaxonomic autapomorphies: from U2 snRNA chromosome

Abstract = {Trachelyopterus is a Neotropical catfish genus with a controversial
   taxonomic history due to the morphological similarity among species.
   Cytogenetically, only classic techniques (Giemsa, C-band, and Ag-NOR),
   18S rDNA, 5S rDNA, telomeric probes, and the microsatellite (GATA)(n)
   have been applied in some species of the genus. Therefore, through an
   integrative approach with the 18S and 5S rDNAs, we describe for the
   first time in Trachelyopterus the distribution pattern of U2 snRNA and
   H3 and H4 histone genes and discuss evolutive and cytotaxonomic aspects
   of six Trachelyopterus species: T. striatulus, T. galeatus, and T.
   porosus from the Amazonas River basin, T. coriaceus and Trachelyopterus
   aff. galeatus from the Araguaia River basin, and Trachelyopterus aff.
   coriaceus from the Paraguay River basin. The 18S rDNA and U2 snRNA
   demonstrate a single locus, while 5S rDNA and histone genes had multiple
   loci. Besides that, a synteny of histone cluster with 18S rDNA locus was
   observed, and a pericentric inversion of the U2 snRNA was detected in
   Trachelyopterus aff. galeatus. Cytotaxonomically, the 5S rDNA was the
   most efficient marker and revealed chromosomal autapomorphies of four
   species, whereas the histone genes and the 18S rDNA distinguished two
   species and the U2 snRNA differentiated one species. As a result, all
   species could be distinguished, including two possible new species.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of the poorly known
   genus Spalerosophis (Serpentes: Colubridae)},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Spalerosophis Jan, 1865, is a colubrid snake genus distributed in arid
   and semiarid regions from northwestern Africa to northern India. Six
   species of Spalerosophis are identified based on traditional morphology;
   however, there are arguments about their systematic status. We performed
   the first molecular phylogenetic analyses for this genus using
   nucleotide sequences of c. 2278 bp from three mitochondrial genes (12S
   rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cyt b) to investigate the phylogenetic relationships
   and historical evolution of the poorly known Spalerosophis species and
   doubtful populations. We used fossil calibrations for dating
   divergences. Our phylogenetic analyses clearly showed five separate
   species with high support values, including S. arenarius, S. atriceps,
   S. microlepis, S. diadema schirasianus, and S. diadema cliffordii.
   Bayesian calibrated molecular clock suggested that the genus
   Spalerosophis diverged from the common ancestor in the Paleogene around
   35.28 Mya (25.89-44.66). Our analysis indicated that isolated S.
   atriceps was separated around 21.72 Mya (10.86-33.04) as the basal
   diverged species of the genus. This suggested that the species of
   Spalerosophis probably originated from an ancestor somewhere in the
   Iranian Plateau and then dispersed to its current geographical range.
   Spalerosophis arenarius and S. atriceps were identified as the two last
   diverged members of the genus, separated from S. d. schirasianus during
   the Middle Miocene about 13.31 Mya (5.52-22.33). These results indicate
   that the separation of Spalerosophis species coincided with the orogenic
   events of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran and the Sulaiman
   Mountains in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Their diversification may
   therefore be the result of vicariance events that promoted their current
   distribution. This work provides a foundation for future studies on the
   phylogeny, diversity, and evolution of the genus Spalerosophis and
   highlights the need for more molecular studies on unknown snakes.},

Abstract = {Considering the threat of pollinator decline to seriously affect
   ecosystem function and food security, the conservation of pollinating
   insects has become of utmost importance, entailing the accurate taxa
   identification in order to establish a long-term monitoring strategy. In
   addition to pollination service, hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) also
   have a role as habitat bioindicators, as well as in organic matter
   recycling and protection of cultivated plants from pests. Representing
   one of the most species-rich hoverfly genera, Merodon Meigen, 1803 holds
   numerous taxonomic challenges, especially within the monophyletic
   Merodon ruficornis species group, which is characterized by incongruence
   between morphological and molecular data. In the present study, we
   successfully resolved the taxonomy of the M. ruficornis group using a
   combination of four genetic markers (3 ` and 5 ` ends of the COI gene,
   28S and ITS2) and demonstrate their potential as molecular tools for
   resolving taxonomic questions within the Merodon genus. We proved the
   utility of indels as valuable molecular signals for the taxa
   delimitation within M. ruficornis group by performing two different
   indels schemes-(1) excluding indels from analysis as missing data; and
   (2) coding indels as presence/absence character matrix. In addition to
   the found congruence with morphologically defined species, our results
   revealed intraspecific differentiation between Anatolian and Balkan
   populations within three species-M. loewi, M. trebevicensis and M.
   armipes. According to the divergence time estimates, lineage
   diversification within the M. ruficornis group probably took place
   during Pleistocene climatic changes as a consequence of the species'
   range alterations.},

Abstract = {Detailed anatomical studies of flowers and fruits may render traits of
   phylogenetic importance, but are still rare in the Boraginales. An Old
   World clade of Cordia comprises many dioecious species, but the floral
   anatomy is largely unexplored and, hence, the structural basis for sex
   separation. Fresh material of buds, functionally unisexual flowers and
   fruits were studied using a stack shot camera. Fixed such material of
   Cordia crenata, C. cf. grandicalyx and C. sinensis was sectioned using a
   microtome and stained with safranin red and astra blue, and the
   gynoecial surface was studied using SEM. The stamens of the female
   flowers are largely intact, but do not produce pollen, whereas the
   gynoecium of the male flowers is highly reduced though develops ovules
   lacking an embryo sac. The morphologically rather unreduced stamens of
   the female flower may have undergone a shift of function from producing
   pollen towards attracting pollinators by optical signals. The outer
   parenchyma of the gynoecium is strongly stained and after fertilisation,
   one through three ovules are maturing towards seeds. The presence of
   more than a single seed enclosed in the undivided endocarp is rare in
   Cordiaceae.},

Abstract = {Johnston's organ has been shown to act as an antennal auditory organ
   across a spectrum of insect species. In the hemimetabolous desert locust
   Schistocerca gregaria, Johnston's organ must be functional on hatching
   and so develops in the pedicellar segment of the antenna during
   embryogenesis. Here, we employ the epithelial cell marker Lachesin to
   identify the pedicellar domain of the early embryonic antenna and then
   triple-label against Lachesin, the mitosis marker phosphohistone-3, and
   neuron-specific horseradish peroxidase to reveal the sense-organ
   precursors for Johnston's organ and their lineages. Beginning with a
   single progenitor at approximately a third of embryogenesis, additional
   precursors subsequently appear in both the ventral and dorsal pedicellar
   domains, each generating a lineage or clone. Lineage locations are
   remarkably conserved across preparations and ages, consistent with the
   epithelium possessing an underlying topographic coordinate system that
   determines the cellular organization of Johnston's organ. By
   mid-embryogenesis, twelve lineages are arranged circumferentially in the
   pedicel as in the adult structure. Each sense-organ precursor is
   associated with a smaller mitotically active cell from which the
   neuronal complement of each clone may derive. Neuron numbers within a
   clone increase in discrete steps with age and are invariant between
   clones and across preparations of a given age. At mid-embryogenesis,
   each clone comprises five cells consolidated into a tightly bound
   cartridge. A long scolopale extends apically from each cartridge to an
   insertion point in the epithelium, and bundled axons project basally
   toward the brain. Comparative data suggest mechanisms that might also
   regulate the developmental program of Johnston's organ in the locust.},

Abstract = {Mechanical influencers have long been shown to affect mature bone. Bone
   mechanosensation is a key feature that allows the skeleton to adapt to
   environmental constraints. In this study, we describe the response of
   immature, developing bones to a mechanical stimulus. To do so, zebrafish
   larvae at different stages of development were exposed to whole-body
   vibration (WBV) at a low frequency of 20 Hz, for up to 4 days. Whole
   mount Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining revealed age-related and
   bone type-specific defects. Specifically, the parhypural and hypural 1
   caudal fin endoskeletal elements were affected when the exposure to WBV
   started early during their development. We show that these WBV-induced
   parhypural and hypural 1 patterning defects are triggered by a
   Sox9-independent pathway, potentially by reducing the distance
   separating adjacent chondrogenic condensations in the developing tail
   skeleton. The remaining hypurals were unaffected by the WBV treatment.
   Altogether, our results indicate that, upon exposure to vibration,
   chondrogenic cell progenitors can react to mechanical stimuli early
   during their development, which ultimately affects the skeletal
   patterning of the growing zebrafish larvae. These findings open a new
   research avenue to better understand the cellular processes involved in
   developing, patterning, and maintaining skeletal tissue.},

Title = {Early Pleistocene hominin teeth from Gongwangling of Lantian, Central
   China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The fossil hominin individual from Gongwangling of Lantian, Central
   China, represents one of the earliest members attributed to Homo erectus
   in East Asia. Recent paleomagnetic analyses have yielded an age of 1.63
   Ma for the Gongwangling hominin. The fossils from this site are critical
   to characterize the morphological features of early hominins in East
   Asia and to understand their relationships with other earlier and later
   members of the genus Homo. However, most morphological details of the
   Gongwangling cranium were obliterated due to postmortem erosion and
   deformation. Here we used high-resolution microcomputed tomography and
   three-dimensional virtual imaging techniques to extract the teeth and
   reconstruct the worn/damaged areas, describe the external morphology,
   measure crown diameters, record nonmetric traits of the crown and root,
   and investigate the shape of the enamel-dentine junction using geometric
   morphometrics. We compared the data obtained from the six teeth of the
   Gongwangling hominin with African early Homo, African and Georgian Homo
   erectus s.l., Asian Homo erectus, Homo antecessor, pre-Neanderthals,
   Neanderthals, and modern humans. Our results show that the Gongwangling
   specimens display affinities with other specimens attributed to H.
   erectus s.l. The highly divergent and noncoalesced three-root system in
   the Gongwangling specimens is comparable to that in the Early
   Pleistocene members of H. erectus s.l., and differs from Middle
   Pleistocene representatives of the species. The enamel-dentine junction
   shape of the Gongwangling molars prefigures the Asian H. erectus pattern
   later found in East Asian Middle Pleistocene H. erectus. The
   morphological comparisons between East Asian Early Pleistocene (e.g.,
   Gongwangling, Meipu, and Quyuan River Mouth) and Middle Pleistocene H.
   erectus (e.g., Zhoukoudian, Hexian, and Yiyuan) suggest a potential
   temporal trend within this species in East Asia.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The correct identification of species diversity of small single-celled
   green coccoid microalgae still causes difficulties, since their
   relatively simple morphology hides a high physiological, ecological and
   genetic diversity. The use of molecular genetic methods has
   revolutionized the study of the true biodiversity of so-called ``small
   green balls,{''} allowing the discovery of numerous new taxa. This
   article presents the results of a study of strains recently isolated
   from small freshwater urbanized lakes (Vasilievsky Lakes system, Samara
   region, Russian Federation). Morphologically, these strains were close
   to the genus Meyerella: spherical cells, cup-shaped, or wide
   girdle-shaped parietal chloroplast without pyrenoid. Analysis of the
   18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences also showed that the studied strains belong
   to this genus. Comparison of morphological characteristics, habitat and
   lifestyle, analysis of tree topology, genetic distances and secondary
   structures of the ITS1 and ITS2 spacers of the Meyerella members, as
   well as the delimitation results using the Automatic Barcode Gap
   Discovery (ABGD) method, the Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) model, the
   Generalized Mixed Yule The Coalescent (GMYC) method allowed us to
   establish that the studied strains ACSSI 346, ACSSI 362 and ACSSI 363
   are representatives of a new species - M. similis sp. nov.},

Title = {Cladistic analysis of the transisthmian genus Eurytellina (Bivalvia:

Abstract = {One of the main questions of phylogenetic systematics has recently
   focused on the reliability and robustness of taxonomic data. Many recent
   studies are devoted almost exclusively to the molecular-morphological
   couplet. However, in many metazoan taxa, the presence of skeletal parts
   or poorly preserved soft parts is dominant in collections, making it
   difficult to extract genetic material. This is the case with many
   invertebrates and unfortunately a very common situation in mollusk
   collections. Herein we carry out a phylogenetic analysis of the
   transisthmian American tellinid bivalve genus Eurytellina based on
   anatomical and morphometric characters, using different ways to analyze
   the morphometric data under parsimony-based methods. Species in this
   genus are recognized as deep infaunal burrowers and present a strong
   filter-feeding apparatus. We included 144 taxonomically important
   morphoanatomical and morphometric characters and 19 landmark characters.
   The main results are a) Tellinota (formerly a synonym of Eurytellina) is
   confirmed as a taxon restricted to Africa; b) Eurytellina lineata is
   confirmed as sister group to all the other members of the genus; c)
   there is strong evidence for three robust clades, here named as groups
   trinitatis, nitens and punicea; d) some transisthmian sister species
   hypotheses are confirmed-although the pattern of speciation and
   radiation may be related to a complex long-term elevation of the Panama
   Isthmus and previous events (probably since the early Cenozoic).
   Furthermore, several new anatomical characters are described within the
   Order Tellinoidea, which should be considered in future studies.},

Abstract = {Thecae horns are specialized anther extensions present in two tribes of
   Araceae: Cryptocoryneae and Schismatoglottideae. This structure is
   important in defining the generic boundaries and segregations within
   Schismatoglottideae. Eleven convergent lineages of thecae horns have
   evolved within Schismatoglottideae, contributing to the diverse stamen
   structures and thecae orientations. Here, we investigated the stamens of
   22 taxa belonging to eight genera (Aridarum, Burttianthus, Hera,
   Heteroaridarum, Pursegloveia, Naiadia, Tawaia, and Toga) of
   Schismatoglottideae. We assessed the floral biology by focusing on the
   angle and movement of the thecae horns during the pistillate and
   staminate phases of anthesis. The angle of the thecae horns changed at
   the start of anthesis and, in several species, elevated further during
   staminate anthesis. Papillae cells, smooth or verrugated surface, are
   present on the thecae horns with the excavated connective often found to
   be smooth vs. non excavated connective, with verrugated surface. The
   presence of calcium oxalate packages decreases from pistillate phase to
   staminate phase of anthesis and is postulated to be a defense mechanism
   against predators.},

Abstract = {The diversification processes underlying why Amazonia hosts the most
   species-rich vertebrate fauna on earth remain poorly understood. We
   studied the spatio-temporal diversification of a tree frog clade
   distributed throughout Amazonia (Anura: Hylidae: Osteocephalus,
   Tepuihyla, and Dryaderces) and tested the hypothesis that Miocene mega
   wetlands located in western and central Amazonia impacted connectivity
   among major biogeographic areas during extensive periods. We assessed
   the group's diversity through DNA-based (16S rRNA) species delimitation
   to identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from 557 individuals. We
   then selected one terminal for each OTU (n=50) and assembled a
   mitogenomic matrix (similar to 14,100 bp; complete for 17 terminals) to
   reconstruct a Bayesian, time-calibrated phylogeny encompassing nearly
   all described species. Ancestral area reconstruction indicates that each
   genus was restricted to one of the major Amazonian biogeographic areas
   (western Amazonia, Guiana Shield and Brazilian Shield, respectively)
   between similar to 10 and 20 Mya, suggesting that they diverged and
   diversified in isolation during this period around the Pebas mega
   wetland. After 10 Mya and the transition to the modern configuration of
   the Amazon River watershed, most speciation within each genus continued
   to occur within each area. In Osteocephalus, only three species expanded
   widely across Amazonia (< 6 Mya), and all were pond-breeders. Species
   with other breeding modes remained mostly restricted to narrow ranges.
   The spectacular radiation of Osteocephalus was probably driven by
   climatic stability, habitat diversity and the acquisition of new
   reproductive modes along the Andean foothills and western Amazonia. Our
   findings add evidence to the importance of major hydrological changes
   during the Miocene on biotic diversification in Amazonia.},

Abstract = {Two multinucleate amoebae species, nowadays belonging to the genus
   Thecochaos, were never seen alive since 1913. Stained preparations
   deposited with the British Museum of Natural History (London) by E.
   Penard remain the only material proof of the existence of these
   organisms. We recently found an amoeba, identified as Thecochaos
   fibrillosum, in the soil sample originating from Chernevaya taiga soil
   in South Siberia (Russia). In total, we have got 15 cells of this
   species; however, using this amount of cells, we performed light- and
   electron-microscopic study, made permanent stained preparations,
   obtained SSU rRNA gene sequence using single-cell DNA isolation
   technique, and performed NGS sequencing to obtain genomic data for
   multigene analysis. Its SSU gene is unusually short (1586 bp), has
   significant losses in many laps, and, to the moment, is the shortest one
   known among Amoebozoa. The SSU sequence of this species robustly groups
   within the family Thecamoebidae as a sister to Thecamoeba/Sappinia
   clade. Multigene analysis either supported this position of Thecochaos
   or suggested its grouping with Sappinia. This study demonstrates that
   modern single-cell techniques allow correct and complete study and
   description of rare and almost non-cultivable amoebae species.},

Abstract = {Morpho-functional polymorphism of modules, also known as ``division of
   labor{''}, is a widespread phenomenon independently evolving multiple
   times in the colonies of many aquatic invertebrates and invertebrate
   chordates. Polymorphic zooids are especially diverse among
   Cheilostomata, the evolutionarily most successful clade in the phylum
   Bryozoa. The most diverse among cheilostome polymorphs are avicularia
   and vibracularia, acting as defensive, repelling, cleaning and
   locomotory ``colonial organs{''}. While their skeletal characters were
   intensively studied, the soft tissues have largely been neglected. This
   hampers evolutionary interpretations. In this study, we compared the
   muscular system in five contrasting types of these polymorphs from 10
   species of eight related as well as distant families. In contrast with
   the prevailing view, we found that the structural and functional changes
   affecting the muscular system during evolutionary transition from
   autozooid to polymorph were considerably more diverse and complex than
   mere ``vestigialization{''}. These changes included muscle loss,
   hypertrophy, rearrangement (regrouping and relocation), fusion, and
   acquisition of asymmetry and muscle striation. Asynchronous contraction
   of originally synchronously working muscles was presumably evolved in
   advanced vibracularia. Some of these modifications were recorded in all
   avicularian types, whereas others were characteristic only for
   particular taxa or polymorphic categories. Our study showed that not
   only skeletal, but also soft parts of the polymorphs were evolutionarily
   very flexible and modified to various degrees and in various directions.},

Abstract = {The genus Noctilio includes the piscivorous N. leporinus and the
   insectivoros N. albiventris, which have a distribution restricted to low
   and humid coastal areas and the main river basins in America.
   Considering the geographic morphometric variation and the molecular
   divergence previously documented in genus Noctilio, we analyze
   two-dimensional geometric configurations of cranial characters to assess
   if the amount of morphological variation or the existence of
   morphological discontinuities within Noctilio species is compatible with
   the possible existence of several species, as well as their
   relationships in a combined phylogenetic reconstruction. The shape and
   size variation of cranial characters supports differences among two of
   three molecular lineages previously reported in N. albiventris-one
   distributed in Central America and North of South America, and the other
   distributed in South America. We also recover differences between the
   two mitochondrial clades for N. leporinus, one distributed from Mexico
   to the west side of the Andes and the Greater Antilles, and the other to
   the eastern side of the Andes and the Lesser Antilles. Based on the
   combined phylogeny, we recover the paraphyly of N. albiventris, composed
   of two morphologically differentiated taxa, and the monophyly of N.
   leporinus, composed of two morphologically divergent lineages. The
   latitudinal position and environmental variables correlate with cranial
   variation and support the geographic pattern of differentiation in the
   evolutionary history of Noctilio.},

   research. Thus, several species of well-studied spiders, including
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum, have been successfully bred for such
   purposes. Crossopriza lyoni is a Haplogyne spider, globally distributed
   and widespread in human inhabitants, prompting interest in various
   studies over the last decades. Despite its scientific importance, no
   laboratory-bred C. lyoni has been documented. Therefore, we describe a
   successful captive breeding system of the species under controlled
   conditions to establish a laboratory stock culture. Methods for mating
   induction, egg collection and segregation, artificial embryo incubation,
   and colony husbandry are discussed. The technique presented is a simple
   and low-cost approach that is reliable for C. lyoni propagation in the
   laboratory over several generations.},

Abstract = {Many anuran species remain to be formally named and described in
   Amazonia, notably in the Guiana Shield, and particularly in megadiverse
   groups such as Pristimantis. Several species in the Guiana Shield region
   have been confused with Pristimantis marmoratus and P. ockendeni.
   Hylodes grandoculis, a taxon previously placed in the synonymy of P.
   marmoratus, may be available for one of these species. To disentangle
   this confusing situation, we examined the external morphology and
   osteology (via mu-CT scans) of the holotype of H. grandoculis, the
   holotype of Pristimantis marmoratus, and of recently collected material
   for which we also analyzed molecular, acoustic, and morphological
   variation. We concluded that some populations from Suriname and northern
   Para, Brazil, are distinct from P. marmoratus and correspond to
   Pristimantis grandoculis. Other populations, from French Guiana, are
   closely related to P. grandoculis but their status remains ambiguous.
   Finally, some populations, from French Guiana and Amapa, Brazil, are
   conspicuously distinct from both P. marmoratus and P. grandoculis and
   are described herein as P. crepitaculus sp. nov. A third species,
   belonging to a ``trans-amazon complex{''}, occurs in southern Suriname,
   Guyana, and Brazil and remains undescribed. Pristimantis grandoculis and
   related populations from French Guiana lack external tympanum,
   columella, pharyngeal ostia, vocal slits and do not vocalize. This
   represents a rare, perhaps unique, example of a deaf and mute species of
   frogs from the Amazonian lowlands.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the pollution level in the central part of
   the Buyuk Menderes River (in both the main tributary and curuksu stream)
   in Denizli (Turkey) using water physicochemical parameters and biomarker
   responses in Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae). In
   physicochemical parameter evaluations, Sigma, Korucuk, and Guzelkoy
   stations were determined to have higher mean temperature, pH, salinity,
   conductivity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) values and lower
   dissolved oxygen (dO(2)) and saturated oxygen (sO(2)) values than
   Bekilli, Mahmutlu, and Saraykoy stations. In biomarker response
   evaluations, C. riparius larvae from Saraykoy, Sigma, Korucuk, and
   Guzelkoy stations were found to exhibit inhibited acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) activities (55\%-68\%) and elevated 7-ethoxyresorufin
   O-deethylase (EROD) activities (191\%-281\%), glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) activities (138\%-187\%), and metallothionein (MT) contents
   (155\%-231\%) when compared with the control values. This study proves
   that different stations are exposed to different pollution sources, the
   pollution level of a station varies depending on the season, and the
   stations on curuksu stream, among which Guzelkoy appears to be the most
   contaminated, are exposed to more pollutants than those on the main
   tributary of the river.},

Abstract = {Progress in eupulmonate gastropod taxonomy is limited by absence of
   single- or low-copy nuclear DNA markers that provide species-scale
   insights. We detail here the single-copy intron 8 of the embryonic
   lethality and abnormal visual system gene (ELAVI8). High sequence
   conservation within flanking exons 8 and 9 allowed design of
   non-redundant primers that enable PCR amplification across a broad
   phylogenetic extent. Across the Eupulmonata and Hygrophila ELAVI8
   product ranged from 602 to 802 base pairs in length. A multiple sequence
   alignment across 62 taxa, representing 36 genera and 12 major clades,
   showed 1296 sites with 865 variable positions. Typically, 2-10 base pair
   differences were noted between closely related species within a genus,
   with 74-200 bases differing between major infra-order clades. ELAVI8
   maximum-likelihood trees showed essentially identical topologies at high
   levels of support compared to those created from concatenated ITS1 + 2
   (within a genus) or 28S (across Eupulmonata and Hygrophila). ELAVI8 is
   superior to these two phylogenetic marker regions, however, because it
   (1) resolves phylogenetic pattern from species- to sub-cohort scales in
   a single amplicon, (2) was better able to resolve family- and
   deeper-clades at high support, (3) allows for outgroup rooting between
   genera, and (4) possesses no intercopy haplotype variability.},

Title = {Estimating range disjunction time of the Palearctic Admirals (Limenitis

Journal = {ORGANISMS DIVERSITY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Three species of the genus Limenitis (Nymphalidae) (L. camilla, L.
   helmanni, L. sydyi) have split ranges in the Palearctic. Their
   disjunction was dated either to the Pleistocene or to the Subboreal time
   of the Holocene. This genus also exhibits an amphiberingean disjunction,
   L. populi vs four Nearctic species. To evaluate the disjunction time in
   Eurasia, we analysed a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene and a
   major part of the histone H1 gene. The former was sequenced in 51
   specimens of three species with Palearctic disjunctions. We detected a
   diverged nuclear copy of the COI gene in L. camilla. The histone H1 gene
   was sequenced in 64 specimens of 8 species. In five species,
   intra-species and intra-individual nucleotide substitutions and
   variation in the number of intra-genic repeats were observed and studied
   by cloning of individual gene copies, with individuals found with more
   than two variants. With 30-80 copies of histone H1 gene in Limenitis
   genomes, as estimated by real time PCR, this was interpreted as
   cis-heterogeneity across the histone gene cluster. No fixed differences
   between the western and eastern range parts were found in L. helmanni,
   L. camilla and L. sydyi, although in the former more alleles of both
   sequences were found in the eastern part. This suggests the range
   disjunctions to be too recent to be dated by molecular means and they
   may only be estimated to have taken place not more than 77-100 tya. This
   fits their provisional dating by Dubatolov and Kosterin (Entomologica
   Fennica 11(3), 141-161, 2000) to the Subboreal time of the Holocene.},

Abstract = {The superorder Cetartiodactyla has expanded to occupy a wide range of
   terrestrial and marine niches with very different energy requirements.
   As mitochondria are the primary site of energy production, we
   hypothesized that the structure and evolutionary rate of Cetartiodactyla
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been influenced by the metabolic
   requirements of different ecological niches. In this study, we
   constructed full-length mtDNA sequences for four Cetartiodactyla
   species: Babyrousa babyrussa, Stenella clymene, Stenella frontalis, and
   Cephalorhynchus commersonii. We performed comparative mitochondrial
   genome analysis, selection pressure analyses, and phylogenetic
   independent contrasts (PIC) analysis to detect the structure and
   evolutionary rate of mitogenomes from Cetartiodactyla native to plain,
   plateau, and marine niches. We found that the structure of
   Cetartiodactyla mtDNA was consistent across three niches. However,
   selection pressure analyses showed that the evolutionary rate of mtDNA
   protein-coding genes (PCGs) was significantly different between niches.
   The marine Cetartiodactyla had the highest rate of PCG evolution, while
   in terrestrial species, the evolutionary rate of all PCGs except ND3 and
   ND6 was faster in plateau Cetartiodactyla than in plain Cetartiodactyla.
   PIC analysis also demonstrated that PCG evolutionary rates were

Abstract = {We explore the phylogenetic position of the Encyclia adenocarpos complex
   through a multilocus analysis of Encyclia with the following DNA
   regions: ITS and plastid rpl32-trnL, trnL-F, and ycf1, analyzed under
   the Bayesian inference and Maximum Parsimony paradigms. We also
   performed an analysis of reconstruction of ancestral areas, with
   particular interest in the first diverging lineages of Encyclia. We used
   an ad hoc regionalization system designed to fit our distributional
   Encyclia data to reconstruct the ancestral distribution of the genus and
   the most relevant nodes. The analyses yielded a moderately
   well-supported topology with the broadest taxonomic Encyclia sampling
   yet. Our results indicate the Encyclia adenocarpos complex is
   monophyletic, highly supported, and sister to a large clade with ca.
   95\% of the species of Encyclia included in the analyses and suggest the
   clade is composed of several related, fundamentally allopatric species
   distributed along the Pacific slopes of Megamexico, including a novelty
   here proposed, Encyclia mariaeugeniae, which is closely related to
   Encyclia enriquearcilae yet differing in several diagnostic characters,
   such as a narrower central lobe to the labellum. The novelty was
   assessed as EN under IUCN criteria. We provide a key to the E.
   adenocarpos clade. Our Encyclia phylogeny identifies several clades
   displaying strong geographic signal; some of these are discussed in
   terms of morphology, ecological preferences, and pollination syndromes.
   The reconstruction of ancestral areas indicates with high probability
   that the earliest diverging nodes of Encyclia occurred in Megamexico.
   Floral variation within clades suggests the genus colonized geographical
   areas and underwent diversifications to occupy novel pollination
   syndromes in a pattern of allopatric, similar assemblages of syndromes
   composed of unrelated taxa. We present a preliminary species list of
   Encyclia and their distributions along the major biogeographic areas to
   provide a hypothesis of diversity patterns and the biogeographical areas
   where the species occur. As we currently understand the genus, Encyclia
   consists of 213 taxa, including 179 formally proposed species, 10
   undescribed ones, and 25 nothotaxa. We provide five plates depicting 100
   species to document the morphological and geographical diversity of
   Encyclia.},

Abstract = {The systematic, phylogenetic, and biogeographic aspects of the rich
   squamate fauna of the Arabian Peninsula are becoming increasingly well
   understood. The Arabian members of the gecko genus Hemidactylus, the
   most diverse genus among Arabian squamates, have been the subject of
   several phylogenetic revisions in recent years. However, large parts of
   the peninsula lacked thorough sampling, for example, the coastal
   hyper-arid plains along the Red Sea and some offshore islands. In this
   study, we examine the genetic, morphological, and ecological
   diversification of a Hemidactylus clade that straddles the Red Sea and
   contains ten Arabian and three African species. We compiled a genetic
   dataset of seven markers (two mitochondrial and five nuclear) to
   reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and collected morphological
   data to assess the level of interspecific morphological disparification.
   Our results support the existence of four yet undescribed species within
   the clade - two from Arabia and two from Ethiopia. We provide taxonomic
   descriptions of the two new Arabian species, one from the western Asir
   Mountains foothills and one from the Farasan Islands. The new species
   from the Asir Mountains foothills highlights the role of the southern
   Arabian coastal desert as an important yet often overlooked local
   biodiversity hotspot. The new species from the Farasan Islands
   represents the second vertebrate species endemic to the archipelago.
   Together with the descriptions of the diagnostic features of both
   species, we provide complete annotated mitochondrial genomes of both
   holotypes and of holotypes of two other species from the clade to
   characterize their mitogenomic composition and architecture.},

Abstract = {Earthworm taxonomy has shown great instability across the twentieth
   century, as exemplified by the numerous genera system of Lumbricidae.
   Sanger-sequenced ``legacy markers{''} have allowed to recover
   genus-level clades within Lumbricidae, but relationships between genera
   were often recovered as polytomies. Anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) is
   a recent source for phylogenomic analyses, providing hundreds of unique
   orthologous loci from across the genome with several advantages (like
   informativeness across different taxonomic scales, cost-effectiveness,
   no necessity of special preservation protocols). In this work, AHE was
   applied to 31 Lumbricidae genera to validate recent genus-level changes
   and to provide a solid ``backbone{''} for the systematics of the family.
   Five hundred ninety-four non-duplicated loci were sequenced, and
   phylogenomic inference was performed using the concatenated alignments
   and independent loci. A ``legacy marker{''} dataset was used to study
   the effect of the inclusion of the AHE phylogenomic tree as constraint.
   Lumbricidae was recovered as a monophyletic family, with Diporodrilus
   pilosus as the earliest branching taxa, followed by two large clades The
   first one comprised the Franco Iberian genera Castellodrilus,
   Cataladrilus, Prosellodrilus, Zophoscolex, Ethnodrilus, Kritodrilus,
   Postandrilus, Galiciandrilus, and Compostelandrilus; the Italian
   Pietromodeona; and the Central European Vindoboscolex. The second one
   included the rest of the studied Lumbricidae genera, with relationships
   between them being well resolved and strongly supported. The
   phylogenomic backbone improved the topological resolution and support of
   the legacy marker phylogenetic tree. Thus, AHE proved highly suitable
   for phylogenomic inference in lumbricid earthworms and closely related
   taxa, allowing to propose changes to the above-genus-level systematics
   of the family.},

Abstract = {The nylon shrimp Heterocarpus reedi is the most important commercial
   demersal crustacean species along the central coast of Chile in the
   southeast Pacific, with an intense fishery since the 1950s. It inhabits
   between 155 and 800 m of depth and is harvested along most of its
   distributional range (21 degrees S to 39 degrees S) by bottom trawling.
   Current management policy considers a single population unit on the
   lower continental shelf margin and upper slope along the exploitation
   area. The goal of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and
   differentiation of H. reedi along the geographic area of exploitation,
   representing the first insights into population genetics of a demersal
   crustacean from Chile. We analyzed 446 partial sequences of the
   mitochondrial COI gene from individuals captured using bottom trawls
   from 14 sites separated by 1 degrees of latitude, covering the
   exploitation area and bathymetric range of the benthic adults. Data
   showed high genetic diversity despite an extensive fishing pressure and
   absence of genetic differentiation among sites. Haplotype diversity
   showed a negative correlation with depth of the trawling, consistent
   with lower abundance of individuals at depths greater than 400 m. Also,
   a high effective population size and a post-LGM demographic expansion
   was detected. Lack of spatial and bathymetrical genetic differentiation
   and extensive gene flow reflect that the species is composed of a single
   panmictic unit. Phylogeographic structure suggests considering latitude,
   depth, and temporal variation in future assessments of the species.},

Title = {Small mammals (Insectivora, Rodentia, Lagomorpha) from the Early
   Pleistocene hominin-bearing site of Dmanisi (Georgia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Small mammals (insectivores, rodents, and lagomorphs) from Dmanisi are
   here reviewed for the first time and used as a tool for
   paleoenvironmental proxies. The small mammal faunal list is composed of
   shrews (Beremendia fissidens, cf. Beremendia minor, Crocidura
   kornfeldi), hamsters (Cricetulus sp., Allocricetus bursae), gerbils
   (Parameriones aff. obeidiyensis), murids (Apodemus cf. atavus),
   arvicolids (Mimomys pliocaenicus, Mimomys aff. pusillus), and pikas
   (Ochotona sp.). A paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on the habitat
   weighting method has been applied to the rodent assemblage. According to
   this method, the most common elements indicate an open-dry habitat
   (36.5\%), followed by water edge (25.7\%) and rocky (21.0\%) elements.
   Open-wet (15.5\%) and woodland elements (1.3\%) are rare. Therefore, the
   habitat occupied by the hominids of Dmanisi was characterized by the
   prevalence of arid conditions, from steppe or semi-desert to open
   Mediterranean forest, with stony or rocky substrate and bushy areas. The
   presence of permanent aquatic environments is also documented. From a
   biogeographic point of view, the small mammal community from Dmanisi is
   composed mainly by Western or Central Asian elements, with a poor
   representation of European elements (Mimomys, Apodemus). It is concluded
   that Dmanisi hominins most possibly had ecological requirements which
   were different from those of the Early Pleistocene hominins from Western
   Europe, which settled on wetter habitats. It could be also possible that
   Dmanisi hominins entered Southern Caucasus at an interglacial phase
   before the deposition of the Dmanisi site. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Morphological integration and evolutionary potential of the primate
   shoulder: Variation among taxa and implications for genetic covariances
   with the basicranium, pelvis, and arm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Within the primate order, the morphology of the shoulder girdle is
   immensely variable and has been shown to reflect the functional demands
   of the upper limb. The observed morphological variation among extant
   primate taxa consequently has been hypothesized to be driven by
   selection for different functional demands. Evolutionary analyses of the
   shoulder girdle often assess this anatomical region, and its traits,
   individually, therefore implicitly assuming independent evolution of the
   shoulder girdle. However, the primate shoulder girdle has developmental
   and functional covariances with the basicranium and pelvic girdle that
   have been shown to potentially influence its evolution. It is unknown
   whether these relationships are similar or even present across primate
   taxa, and how they may affect morphological variation among primates.
   This study evaluates the strength of covariance and evolutionary
   potential across four anatomical regions: shoulder girdle, basicranium,
   pelvis, and distal humerus. Measures of morphological integration and
   evolutionary potential (conditioned covariance and evolutionary
   flexi-bility) are assessed across eight anthropoid primate taxa. Results
   demonstrate a consistent pattern of morphological constraint within
   paired anatomical regions across primates. Differences in evolutionary
   flexibility are observed among primate genera, with humans having the
   highest evolutionary potential overall. This pattern does not follow
   functional differences, but rather a separation between monkeys and
   apes. Therefore, evolutionary hypotheses of primate shoulder girdle
   morphological variation that evaluate functional demands alone may not
   account for the effect of these relationships. Collectively, our
   findings suggest differences in genetic covariance among anatomical
   regions may have contributed to the observable morphological variation
   among taxa. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Morphological affinities of a fossil ulna (KNM-WS 65401) from Buluk,
   Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The morphological affinities of a primate proximal ulna (KNM-WS 65401)
   recovered from the late Early Miocene site Buluk, Kenya, are appraised.
   Nineteen three-dimensional landmarks on ulnae from 36 extant anthropoid
   species (n 1/4 152 individuals) and KNM-WS 65401, as well as a subset of
   14 landmarks on six ulnae belonging to other East African Miocene
   catarrhine taxa, were collected. To quantify ulnar shape,
   three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques were used and linear
   dimensions commonly cited in the literature were derived from the
   landmark data. KNM-WS 65401 is situated between monkeys and hominoids in
   the principal components morphospace. KNM-WS 65401 shares features such
   as a short olecranon process, broad trochlear notch, and laterally
   oriented radial notch with extant hominoids, whereas features such as an
   anteriorly directed trochlear notch and flat, proximodistally elongated,
   and anteroposteriorly narrow radial notch are shared with extant
   monkeys. Principal component scores and linear metrics generally align
   KNM-WS 65401 with both suspensors and arboreal quadrupeds, but quadratic
   and linear discriminant analyses of principal component score data
   provide posterior probabilities of 80\% and 83\%, respectively, for
   assignment of KNM-WS 65401 to the suspensory group. Compared with fossil
   ulnae from other Miocene primates, KNM-WS 65401 is morphologically most
   distinct from KNM-LG 6, attributed to Dendropithecus macinnesi, and
   morphologically most similar to KNM-WK 16950R, attributed to
   Turkanapithecus kalakolensis. The KNM-WS 65401 individual likely
   possessed more enhanced capabilities for elbow joint extension, perhaps
   during suspensory behaviors, compared with other Miocene primates in the
   sample. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Two Late Pleistocene human femora from Trinil, Indonesia: Implications
   for body size and behavior in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Late Pleistocene hominin postcranial specimens from Southeast Asia are
   relatively rare. Here we describe and place into temporal and geographic
   context two partial femora from the site of Trinil, Indonesia, which are
   dated stratigraphically and via Uranium-series direct dating to ca.
   37-32 Ica. The specimens, designated Trinil 9 and 10, include most of
   the diaphysis, with Trinil 9 being much better preserved. Microcomputed
   tomography is used to determine cross-sectional diaphyseal properties,
   with an emphasis on midshaft anteroposterior to mediolateral bending
   rigidity (I-x/I-y), which has been shown to relate to both body shape
   and activity level in modern humans. The body mass of Trinil 9 is
   estimated from cortical area and reconstructed length using new
   equations based on a Pleistocene reference sample. Comparisons are
   carried out with a large sample of Pleistocene and Holocene East Asian,
   African, and European/West Asian femora. Our results show that Trinil 9
   has a high I-x/I-y ratio, most consistent with a relatively
   narrow-bodied male from a mobile hunting-gathering population. It has an
   estimated body mass of 55.4 kg and a stature of 156 cm, which are small
   relative to Late Pleistocene males worldwide, but larger than the
   penecontemporaneous Deep Skull femur from Niah Cave, Malaysia, which is
   very likely female. This suggests the presence of small-bodied active
   huntergatherers in Southeast Asia during the later Late Pleistocene.
   Trinil 9 also contrasts strongly in morphology with earlier partial
   femora from Trinil dating to the late Early-early Middle Pleistocene
   (Femora II-V), and to a lesser extent with the well-known complete Femur
   I, most likely dating to the terminal Middle-early Late Pleistocene.
   Temporal changes in morphology among femoral specimens from Trinil
   parallel those observed in Homo throughout the Old World during the
   Pleistocene and document these differences within a single site. (C)

Title = {Flake tools in the European Lower Paleolithic: A case study from MIS 9
   Britain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Studies of flake tools in the British Lower Paleolithic are rare owing
   to lower quantities of flake tools than handaxes and the perception that
   flake tool technology became more important in the succeeding Middle
   Paleolithic. In Britain, and Europe more broadly, MIS 9 (328-301 ka) has
   been characterized as a period of technological transition owing to the
   presence of early prepared core technology and the status of the period
   as the final interglacial prior to the onset of the Middle Paleolithic.
   It has been argued that the period demonstrates an increase in both the
   numbers and importance of flake tools, possibly showing emerging Middle
   Paleolithic behaviors. This study presents the results of a
   technological examination of flake tools in Britain during MIS 9,
   focusing on 25 sites, including 15 assemblages previously recorded as
   having higher quantities of flake tools. We use these assemblages to
   assess whether the flake tools of MIS 9 represent a transition toward
   the technology of the Middle Paleolithic. We consider factors including
   collection history, site formation, function, reduction, and cultural
   groups. We argue that in Britain the archaeological record of MIS 9 does
   not show an increase in the use of flake tools and demonstrates more
   continuity than change in relation to earlier periods of the Lower
   Paleolithic. There is a technological background of ad hoc retouch of
   simple flake tools with occasional evidence of more invasively retouched
   scrapers. Furthermore, aside from the introduction of Levallois
   technology, flake tools change little in the Early Middle Paleolithic.
   These results are contextualized within the broader evidence from Europe
   and comparisons to the longer sequences at key sites. We conclude that
   the major changes in technology began between MIS 13 and MIS 11 and
   these merely became cemented during MIS 9 and the following Middle
   Paleolithic. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A revised (earliest Vallesian) age for the hominoid-bearing locality of
   Can Mata 1 based on new magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data
   from Abocador de Can Mata (Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Abocador de Can Mata (ACM) composite stratigraphic sequence (els
   Hostalets de Pierola, Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula) has
   yielded a diverse primate assemblage from the late Aragonian (Middle to
   Late Miocene). Detailed litho-, bio-, and magnetostratigraphic control
   has enabled an accurate dating of these fossil remains. Comparable data,
   however, were lacking for the nearby locality of Can Mata 1 (CM1), which
   yielded a dryopithecine canine of a female individual. Given the lack of
   hipparionin equids and giraffids, CM1 has been correlated to the latest
   Aragonian (Mammal Neogene {[}MN] zone MN7+8). Here we revise the age of
   CM1 based on fieldwork and associated paleomagnetic samplings undertaken
   in 2018-2021. Our results extend the ACM composite sequence upward and
   indicate that CM1 correlates to the earliest Vallesian (MN9). The
   updated ACM sequence has a thickness of similar to 300 m and comprises
   12 magnetozones correlated to subchrons C5Ar.1r to C5n.2n (similar to
   12.6-11.1 Ma; latest MN6 to earliest MN9, late Aragonian to earliest
   Vallesian). CM1 is correlated to C5r.1r (11.146-11.056 Ma), with an
   interpolated age of 11.11 Ma, thus postdating the dispersal of
   hipparionin horses into the Valles-Penedes Basin-which is correlated to
   the previous subchron C5r.1n, with an interpolated age of 11.18 Ma, and
   by definition marks the beginning of the Vallesian. CM1 also minimally
   postdates the earliest record of giraffids at ACM-representing their
   earliest well-dated occurrence in the basin-being correlated to C5r.1n
   with an interpolated age of 11.11 Ma. We conclude that CM1 has an
   earliest Vallesian (MN9) age of similar to 11.1 Ma, intermediate between
   the Aragonian dryopithecins and the Vallesian hispanopithecins. Ongoing
   paleontological surveillance at ACM thus offers the prospect to yield
   additional earliest Vallesian ape remains, which are essential to
   clarify their taxonomic allocation as well as to confirm whether
   hispanopithecins evolved locally from dryopithecins rather than
   immigrating from elsewhere during MN9. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Variations by degrees: Western European paleoenvironmental fluctuations
   across MIS 13-11},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 13-11 saw a major transformation in the
   hominin occupation of Europe, with an expansion in the scale and
   geographical distribution of sites and artifact assemblages. That
   expansion is explored here in the context of paleoenvironmental
   variability, focusing on geographical and chronological trends in
   climatic and habitat conditions at and between key Lower Paleolithic
   sites in Western Europe. Climatic conditions at British sites are
   compared across MIS 13-11, and used to test predicted values from the
   Oscillayers data set. Conditions at hominin and nonhominin sites are
   compared to explore possible limitations in hominin tolerances during
   MIS 13-11. Trends in conditions are explored with reference to long-term
   global patterns, short-term substage events, and seasonal variations.
   The apparent increase in the scale of hominin activity in north-western
   Europe during MIS 13 is surprising in light of the relatively harsh
   conditions of late MIS 13, and is likely to reflect significant
   physiological and/or behavioral adaptations, a mild south-north
   temperature gradient in western Europe during MIS 13, and the relatively
   mild, sustained conditions spanning MIS 15-13. The expanded occupation
   of north-western Europe during MIS 11 probably reflects the extended
   mild conditions of MIS 11c, since marked seasonal temperature
   differences and substantial behavioral changes between hominin sites in
   MIS 13 and 11 are not clearly evident. Site-specific conditions in
   south-western Europe during MIS 11 suggest milder winters, warmer
   summers, and reduced seasonal variability compared to northwestern
   Europe. Some or all of these conditions may have supported larger, core
   populations, as may the relatively mild conditions associated with
   south-western European sites during MIS 12. Finally, comparisons between
   north-western and north-central European sites indicate relatively small
   differences in seasonal temperatures, suggesting that climate may only
   be a partial factor behind the smaller-scale occupations of
   north-central Europe during MIS 13-11.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Cochlear morphology of Indonesian Homo erectus from Sangiran},

Abstract = {Homo erectus s.l. is key for deciphering the origin and subsequent
   evolution of genus Homo. However, the characterization of this species
   is hindered by the existence of multiple variants in both mainland and
   insular Asia, as a result of divergent chronogeographical evolutionary
   trends, genetic isolation, and interbreeding with other human species.
   Previous research has shown that cochlear morphology embeds taxonomic
   and phylogenetic information that may help infer the phylogenetic
   relationships among hominin species. Here we describe the cochlear
   morphology of two Indonesian H. erectus individuals (Sangiran 2 and 4),
   and compare it with a sample of australopiths, Middle to Late
   Pleistocene humans, and extant humans by means of linear measurements
   and both principal components and canonical variates analyses performed
   on shape ratios. Our results indicate that H. erectus displays a mosaic
   morphology that combines plesiomorphic (australopithlike) features (such
   as a chimplike round cochlear cross section and low cochlear thickness),
   with derived characters of later humans (a voluminous and long cochlea,
   possibly related to hearing abilities)dconsistent with the more basal
   position of H. erectus. Our results also denote substantial variation
   between the two studied individuals, particularly in the length and
   radius of the first turn, as well as cross-sectional shape. Given the
   small size of the available sample, it is not possible to discern
   whether such differences merely reflect intraspecific variation among
   roughly coeval H. erectus individuals or whether they might result from
   greater age differences between them than currently considered. However,
   our results demonstrate that most characters found in later humans were
   already present in Indonesian H. erectus, with the exception of
   Neanderthals, which display an autapomorphic condition relative to other
   Homo species.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Respect for males amid suppression of females: Selective use of
   aggression and fitness correlates in the male-dominated society of
   hamadryas baboons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) are a useful model for human social
   evolution for multiple reasons, including their multilevel society,
   intense cross-sex bonds, and intermale tolerance. Their most stable
   social grouping, the one-male unit (OMU)-comprising a leader male,
   females, and sometimes follower males-is formed via successive takeovers
   of individual females by males. While takeovers occur via both
   aggressive and non-aggressive mechanisms, aggressive herding is common
   during and after takeovers and appears crucial in maintaining OMUs. Here
   we use behavioral and demographic data from Filoha, Ethiopia to examine
   the relationship between aggressive takeovers and fitness correlates. We
   found no relationship between a male's percentage of takeovers that were
   aggressive and his presumed number of infants sired, nor his number of
   females or followers. However, we did find that a leader male's average
   intensity of aggression toward both other males and females around the
   time of a takeover was negatively related to his presumed number of
   infants sired. In addition, a leader male's average intensity of
   aggression toward other males was negatively related to his maximum
   number of followers. Finally, leader males exhibited more intense
   aggression toward females in interband, compared to intraband,
   takeovers. Our findings suggest that (1) leader males who limit their
   aggression toward other males may have greater success in attracting
   followers, thereby increasing their fitness via enhanced defense of the
   OMU; (2) exceptionally aggressive takeovers may lead to lower birth
   rates via female reproductive suppression; and (3) the extent to which
   males use aggression toward females depends on the context in which the
   takeover occurs. Overall, these results both suggest that hamadryas
   males use aggression selectively and underscore the ubiquity of
   intermale tolerance and female suppression in the hamadryas social
   system. This study lends insight into the interplay between male-female
   and male-male social dynamics during human evolution.(c) 2022 The

Title = {Comparing walking and running in persistence hunting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It has been proposed that humans' exceptional locomotor endurance
   evolved partly with foraging in hot open habitats and subsequently about
   2 million years ago with persistence hunting, for which endurance
   running was instrumental. However, persistence hunting by walking, if
   successful, could select for locomotor endurance even before the
   emergence of any running-related traits in human evolution. Using a heat
   exchange model validated here in 73 humans and 55 ungulates, we
   simulated persistence hunts for prey of three sizes (100, 250, and 400
   kg) and three sweating capacities (nonsweating, low, high) at 6237
   combinations of hunter's velocity (1-5 m s(-1), intermittent), air
   temperature (25-45 degrees C), relative humidity (30-90\%), and start
   time (8:00-16:00). Our simulations predicted that walking would be
   successful in persistence hunting of low- and nonsweating prey,
   especially under hot and humid conditions. However, simulated
   persistence hunts by walking yielded a 30-74\% lower success rate than
   hunts by running or intermittent running. In addition, despite requiring
   10-30\% less energy, successful simulated persistence hunts by walking
   were twice as long and resulted in greater exhaustion of the hunter than
   hunts by running and intermittent running. These shortcomings of pursuit
   by walking compared to running identified in our simulations could
   explain why there is only a single direct description of persistence
   hunting by walking among modern hunter-gatherers. Nevertheless, walking
   down prey could be a viable option for hominins who did not possess the
   endurance-running phenotype of the proposed first persistence hunter,
   Homo erectus. Our simulation results suggest that persistence hunting
   could select for both long-distance walking and endurance running and
   contribute to the evolution of locomotor endurance seen in modern
   humans. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding as a tool for assessing
   prehistoric plant use at the Upper Paleolithic cave site Aghitu-3,
   Armenia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Current knowledge about Paleolithic human plant use is limited by the
   rare survival of identifiable plant remains as well as the availability
   of methods for plant detection and identification. By analyzing DNA
   preserved in cave sediments, we can identify organisms in the absence of
   any visible remains, opening up new ways to study details of past human
   behavior, including plant use. Aghitu-3 Cave contains a 15,000-yearlong
   record (from similar to 39,000 to 24,000 cal BP) of Upper Paleolithic
   human settlement and environmental variability in the Armenian
   Highlands. Finds from this cave include stone artifacts, faunal remains,
   bone tools, shell beads, charcoal, and pollen, among others. We applied
   sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding to the Aghitu-3
   sedimentary sequence and combined this with pollen data to obtain a
   temporal reconstruction of plant assemblages. Our results reveal a
   stratification of plant abundance and diversity where sedaDNA reflects
   periods of human occupation, showing higher diversity in layers with
   increased human activity. Low pollen concentrations combined with high
   sedaDNA abundance indicate plant remains may have been brought into the
   cave by animals or humans during the deposition of the lower two
   archaeological horizons. Most of the recovered plants are reported to be
   useful for food, flavor, medicine, and/or technical purposes,
   demonstrating the potential of the environment around Aghitu-3 Cave to
   support humans during the Upper Paleolithic. Moreover, we identified
   several specific plant taxa that strengthen previous findings about
   Upper Paleolithic plant use in this region (i.e., for medicine and the
   manufacturing and dyeing of textiles). This study represents the first
   application of plant sedaDNA analysis of cave sediments for the
   investigation of potential plant use by prehistoric humans. (C) 2022 The

Title = {The influence of climate and population structure on East Asian skeletal
   morphology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that global variation in body proportions is
   more complex than previously thought as some traits formerly associated
   with climate adaptation are better explained by geographic proximity and
   neutral evolutionary forces. While the recent incorporation of
   quantitative genetic methodologies has improved understanding of
   patterns related to climate in Africa, Europe, and the Americas, Asia
   remains underrepresented in recent and historic studies of body form. As
   ecogeographic studies tend to focus on male morphology, potential sex
   differences in features influenced by climate remain largely unexplored.
   Skeletal measurements encompassing the dimensions of the skull, pelvis,
   limbs, hands, and feet were collected from male (n = 459) and female (n
   = 442) remains curated in 13 collections across seven countries in East
   Asia (n = 901). Osteological data were analyzed with sex and minimum
   temperature as covariates adjusted by autosomal single-nucleotide
   polymorphism population genetic distance using univariate Bayesian
   linear mixed models, and credible intervals were calculated for each
   trait. Analysis supports a relationship between specific traits and
   climate as well as providing the magnitude of response in both sexes.
   After accounting for genetic distance between populations, greater
   association between climate and morphology was found in postcranial
   traits, with the relationship between climate and the skull limited
   primarily to breadth measurements. Larger body size is associated with
   colder climates with most measurements increasing with decreased
   temperature. The same traits were not always associated with climate for
   males and females nor correlated with the same intensity for both sexes.
   The varied directional association with climate for different regions of
   the skeleton and between the sexes underscores the necessity of future
   ecogeographic research to holistically evaluate body form and to look
   for sex-specific patterns to better understand population responses to
   environmental stresses. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A nonanalog Pliocene ungulate community at Laetoli with implications for
   the paleoecology of Australopithecus afarensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The dietary guild structure of ungulate communities is a useful
   paleoecological tool for understanding the context of hominin
   paleobiology and evolution. Ungulates are well represented in the fossil
   record, and their dietary preferences reflect those of major habitat
   types. However, paleoecology relies on modern ecological patterns as
   analogs for recreating ecologies of the past. It has previously been
   sug-gested that for much of the Pliocene, no such modern analogs exist
   for the herbivore communities associated with hominins in eastern
   Africa. This study aims to determine whether the ungulate com-munity
   associated with A. afarensis at the Pliocene site of Laetoli, Tanzania,
   shares similarities with extant communities or whether it lacks a modern
   analog. Our multiproxy approach using mesowear, hyp-sodonty, and stable
   carbon isotopes of tooth enamel to infer the diets of ungulates in the
   Upper Laetolil Beds shows that this community is dominated by browsers
   and mixed feeders and has a very low prevalence of grazers and
   frugivores. This dietary guild composition distinguishes the Upper
   Laetolil Beds from modern African communities and suggests either that
   the Upper Laetolil Beds had a unique vegetation structure which was able
   to support a higher diversity of browsing ungulates than that exists in
   African ecosystems today or that it retained an ungulate community that
   was resilient to environ-mental change. The Upper Laetolil Beds ungulate
   community is also unique relative to other mid-Pliocene communities in
   eastern Africa, some of which are similar to extant communities, while
   others, such as Laetoli, lack modern counterparts. This suggests that A.
   afarensis was a eurytopic species that inhabited a variety of
   ecosystems, including those with and without modern analogs. The
   co-occurrence of both analog and nonanalog communities in the Pliocene
   suggests that the trans-formation toward ungulate communities of modern
   aspect occurred asynchronously in eastern Africa.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Morphological integration in the hominid midfoot},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The calculation of morphological integration across living apes and
   humans may provide important insights into the potential influence of
   integration on evolutionary trajectories in the hominid lineage. Here,
   we quantify magnitudes of morphological integration among and within
   elements of the midfoot in great apes and humans to examine the link
   between locomotor differences and trait covariance. We test the
   hypothesis that the medial elements of the great ape foot are less
   morphologically integrated with one another compared to humans based on
   their abducted halluces, and aim to determine how adaptations for
   midfoot mobility/stiffness and locomotor specialization influence
   magnitudes of morphological integration. The study sample is composed of
   all cuneiforms, the navicular, the cuboid, and metatarsals 1-5 of Homo
   sapiens (n = 80), Pan troglodytes (n = 63), Gorilla gorilla (n = 39),
   and Pongo sp. (n = 41). Morphological integration was quantified using
   the integration coefficient of variation of interlandmark distances
   organized into sets of a priori-defined modules. Magnitudes of
   integration across these modules were then compared against sets of
   random traits from the whole midfoot. Results show that all nonhuman
   apes have less integrated medial elements, whereas humans have highly
   integrated medial elements, suggesting a link between hallucal abduction
   and reduced levels of morphological integration. However, we find
   considerable variation in magnitudes of morphological integration across
   metatarsals 2-5, the intermediate and lateral cuneiform, the cuboid, and
   navicular, emphasizing the influence of functional and nonfunctional
   factors in magnitudes of integration. Lastly, we find that humans and
   orangutans show the lowest overall magnitudes of integration in the
   midfoot, which may be related to their highly specialized functions, and
   suggest a link between strong diversifying selection and reduced
   magnitudes of morphological integration. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Initial Upper Paleolithic bone technology and personal ornaments at
   Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The expansion of Homo sapiens and our interaction with local
   environments, including the replacement or absorption of local
   populations, is a key component in understanding the evolution of our
   species. Of special interest are artifacts made from hard animal tissues
   from layers at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria) that have been attributed to
   the Initial Upper Paleolithic. The Initial Upper Paleolithic is
   characterized by Levallois-like blade technologies that can co-occur
   with bone tools and ornaments and likely represents the dispersal of H.
   sapiens into several regions throughout Eurasia starting by 45 ka or
   possibly earlier. Osseous artifacts from the Initial Upper Paleolithic
   are important components of this record and have the potential to
   contribute to our understanding of group interactions and population
   movements. Here, we present a zooarchaeological, technological, and
   functional analysis of the diverse and sizable osseous artifact
   collection from Bacho Kiro Cave. Animal raw material sources are
   consistent with taxa found within the faunal assemblage including
   cervids, large bovids, and cave bears. A variety of bone tool
   morphologies, both formal and informal, indicate a diverse technological
   approach for conducting various on-site activities, many of which were
   focused on the processing of animal skins, likely for cold weather
   clothing. Technological flexibility is also evident in the manufacture
   of personal ornaments, which were made primarily from carnivore teeth,
   especially cave bear, though herbivore teeth and small beads are also
   represented. The osseous artifacts from Bacho Kiro Cave provide a series
   of insights into the bone technology and indirectly on the social
   aspects of these humans in southeast Europe, and when placed within the
   broader Initial Upper Paleolithic context, both regional and shared
   behaviors are evidently indicating widespread innovation and complexity.
   This is especially significant given the location and chronology of the
   site in the context of H. sapiens dispersals. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Evaluating landscape knowledge and lithic resource selection at the
   French Middle Paleolithic site of the Bau de l'Aubesier},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We report on the application of a novel approach to exploring the degree
   of landscape knowledge, wayfinding abilities, and the nature of
   decision-making processes reflected in the utilization of stone
   resources in the French Middle Paleolithic. Specifically, we use data
   from the site of the Bau de l'Aubesier to explore the reasons why a
   majority of the 350 raw material sources cataloged in the surrounding
   region appear not to have been utilized, including several located near
   the site and yielding high-quality lithic materials. To this end, we
   focus on the spatial relationships between sources as an explanatory
   variable, operationalized in terms of minimum travel times. Using
   geographic information system software and a generalized linear model of
   resource selection derived from the Bau assemblages, we compute source
   utilization probabilities from the perspective of hominins located
   off-site. We do so under three optimization scenarios, factoring in the
   intrinsic characteristics (e.g., quality) and time required to reach
   each source on the way to the Bau. More generally, we find that in
   slightly more than 50\% of cases, seemingly viable sources may have been
   ignored simply because the minimum cost path leading back to the Bau
   passes through or requires only minimal deviations to reach, higher
   quality options. More generally, we found that throughout the entire
   region, a cost/benefit analysis of competing sources favors those from
   source areas known to have been utilized. Virtually all the available
   information on lithic procurement at the Bau is consistent with a model
   of landscape utilization premised on detailed knowledge of a very large
   area, an ability to accurately estimate travel times between locations,
   and a pragmatic strategy of stone resource exploitation based on
   minimizing costs (travel and search times) and maximizing utility.(c)

Title = {Post-LGM environments and foragers on the move: New data from the lower
   Altmuhl Valley (Franconian Jura, SE Germany)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {After the Last Glacial Maximum, the Swabian and Franconian Jura (in SW
   and SE Germany, respectively) were repopulated by Magdalenian
   hunter-gatherers within the same communication network. However, while
   the Magdalenian settlement of the Swabian Jura dates to 17-14 ka cal BP,
   permanent Magdalenian occupations in the Franconian Jura date to 15-14
   ka cal BP. In comparison with its western counterpart, the Franconian
   Jura was mostly excavated in the early days of archaeological research.
   Does this different chronology reflect the different history of
   research? Why did Magdalenian foragers establish permanent occupation in
   the Franconian Jura nearly 2 millennia after settling in Swabia, despite
   the fact these regions are only 150 km apart? To address these
   questions, we reinvestigated two sites in the Altmithl Valley with
   micromorphology and luminescence dating, namely Felsenhausl-Kellerhohle
   and Klausennische. Our data show that both sites have intact Pleistocene
   deposits. Among these, we identified sediments dating between 17 and 15
   ka that show only rare lithic artifacts and microfeatures indicative of
   cold and arid conditions. Our work and published data suggest that the
   steady settlement of Magdalenian foragers in the Altmithl Valley
   starting 15 ka cal BP coincides with the end of this harsh period and
   the onset of cool and wetter environments. Data from the Swabian Jura
   demonstrated that in the Lone Valley, similar environments and
   Magdalenian occupations commenced earlier, starting 17 ka cal BR.
   Therefore, we propose that regional environments acted as a barrier
   against the dispersal of foragers in the Franconian Jura and determined
   its later Magdalenian occupation. Our research highlighted that
   different environments, taphonomic processes, and site uses probably
   coexisted across the German Jura. Therefore, it remains fundamental to
   expand the multisite data set proposed in this article to further test
   hypotheses about human/environment interaction in this region. (C) 2022

Title = {A refined chronology for the Middle and early Upper Paleolithic sequence
   of Riparo Mochi (Liguria, Italy)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Riparo Mochi rock shelter, located on the Ligurian coast of Italy,
   is one of the most important early Upper Paleolithic sites on the
   Mediterranean rim. Its -10-m-deep stratigraphy comprises a Mousterian
   sequence, followed by various development stages of the Upper
   Paleolithic. A series of radiometric dates on marine shells bearing
   traces of human modification has provided a chronological framework for
   the final Mousterian and the Proto-Aurignacian of the site. Based on
   modeling results, the end of the Mousterian was dated between 44.0 and
   41.8 ka cal BP (68\% probability) and the beginning of the
   ProtoAurignacian between 42.7 and 41.6 ka cal BP (68\% probability).
   However, these estimates were based on a limited number of radiocarbon
   ages in the Mousterian levels. Here, we report new dating of the Mochi
   sequence using luminescence techniques, along with new radiocarbon
   measurements. The combination of these results using a Bayesian modeling
   approach allows for the first time the establishment of a more precise
   timing for the Mousterian occupation at the site. We show that
   Mousterian groups were already present at Riparo Mochi by at least 65 ka
   and continued to occupy the site for another 20 ka. The transition to
   the earliest Upper Paleolithic at the site is centered around 44.3-41.1
   ka (95.4\% probability), providing our best age estimate for the
   beginning of the Early Upper Paleolithic and the establishment of modern
   human groups in the Balzi Rossi. The sequence continues upward with a
   more evolved Aurignacian phase and a Gravettian phase starting at -26 ka
   or earlier. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {Morphological variation of the maxilla in modern humans and African apes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Differences in morphology among modern humans and African apes are
   frequently used when assessing whether hominin fossils should be
   attributed to a single species or represent evidence for taxic
   diversity. A good understanding of the degree and structure of the
   intergeneric, interspecific, and intraspecific variation, including
   aspects such as sexual dimorphism and age, are key in this context. Here
   we explore the variation and differences shown by the maxilla of extant
   hominines, as maxillary morphology is central in the diagnosis of
   several hominin taxa. Our sample includes adults of all currently
   recognized hominine species and subspecies, with a balanced species sex
   ratio. In addition, we compared the adults with a small sample of late
   juveniles. The morphology of the maxillae was captured using
   threedimensional landmarks, and the size and shape were analyzed using
   geometric morphometric methods. Key observations are that 1) the
   maxillae of all extant hominine species and subspecies show
   statistically significant differences, but complete separation in shape
   is only seen at the genus level; 2) the degree of variation is not
   consistent between genera, with subspecies of Gorilla being more
   different from each other than are species of Pan; 3) the pattern of
   sexual shape dimorphism is different in Pan, Gorilla, and Homo, often
   showing opposite trends; and 4) differentiation between maxillary shapes
   is increased after adjustment for static intraspecific allometry. These
   results provide a taxonomically up-todate comparative morphological
   framework to help interpret the hominin fossil record, and we discuss
   the practical implications in that context. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Early Neanderthals in contact: The Chibanian (Middle Pleistocene)
   hominin dentition from Velika Balanica Cave, Southern Serbia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Neanderthals are Eurasian fossil hominins whose distinctive morphology
   developed in the southwestern corner of Europe and later spread
   throughout the continent, reaching Southwest Asia before the Late
   Pleistocene and spreading into Central Asia by 59-49 ka. The timing,
   tempo, and route of the Neanderthal movements eastward are poorly
   documented. The earliest probable evidence of Neanderthals in Asia comes
   from Karain E Cave (Anatolia, Turkey), dated to 250-200 ka. We present
   four Chibanian (Middle Pleistocene) hominin specimens, representing at
   least two individuals, from Velika Balanica Cave (Serbia): a permanent
   upper third molar (BH-2), a deciduous upper fourth premolar (BH-3)
   refitted to a poorly preserved maxillary fragment with the permanent
   first molar in the alveolus (BH-4), and a permanent upper central
   incisor (BH-5). We provide descriptions of the teeth, as well as a
   comparative analysis of the well-preserved M-1 (BH-4), including
   assessments of cusp angles, relative occlusal polygon area, relative
   cusp base areas, two-and three-dimensional enamel thickness, and
   taurodontism. Morphology of both the occlusal surface and the enamel
   dentine junction of the M-1 indicates that the maxillary fragment and
   associated dP4 belonged to an early Neanderthal child. The heavily worn
   I-1 and M-3 are consistent with the Neanderthal morphology, although
   they are less distinct taxonomically. These Chibanian remains with
   provenance from layer 3a are constrained by two thermoluminescence
   dates: 285 +/- 34 ka and 295 +/- 74 ka. They represent the earliest
   current evidence of Neanderthal spread into the Eastern Mediterranean
   Area. We discuss these findings in light of recent direct evidence for
   cultural connections between Southwestern Asia and Southeast Europe in
   the Chibanian.

Title = {Early Pleistocene stratigraphy, sedimentary environments, and formation
   contexts at Dmanisi in the Georgian Caucasus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Early Pleistocene site of Dmanisi is now well known for its large
   number of fossils of early Homo erectus as well as associated artifacts
   and faunal remains, recovered mainly in pipe-related geologic features.
   Testing in the M5 unit 100 m to the west of the main excavations
   revealed a thick stratigraphy with no evidence of pipes or gullies,
   indicating that the geologic record at Dmanisi included spatially
   distinct sedimentary environments that needed further investigation.
   Here we report the results of a geoarchaeological program to collect
   data bearing on contexts and formation processes over a large area of
   the promontory. That work has defined over 40,000 m(2) of in situ
   deposits with artifacts and faunas. Stratum A ashes bury the uppermost
   Mashavera Basalt, which we have dated to 1.8 Ma in the M5 block. The
   Stratum A deposits contain stratified occupations that accumulated
   quickly and offer good potential for recovery of in situ materials.
   Stratum B1 deposits above the A/B unconformity include all of the pipe
   and gully facies at Dmanisi, reflecting a brief but very intense phase
   of geomorphic change. Those deposits contain the majority of faunas and
   all of the hominin fossils. B1 slope facies offer excellent formation
   contexts away from the piped area, and all B1 deposits are sealed by
   Stratum B2 over the whole promontory. Strata B2 to B5 register a return
   to slope facies, with no further evidence of pipes or gullies. Those
   deposits also present excellent contexts for recovery of in situ
   occupations. Overall, Dmanisi's geologic history preserves an
   exceptional record of the activities and environmental context of
   occupations during the first colonization of Eurasia. (C) 2022 Elsevier

Title = {Comparing the Boxgrove and Atapuerca (Sima de los Huesos) human fossils:
   Do they represent distinct paleodemes?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The early Middle Pleistocene human material from Boxgrove (West Sussex,
   UK) consists of a partial left tibia and two lower incisors from a
   separate adult individual. These remains derive from deposits assigned
   to the MIS 13 interglacial at about 480 ka and have been referred to as
   Homo cf. heidelbergensis. The much larger skeletal sample from the Sima
   de los Huesos (Atapuerca, Spain) is dated to the succeeding MIS 12, at
   about 430 ka. This fossil material has previously been assigned to Homo
   heidelbergensis but is now placed within the Neanderthal Glade. Because
   of the scarcity of human remains from the Middle Pleistocene and their
   morphological variability, this study assessed whether the Boxgrove
   specimens fit within the morphological variability of the homogeneous
   Sima de los Huesos population. Based on morphometric analyses performed
   against 22 lower incisors from Sima de los Huesos and published
   material, the data from the Boxgrove incisors place them comfortably
   within the range of Sima de los Huesos. Both assemblages present robust
   incisors distinct from the overall small recent Homo sapiens incisors,
   and Boxgrove also aligns closely with Homo neanderthalensis and some
   other European Middle Pleistocene hominins. Following morphological and
   cross-sectional analyses of the Boxgrove tibia compared to seven adult
   Sima de los Huesos specimens and a set of comparative tibiae, Boxgrove
   is shown to be similar to Sima de los Huesos and Neanderthals in having
   thick cortices and bone walls, but in contrast resembles modern humans
   in having a straight anterior tibial crest and a suggestion of a lateral
   concavity. Based on the patterns observed, there is no justification for
   assigning the Boxgrove and Sima de los Huesos incisors to distinct

Title = {The taxonomic attribution of African hominin postcrania from the Miocene
   through the Pleistocene: Associations and assumptions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Postcranial bones may provide valuable information about fossil taxa
   relating to their locomotor habits, manipulative abilities and body
   sizes. Distinctive features of the postcranial skeleton are sometimes
   noted in species diagnoses. Although numerous isolated postcranial
   fossils have become accepted by many workers as belonging to a
   particular species, it is worthwhile revisiting the evidence for each
   attribution before including them in comparative samples in relation to
   the descriptions of new fossils, functional analyses in relation to
   particular taxa, or in evolutionary contexts. Although some workers
   eschew the taxonomic attribution of postcranial fossils as being less
   important (or interesting) than interpreting their functional
   morphology, it is impossible to consider the evolution of functional
   anatomy in a taxonomic and phylogenetic vacuum. There are 21 widely
   recognized hominin taxa that have been described from sites in Africa
   dated from the Late Miocene to the Middle Pleistocene; postcranial
   elements have been attributed to 17 of these. The bones that have been
   thus assigned range from many parts of a skeleton to isolated elements.
   However, the extent to which postcranial material can be reliably
   attributed to a specific taxon varies considerably from site to site and
   species to species, and is often the subject of considerable debate.
   Here, we review the postcranial remains attributed to African hominin
   taxa from the Late Miocene to the Middle and Late Pleistocene and place
   these assignations into categories of reliability. The catalog of
   attributions presented here may serve as a guide for making taxonomic
   decisions in the future. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Domestic spaces as crucibles of Paleolithic culture: An archaeological
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The places in which people live, sleep, prepare food, and undertake
   other activities-known variably as homes, residential sites, living
   sites, and domestic spaces-play a key role in the emergence and
   evolution of modern human culture. The dynamic influence of domestic
   spaces began early in human evolutionary history, during the
   Paleolithic/Stone Age. Drawing on examples from Africa and western
   Eurasia, this article explores aspects of the changing social and
   cultural significance of domestic spaces throughout this time using
   several lines of evidence: repeated site visitation, behavioral
   structuring of living spaces, and information gained by dissecting
   palimpsest records. With the development of pyrotechnology, living sites
   become hearth-centered domestic spaces that provided a common hub for
   activities. Through time the activities around hearths increased in
   their complexity and diversity. The parsing of palimpsest records by
   archaeologists also reveals changes in the nature, variety, and
   intensity of on-site activities through time, indicating shifts in site
   function and the spatial expression of cultural norms. Archaeological
   evidence shows that the entwined development of domestic spaces and
   human cultural activities was gradual, albeit nonlinear from the Lower
   Paleolithic through the Upper Paleolithic/later Middle Stone Age. In
   this process, domestic spaces emerged as common arenas of opportunity
   for social interaction and knowledge transmission, qualities that may
   have contributed to and enhanced the development of cumulative culture
   in Paleolithic society. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptations for bipedal walking: Musculoskeletal structure and
   three-dimensional joint mechanics of humans and bipedal chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Humans are unique among apes and other primates in the musculoskeletal
   design of their lower back, pelvis, and lower limbs. Here, we describe
   the three-dimensional ground reaction forces and lower/ hindlimb joint
   mechanics of human and bipedal chimpanzees walking over a full stride
   and test whether: 1) the estimated limb joint work and power during the
   stance phase, especially the single support period, is lower in humans
   than bipedal chimpanzees, 2) the limb joint work and power required for
   limb swing is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees, and 3) the
   estimated total mechanical power during walking, accounting for the
   storage of passive elastic strain energy in humans, is lower in humans
   than in bipedal chimpanzees. Humans and bipedal chimpanzees were
   compared at matched dimensionless and dimensional velocities. Our
   results indicate that humans walk with significantly less work and power
   output in the first double-support period and the single-support period
   of stance, but markedly exceed chimpanzees in the second double-support
   period (i.e., push-off). Humans generate less work and power in limb
   swing, although the species difference in limb swing power was not
   statistically significant. We estimated that total mechanical positive
   `muscle fiber' work and power were 46.9\% and 35.8\% lower,
   respectively, in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees at matched
   dimensionless speeds. This is due in part to mechanisms for the storage
   and release of elastic energy at the ankle and hip in humans.
   Furthermore, these results indicate distinct `heel strike' and `lateral
   balance' mechanics in humans and bipedal chimpanzees and suggest a
   greater dissipation of mechanical energy through soft tissue
   deformations in humans. Together, our results document important
   differences between human and bipedal chimpanzee walking mechanics over
   a full stride, permitting a more comprehensive understanding of the
   mechanics and energetics of chimpanzee bipedalism and the evolution of
   hominin walking. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Title = {Comparative description and taxonomic affinity of 3.7-million-year-old
   hominin mandibles from Woranso-Mille (Ethiopia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fossil discoveries of early Australopithecus species from Woranso-Mille
   have played a significant role in improving our understanding of
   mid-Pliocene hominin evolution and diversity. Here, we describe two
   mandibles with dentitions, recovered from sediments immediately above a
   tuff radiometrically dated to 3.76 +/- 0.02 Ma, and assess their
   taxonomic affinity. The two mandibles (MSD-VP-5/16 and MSD-VP-5/50) show
   morphological similarities with both Australopithecus anamensis and
   Australopithecus afarensis. Some of the unique features that distinguish
   Au. anamensis from Au. afarensis are present in the mandibles, which
   also share a few derived features with Au. afarensis. Their retention of
   more Kanapoi Au. anamensis-like traits, compared to the fewer derived
   features they share with Au. afarensis, and the presence of Au.
   anamensis at Woranso-Mille in 3.8-million-year-old deposits, lends
   support to their assignment to Au. anamensis. However, it is equally
   arguable that the few derived dentognathic features they share with Au.
   afarensis could be taxonomically more significant, making it difficult
   to conclusively assign these specimens to either species. Regardless of
   which species they are assigned to, the mosaic nature of the
   dentognathic morphology and geological age of the two mandibles lends
   further support to the hypothesized ancestor-descendant relationship
   between Au. anamensis and Au. afarensis. However, there is now limited
   fossil evidence indicating that these two species may have overlapped in
   time. Hence, the last appearance of Au. anamensis and first appearance
   of Au. afarensis are currently unknown. Recovery of Australopithecus
   fossils from 4.1 to 3.8 Ma is critical to further address the timing of
   these events. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Morphological modularity in the anthropoid axial skeleton},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous research has found that hominoids have stronger modularity
   between limb elements than other anthropoids, suggesting that there is
   less constraint on morphological diversification (e.g., limb
   proportions) in hominoids in terms of evolutionary independence.
   However, degrees of modularity in the axial skeleton have not been
   investigated across a broad range of anthropoid taxa. Thus, it is
   unknown whether hominoids also have stronger modularity in the axial
   skeleton than other anthropoids, which has implications for the
   evolution of diverse torso morphologies in Miocene apes as well as the
   evolution of novel characteristics in the skull and vertebrae of fossil
   hominins. In this study, 12 anthropoid genera were sampled to examine
   degrees of modularity between axial skeletal elements (i.e., cranium,
   mandible, vertebrae, and sacrum). Covariance ratio coefficients were
   calculated using variance/covariance matrices of interlandmark distances
   for each axial skeletal element to evaluate degrees of modularity. The
   results showed that Alouatta, Hylobates, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo showed
   generally stronger modularity than other anthropoid taxa when
   considering all axial skeletal elements. When only considering the
   vertebral elements (i.e., vertebrae and sacrum), Alouatta, Hylobates,
   Gorilla, and Pan showed generally stronger modularity than other
   anthropoid taxa. Humans showed stronger modularity between the skull and
   vertebrae than other hominoids. Thus, the evolution of novel
   characteristics in the skull and vertebral column may have been less
   constrained in fossil hominins due to the dissociation of trait
   covariation between axial skeletal elements in hominoid ancestors, thus
   fostering more evolutionary independence between the skull and vertebral
   column. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An ancient cranium from Dmanisi: Evidence for interpersonal violence,
   disease, and possible predation by carnivores on Early Pleistocene Homo},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Five well-preserved individuals from Dmanisi represent a paleodeme
   attributed to early Homo. Here we provide a case study of the D2280
   adult cranium, which presents four oval-shaped lesions on the frontal,
   left parietal, and occipital bones. Several conditions are considered as
   possibly contributing to this pathology, including trauma, cysts,
   metastatic cancer, and infectious disease. One large but shallow
   depression on the left parietal bone has slightly elevated boundaries.
   Imaging reveals inner and outer tables that are reciprocally concave, so
   that the diploe euro is diminished or completely absent. This lesion is
   very likely a result of traumatic injury. Two additional depressions on
   the left side frontal and occipital bones may also be attributed to
   blunt force trauma. Such injuries stem from a variety of causes, but
   interpersonal violence may well be implicated. Based on the location and
   structure of a fourth lesion on the right-side frontal bone, we advance
   a possible diagnosis of treponemal disease. Lesions on the cranium and
   specifically on the frontal bone are common in treponemal disease. The
   condition develops as a periostitis, which eventually results in the
   destruction of the osteoperiosteal border of the cranial outer table and
   rarely involves the inner table. Additional perforations on the
   occipital bone are interpreted as perimortem damage resulting from
   predation by carnivores or scavenging by birds. If our reading of this
   cranial evidence can be confirmed, then D2280 documents one of the
   earliest instances of blunt force trauma in the Homo lineage. Dmanisi
   may also reveal the presence of treponemal disease in a population dated
   ca. 1.77 Ma ago. These findings bear on the social behavior of ancient
   humans and also the impact of infectious diseases on their survival.(c)

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of Middle-Late Miocene apes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite intensive study, many aspects of the evolutionary history of
   great apes and humans (Hominidae) are not well understood. In
   particular, the phylogenetic relationships of many fossil taxa remain
   poorly resolved. This study aims to provide an updated hypothesis of
   phylogenetic relationships for Middle-Late Miocene fossil apes, focusing
   on those taxa typically considered to be great apes. The character
   matrix compiled here samples 274 characters from the skull, dentition,
   and postcranium. Multiple iterations were performed to examine the
   effects of ingroup taxon selection, outgroup constraints, treatment of
   continuous data, character partitions (craniodental, postcranial), and
   missing data. Parsimony and Bayesian methods were used to infer
   phylogenetic relationships. Most European hominoids (Hispano-pithecus,
   Rudapithecus, Dryopithecus, Pierolapithecus) are recovered as stem
   hominids, not more closely related to orangutans or to African apes and
   humans (Homininae), whereas Ouranopithecus, Graecopithecus, and
   Nakalipithecus are inferred to be members of the hominine clade. Asian
   fossil hominoids, with the exception of Lufengpithecus hudienensis, are
   recovered as part of the orangutan clade (Ponginae). Results suggest
   that Kenyapithecus and Griphopithecus are possible stem hominids,
   whereas Equatorius and Nacholapithecus are consistently recovered as
   stem hominoids. Oreopithecus and Samburupithecus are not recovered as
   hominids. Results of Bayesian analyses differ from those of parsimony
   analyses. Craniodental and postcranial character partitions are
   incongruent in the placement of hylobatids, which is interpreted as
   evidence that hylobatids and hominids independently evolved adaptations
   to suspensory positional behaviors. An understanding of phylogenetic
   relationships is necessary to address many of the questions asked in
   paleoanthropology. Thus, the updated hypothesis of phylogenetic
   relationships presented here can be used to gain a better understanding
   of important morphological transitions that took place during hominid
   evolution, ancestral morphotypes at key nodes, and the biogeography of
   the clade. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Feeding ecology of the last European colobine monkey, Dolichopithecus
   ruscinensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Currently, very little is known about the ecology of extinct Eurasian
   cercopithecids. Dietary information is crucial in understanding the
   ecological adaptations and diversity of extinct cercopithecids and the
   evolution of this family. For example, the colobine genus
   Dolichopithecus is represented by multiple large-bodied species that
   inhabited Eurasia during the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The available
   evidence, though limited, suggests semiterrestrial locomotion, which
   contrasts with most extant African and Asian colobines that exhibit
   morphological and physiological adaptations for arboreality and
   folivory. These differences raise questions regarding the dietary
   specialization of early colobine taxa and how/if that influenced their
   dispersion out of Africa and into Eurasia. To further our understanding
   of the ecology of Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecids, we characterized the
   dental capabilities and potential dietary adaptations of Dolichopithecus
   ruscinensis through dental topographic and enamel thickness analyses on
   an M1 from the locality of Serrat d'en Vacquer, Perpignan (France). We
   also assessed the feeding behavior of D. ruscinensis through dental
   microwear texture analysis on a broad sample of fossil molars from
   fossil sites in France, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. Dental
   topographic and enamel thickness analyses suggest that D. ruscinensis
   could efficiently process a wide range of foods. Results of the dental
   microwear texture analysis suggest that its diet ranged from folivory to
   the consumption of more mechanically challenging foods. Collectively,
   this suggests a more opportunistic feeding behavior for Dolichopithecus
   than characteristic of most extant colobines. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Ecological interactions on shells of Mactra isabelleana d'Orbigny, 1846
   (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from southern Brazil: first record of a unique
   host-parasite interaction},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Mollusk shells are common substrates for several groups of marine
   invertebrates, which use them as housing or refuge, often producing
   traces in the form of bioerosion. In dead associations (current or
   fossil), it is difficult to determine if bioerosion was produced
   postmortem or not. The objective of this study was to describe anomalous
   internal growths in shells of the bivalve Mactra isabelleana, relating
   these occurrences to bioerosion on the external face, inferring if it
   was produced while the mollusk was still alive or not. To do so, 552
   valves of M. isabelleana from the Cassino, Hermenegildo and Concheiros
   do Albardao beaches, southern Brazil, were examined for external face
   bioerosion caused by spionid polychaetes-U-shaped horizontal perforation
   (Caulostrepsis isp.)-and internal shell alterations. The preferred
   location for bioerosion was analyzed based on a sectorization of valves
   into four quadrants (Q1 and Q3 posterior, and Q2 and Q4 anterior) and by
   counting external perforations and internal alterations in each. From
   the total M. isabelleana valves, 199 presented bioerosion Caulostrepsis
   on their external face. Inner face structures found were attached
   pearls, blisters and sheets. Sheets-type alterations are described
   herein for the first time. The most commonly affected quadrants by
   Caulostrepsis showed correspondence to internal alterations (Q1 and Q3)
   in the posterior region of the shell, indicating that the bivalve was
   alive when perforated. This is the first description of a parasite-host
   interaction in M. isabelleana shells for southern Brazil and the first
   time that parasitism is related to the ichnogenus Caulostrepsis.},

Title = {Out of the shadows: automatic fish detection from acoustic cameras},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 26},
Abstract = {Efficacious monitoring of fish stocks is critical for efficient
   management. Multibeam acoustic cameras, that use sound-reflectance to
   generate moving pictures, provide an important alternative to
   traditional video-based methods that are inoperable in turbid waters.
   However, acoustic cameras, like standard video monitoring methods,
   produce large volumes of imagery from which it is time consuming and
   costly to extract data manually. Deep learning, a form of machine
   learning, can be used to automate the processing and analysis of
   acoustic data. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect
   and count fish in a publicly available dual-frequency identification
   sonar (DIDSON) dataset. We compared three types of detections, direct
   acoustic, acoustic shadows, and a combination of direct and shadows. The
   deep learning model was highly reliable at detecting fish to obtain
   abundance data using acoustic data. Model accuracy for counts-per-image
   was improved by the inclusion of shadows (F1 scores, a measure of the
   model accuracy: direct 0.79, shadow 0.88, combined 0.90). Model accuracy
   for MaxN per video was high for all three types of detections (F1
   scores: direct 0.90, shadow 0.90, combined 0.91). Our results
   demonstrate that CNNs are a powerful tool for automating underwater
   acoustic data analysis. Given this promise, we suggest broadening the
   scope of testing to include a wider range of fish shapes, sizes, and
   abundances, with a view to automating species (or `morphospecies')
   identification and counts.},

Title = {Taxonomic resolution of coral image classification with Convolutional
   Neural Network},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 25},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are the most complex, diverse, and sensitive marine
   ecosystems, which are globally undergoing drastic changes. Changes in
   coral coverage, abundance, and diversity are difficult to track at
   adequate taxonomic resolution in a fast and efficient way. Deep
   Learning-enabled image recognition can help to increase the accuracy and
   can add to automating the entire survey process. However, the extent to
   which coral phylogenetic relationships within the higher taxonomic ranks
   are reflected by shared visual traits of the constituent species is an
   unresolved research subject. As a consequence, it is even more
   questionable whether the taxonomy of coral reefs at these levels can be
   identified from images using Machine Learning techniques. In this study,
   we analyzed the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   through different taxonomic ranks to classify the underwater images. We
   have used 1,15,296 images from the CoralNet database comprising 104
   species. A classifier was developed by fine-tuning the pre-trained
   ResNet34. The developed CNN classified 87.5\% of 34,543 test images
   correctly to species level and 91.78\% to genus level. The average
   classification recall on species level was 83.99\%. The ability to
   classify coral photographs at the species level can significantly boost
   the amount of occurrence data collected from survey sites. Even
   anticipating a higher taxonomic level will be a great place to start for
   additional research on a completely unknown specimen. Hence, the new
   technique will be a very useful tool for forecasting and understanding
   ecological responses to the environmental changes.},

Abstract = {The present study is based on the identification of benthic diatoms
   sampled along the Coastal Central Constantine in northeastern of
   Algeria. Our work aims to address relationships between environmental
   variables and characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the
   diatom flora. Diatoms and samples for physicochemical analysis were
   collected from 26 sampling sites between May 2017 and August 2018. The
   number of species accounted for was 109 species in the Safsaf watershed,
   117 taxa in the Kebir and 129 species in the watershed of Guebli which
   was the most diversified catchment. The great majority of diatom taxa
   were cosmopolitan species. Naviculaceae were the most abundant
   (47.87\%). Our results demonstrated the main environmental variables
   controlling the diatom distribution in all the watersheds, including
   conductivity, and pollution gradients highlighted in Canonical
   Correspondence Analyses (CCA). The results of the Shannon diversity
   index (H') showed that the species diversity observed in the sampled
   sites during summer is higher than that observed in spring and winter.
   During this season, mean Shannon diversity values were around H' = 4.49,
   3.98, and 4.17, respectively, while species richness varied between 13
   and 34 across the three watersheds.},

   threat for freshwater ecosystems worldwide. We showed that diets lacking
   highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and sterols reduce the salinity
   tolerance range of daphnids by more than 30\%. Our measurements of
   individual metabolic rate coupled with the quantification of consumers
   NaCl body content revealed that this reduction in salinity tolerance
   arises either from an increased energetic cost of iono-/osmo-regulation
   when food quality declines or from a lower resistance to NaCl when
   consumers lack sterols and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). While
   improving individual salt tolerance, these two mechanisms may have
   opposite consequences at ecosystem scale and need to be fully considered
   when predictions of consumers responses to multifactorial stresses are
   induced by global change.},

Title = {The energetic cost of facing cyanotoxins: a case study on Daphnia magna},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Under the effects of global change, toxic cyanobacterial proliferations
   increase and subsequently threaten freshwater ecosystems and the
   services they provide. Zooplankton consumers, a key trophic level of
   freshwater ecosystems, are particularly impaired by cyanotoxins, but
   populations regularly exposed to cyanobacteria can develop tolerance
   against toxins. While the physiological processes involved in this
   tolerance have been extensively studied, their consequences for
   consumers' energetics remain poorly explored, impeding predictions of
   energy flow from zooplankton up to higher trophic levels. Here, we
   explored the metabolic response of Daphnia magna exposed to toxic and
   non-toxic strains of cyanobacteria to define the energy dedicated to
   cyanotoxins resistance mechanisms. We showed that resting metabolic rate
   (RMR) of individuals exposed to toxins increased by up to 60\%,
   reflecting the energy requirement involved by cyanotoxin resistance
   processes. By quantifying the energy dedicated to resistance mechanisms,
   RMR constitutes an interesting metric to estimate overall capacity of
   individual zooplankters to actively handle cyanotoxins. Moreover, RMR
   responds more promptly to cyanotoxins than growth thus being adequate to
   assess short-term cyanotoxins constraints (< 72 h). Overall, we showed
   that cyanotoxins resistance constitutes an energy leak in freshwater
   ecosystems. Quantifying this leak of energy may help anticipate
   alterations of energy flow within food web in response to cyanobacterial
   proliferation and, ultimately, enhance our predictions of freshwater
   ecosystem structure and functions in a context of global change.},

Title = {A trait-based perspective toward the mechanistic understanding of
   benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage in a tropical rice field},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1069-1097},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Approximately 15\% of the world's wetlands are rice fields, vital in
   providing food for 40\% of the human population. Due to farming
   practices-induced habitat disturbances, rice cultivation acts as a
   habitat filter that retains only taxa possessing specific traits to
   overcome the constraints. Being aquatic biota, benthic
   macroinvertebrates are also impacted by the intermittent presence of
   water in rice fields. The biological traits and trait combinations of
   benthic macroinvertebrates enabling their existence during the rice
   cultivation cycle in seasonal rice fields of Maranchery Kole (The Ramsar
   site Vembanad Kole wetland's part) were studied. Based on the
   literature, 63 categories of 11 biological traits assignable at the
   genus level were used to characterize benthic macroinvertebrates. The
   taxa by traits data matrix was subjected to Gower's distance-based
   hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to categorize faunal groups
   with similar trait assembly. According to the abundance weighted trait
   modality scores, the predominant traits were small body size, life
   duration of more than 1 year, multivoltine life cycle, aquatic larval
   stage, aquatic passive dispersal, cocoons as resistant form, locomotion
   by full water swimming, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction,
   detritus as food and deposit-feeding. Trait-based classification of taxa
   resulted in 5 clusters. Characteristic trait combinations in each
   cluster particularly those beneficial for survival in unstable lentic
   freshwaters enabled the existence of taxa. Cluster I, the most abundant
   group (oligochaetes), was benefited from trait combinations including
   resistance forms to survive the intermittent presence of water in rice
   fields. Asexual reproduction and early onset of reproduction ensured
   their higher abundance from the transplanting phase. Detrital feeding
   also facilitated their rapid buildup in newly flooded fields rich in
   decomposing detritus. Cluster groups II and III, actively flying
   colonists characterized by competitive traits like predation, were more
   in tillering and preharvest phases. Apart from resistant and resilient
   traits ensuring survival in the temporary and disturbed habitat,
   exclusive trait combinations favored the faunal groups through different
   phases.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effect of different coverage of aquatic plants on the
   characteristics of the phytoplankton community structure is beneficial
   for management of lakes and protection of the aquatic ecosystems. In the
   present study, the effect of aquatic plants coverage on plankton
   community structure in a shallow macrophytic lake located in the middle
   reaches of the Yangtze River was investigated by dividing the lake into
   low, median, and high coverage habitats. Furthermore, the
   characteristics of phytoplankton and zooplankton community structures,
   and physicochemical indexes of lake water in the three habitats were
   analyzed. The results showed that an increase in aquatic plant coverage
   effectively reduced total phosphorus and total nitrogen in water and
   reduce the risks posed by phytoplankton blooms. Phytoplankton
   populations fluctuated slightly, and cyanobacteria density decreased in
   the medium coverage habitat when compared to those in the low coverage
   habitat. The phytoplankton species and quantity increased, and the lake
   water stability was enhanced in low coverage habitat when compared to
   those in the high coverage habitat. Zooplankton density, biodiversity
   index, and Pielou's evenness index of the medium coverage habitat were
   higher than those of the low and high coverage habitats. Our results
   suggest that to improve the stability of shallow lake water environment,
   the coverage of aquatic plants should be maintained at 26.7-33.1\% based
   on the physicochemical properties of water bodies and variations in
   phytoplankton community structure.},

Abstract = {Ammonia oxidation microorganism (AOM) is a key aspect of nutrient
   recycling in aquaculture sediments. Recently, rice-fish co-culture
   (symbiosis) has been paid more and more attention to the restoration of
   water and sediment quality in intensive aquaculture. Nevertheless, there
   are few studies on the effect of rice-fish co-culture on AOM in the
   sediments. Here, a field experiment was used to determine differences in
   abundance, community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) along
   with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in surface sediments (0-10 cm) in
   the paddy field (with ridge of 80 cm high, similar to shallow pond) for
   co-culture of japonica rice and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (JR-C),
   co-culture of indica rice and crayfish (IR-C), and crayfish monoculture
   (CM). The results showed that AOA were higher abundance, and diversity
   than AOB in the three modes of crayfish farming; AOA and AOB communities
   were dominated by Nitrososphaera and Nitrosospira clusters,
   respectively, with an average relative abundance of 97.86\% and 93.77\%;
   among the three modes, IR-C remarkably lowered alpha-diversity of AOA
   and AOB. Compared to CM, relative abundance of the Nitrosospira cluster
   in IR-C and JR-C was significantly increased, and the abundance of amoA
   genes of AOA in JR-C was remarkably higher (P < 0.05). Redundancy
   analysis (RDA) and spearman's correlation analysis showed that AOB
   community structure and abundances of AOA were significantly correlated
   with sediment pH, which indicated that sediment pH dominantly controlled
   the AOM.},

Title = {Negative effects of ghost nets on Mediterranean biodiversity},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets (i.e., ghost nets)
   strongly affect biodiversity in marine ecosystems of numerous localities
   around the world. Based on videos posted by different people in YouTube
   (TM), we accessed the negative effects of these gears in the
   Mediterranean Sea. We identified 86 species, from 12 groups, in 12
   countries within the Mediterranean region (including in the Africa,
   Europe, and Asia). Of the species entangled in ghost nets, 10 are
   considered threatened with extinction according to the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature. Fishes and macrocrustaceans were the
   most recorded groups entangled in ghost nets. We also identified algae,
   other invertebrates (i.e., cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs,
   poriferans, tunicates) and vertebrates (i.e., turtles and mammals). The
   larger number of ghost fishing events were recorded in Italy and Turkey.
   This is the most complete study showing the negative effects of ghost
   nets on marine biodiversity worldwide, based on data retrieved from
   digital media. With the available literature, our data are important to
   implement measures against ghost fishing nets in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Abstract = {In zooplankton surveys, many smaller taxa or species considered less
   important are often overlooked. One such example is the actinotrocha
   larvae of phoronid worms that are rarely quantified in zooplankton
   samples yet may play important roles in marine food webs. To gain a
   better understanding of phoronid ecology in coastal waters, we
   retrospectively analysed 145 plankton samples collected from two coastal
   sites in Ireland (Lough Hyne and Bantry Bay). Samples were collected
   using plankton nets from depths of 20 and 40 m. Phoronids were present
   in 37.7\% and 38.2\% of samples, with mean abundances of 0.3 +/- 0.5
   ind. m(-3) and 1.2 +/- 2.8 ind. m(-3), respectively, and were identified
   as Phoronis muelleri and Phoronis hippocrepia. Phoronids were present
   consistently each year from April to October at Lough Hyne and from
   February to October at Bantry Bay. Comparisons with other taxa in Lough
   Hyne show that abundances are similar to those of fish larvae (1.1 +/-
   1.8 ind. m(-3)) and echinoderm larvae (2.3 +/- 4.4 ind. m(-3)).
   Examination of these samples from Irish waters suggests that phoronids
   are more abundant in temperate waters than previously reported.},

Abstract = {Acropora palmata is colonized by encrusting sponges, such as Clathria
   venosa, in the lower zones of coral branches, especially in areas devoid
   of living tissue. To analyze the responses of tissues involved in the
   areas of interaction, we investigated the advancement rates and the
   sponge growth and recovery rates after the removal of sponge tissue. To
   assess the advance or retreat rates of the sponge and coral, steel
   screws were placed at the limits of the sponge/coral interaction area
   (treatment 1), and the response of the coral and sponge tissues was
   recorded. In treatment 2, the sponge was removed by scraping and
   cleaning the area. In treatment 3, the sponge was removed, and the area
   occupied by the sponge was filled with epoxy putty. We found that the
   interaction was a standoff (T1) in 64.2\% of cases, the sponge advanced
   in 7.1\% of cases, and regression was observed in 28.7\% of cases.
   Following its partial removal of the sponge (T2), C. venosa recovered
   the formerly occupied space in one month, whereas in T3, growth and
   recovery required 3 months. Clathria venosa is a colonizing species of
   the lower parts of the bases and branches of A. palmata, which despite
   presenting a rapid regeneration rate, no evidence was found that in
   contact with the coral, the sponge generates tissue deterioration.},

Title = {Environmental descriptors and reproductive modes drive multiple facets

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Temporary ponds contribute to the maintenance of freshwater
   biodiversity. Biotic and abiotic predictors are known to influence
   community assembly patterns in ponds, but the magnitude of these effects
   on different facets of diversity remains poorly investigated. We
   evaluated the influence of different ecological predictors (climatic and
   local environmental descriptors, and reproductive modes) on the
   taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of anuran tadpoles in
   10 temporary ponds in southern Brazil. We hypothesize that: (i) tadpole
   diversity will be affected by ecological predictors, particularly
   climate, known to influence the diversity of anuran reproductive modes;
   (ii) congruent responses by the three facets of diversity to the
   environmental predictors. We used structural equation models to reveal
   the pathways by which each ecological predictor affected tadpole
   diversity. Models explained over 85\% of the variation in tadpole
   diversity. Water depth and dissolved oxygen positively influenced all
   dimensions of tadpole diversity, while pond area, air humidity,
   evaporation, and maximum and minimum air temperature negatively affected
   all facets of diversity. The foam nest strategy positively influenced
   phylogenetic diversity. Environmental filtering seems to be the driver
   behind the assembly patterns of tadpole communities in these temporary
   ponds, acting mostly through climate and pond area. The reproductive
   mode of leptodactylids contributes to the resilience of the communities
   during the dry phase of the ponds. Finally, the congruent responses of
   the three components of diversity to the environmental gradients
   reinforce the idea that tadpole communities are not randomly structured.},

Abstract = {As a factor controlling the vertical distribution of larvae, changes in
   phototaxis, geotaxis, and sinking velocity concerning larval development
   in the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), a relatively shallower water
   species, and red snow crab (Chionoecetes japonicus), a relatively deeper
   water species, were investigated using laboratory-raised individuals. We
   also measured carapace width and carapace length in all larval stages
   and the length of the spines seen in the zoeal stages. The phototaxis of
   the zoeae of both species was strongly positive immediately after
   hatching, but it gradually changed to neutral. Megalopal phototaxis
   changed from strongly negative to neutral. The geotaxis of both species
   was strongly negative only for a few days after hatching, and the red
   snow crab exhibited stronger negative geotaxis than the snow crab. The
   sinking velocity of the red snow crab was slower than the snow crab just
   after hatching but faster in the megalopal stage. Red snow crab showed a
   greater tendency to float immediately after hatching (stronger negative
   geotaxis, slower sinking rate), compared to snow crab, and sink more
   easily in the megalopal stage (faster sinking speed). This might be
   because the red snow crab hatches and settles at deeper areas than the
   snow crab. Red snow crab larvae had larger carapace sizes and shorter
   spine lengths (at the zoeal stages) than the snow crab, which is
   indicative of adaptations that increase starvation tolerance for longer
   larval periods and reduce the energy costs of swimming for longer
   distances (i.e., greater hatching depth) after hatching.},

Abstract = {Surma River of Bangladesh is a representative of sub-tropical river
   system which is complex, dynamic and interacting socio-ecological
   system. Though land-based activities control the water quality of this
   river system, no studies have been conducted on the role of land-use
   patterns on water quality and biotic communities. Therefore, this study
   aimed to understand the impacts of water quality on the plankton
   community dynamics of Surma River basin. In addition, the study also
   examined the impacts of land-use patterns on water quality of river.
   Land-use patterns were identified by analyzing Landsat-8 imageries of
   the United State Geological Survey. Data on biotic and abiotic variables
   were collected from 15 sampling stations during dry season. Unsupervised
   and supervised classification techniques were used to identify the
   land-use patterns. Weighted arithmetic method was used to develop water
   quality index of river system. This study found four types of land-use
   patterns around Surma River basin (i.e., built-up area, barren land,
   river, vegetation and agriculture). Water quality index indicates that
   water quality is good in the rural area, while bad in the urban areas.
   Our study found that land-use pattern is a good predictor of water
   quality (R-2 = 0.97) of Surma River basin. Our study also found that
   high plankton species diversity coincides with the good water quality of
   the river. This study will serve as tool for the management of Surma
   River basin of Bangladesh.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) and polystyrene (PS) microplastics have attracted much
   attention because they are widely distributed in the environment, while
   their combined toxicity to aquatic organisms has rarely been studied.
   Therefore, this study explored the impact of microplastics on the toxic
   effects and biodegradation of BPA to the microalgae Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa. The results indicated that during the 16 days culture, PS
   (5 mg/L) increased the growth inhibition of BPA (1 mg/L and 10 mg/L) on
   C. pyrenoidosa compared to without PS. Similarly, PS (5 mg/L and 100
   mg/L) also increased the degradation efficiency of BPA (1 mg/L and 10
   mg/L) by algae. However, the changes of the chlorophyll content and the
   Fv/Fm value were opposite due to the hermetic and shading effect.
   Moreover, this study also found that five intermediates were formed
   during BPA degradation process because of the presence of oxidoreductase
   and glycosyltransferase. The results of the study provided vital
   information on the effect of PS on the toxicity and biodegradation of
   BPA to microalgal.},

Abstract = {Repeated coral reef surveys conducted in 2016-2021 in the coastal area
   of Nui Chua National Park in Ninh Thuan Province (South-Central
   Vietnam), formerly one of the richest coral areas in the Vietnamese
   coastal waters of the South China Sea, revealed dramatic degradation of
   coral communities over a five-year period. Coral cover decreased by 93\%
   and coral diversity by six-fold. This phenomenon has resulted from a
   long-term outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster sp. (COTS)
   reinforced by sea surface temperature anomalies in June 2019. The last
   survey, conducted in the target monitoring site in May 2021, revealed
   that the outbreak of COTS had ceased together with the disappearance of
   food sources for this starfish. Predator removal caused by overfishing
   and to some degree, nutrient enrichment resulting from the local
   seasonal upwelling, apparently determined the extent of the COTS
   outbreak. Degraded upstream coral reefs in the adjacent districts do not
   suggest coral recovery in this area in the near future.},

Abstract = {Microcystis has been the dominant bloom-forming cyanobacterial
   population in Lake Taihu over the past two decades. To illustrate the
   temporal and spatial variation in the main colony characteristics for
   Microcystis and their key environmental factors in Lake Taihu, an annual
   investigation of the size, morphospecies and viability (the viable cell
   rate) of Microcystis colonies was performed in this study from 2020 to
   2021. The average colony diameter ranged from 81.12 to 499.54 mu m at
   all sites during this investigation. The average colony diameter of the
   whole lake in spring and in late autumn to early winter was higher than
   that in other times. Microcystis flos-quae, Microcystis aeruginosa,
   Microcystis novacekii and Microcystis wesenbergii were the main dominant
   morphotypes, which was mainly affected by pH, TDP and temperature.
   Although no significant correlation was found between colony viability
   and environmental factors, the temporal difference in colony viability
   was remarkable. Colony viability in autumn (mainly October and
   November), spring (March and April), and July was lower than that in
   other times.},

Title = {Nutrient limitation of primary production in rivers along a land use

Abstract = {Benthic microalgae (BMA) biomass and community structure in freshwater
   lotic systems are often limited by inorganic nutrient availability. We
   examined nutrient limitation of benthic algae biomass and community
   structure using nutrient diffusing substrates in four rivers along a
   land use gradient in the Lake Biwa basin, Japan. Ambient in-stream
   nutrient concentrations were correlated to catchment land use, with the
   highest nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations being found in rivers
   draining more forested catchments. Nutrient limitation of primary
   producer biomass and nutrient-driven changes in community structure were
   evident in all four rivers, regardless of in-stream nutrient
   concentrations and surrounding land use. BMA biomass (measured as
   chlorophyll log-response ratio) exhibited the greatest nutrient
   limitation in rivers with higher in-stream nutrient concentrations. The
   relationship to catchment land use was less clear, with the highest
   nutrient limitation being observed in the catchment with moderate
   amounts of agricultural and forested land use. Nutrient additions
   resulted in a shift from dominance by Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) to a
   mixed Bacillariophyceae-Chlorophyceae (chlorophyte) community in all
   rivers and this shift was most pronounced in the forested catchments.
   Changes within the diatom community with nutrient additions were also
   observed, although the shifts in diatom community within a river in
   response to nutrient additions were much smaller than the differences in
   diatom community composition among rivers. Diatom taxa classified as
   highly motile increased with nutrient additions in all rivers. Our
   results suggest that primary producer community in rivers may be
   sensitive to nutrient inputs even in areas with elevated nutrient
   concentrations and catchments dominated by agricultural land use. There
   is likely widespread nutrient limitation in rivers of Japan, across both
   in-stream nutrient and land use gradients and any increases in nutrient
   loading will likely stimulate benthic algal growth. Our findings
   highlight the importance of looking at both biomass and species
   composition to assess ecosystem-level impacts of elevated nutrient
   levels.},

Title = {Abiotic factors that affect the distribution of aquatic macrophytes in
   shallow north temperate Minnesota lakes: a spatial modeling approach},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Macrophytes are an integral component of lake communities; therefore,
   understanding the factors that affect macrophyte community structure is
   important for conservation and management of lakes. In Sibley County,
   Minnesota, USA, five of the largest and most recreationally important
   lakes were surveyed using the point-intercept method. At each point the
   presence of macrophytes were recorded, water depth was measured, and a
   sediment sample was collected. Sediment samples were partitioned by
   determining sand, silt, clay, and organic matter fractions. The richness
   of macrophytes in all lakes were modeled via generalized linear
   regression with six explanatory variables: water depth, distance from
   shore, percent sand, percent silt, percent clay, and percent sediment
   organic matter. If model residuals were spatially autocorrelated, then a
   geographically weighted regression was used. Mean species richness (N
   point(-1)) was negatively related to depth and distance from shore and
   either positively or negatively related to silt depending on the lake
   and which macrophytes were present. All species richness models had
   pseudo-R-2 values between 0.25 and 0.40. Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton
   crispus) was found at 44\% of all sampling points in one lake, and its
   presence was related to water depth, percent silt, and percent sediment
   organic matter during early season surveys. Results from this study
   exhibit the inhibitory relationship between water depth and macrophyte
   growth. The results from these models suggest interactions are complex
   between macrophytes, environmental factors, and sediment texture; and
   that these interactions are species and site specific. A single
   landscape scale model would not be appropriate to capture the in-lake
   processes driving macrophyte distribution and abundance; and management
   strategies will need to be developed on a lake-by-lake basis.},

Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Six potential toxic metals (PTMs) in water-sediment-submerged macrophyte
   systems were investigated in six shallow lakes in Changsha City, Central
   China. The mean metal concentrations in the surface and interstitial
   water were in the order of Cu>As>Zn>Cr>Pb>Cd and As>Cu>Zn>Cr>Pb>Cd,
   respectively. Both surface and interstitial water were not polluted,
   except the interstitial water of Yue Lake with slight pollution
   (P-N=1.93). The mean metal concentration was in the order of
   Zn>Cr>As>Cu>Pb>Cd in the sediments. The concentration of As in all urban
   shallow lakes exceeded 25 mg kg(-1), and Cd in Meixi Lake and Xianjia
   Lake also exceeded 0.3 mg kg(-1). The sediments were slight to severe
   pollution in the studied urban shallow lakes. Among the submerged
   macrophytes, the concentrations of PTMs were decreased in the order of
   Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara > Myriophyllum verticillatum L. >
   Centella asiatica (L.) Urban > Potamogeton crispus L. Zn was the most
   accumulated in all the submerged macrophytes, and the highest
   bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of Zn was 43.0 in V. natans. V. natans also
   exhibited relatively high BAFs of 4.6, 2.4, and 4.7 for Cu, As, and Pb,
   compared with other submerged macrophytes. The translocation factor (TF)
   of As was no more than 0.3 in all submerged macrophytes. The TFs of the
   other metals were dependent on the plant species. For most studied
   metals (As, Pb, Zn, and Cd), significant positive correlations were
   identified between submerged macrophytes and their surrounding
   water/sediments (P<0.05). These results indicated that the potential use
   of native submerged macrophytes, especially for V. natans, for PTM
   removal from urban shallow lakes is worth further exploration.},

Abstract = {Differences and similarities between spiny lobster' sexes diet could
   result from multifactorial environmental influence. We evaluated the
   trophic spectrum for Panulirus argus, estimated lobster's selectivity,
   and corroborated the hypothesis that lobster' sexes diet is similar
   between subzones with different benthic community in two fishing
   subzones of the gulf of Batabano, Cuba. Stomach contents of 52 lobsters
   from Diego Perez (DP), and 68 from Aguardiente (AA), were analyzed.
   Frequency of occurrence (FO), gravimetric (G), and relative importance
   (IIR) indices were calculated for each food category. Ellenberg
   Similarity (ISe), Morisita, and Ivlev Selectivity (E) indices were also
   applied. Different diet descriptors were also related to benthic
   community attributes also used to compare between subzones and sexes.
   Trophic spectrum for P. argus consisted of gastropods, bivalves,
   polyplacophores, sea urchins, stomatopods, brachyurans, anomurans,
   polychaetes, ophiuroids, sponges, foraminifera, hydrozoans, fish, and
   plant matter. The E index showed a P. argus positive selectivity for
   gastropods Costoanachis sp., Diodora sp., Lucapina sp., Rissoina sp.,
   Fasciolaria tulipa, and Gibberula fluctuata, the bivalves Arcopsis sp.,
   Barbatia domingensis, Antillipecten antillarum, and Codakia orbicularis,
   and crustaceans of the Order Stomatopoda. Selectivity was highest but
   negative for Pinctada imbricata, Tucetona pectinata, Chione sp., and
   anomurans. Diet between sexes was similar in DP (ISe = 47.1\%) and the
   same in AA (ISe = 97.6\%), both with high trophic level overlap.
   Lobster's diet descriptors and the diet for each sex were similar
   (medium level) between subzones, while the attributes of the benthic
   community were different. Similarities between diets for each sex were
   kept despite differences in benthic community-specific composition.},

Abstract = {The effect of the anticyclonic eddy on the morphological structure,
   abundance (NB) and biomass of bacterioplankton (BB) in the deep
   phytoplankton maximum (DPM) was experimentally studied on natural
   phytoplankton in the Black Sea. Characteristic processes were simulated:
   the death of phytoplankton as a result of deepening DPM below the photic
   zone and a simultaneous increase in nutrient concentrations. In the
   experiment, primary production was terminated. Two cases were simulated:
   Regular and Deep DPM sinking with medium to high daily nutrient
   additions. Deep and Regular cases showed similar dynamics without
   significant differences. The NB increased during the first 4 days by 3.5
   times to the maximum of 1.12 x 10(6) ml(-1) cells. BB increased by 11.8
   times to 42.5 mg C m(-3). At the same time, the bacterial morphological
   structure changed towards the dominance of large rods in the BB (up to
   100\%), resembling copiotrophic bacteria. The sharp increase in BB
   cannot be explained by utilizing the organic matter released from dead
   eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass since it was low (4.0 mg C m(-3)). We
   assume that the enrichment of the environment with biogenic elements
   resulting from anticyclonic deepening can promote the development of
   large, fast-growing copiotrophic forms of bacteria. This growth can be
   achieved through a more complete use of the already available labile
   organic matter rather than the new one released from the dying DPM.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {An assessment of the bioturbation potential of seven freshwater snail
   species was made in a laboratory microcosm study. Two non-operculate
   species, Indoplanorbis exustus, and Racesina luteola and five operculate
   species, namely Pila globosa, Filopaludina bengalensis, Gabbia orcula,
   Melanoides tuberculata, and Brotia costula were considered for the
   experiment extending for a period of 28-days. Grazing, burrowing and
   bulldozing activities of snails on sediments bed induced changes in
   physicochemical properties of substratum and modulated the organic
   mineralization process. All seven snail species increased NH4+-N and
   PO43--P flux from sediment to overlying water in comparison with the
   control. Moreover, in snail presence modulated NOX- (NO2- -N + NO3- -N)
   concentrations and other parameters (DO, pH, TDS, conductivity) to the
   column water. Snail activity induced changes in physicochemical
   properties (TN, AP, OC, porosity and WHC) of sediment and modulated the
   organic mineralization process based on the length of the snails. The
   sediment texture was changed, more prominently in presence of the
   operculate snails than the non-operculate snails. Apparently, the
   operculate benthic snail F. bengalensis induced greater changes in the
   sediment in comparison to other snails. Nonetheless, all the snails
   appear to be efficient engineers in the management and habitat
   manipulation of the freshwater ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Trophic interaction in tropical regions is influenced by factors such as
   the size of organisms and the presence of intermediate predators.
   Macrophytes can act directly on predator-prey dynamics through the
   habitat structure provided by plants. We conducted an in situ mesocosm
   experiment (100 L) in a Brazilian reservoir to evaluate the top-down and
   bottom-up control promoted by the fish Astyanax lacustris, and to
   evaluate the effects of floating and submerged macrophytes' morphology
   on trophic interaction. The experiment lasted ten days and consisted of
   four treatments in triplicate (n = 12): a control (C) without fish, with
   only the natural plankton community, and treatments with addition of
   fish (+ F), fish + floating macrophyte (+ FFM) and fish + submerged
   macrophyte (+ FSM). In treatments with macrophytes, artificial plants
   were added to serve as shelter for zooplankton and Chaoborus. Our
   results showed that fish reduced small cladoceran and Chaoborus biomass
   by top-down control and increased edible phytoplankton biomass by
   increasing nutrient concentrations by bottom-up control. Chaoborus
   increased the food chain length to four levels, with negative effects on
   the biomass of small cladocerans. Submerged macrophytes were more
   efficient in providing refuge for copepods and Chaoborus. In general,
   planktivorous fish had a direct effect on zooplankton and an indirect
   effect on phytoplankton, and the invertebrate Chaoborus interfered with
   the functioning of trophic networks. Our results show that, in
   experimental conditions, macrophytes can play a fundamental role in
   tropical reservoirs by reducing the strength of top-down control in the
   trophic cascade.},

Abstract = {Identifying conservation strategy is essential regarding prioritization,
   planning, and managing biodiversity. The Eastern Himalayan freshwater
   reaches contain diverse taxa of fish species. Despite having several
   coarse scales of assessment, the information regarding the fine-scale
   conservation priorities is scanty. The development of indices from
   multimeric attributes has been proved efficient, aiding conservation
   planning, in-depth research, exploitation, policy-making, and public
   awareness. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed indexing of
   conservation values for the freshwater fish species inhabiting the
   sub-Himalayan Terai-Dooars ecoregion of the Eastern Himalayas. Based on
   three years of extended sampling in six freshwater reaches, 170
   indigenous fish species were identified. Each fish species was assigned
   a discrete conservation value following their rarity, taxonomic
   singularity, contribution to beta diversity, global threat status,
   regional importance, and maximal achievable body lengths. Neolissochilus
   hexagonolepis has the highest conservation value. In contrast, the
   lowest values were observed for Pethia gelius, Pethia guganio, and
   Pethia phutunio. The freshwater habitats of upper and lower elevation
   harbor essential fish species for conservation, driven by precipitation,
   topographic, and land cover variability. Such results were accomplished
   through spatial interpolation and prioritization regarding fish
   conservation, protection, and vulnerability toward the human footprint
   for this region of the Eastern Himalayas.},

Abstract = {Tourism remains one of the top threats in nature reserves worldwide. In
   this study, we first used both a field survey and in situ nutrient
   enrichment experiments to assess the effects of tourisms on aquatic
   ecosystems in a World Natural Heritage site that includes lakes,
   streams, shoals, and waterfalls. The results showed that phosphorus (P)
   enrichment altered benthic algal assemblage composition and the color of
   bryophyte-dominated benthic substrates in a shoal. Epilithic diatoms and
   their responses to the nutrient addition were significantly different
   between the control and test sites on a lake, which had contrasting
   tourist impacts in a lake. Second, we assessed the resilience of a lake
   heavily visited in the reserve by comparing phytoplankton density before
   and after a 2-year reserve closure due to an earthquake. Our study
   confirmed the hypotheses: (1) the perceived color change in Jiuzhaigou
   Natural Reserve waters was caused by nutrient enrichment in relation to
   tourist activities and was closely associated with a shift in algal
   composition; and (2) the changes to the fluvial and lake systems are
   still at their early stages and could be recovered by reducing tourism
   pressure. Our findings provide managers of protected karstic nature
   reserves with critical information for identifying causes of reserve
   degradation, estimating the carrying capacity for tourism and
   establishing limits of acceptable ecosystem changes. Guiping Deng

Abstract = {Introduced species may be one of the penultimate threats facing natural
   systems in the Anthropocene. Unfortunately, some taxa, such as meiofauna
   (organisms that pass through a 1 mm mesh but are retained by a 45 mu m
   mesh), are so challenging to study that the presence and impact of
   introduced meiofauna often goes undetected. Further, the impacts of
   introduced species are seldom placed into context with other structuring
   variables. Therefore, we used infaunal invertebrate communities of
   northern British Columbia, Canada, to quantify potential impacts of the
   introduced Cumacea Nippoleucon hinumensis upon the infaunal community
   and its closest endemic analog, Cumella vulgaris. We also compared the
   relative importance of this introduced species to other top-down
   (predation), bottom-up (competition), middle-out
   (predation/competition), and abiotic (tolerance) variables in
   structuring the infaunal community. We identified a significant negative
   correlation between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris, suggesting that when
   placed in context with other structuring factors, the introduced species
   may have a minor, but detectable impact upon C. vulgaris populations.
   However, no relationship was observed between N. hinumensis and the
   infaunal community. The lack of a community-wide effect is potentially
   the result of the similarity between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris life
   history strategies, enabling the introduced species to effectively
   replace C. vulgaris in the food web. As such, N. hinumensis may be best
   described as an invasive species, and not as merely non-native.
   Furthermore, the analytical techniques used here can be applied to other
   ecological systems to quantify and compare the impact of introduced
   species against other structuring forces.},

   large-sized dispersers (i.e., Macaca fuscata and Ursus thi-betanus) have
   been constrained mainly owing to past anthropogenic disturbances.
   Moreover, the distribution of several native mesocarnivores has been
   fragmented, although masked palm civet, Paguma larvata, a non-native
   frugivorous mesocarnivore, has expanded its distribution over the past
   quarter-century. Here, we evaluated the roles of this non-native species
   in defaunated cool-temperate forests by assessing primary and secondary
   seed dispersal via civets. To assess the primary dispersal process, we
   identified their possible latrines, where seeds were initially
   dispersed, by tracking radio-tagged civets. We then compiled an
   inventory of seeds transported by civets combining the results of the
   fecal analysis performed in this study and a literature survey for seeds
   known to be transported by civets. To explore secondary seed dispersals,
   we first determined the ability of civet feces to attract dung beetles
   using pitfall traps and then compared this ability of civet feces with
   that of the feces of raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, a native
   mesocarnivore. Our findings showed that (1) over 90\% of the civet
   latrines confirmed within forested areas with flat terrain, safe sites
   for germination and establishment of common plant seeds, and carried
   seeds of 20 plant species; (2) the civet feces were more strongly
   preferred by dung beetles than raccoon dog feces; and (3) the abundance
   of large tunneler beetles with superior seed burial ability using the
   civet feces was 3.7 times as high as that of raccoon dog feces. Thus,
   these findings suggest that this non-native mesocarnivore could recover
   functional redundancy by offsetting injured endozoochorous processes.},

Title = {Goat browsing does not induce physical defences but reduces leaf size in
   Vachellia trees},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {One aspect of plant-herbivore interactions in African savannas is the
   browsing impact of mammalian herbivores on plants, which may result in
   induced physical defences (spines) and changes in leaf morphology in
   trees experiencing intensive browsing. In these savannas, spinescence is
   considered to have evolved in response to herbivore pressure from large
   mammals. We assessed the impact of free-ranging domesticated goats on
   the spines and leaves of Vachellia karroo, V. nilotica and V. torahs in
   Msinga, South Africa. We predicted that there would be fewer and smaller
   leaves, and longer spines occurring below compared to above 1.5 m for
   all tree species. We further predicted that the outer parts of the tree
   canopy would have smaller and fewer leaves, as well as more and longer
   spines compared to the inner part of the canopy. To determine the
   response of these trees to goat herbivory, 35 trees of each Vachellia
   species were selected, the number of leaves and spines found on two
   randomly selected branches below 1.5 m and one above 1.5 m were
   measured. We found that leaves were fewer and smaller below compared to
   above 1.5 m. Interestingly, we found the reduced leaf size to be equal
   to the size of spines below 1.5 m. We also found that V. karroo had more
   spines below 1.5 m compared to V. torahs and V. nilotica. Along the
   branch segments, we found that spines were longer in the most accessible
   parts of the branch, the outer canopy. This study showed that browsing
   by goats, unlike wild herbivores, do not induce plant physical defences
   but rather limit available foliage. We also showed that physical
   defences (spine density) of Vachellia trees vary. This has implications
   for management and ecology of rangelands browsed by domestic mammals.},

Title = {Soil heterogeneity and species composition jointly affect individual
   variation of three forage grasses},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aims: Individual variation (IV) plays an important role in driving the
   structure and function of plant communities, especially when plants
   growing in heterogeneous soils. However, the joint effects of soil
   heterogeneity and species composition on IV are still unclear. Methods:
   A controlled experiment was done, where four soil heterogeneity levels
   were developed by filling resource-rich and resource-poor substrates in
   pots with different patch sizes (i.e. fine, small, medium and large),
   and seven types of species compositions were derived from all the
   possible combinations of three forage grasses (i.e. Festuca elata,
   Bromus inermis and Elymus breviaristatus). Coefficient of variation (CV)
   of plant height and chlorophyll content were applied to quantify IV.
   Results: CV first increased and then decreased with increasing patch
   size. Moreover, CV in monocultures was on average lower than mixtures.
   Furthermore, patch size and species composition jointly affected IV,
   where B. inermis growing together with E. breviaristatus had relatively
   higher CV of plant height than that in other compositions, while F.
   elata growing together with E. breviaristatus had relative higher CV of
   chlorophyll content than that in other compositions, and both of these
   patterns were found in pots with small patch size. Conclusions: Soil
   heterogeneity and species composition jointly affected individual
   variation of plants. More plant traits such as plant biomass should be
   considered to further explore the effects of soil heterogeneity on
   individual variation. Such results can be applied in the restoration of
   degraded grasslands.},

Title = {Does intraspecific trait variability affect understorey plant community
   assembly?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing evidence points to the major impact of intraspecific
   variability in species characteristics on com-munity assembly.
   Contrasting theories predict that high trait variability might either
   steepening dominance orders or promote diversity. Here, we try to test
   these predictions with understorey plants in a Polish mixed temperate
   forest. We focus on four important traits (leaf dry mass LDW, plant
   height SH, specific leaf area SLA, and number of flowers NF) of the
   small balsam Impatiens parviflora, the dominant species in this forest
   system. We relate trait variability to community species richness and
   abundances, as well as to soil characteristics. Trait variability was
   high irrespective of species richness. Contrary to theory, abundances of
   non -I. parviflora species significantly decreased with increasing
   variance in I. parviflora trait expression. Trait variability did not
   signif-icantly influence species composition and was not significantly
   correlated with soil characteristics. Our results emphasis the need to
   study trait variability in terms of appropriate statistical standards as
   provided by the allometric variance -mean relationship. We argue that an
   individual based study of local trait variability might return important
   insights into the composition and assembly of local communities.},

Title = {Seed dispersal mechanism of Erythronium japonicum in Northeast China},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Seed dispersal is recognized as a very important stage in the life
   history of plant sexual reproduction. Seed dispersal directly determines
   whether plant seeds can reach the favorable germination sites and ensure
   the successful germination of seeds subsequently which is the first
   stage of plant seedling establishment. The final dispersal location of
   seeds with diplochory usually requires the joint decision of two stages
   including primary seed dispersal and secondary seed dispersal. The seed
   dispersal of Erythronium japonicum by ants was investigated in three
   different habitats. The effect of seed maturity on seed fate and the
   effects of elaiosome removal and water immersion on seed dispersal in
   the wild were studied. The results showed that eight species of ants
   were involved in E. japonicum seed dispersal in the three habitats. The
   seed handling efficiency and the number of seeds transported by ants
   were affected by the composition of ant community and the size of ant
   population. There was a strong correlation between the seed dispersal
   distance and the body length of ants. Small ants may have expanded their
   foraging range through fierce struggle. The immature E. japonicum seeds
   will also be handling by ants, indicating that the seed elaiosome mature
   prior to seeds. We found elaiosome plays an important role in the
   dispersal of E. japonicum seeds, and it can also be used as a ``handle
   point{''} for smaller ants. The components of elaiosome are not easily
   soluble in water, which can avoid the loss of the attraction of E.
   japonicum seeds to ants due to the rain during the seed dispersal
   process.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Vegetation structural diversity, also called structural complexity, has
   great effects on biodiversity and ecological processes, with higher
   biodiversity often observed in areas with higher structural diversity.
   As for other ecological variables, structural diversity is spatially
   heterogeneous. Thus, quantifying its spatial heterogeneity may provide
   clues to the spatial variation in ecological processes. We studied the
   spatial patterns of structural diversity in two different environments,
   tundra and forest-tundra ecotone, near Churchill, MB, Canada. We sampled
   vegetation and quantified five types of structural diversity (ground
   cover, herbaceous plants, woody plants, all live plants, and deadwood)
   along five transects, with lengths of 81-227 m, and used wavelet
   analysis to assess the scales of spatial pattern. We also assessed the
   effects of soil pH, microtopography, elevation, and distance from lakes
   on structural diversity. In general, structural diversity was spatially
   structured on a variety of scales, from 2 to 55 m, with larger scales
   being observed in the tundra than in the ecotone transects. In addition,
   structural diversity in the tundra was generally higher near lakes and
   in areas with a higher pH, whereas in the ecotone it increased mostly
   with increasing pH and microtopographic variation. Spatial heterogeneity
   is an important characteristic of the forest-tundra ecotone and even
   tundra areas that appear homogeneous are structurally diverse at a
   variety of scales.},

   and prey. Predatory sea stars are key species in many marine ecosystems
   and often elicit defensive responses in their prey. This study
   investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on the escape response of the
   sea star Parvulastra exigua to its sea star predator Meridiastra calcar.
   In response to touch by M. calcar, P. exigua exhibits a distinct fleeing
   response. The escape response of P. exigua with respect to velocity and
   escape trajectory was investigated after both species were acclimated in
   OA conditions. At pH(T) 7.6 and 7.8 velocity and escape trajectory of
   the fleeing response of P. exigua did not differ from that seen in the
   ambient treatment. However, there was a delay in the time that P. exigua
   started to flee with the initiation time being 2.8 times slower (10 vs
   28 s) at pH(T) 7.6. This delay may increase the vulnerability of P.
   exigua to predation by M. calcar and have ecological effects with
   respect to the role of this species as an algal grazer on rocky shores
   of southeast Australia where these sea star species co-occur.},

Title = {Are mussels and oysters capable of reducing the abundances of
   Picochlorum sp., responsible for a massive green algae bloom in Thau
   lagoon, France?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {After an exceptional hydroclimatic year, a ``massive green algae bloom
   ``, dominated by the autotrophic picoeukaryote Picochlorum sp, was
   observed in 2018-2019 in the Thau lagoon. Oyster farmers informed
   decision-makers and scientists about an alarming halt to growth, loss of
   flesh weight and abnormal mortality in commercial size oysters, whereas
   mussel farmers observed no adverse effects. Two hypotheses were tested.
   First, Mediterranean mussels are capable of filtering Picochlorum spp.
   whereas Pacific and flat oysters are not. Second, picophytoplankton
   filtration rates vary with the size of the oyster, spats having greater
   ability than juveniles and commercial size oysters. A series of
   experiments was conducted in February 2019 using a series of beakers
   containing (i) three different types of solutions (1 L): water from the
   Thau lagoon containing Picochlorum at a rate of 45.2 million cells.L-1
   (P) or diluted to 20.7 million cells. L-1 (D) and a solution of
   Isochrysis galbana containing 9.4 million cells. L-1; (ii) in the
   absence or presence of five types of bivalves: Pacific oysters of three
   different sizes (spat, juvenile and commercial size), flat oysters, and
   Mediterranean mussels of commercial size. Four separate water samples
   were taken during a 40-min incubation period to measure fluctuations in
   picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton abundances using flow cytometry.
   Retention efficiency (\%) was compared according to species and size. In
   contrast to Pacific and flat oysters, mussels with an average weight of
   21.4 g, were able to drastically reduce the abundances of Picochlorum
   and depleted nearly one million Picochlorum cells per minute at 11.4 ?.
   These results suggest that the 1228 t of mussels that died in 2018
   before the Picochlorum bloom could have helped limit the Picochlorum
   bloom if they had survived the heat and anoxia.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The red drum is a valuable coastal species distributed throughout the
   southeastern US where winter cold stress can vary geographically and
   impact survivorship. We studied the thermal sensitivity of red drum gill
   Na+/K++ ATPase in order to gain insight regarding temperature effects on
   osmoregulatory capabilities with potential implications for overwinter
   survival. We collected gill tissue from age-0 juvenile red drum
   acclimated to a temperature of 15 ? and measured Na+/K+ ATPase activity
   at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 25 ? to assess function over a broad thermal range.
   The Arrhenius plot for Na+/K+ ATPase activity indicated a breakpoint at
   8.6 C, below which greater activation energy was required for the Na+/K+
   ATPase reaction. Increased gill Na+/K+ ATPase temperature sensitivity
   below 8.6 ? may limit the ability of age-0 red drum to maintain ionic
   and osmotic balance during acute exposure to extreme cold temperatures.},

Title = {Macroalgal canopies provide corals limited protection from bleaching and
   impede post-bleaching recovery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {553},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching, the result of loss of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, as
   well as post-bleaching recovery can be exacerbated or mitigated by a
   range of local factors such as depth, turbidity, and natural or
   artificial shading providing protection for corals during thermal
   anomalies. On many reefs, losses in coral cover coincide with increases
   in upright macroalgae growth. Such shifts in benthic communities are
   generally viewed as negative, whereby macroalgae can outcompete corals
   for space, and affect adult coral health and fitness. However, the
   canopy provided by upright macroalgae could reduce solar irradiance and
   provide refuge for understorey corals during heat events, decreasing
   coral bleaching and subsequent mortality. To test this hypothesis, this
   study manually removed macroalgae from experimental plots on a
   macroalgae-dominated fringing reef at Magnetic Island in the central
   inshore region of the Great Barrier Reef, comparing the subsequent
   bleaching during and recovery following a severe heat stress event. In
   March 2020, sea surface temperature at Magnetic Island reached 31.4
   degrees C, leading to bleaching. Surveys of coral communities undertaken
   at the peak of accumulated severe heat stress (DHW of 9.3 degrees
   C-weeks) in control and macroalgae removal plots showed that, averaged
   across coral morphological groups, there was no overall difference in
   bleaching prevalence in algal-removal and control plots (21.1\% and
   20.8\% of the community bleached; respectively). However, bleaching
   prevalence varied within morphological groups, with massive morphology
   corals demonstrating higher probability of bleaching in removal plots
   compared to controls (0.26 and 0.09, respectively). Bleaching severity
   (i.e. percent of the colony tissue bleached) was consistent across
   control and removal plots (83.2\% and 80.4\% of colony area,
   respectively, averaged across morphologies), with branching corals
   demonstrating the lowest severity. Surveys were repeated in July after
   heat stress had dissipated, with coral communities in algal-removal
   plots displaying greater recovery than controls (i.e. 86.1\% and 75.6\%
   healthy, respectively, model estimated mean averaged across
   morphologies). Encrusting corals in control plots were the slowest to
   recover. We conclude that macroalgae provided limited refuge for
   branching and encrusting corals at the height of the thermal event,
   likely due to the severity of the accumulated heat stress, while massive
   corals enjoyed some degree of protection from the canopy. Greater
   recovery of coral communities in removal plots may potentially be
   explained by reduced competition with adjacent macroalgae. This study
   provides important insights into the interactions between these two
   dominant benthic groups and supports previous work finding macroalgae
   inhibits coral recovery after severe bleaching events.},

Title = {Estimating mistletoe biomass in a semi-arid savanna woodland, southwest
   Zimbabwe},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite the biological importance of mistletoes in forests and woodlands
   globally, mistletoe biomass is rarely quantified, particularly in
   tropical regions. Thus, we constructed allometric models to predict the
   biomass of three mistletoe species (Erianthemum ngamicum, Plicosepalus
   kalachariensis, and Viscum verrucosum) in semi-arid savanna, southwest
   Zimbabwe. We destructively sampled 30 individuals of each mistletoe
   species and recorded their broad haustorium diameter, narrow haustorium
   diameter, and the width, breadth, vertical depth, and percentage of
   leaves of the whole plant. After measuring the dry biomass of each
   mistletoe, we fitted linear regression models - selected and compared
   based on corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) minimization.
   Mistletoe volume (r(2) = 0.95) best predicted biomass in E. ngamicum,
   while mistletoe size was the best predictor for P. kalachariensis (r(2)
   = 0.90) and V. verrucosum (r(2) = 0.95). Models using haustorium
   diameter had the lowest predictive power in all species. V. verrucosum
   and P. kalachariensis had greater total mean dry biomass than E.
   ngamicum. Stems constituted the larger proportion of total biomass than
   leaves in E. ngamicum (75 vs. 23\%) but the reverse is true for P.
   kalachariensis (40 vs. 58\%). Of the total biomass, fruits and flowers
   constituted 6\% in V. verrucosum and E. ngamicum and 2\% in P.
   kalachariensis. The leaf to stem biomass contribution decreases in E.
   ngamicum but increases in P. kalachariensis as the plant grows. Models
   using mistletoe biometry (width, breadth, and vertical depth of the
   whole plant), rather than host size (height, diameter at breast height,
   and canopy area), best predicted total mistletoe biomass. Not only does
   this enable estimation of mistletoe biomass beyond the scale of infected
   individuals, but the contribution of mistletoes to local biomass, carbon
   stock, and ecosystem processes (e.g., nutrient cycling) can also be
   quantified at different spatial scales helping elucidate their keystone
   role in semi-arid savanna.},

Title = {Eelgrass meadows harbor more macrofaunal species but bare sediments can
   be as functionally diverse},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are important ecosystem engineers, providing habitat
   for a range of marine organisms which sustain many ecosystem functions.
   Due to global loss of seagrass, conservation and restoration incentives
   are rapidly increasing. However, it is not well understood how
   environmental setting affects the structural and functional diversity of
   macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina), and to
   what extent their importance as macrofaunal habitat is affected by
   abiotic variables across spatial scales. In the present study, we
   explored macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows and adjacent bare
   habitats across contrasting envi-ronments in Southern Sweden. We
   assessed taxonomic and functional diversity in concert and evaluated
   envi-ronmental properties as explanatory variables for the observed
   differences. Our results showed that eelgrass meadows supported a
   significantly higher taxonomic richness and abundance compared to
   adjacent bare sedi-ments whereas differences in structural and
   functional diversity was mainly a function of site and highly influenced
   by dominance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans. Interestingly,
   functional redundancy was higher in brackish compared to marine sites,
   illustrating the effect of generalist species that cover a wide range of
   func-tional traits. Abiotic sediment variables did not explain the
   variation in structural or functional diversity, but were largely
   overshadowed by the effect of eelgrass and its belowground biomass. From
   a restoration perspec-tive, our results imply that the positive effects
   of eelgrass restoration are similar across environments and that the
   presence of eelgrass is the most important factor in structuring benthic
   communities, but the effects on functional diversity and redundancy need
   further attention.},

Title = {Limited evidence for local adaptation to salinity and temperature
   variability in San Juan Island populations of the copepod Tigriopus
   californicus (Baker)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Local adaptation has been studied in a broad range of taxa for decades.
   However, we have limited understanding of how often it occurs in
   variable environments. Whether phenotypic plasticity can evolve in
   distinct ways among populations experiencing different patterns of
   abiotic variability is unclear. Abiotic conditions in coastal marine
   habitats can be highly heterogeneous at small spatial scales, which
   might promote local adaptation. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus
   californicus (Baker, 1912) has become a model system for testing whether
   phenotypic differences among populations are a result of local
   adaptation. To identify potential selective pressures in the field,
   temperature and salinity were measured in high shore pools for six
   months at three sites on San Juan Island in Washington, USA. A common
   garden experiment with factorial combinations of seven temperature and
   two salinity (32, 55 ppt) treatments was conducted on these distinct
   populations. Two temperature treatments varied daily, both with an
   average of 20 C, but different ranges (low amplitude: 15-25 C, high
   amplitude: 10-30 C). The other five treatments were the average,
   maximum, and minimum temperatures held constant. Fecundity,
   survivorship, and development were characterized across two generations.
   There were strong interactive effects of temperature and hypersalinity
   on copepod culture dynamics, but these effects differed among
   populations. Abiotic patterns in the field were correlated with few
   observed differences in population phenotypes, thus limited evidence for
   local adaptation was found. For these populations, differences in
   selective pressures among sites might not be strong enough to overcome
   the influence of genetic drift.},

Title = {Ecology of morphological fruit types, and fruit and seed colors in 27
   Venezuelan plant communities},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The composition, richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) of
   morphological fruit types, and fruit and seed colors were assessed in 27
   Venezuelan plant communities. We examined whether morphological fruit
   types and fruit and seed colors represent ecological attributes with
   predictable values that can be related to the structural and climatic
   characteristics of plant communities. Texture, dehiscence, and fruit
   types following two classification systems, and fruit and seed colors
   were determined for each plant community and habitat. The highest mean
   frequencies of dry fruits were found in the meadow, wetland and
   shrubland vegetation types, and the highest mean frequencies of fleshy
   fruits in the wet forests. The frequencies of dry and fleshy fruits, and
   dehiscent and indehiscent fruits were largely similar in both habitat
   types. The most common fruit types were loculicidal and septicidal
   capsules in the mesothermic shrublands, wetlands, and savanna grassland;
   berries in the cloud forests, sub-p ` aramo and riparian wet forest;
   drupes in the cloud forests and psammophilous meadow; schizocarps in the
   xerophytic shrublands and psammophilous meadow; and achenes in the
   savanna grassland and p ` aramo. The richness and diversity of the
   morphological fruit types, and fruit and seed colors identified were
   highest in dry forests. Almost all the ecological parameters measured
   were positively correlated, including plant species number, except
   abiotic factors. The composite Shannon-Weiner diversity index and fruit
   types and fruit and seed colors richness were significantly correlated
   with the total number of plant species number. Plant locality
   classification according to the frequencies of each morphological fruit
   type showed approximate affinities with geographic areas, vegetation
   type and plant community. This suggests a predictable value, and
   highlights the importance of the composition, richness, and diversity of
   fruit types in the organization of plant communities and their biotic
   and abiotic interactions.},

Title = {Functional importance of bird-dispersed habitat for the early
   recruitment of Taxus chinensis in a fragmented forest},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The relationship between bird habitat selection and seed deposition is
   well established; however, knowledge remains limited on the functional
   importance of bird habitat for the early recruitment of seed deposition
   and seedlings in remnant fragmented forests. Here, we evaluated the
   post-foraging habitat use by birds and quantified the effects of habitat
   factors on seed deposition and seedling distribution of the endangered
   Chinese yew Taxus chinensis in a fragmented forest. Birds preferentially
   frequented fruiting trees for perching (85\%, T. Chinensis and Machilus
   thunbergii trees). Tree cover, height, crown size, and girth were the
   most important factors affecting habitat use by birds. Consequently, the
   number of deposited seeds was positively affected by three
   tree-associated perching traits (girth, cover, and crown size). Seedling
   distribution strongly overlapped with the distribution of deposited
   seeds, confirming that seedlings could survive in bird-dispersed
   habitats. Increasing tree girth, cover, and crown size may enhance
   seedling recruitment. Our results highlighted the functional importance
   of large trees in patchy environments for supplying suitable sites for
   bird habitat use, which also fitted the requirement for early
   recruitment of T. chinensis. Consequently, protecting remaining large
   trees in fragmented forests should be considered in forest conservation
   and management.},

Title = {Assessing the presence, settlement and growth of the invasive
   Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii, on mussel farms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Biofouling invasive species cause economic harm to shellfish aquaculture
   and require effective management strategies. Therefore, a better
   understanding of the life cycle and spread of key pest species for more
   efficient surveillance approaches is needed. The main purpose of this
   study was to assess effectiveness of detecting the invasive
   Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii, at mussel farms using
   environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/ eRNA) approaches and compare the
   results to visual surveys that were undertaken to detect presence,
   settlement seasonality and growth of the fanworm on different settlement
   substrates. Monthly biofilm and seawater samples were taken around three
   mussel farm sites and tested for S. spallanzanii eDNA and eRNA signals
   using a species-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. Occupancy
   modelling applied on the eDNA-based detections indicated the fanworm's
   probability of detection at 90\% of all sampled locations regardless of
   month or depth. Environmental DNA ddPCR copy numbers were highly
   variable but were detected in every monthly sample. Specifically, month
   and sampling matrix (seawater or biofilm) contributed significantly to
   predicting the eDNA signal strength (p < 0.001). Unfortunately, eRNA
   detections were very low and only ten out of 48 samples yielded a
   positive eRNA detection. Observations from settlement substrates showed
   that it took around 8 months for the fanworms to grow to \~{}5 cm in
   length and they preferred to settle on more complex rather than smooth
   surfaces. Our results suggest that a species-specific eDNA/RNA ddPCR
   assay at a mussel farm, followed by further visual or settlement
   monitoring could aid increased vigilance for detecting the arrival of
   newly invasive species at an early settlement stage.},

Title = {The lugworm fishery in Northumberland, UK: Bait digging impacts in a
   marine protected area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {552},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Robust evidence of fisheries impacts is required to support
   evidence-based management. Intertidal fisheries have received
   considerably less attention to date compared to inshore and offshore
   counterparts. The need for additional intertidal data and assessment has
   been identified for protected sites under UK legislation (i.e., the
   Department for Environment, Food \& Rural Affairs `revised approach to
   commercial fisheries'). Digging for Arenicola spp. is carried out both
   recreationally and commercially within the Berwickshire and North
   Northumberland Special Area of Conservation (SAC), a Marine Protected
   Area (MPA) along the northeast coast of England. This study investigated
   the impacts of such activities, comparing sites across a gradient of
   fishing pressure (none, low, high), in combination with small scale
   experimental disturbances (simulated digging and lugworm exclusion) at
   an unfished site. Fishing pressure gradient studies indicated no
   long-term impacts on the target species, as no significant differences
   were detected between sites. This suggests that current collection
   intensities are not reducing or altering targeted lugworm populations.
   However, finer scale experimental work revealed significant negative
   impacts upon the wider sediment communities in the short term, which was
   mirrored in the longer-term, fisheries scale gradient site comparisons.
   Reductions in total infaunal abundance and taxonomic richness and
   altered community structures were observed. Recovery within experimental
   plots was rapid (within a few months), suggesting that under similar
   conditions, sites have the potential for substantial recovery if
   disturbance is ceased. The observed alterations to infaunal communities
   could have ecosystem wide implications, with altered functional
   diversity and ecosystem processes that are not compatible with the
   conservation objectives or designations of the study site. Additional
   management measures such as further closed areas or seasonal closures to
   bait digging would allow for recovery and restoring sites.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {English Ivy (Herdera helix, Araliaceae) is an evergreen woody climbing
   plant occurring naturally in temperate forests of Europe and as
   introduced ornamental plant in many parts of the world, becoming
   invasive in some. Over the last decades an increase of ivy occurrence in
   middle Europe was observed in forests as well as in urban or rural
   areas. As a consequence, ivy might also play a larger role in food webs
   and nutrient and carbon cycling in the future. We followed the
   decomposition of litter of ivy and compared it to litter of four common
   host trees species (sycamore, ash, oak, beech) using mesh bags with and
   without mesofauna access over a period of 10 months. Experiments were
   set up in nine gardens spread over Germany, involving citizen
   scientists. In the presence of mesofauna, ivy litter decomposed faster
   than litter of three of the tree species. The contribution of mesofauna
   to decomposition followed a similar pattern. In the absence of
   mesofauna, ivy decomposed faster than two of the tree species. In a
   changing world where ivy becomes more abundant, and tree species face
   population decline due to disease or climatic stress, litter composition
   will also change. Ivy adds medium to fast decaying litter to the
   ecosystem, and in other seasons than tree species. Conducting
   experiments with citizen scientist offers the possibility for
   wide-spread multi-site experiments generating robust data and overcoming
   local restrictions with low budgets.},

Title = {Habitat suitability of drift macroalgae in two shallow coastal estuaries
   of the northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Drift macroalgae, often associated with seagrass habitats, may provide
   resources and habitat to seagrass asso-ciated fauna, increasing faunal
   abundance and diversity. Yet, excessive amounts of drift macroalgae can
   be harmful, reducing the abundance of both aquatic angiosperms and
   animals by causing localized hypoxia. To ascertain the effects of drift
   macroalgae at biomasses commonly found in the northern Gulf of Mexico,
   we quantified recruitment into drift macroalgae without the presence of
   seagrass and measured associated changes to temperature, dissolved
   oxygen, and flow in Redfish Bay, Texas and Big Lagoon, Florida, USA.
   These locations comprise different coastal ecosystems with different
   compositions of drift macroalgae. In both locations, the presence of
   macroalgae significantly increased recruitment of small nekton, with
   higher abundances and species richness found within macroalgae relative
   to adjacent artificial macroalgae. Flow velocity and dissolved oxygen
   levels were lower in macroalgae than in adjacent artificial or bare
   substrate, but still remained above hypoxic levels over daily
   fluctuations. Despite lower oxygen levels at night, and overall lower
   water flow, organisms readily recruited into drift macroalgae more so
   than the artificial habitats nearby. However, the reduction in oxygen
   reveals that in higher biomasses, macroalgae could adversely affect
   animals.},

Title = {Environmental constraints on the photosynthetic rate of the marine
   flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Symsagittifera roscoffensis, an Acoel flatworm that lives within the
   intertidal zone, was first discovered over a century ago as a ``plant
   animal{''} due to its symbiotic relationship with the alga Tetraselmis
   convolutae. Although commonly used as a model organism in biomedical
   research, there is little information regarding its life history or how
   environmental factors affect this organism. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of a range of abiotic factors on S.
   roscoffensis by measuring its photosynthetic oxygen production rate
   under different salinities, temperatures, light intensities,
   photoperiods, and nutrient concentrations over 6 days. Salinity (20, 30
   and 40) had little effect on photosynthetic rate, whereas a temperature
   of 14 degrees C yielded significantly higher final oxygen production
   than 0 and 30 degrees C. The lowest light intensity (21 mu mol m- 2 s-
   1), the shortest photoperiod (8 L:16 D) and the intermediate nutrient
   concentration (f/4) resulted in the highest final oxygen production
   rates. Our results showed that S. roscoffensis had the ability to
   tolerate and remain photosynthetically active under a wide range of
   conditions that it is likely to experience within the intertidal zone.
   Using our experimental data, we estimated that S. roscoffensis was able
   to produce 174\% body C d-1 via photosynthesis alone, which could
   explain the total absence of heterotrophic feeding in this organism. The
   organism appeared to be robust and easy to cultivate, which should open
   new opportunities for its wider applications.},

Title = {Is it possible to photoperiod manipulate spawning time in planktivorous
   fish? A long-term experiment on Atlantic herring},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {552},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The oocyte development (vitellogenesis) of individual fish is highly
   dependent upon their physiology which is influenced by both intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors. Thus, if individuals encounter poor biophysical
   conditions, they will likely be unable to reproduce. The photoperiod is
   an external factor that is constant between years but with increasing
   intra-annual (seasonal) variation polewards. In high-latitude marine
   environments, several ecological processes are strongly photic
   entrained, e.g., the planktonic spring bloom. However, it is still
   unclear whether day length or planktonic peaks (feeding opportunity) is
   the main timer or regulator behind gametogenesis not only for teleost
   piscivores but also for planktivores living in these waters. Hence, we
   experimentally investigated the role of photoperiod steering
   vitellogenesis in the planktivomus Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus),
   rearing larvae up to the mature adult stage. We imposed a natural and
   6-month offset photoperiod hypothesising that vitellogenesis is
   entrained by this photic zeitgeber. The results of our experiment
   clearly demonstrated that herring have a strong photic zeitgeber acting
   upon vitellogenesis according to the experienced photoperiod. Thus, the
   Offset Group showed a displacement in vitellogenesis of 6 months. The
   second hypothesis that feeding opportunities play a clear role in
   assisting this photic zeitgeber in Atlantic herring could be rejected.
   This clarification supports that the survival potential of the larvae is
   the main selection pressure in operation in these respects, i.e., rather
   than the extent of feeding opportunities of the adults.},

Title = {Frugivory and seed dispersal by the Red-footed Tortoise Chelonoidis
   carbonaria},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Seed dispersal by frugivores is essential in plant life cycles, with
   birds and mammals the principal and well studied dispersal agents.
   However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises
   could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems.
   The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is one of the largest
   terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large
   seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and
   their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed
   the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut
   retention time (GRT), and the post consumption germination capacity for
   tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to
   eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of
   23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four
   tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 \& PLUSMN; 4.81
   days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with
   females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be
   due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males.
   Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species
   used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than
   control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially
   important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large
   quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates.
   This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for
   large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs
   similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to
   defaunation processes.},

Title = {Epigeal fauna and edaphic properties as possible soil quality indicators
   in forest restoration areas in Espirito Santo, Brazil},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of soil quality indicators can indicate the efficiency of
   forest restoration practices. Litter, soil chemical attributes, and soil
   fauna can be used for this purpose since these factors are linked to
   each other in nutrient cycling and respond to changes in land use
   management. The present study aimed to identify accumulated litter
   biomass on topsoil, its nutrient concentration, composition of the
   epigeal fauna community, and topsoil chemical attributes as possible
   soil quality indicators in restoration areas of Atlantic Forest (T1, T2,
   and T3) with different levels of native tree seedlings richness (29, 58,
   and 114 species, respectively), pasture (T4), and native forest (T5,
   control), by three plots (50 x 50 m) in each area, in the municipality
   of Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Samples of accumulated litter on
   topsoil, topsoil (0-5 cm), and community of epigeal fauna (by pitfall
   traps) were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Accumulated
   litter biomass on the topsoil, concentration of K and Mg in its biomass,
   abundance of Coleoptera and Pseudoscorpionida, total N and exchangeable
   K concentrations in the topsoil were the most relevant soil quality
   indicators, according to the principal component analysis. In both
   climatic seasons, T5 presented high dissimilarity in relation to the
   other areas and best soil quality due to its association to higher
   values of accumulated litter biomass, its nutrient concentration (N, K,
   Ca, Mg, S), relative frequency or abundance of Coleoptera,
   Pseudoscorpionida, and Others, concentrations of total organic carbon,
   total N, available P, exchangeable Ca, extractable acidity, sum of
   bases, and cation exchange capacity; T1, T2, and T3 were associated to
   higher values of relative frequency of Formicidae and presented low
   dissimilarity to each other; T4 was associated to higher values of pH.
   Therefore, the forest restoration areas have not yet contributed to the
   general quality of the soil approaching that observed in T5.},

Abstract = {A recent paper published in Trends in Ecology and Evolution suggested a
   new alternative for the reporting of statistical results, using a
   language based on evidence against the null hypothesis. I agree that the
   reporting of null hypothesis statistical testing clearly needs
   improvement, but the proposal of an evidence-based language has several
   drawbacks: a) it goes back to the original Fisherian continuous
   interpretation of p-values, b) at the same time uses some loose
   categorizations and, c) most importantly, it may provide a wrong idea of
   what p-values actually are. By saying that there is very strong, strong,
   moderate, weak or little evidence of an effect, the reader gets the idea
   that p-values are providing Bayesian-type information on the probability
   of the null hypothesis given our data. However, p-values are only
   providing information on the probability of having obtained our data (or
   more extreme data), under the trueness of the null hypothesis. That is
   why I suggest reporting results using a data probability-based language,
   together with a previous and separate specification of the magnitude of
   the effects.},

Title = {Pollination service and soybean yields},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soybean is the most important crop for Argentina in terms of cultivated
   area and annually exported tons. Although soybean is autogamous, crop
   yields can be enhanced by pollinators. The aim of this study is to
   analyze the effects of insect pollination on soybean production. A
   pollination exclusion experiment (15 replications) was conducted to
   analyze the effects on seed production per plant in three stands located
   in the adjacence to a 100 Ha forested park, which was considered the
   main potential source of wild pollinators to soybean flowers. Fruits and
   seeds produced per plant -controlled by vegetative growth-were compared
   between plants with flowers open to pollinators and fully-caged plants
   (with flowers excluded from pollinators). A control treatment for the
   shading effect of the cages used for pollinator exclusion was also
   performed. Pollination was estimated by pollen deposited on stigmas. The
   number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas of open-pollinated flowers
   was higher than that of excluded flowers (27.3 vs 6.9 pollen grains per
   stigma, respectively). Reproductive variables (\# of fruits and \# of
   seeds per plant; total yield per plant) showed lower values (13-25\% of
   reduction according to the variable) in excluded flowers compared to
   those from open-pollinated flowers. The contribution of biotic
   pollination to soybean production could be important because when
   pollinators are excluded pollen deposition and crop yields decrease. The
   soybean pollination service could be considered as part of the green
   infrastructure needed to maintain or to improve soybean yields.},

Title = {Prey interactions in tiger sharks: Accounting for visual perception in
   animal-borne cameras},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {553},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The `evolutionary arms race' between predator and prey is responsible
   for many physiological, morphological, and behavioural adaptations and
   some of the most compelling examples relate to the generation and
   detection of visual signals. Better understanding of adaptations can
   arise from approaching predator-prey dynamics from the point of view of
   the animals themselves, such as through animal-borne cameras. As we
   learn more about an animal's visual system, we can take this further and
   analyse visual scenes through their eyes. In this study video cameras
   mounted on tiger sharks were used to analyse motion cues of sea turtles
   using two-dimensional motion detector (2DMD) models. Sharks were also
   equipped with tri-axial motion-sensors to compare visual motion cues to
   behaviour, using the behavioural metrics of overall dynamic body
   acceleration (ODBA), path tortuosity, tailbeat frequency and tailbeat
   acceleration signal amplitude. When comparing the behaviours of sharks
   in the minute before and after interactions with sea turtles, we found
   lower ODBA of sharks associated with sea turtles that produced greater
   visual motion cues. These turtles also invoked swimming by sharks that
   was more tortuous than when no turtle was encountered. Together, these
   behaviours suggest that tiger sharks may potentially stalking turtles
   that produced greater motion cues. Many sea turtles did not stand out
   from the background motion suggesting they remain motionless as a form
   of camouflage. This study provides insights into the use of visual cues
   in prey identification by tiger sharks and the camouflage strategies
   used by sea turtles to avoid predation.},

Abstract = {Carex meyeriana lowland meadow is one of the most important grassland
   compositions in Hulun Buir and Northeastern China, until now,
   substantial part of C. meyeriana meadow in Hulun Buir has been degraded
   due to overgrazing. In order to clarify the effects of overgrazing on
   plant communities, soil physicochemical properties and microorganisms of
   C. meyeriana meadow, long-term unused and overgrazing C. meyeriana
   meadow were selected as research objects. The important value of C.
   meyeriana and soil physicochemical properties were determined, and soil
   microbes were measured by high-throughput sequencing techniques. The
   results showed that long-term overgrazing would lead to increasing plant
   diversity, but the advantage of C. meyeriana, soil organic matter and
   total nitrogen content were significantly reduced. At the same time, the
   differences in community diversity of soil bacteria from 0 to 30 cm
   tended to decrease, while fungal tend to heterogeneity, and fungal
   communities occupied a dominant position in the change of
   microorganisms. In addition, metagenomics sequencing results showed that
   overgrazing mainly affected the functional genes of bacteria, most of
   the dif-ferential genes were related to the energy cycle and metabolism,
   but had no impact on the normal function of soil carbon and nitrogen
   cycles.},

Abstract = {In this study, we focused on the effects of microclimatic, climatic, and
   anthropogenic factors on culturable microfungal communities in the soil
   of the north-facing slope (NFS) and the south-facing slope (SFS) at the
   Metzar ``Evolution Canyon{''} in the Golan Heights, Israel. Using the
   soil dilution plate method, 94 species from 47 genera were isolated. The
   communities' composition was subjected to pronounced interslope
   variations in both summer and winter. Whereas xerotolerant
   melanin-containing species and thermotolerant Aspergillus spp.
   pre-dominated in the SFS soil, peaking in the summer, mesophilic
   Penicillium spp. were especially abundant in the NFS soil. The
   quantitative parameter-density of microfungal isolates-exhibited the
   strongest seasonal varia-tions, showing that it was the most sensitive
   to the fluctuation in soil temperature and moisture. Comparison of
   microfungal communities in the currently recovered and previously
   disturbed SFS soil showed that intensive pasturage followed by soil
   degradation led to the simplification of communities, decreased their
   diversity level, and resulted in the prevalence of species with
   different ecological preferences. Comparison of the native NFS
   communities isolated in the summers of 2002 and 2019 revealed changes in
   the community structure, which could be related to global warming. These
   changes were associated with stress-tolerant fungal traits, which may be
   useful under increasing soil temperature and desiccation.},

Title = {Invasion in the riparian zone: What is the effect of Pteridium
   arachnoideum on topsoil permeability?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pteridium arachnoideum is a cosmopolitan, allelopathic, pervasive
   species which is expanding its occurrence in many regions of the
   tropics. Yet, the ecohydrological effects of such colonization is
   virtually unknown especially when it occurs in riparian zones which are
   expected to perform many important ecosystem services. The objective of
   the present study was to evaluate the influence of Pteridium
   colonization on topsoil permeability in riparian zones. To do that, we
   selected two similar riparian zones: (i) dominated by Pteridium
   arachnoideum and (ii) under tropical forest. We performed infiltration,
   water repellency (dry and wet season) and penetration resistance
   measurements to evaluate soil permeability. The infiltration capacity
   was significantly lower in Pteridium compared to riparian forest. We
   attribute this reduction to the significant increase in both water
   repellency in the dry season and soil penetration resistance in the soil
   under Pteridium. Water repellency, though still present in the wet
   season in both riparian zones, had no significant difference. Our
   results show that, despite the loss of biodiversity with Pteridium
   invasion, water repellency has a clear reduction in the wet season which
   likely benefits infiltration. Thus, basic hydrological ecosystem
   services can probably still be provided by such invaded riparian zones.},

   habitat types, water availability, and elevation},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Understanding the patterns and drivers of species assemblages is the
   central tenet of community ecology and this may inform effective
   conservation and management strategies. Such information is scarce in
   tropical regions, particularly the Palawan faunal region and island
   group in the western Philippines. Here we examined the patterns of
   anuran richness and identified correlations in species co-occurrences
   and their shared responses to habitat types, water availability, and
   elevation. We sampled anuran populations using standardized transects
   established across Palawan's major islands between 2013 and 2019. We
   generated interpolated and extrapolated richness using Hill numbers. To
   investigate species co-occurrences and the relative importance of
   environmental variables, we used Joint Species Distribution Model
   (JSDM). A total of 18 anuran species were recorded, including seven
   non-endemic and 11 species restricted to Palawan. Anuran richness was
   highest in forests habitats than in cultivated land areas. Sites with
   water sources had higher anuran richness than those without water.
   Species richness observed along elevational gradient exhibited a
   hump-shaped pattern. Significant positive correlations in species
   co-occurrences were found among aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Anuran
   species showed tight associations with elevation and water availability,
   indicating that these variables are strong predictors of anuran
   co-occurrences. Finally, this study broadens our understanding of the
   differences and similarities in habitat requirements among anuran
   species, highlighting the need to consider such information when
   developing conservation strategies other than the traditional
   vulnerability and irreplaceability measures.},

Abstract = {Functional diversity and species diversity provide information to
   understand differences between plant communities from a contrasting
   environment and the complementary on regional scale. Environmental
   variation determines which plants can persist in the community via
   species sorting processes; forest exposed to extended inundation each
   year has shown divergence in plant community composition, structure, and
   functional diversity, compared with unflooded dense forest. Here, we
   researched flooded and unflooded forests in the upper Magdalena River
   Valley (Colombia) to quantify and compare the plant species diversity
   and plant functional diversity. We calculated three components of
   functional diversity (i.e., functional richness, functional evenness,
   and functional divergence), we also used a measure of functional
   richness weighted by species abundance. Our results show that the plant
   community in the unflooded forest has higher stem density and lower
   basal area than flooded forests. Also, we show that tree communities in
   the flooded forests had higher specific leaf area, but lower wood
   density, suggesting an acquisitive resource strategy. Species diversity
   and functional diversity were higher in the plant community from the
   unflooded forest. Our findings of the functional traits and the
   functional diversity components reinforce the idea that the variation
   between flooded and unflooded forests is going beyond the species list
   in the plant communities. However, it is still unclear whether any
   general patterns exist regarding differences between flooded and
   unflooded tropical forests.},

Title = {Prevalence of stochastic processes in the fire-mediated reassemblage of
   the soil arthropod community of a pine forest},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {115},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wildfires are significant disruptors of established communities, but
   natural fire regimens are essential to sustaining biodiversity in
   fire-prone ecosystems. Besides plants, soil arthropods are highly
   affected by wildfires, but their communities are also highly resilient
   to such catastrophic events. It is known that both stochastic (local
   extinction, dispersion, and colonization probabilities) and
   deterministic (environmental and biotic filters) processes take part in
   the reassembly of biotic communities after wildfires. However, the
   contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes in reassembling
   soil arthropod communities after wildfires remains unclear, and it is
   largely unknown how this is affected by fire severity. This study
   reports on the trophic guilds, taxa composition, and alpha and beta
   diversity partitioning of a soil arthropod community over one year,
   considering unburnt forest and two levels of fire severity in a pine
   forest in the eastern mountainous region of Mexico. The wildfire had a
   positive effect on the abundance of saprophagous species, especially in
   moderate-fire severity sites. Overall, the diversity of the community of
   soil arthropods has increased over time since the fire. Taxa turnover
   contributed beyond random expectations to the observed beta diversity,
   suggesting that stochastic processes predominated in the reassemblage of
   the soil arthropod community. We conclude that the changes in the alpha
   and beta diversity of the postfire soil arthropod community were
   affected by the severity of the wildfire and by the time that had passed
   since the fire event, showing a capacity for recovery to this type of
   disturbance.},

Title = {Demography of the dominant perennial grass species of a humid African
   savanna},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Perennial grasses are the main source of fuel during fires in savannas.
   The demography of these grasses likely varies between species although
   they have the same general architecture and coexist in savannas.
   However, very few studies compare their demography. Similarly, their
   demography likely varies between years because of the variability in
   weather condition and fire intensity. We described and compared the
   demography and life-cycle of the four dominant perennial grass species
   (Andropogon canaliculatus, Andropogon schirensis, Hyparrhenia diplandra
   and Loudetia simplex) of the Lamto savanna (Ivory Coast) and assessed
   the influence of their demographic features (stasis, fecundity, growth,
   fragmentation and retrogression) on this demography. Grass species were
   monitored over three consecutive years (2015-2016, 2016-2017 and
   2017-2018) on three 5 m x 10 m plots. We used a size-classified matrix
   model with 5 circumference classes (3-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-35 cm, 35-50
   cm and >50 cm). Results showed differences in the age-based parameters,
   asymptotic growth rates (lambda s) and elasticities of the lambda s of
   the grass species. The population of A. canaliculatus, A. schirensis and
   H. diplandra were slowly declining while L. simplex was significantly
   declining. There were noticeable year-to-year variations in the
   demography of these four species. The most important demographic
   parameter influencing As was the stasis in all species, while
   retrogression and fragmentation contributed to a relative homogeneity of
   ages between size-classes 2 to 5. This study provides new insights about
   the demography of Guinean savanna grasses that could be used to describe
   the mechanisms of their coexistence, and inform fire management
   policies.},

Title = {Patterns of guanaco distribution and microhabitat use in Tierra del
   Fuego: From protected to sheep ranching areas},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Wild herbivore distribution responds to habitat and forage availability
   modulated by predation risk and inter-specific interactions. Nowadays,
   the study of distribution and abundance of wild and domestic herbivores
   have regained importance to understand and diminish conservation
   conflicts in productive lands worldwide. Contiguous ranching and
   protected areas have created conflicting scenarios when wild ungulate
   populations increase and redistribute in livestock rangelands, because
   of competition for food and disease transmission. Consequently,
   understanding wild ungulate distribution and density patterns is
   critical to inform efficient management strategies for livestock grazing
   and wild ungulate coexistence. Here we analyze guanaco (Lama guanicoe)
   density and distribution, and compare habitat and microhabitat use
   (plant biomass, species richness, and diversity) in a protected area and
   in surrounding sheep ranches of Tierra del Fuego. Density of guanaco was
   similar between protected area and ranches, but proportion of groups and
   average group size were larger on ranches, and total guanaco density was
   also higher outside than within the protected area, which contrasts with
   previous studies. Use of microhabitat features was also different
   between both management regimes. Guanaco used areas with higher
   vegetation biomass, plant composition and richness in the protected area
   than on ranches. These results suggest that both intrinsic
   (socio-biological) and extrinsic (forage availability and human
   distur-bance) factors influence density and distribution patterns as
   well as microhabitat use by the guanaco, which have large implications
   for its conservation.},

   consumers of algae and other prey in benthic ecosystems worldwide. In
   the Gal ` apagos rocky subtidal zone, sea stars are abundant and
   diverse, but their distribution, feeding habits and ecological impacts
   have received little attention. We compared diets and distributions of
   the six most abundant sea star species to examine their functional
   roles. Bi-annual censuses carried out between 2006 and 2014 at two
   depths (6-8 m, 12-15 m) at 12 sites in Gal ` apagos identified two
   abundance ``hotspots{''} and revealed higher densities at locations with
   more heterogeneous benthic topographies. Field surveys showed a high
   incidence of feeding (35-68\% of individuals across species) and
   distinct diets were evident for each species in terms of food items and
   dietary breadth, suggesting niche partitioning. Most species can be
   classified as facultative herbivores, with diets dominated by crustose
   and turf algae supplemented by a small proportion of sessile
   invertebrates. The two most abundant species, Pentaceraster cumingi and
   Nidorellia armata, had the narrowest diets. Field prey selectivity
   experiments identified P. cumingi as a size-selective predator of small
   pencil urchins Eucidaris galapagensis. In field caging experiments, N.
   armata reduced biomass of unbleached crustose coralline algae by 72\%.
   In the context of emerging threats such as disease, ocean acidification
   and climate change, a deeper understanding of the distinct functional
   roles of sea stars can inform ecological models and management plans.},

Title = {Mangrove macroalgae increase their growth under ocean acidification: A
   study with Bostrychia (Rhodophyta) haplotypes from different
   biogeographic provinces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Increasing oceanic CO2 has caused a decrease in oceanic pH, a process
   termed ocean acidification (OA). OA may benefit fleshy macroalgae due to
   the increased availability of inorganic carbon sources for
   photosynthesis since they are tolerant of decreases in pH. In this
   study, we analyzed multiple physiological responses of Bostrychia
   montagnei and Bostrychia calliptera from two biogeographic provinces of
   Brazil (Tropical Southwestern Atlantic {[}TSA] and Warm Temperate
   Southwestern Atlantic {[}WTSA]) after culturing them at a set of
   bioreactors in three pH levels (7.2, 7.6, and 8.0). Two pH were
   decreased by CO2 enrichment into the culture medium. Molecular analyses
   using plastidial (rbcL-3P) and mitochondrial (COI-5P) DNA markers were
   also performed to identify genetic divergences between macroalgae from
   TSA and WTSA. Molecular evidence of COI-5P marker demonstrated that the
   specimens of both B. montagnei and B. calliptera from TSA and WTSA
   constitute different haplotypes, with a strong segregation between them.
   Macroalgae from both localities increased their growth in treatments of
   decreased pH with increased CO2 availability. Overall, physiological
   responses of the algae were not negatively affected by decreased pH. B.
   montagnei from TSA increased its polysaccharide and allophycocyanin
   content at pH 7.2, and B. montagnei from WTSA increased its low
   molecular weight carbohydrate content at pH 7.2 as well. Antioxidant
   activity - a proxy for physiological stress - was not affected by
   decreased pH. Our study indicates that haplotypes of B. montagnei and B.
   calliptera from TSA and WTSA can be relevant to CO2 sequestration in
   mangroves once they are tolerant of decreased pH and increase their
   growth under increased CO2 availability.},

Title = {Fussy eaters, bait loss and escapees: How reliable are baited-hook
   assessments of shark abundance in shallow, coastal waters?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sets of baited hooks decrease in fishing efficacy over time as catch
   accumulates and bait is lost, and this complicates the quantification of
   fishing effort for species abundance calculations. Although hook-timers
   facilitate a more accurate estimation of fishing time, they cannot
   provide taxonomic information in the case of escapees or bait loss, nor
   can they provide information on animals that approach the gear but do
   not physically engage with it. To overcome these limitations, the
   present study attached sport action cameras to baited drumlines during a
   catch-and-release survey of sharks in the shallow, coastal waters of the
   eastern Caicos Bank, Turks and Caicos Islands. Overall, the true fishing
   time was found to be appreciably less than the apparent fishing time and
   more sharks approached or interacted with the gear than were
   successfully captured by it. Furthermore, shark-gear interactions varied
   by species while the amount of bait loss differed between deployment
   areas. Taken together, these findings suggest that baited-hook surveys
   underestimate shark abundance and that the magnitude of this error
   varies by species and habitat type.},

Title = {Body colourations affect predation risk from fish in fiddler crabs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many animals show conspicuous colour patterns that inform potential
   predators about their unprofitability due to their toxicity or
   unpalatability (aposematism). However, no systematic work has evaluated
   the colouration of crabs in terms of aposematism, even though many
   species exhibit conspicuous colouration. We conducted a laboratory study
   to compare predation risk from a fish predator, the barred mudskipper
   (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), in two sympatric fiddler crab species
   with different body colour patterns: Austruca perplexa with
   brownish-white colourations and Paraleptuca crassipes with red-and-black
   colour patterns. Fiddler crabs and mudskippers are active on tidal flats
   during low tides. A predation trial by stocking one crab and one
   mudskipper in a test arena was repeated five times for each species-sex
   combination. The animal behaviour was video recorded for 24 h, and crabs
   were confirmed to be alive or dead after 72 h. A. perplexa females were
   most vulnerable to predation from mudskippers. The attack intensity from
   mudskippers was stronger during the nighttime than daytime against P.
   crassipes females and males and A. perplexa males, suggesting that
   mudskippers may avoid them by visually detecting the body colouration in
   P. crassipes and the body structure in males of both species (i.e. a
   large weaponry claw) during the daytime. Mudskippers eventually preyed
   on and consumed some individuals in both species-sexes. Mudskippers are
   known to shift their main food components from small crustaceans through
   polychaete worms to crabs, such as fiddler crabs, and unpalatable
   polychaete worms tend to be brightly coloured. We suggest that the red
   colouration of P. crassipes may be incidental mimicry of the unpalatable
   red/orange-coloured polychaete worms that mudskippers might have learned
   to avoid.},

Title = {Impact of a macrofaunal ecosystem engineer on its assemblage and its
   habitat in mixed sediments as assessed through manipulative experiments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ecosystem engineers can modify the environment, affecting the associated
   community. Studies of mussels as ecosystem engineers have been conducted
   mostly in the rocky intertidal zone, while those in sedimentary
   intertidals have been relatively scarce. The present study assessed the
   effect of varying densities of Brachidontes rodriguezii on local
   environmental variables (substrate weight, water content, organic
   matter, weight of sediments adhering to mussel byssus) and ecological
   attributes of the associated community (richness, abundance, diversity,
   evenness, and assemblage structure) at different intertidal levels,
   sites, and seasons, in a mixed sediment intertidal region in San Antonio
   Bay (Patagonia, Argentina). We performed two independent manipulative
   field experiments at low and mid intertidal levels at two sites-Punta
   Verde (PV), with relatively higher current velocities and coarser grain
   sizes than Punta Delgado (PD)-in both winter and summer. Manipulative
   experiments consisted in reducing mussel density to 50\% in the low
   intertidal and increasing that density to up to 100\% in the mid zone.
   We hypothesized that local environmental variables and ecological
   attributes associated with B. rodriguezii depended on mussel density.
   The reduction in B. rodriguezii density increased the evenness and
   reduced the abundance at PD plus reduced the richness at PV. Also, when
   reducing mussel density, the assemblage structure differed in water
   content and organic matter at both sites between treatments and seasons.
   The sediment weight adhering to mussel byssus in PD and substrate weight
   in PV were the best descriptors of the assemblages. The increase in
   mussel density, however, produced a weak effect on the ecological
   attributes of the community, and the assemblage structure did not
   correlate with the environmental variables considered. Our results
   demonstrated a stronger engineering effect of B. rodriguezii at reduced,
   but not increased, mussel density. This study revealed that the
   ecological attributes associated with B. rodriguezii both were
   density-dependent and varied with sites along the year in mixed-sediment
   intertidal zones.},

Title = {Spatial isolation impacts pollinator visitation and reproductive success
   of a threatened self-incompatible Mediterranean tree},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pollination service is crucial to achieve successful plant sexual
   reproduction and long-term population persistence. This pollination
   service can be affected by plant conspecific density and also by
   intrinsic features of individuals related to their flowering phenology
   and floral display. However, studies examining intrinsic and extrinsic
   traits on pollinator visitation and reproductive success of
   Mediterranean trees with limited reproduction are still scarce. We
   analyzed the effects of plant isolation, flowering phenology, flower
   weight and tree size on flower visitation probability, flowering patch
   visitation probability, fruit set and crop size. To this end, we
   intensively monitored pollinator visitation and fruit production of 67
   (in 2019) and 73 (in 2020) Pyrus bourgaeana Decne trees within a
   threatened Mediterranean population. Our results revealed that isolated
   individuals received more pollinators than those on conspecific
   aggregations, suggesting intraspecific competition for pollinators in
   dense flowering neighborhoods. However, fruit set was higher in trees
   close to flowering conspecifics despite having fewer visits from
   pollinators, suggesting pollen limitation but not pollinator limitation
   in spatially isolated trees. Interestingly, we found increased crop
   sizes in spatially isolated trees which could be related to reduced
   intraspecific competition for resources in low-density neighborhoods
   (water, nutrients) and/or to higher reproductive investment (i.e. higher
   flower production). Overall, our results indicated pollen but not
   pollinator limitation in spatially isolated trees. Under this scenario
   of sexual reproduction mediated by pollinators, our findings stress the
   relevance of individuals' spatial distribution for self-incompatible
   trees exhibiting low individuals' densities.},

Title = {Subindividual variation accounts for most of the variability in two

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence of within species flower trait variability.
   In Cistus ladanifer, there is a great variation in the number of locules
   of the ovary (6-12). In this study, we assessed the variation in the
   number of ovary locules and ovule production at population, individual
   and intraindividual levels in 5 localities in the Madrid Region (Central
   Spain). We have answered the following questions: What level present
   larger variation? Is there a relationship between the number of ovary
   locules and ovule production? And if yes, does it hold across all
   levels? We sampled almost 500 flowers from 50 individuals for five
   localities. We counted the number of locules of the ovary and estimate
   the number of ovules per flower. The partitioning of total variation
   among populations, individuals and within-individuals was estimated for
   both variables. To analyze differences among locations, we performed
   general linear models. We found that within-individual variation was the
   main source of variation for all measured variables. Inter-individual
   variation was relevant only for the number of locules, and inter
   -population variation was almost negligible for all variables. Despite
   the positive correlation between the num-ber of locules per flower and
   ovule production, populations with more locules did not present more
   ovules per flower. In summary, we found that variation in the number of
   locules and its relationship with ovule production is scale dependent.},

Title = {Ocean acidification modifies behaviour of shelf seabed macrofauna: A
   laboratory study on two ecosystem engineers, Abra alba and Lanice
   conchilega},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The feeding activity and burrow ventilation by benthic invertebrates
   importantly affect the biodiversity and functioning of seafloor
   sediments. Here we investigated how ocean acidification can modify these
   behavioural activities in two common and abundant macrofaunal ecosystem
   engineering species in temperate continental shelf communities: the
   white furrow shell Abra alba and the sand mason Lanice conchilega. Using
   time-lapse imagery and sediment porewater hydraulic signatures we show
   that both species adapt their behaviour in response to predicted future
   pH conditions (-0.3 units). During a three-week laboratory experiment,
   A. alba reduced the duration per feeding event when suspension and
   deposit feeding (by 86 and 53\%, respectively), and almost completely
   ceased suspension feeding under reduced seawater pH in comparison to
   ambient seawater pH (pH similar to 8.2). This behavioural change reduces
   the intake of low pH water during feeding and respiration. L. conchilega
   increased its piston-pumping frequency by 30 and 52\%, respectively,
   after one and two weeks of exposure to future pH conditions (-0.3 units)
   relative to ambient conditions. This change in irrigation activity
   suggests higher metabolic demands under low seawater pH, and also
   extended low water column pH conditions deeper into the seafloor.
   Because the distribution of other populations depends on the
   physicochemical setting by our focal species, we argue that the
   demonstrated behavioural plasticity will likely have cascading effects
   on seafloor diversity and functioning, highlighting the complexity of
   how ocean acidification, and climate change in general, will affect
   seafloor ecology.},

Title = {The ontogeny of at-sea behaviour in male southern elephant seals
   (Mirounga leonina) at Marion Island},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Megafauna, such as southern elephant seals (SESs) (Mirounga leonina,
   Linn.), forage in diverse, seemingly lim-itless habitats. In pelagic
   settings, their behaviour is more likely to be limited by physiological
   ability and prey distribution, than physical barriers. For elephant
   seals, their rapid growth in body size corresponds to changing
   physiological abilities. These changes are most pronounced for male
   elephant seals. While most studies have compared male and female SESs in
   terms of changing body size and physiological ability, few studies have
   compared the influence of changing body size on behaviour of male SESs
   from the same population using long term satellite tracking data. We
   describe age-related differences in movement and diving behaviour for
   male SESs from Marion Island. We analysed satellite tracking data
   collected from 23 male SESs seals fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit
   Satellite Relay Data Loggers at Marion Island between 2005 and 2011.
   Each dive was assigned a behavioural mode, either `searching' or
   `transit', using state-space modelling. We used mixed-effects models to
   quantify the influence of age and behavioural mode on dive duration,
   surface duration, dive depth and number of daily dives. Younger seals
   travelled significantly further from Marion Island and spent most of
   their dives in transit mode, whereas older seals stayed closer to the
   island but were in searching mode for most of their tracks. When
   searching, older seals dived more frequently, displayed longer dive and
   surface durations, and reached greater depths than younger seals. These
   differences in diving behaviour seem to reflect changing physiological
   ability. For male SESs, changes in physiological ability necessitate
   behavioural plasticity, which may be the key to survival and future
   breeding success. Robust males are more likely to breed and must
   therefore, maintain their body size by adapting to local oceanic
   conditions.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal patterns of earthworm abundance suggest time-limited
   food availability for a subalpine bird species},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Changes in food availability may act as a major mechanism by which
   global change impacts populations of birds, especially in seasonal
   environments at high elevations or latitudes. Systematic sampling of
   invertebrates, which constitute the diet of many bird species during the
   breeding season, is however largely missing in mountain ecosystems and
   is overall very rare for soil-dwelling species or stages. Here, we
   repeatedly sampled earthworms (Lumbricidae), the staple prey of the Ring
   Ouzel Turdus torquatus, over a whole breeding season in a study area in
   the Swiss Alps. Our main goal was to finely characterise spatio-temporal
   patterns of food availability for this declining bird species, in
   relation to elevation, habitat type and snowmelt stage. In 24 sampling
   plots, we extracted two soil cores every week for 6-10 weeks and
   hand-sorted soil invertebrates separately for two 5-cm soil layers. We
   then analysed the abundance of earthworms in those two layers in
   relation to various environmental parameters. We show that within our
   study area, edaphic and topographical parameters are poor predictors of
   the mean abundance of earthworms over the breeding season. Ground
   vegetation cover and soil moisture, however, are suitable predictors for
   the number of earthworms within the soil profile at each sampling time,
   i.e., of their availability for Ring Ouzels. Moreover, we provide
   evidence for a clear seasonal peak in earthworm availability, which was
   more pronounced in open grasslands compared to forested areas and
   happened later in the season where snow lingered. This study, by
   improving our understanding of the factors driving food availability for
   a mountain bird species, provides insights into how shifts in land-use
   and climate might lead to altered predator-prey interactions.},

Title = {Ghost crab predation of loggerhead turtle eggs across thermal habitats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {551},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The reproductive success of sea turtles is highly influenced by the
   environmental and biological conditions of the nesting beach. Maio
   Island, Cabo Verde, one of the main nesting sites for the Northeast
   Atlantic loggerhead subpopulation, displays marked heterogeneity of sand
   coloration, with dark, mixed and light sandy beaches, resulting in
   different thermal habitats. Considering that sand temperature can
   influence both sea turtle embryo development and predatory activity by
   ghost crabs - the main predators of clutches and hatchlings at Cabo
   Verde - we surveyed loggerhead nesting beaches at Maio Island, with
   three sand colorations ('beach type'), to assess: 1) the density and
   size of ghost crab burrows, as a proxy for ghost crab density and size,
   and 2) ghost crab predation on 70 loggerhead nests. We further assessed
   nest site selection, by considering the number of nesting activities and
   clutches laid across beach type. There were no evident trends in the
   distributions of ghost crab density and size between years or beach
   type. We found that ghost crab predation is a major source of mortality
   in Maio Island, affecting 67.8\% (n = 59) of the nests. Ghost crab
   predation was variable between beaches, but generally, at the warmer
   dark sand beaches, clutch mortality was mostly caused by ghost crab
   predation (53.2\%, n = 17), while at the mixed sand beaches mortality by
   predation was low (7.5\%, n = 18), compared to mortality due to other
   causes (49.9\%), indicating that other factors can also significantly
   impact clutch survival. The mixed sand beaches had more nesting
   activities and higher nest density (2.29/m(2); 1.25/m(2), respectively),
   compared to the light sand (0.72/m(2); 0.35/m(2)) and the dark sand
   beaches (0.73/m(2); 0.27/m(2)), suggesting a possible predation-free
   nesting preference. Our findings show that some beaches are in need of
   nest protection, thus we recommend both in situ nest protection and egg
   translocation to safe hatcheries, depending on the threats identified,
   to enhance clutch survival at such heterogeneous nesting areas as Maio
   Island.},

   chromatography with an electroantennographic detector (GC-EAD) analysis,
   the stereochemistry of the bioactive compound was identified to be 3R,
   whereas (3S)-TXIB showed no activity. The inactive enantiomer did not
   inhibit the activity of commercially available TXIB, which was a racemic
   mixture. When the female moth was placed on the TXIB-treated fruits in
   the oviposition assay, she repeated grooming antennae. The reason why
   the moth detects this artificial compound is unknown, although the
   stereochemical structure of TXIB could have given an abnormality to the
   moth's antennae.},

Title = {Constraints in using relative biomass as a measure of competitive
   success in phytoplankton - A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {`The plankton paradox' view which contradicted competitive exclusion
   principle has been changing since the last decade. Current outlook based
   on the evidence from size scaling studies suggests that in a given
   nutrient regime, phytoplankton that are capable of efficient nutrient
   intake increases in biomass, perhaps leading to the exclusion of those
   with inefficient nutrient intake ability. Commonly observed higher
   biomass of larger cells (e.g., diatoms and dianoflagellates) in
   eutrophic environment and that of smaller cells (e.g.,picophytoplankton)
   in oligotrophic environment has been viewed as the competitive success
   of higher and lower size strata in respective nutrient gradients. We
   analyse the above view point sceptically, and share the opinion as
   follows. Conventional approach of using relative biomass as a measure of
   competitive success in phytoplankton could lead to underestimate the
   ecological success of smaller phytoplankton in eutrophic and mesotrophic
   waters. We also suggest that pico-phytoplankton that require very low
   nutrient quota can co-exist with larger cells by sharing a negligible
   part of the community niche, without exerting competition related
   pressure, irrespective of the nutrient status of the system. Similarly,
   large cells that are confined to the nutrient rich waters, can avoid
   competition with smaller algae by their exceptional nutrient storage
   ability. Consequently, there is a limitation in using relative biomass
   as a measure of competitive success in phytoplankton community. We also
   emphasis that in aquatic microbial world where all interactions occur at
   cellular level, difference in particle size could provide an additional
   mechanism to prevent competitive exclusion by facilitating resource
   partitioning and selective predation pressure.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Otoliths are very useful biomarkers especially for fish growth. Climate
   change with the associated global changes in warming and acidification
   could affect the calcification and the shape of otoliths during the
   crucial larval period in teleost fish. To evaluate this predicted
   combined effect of temperature and CO2, Atlantic herring (Clupea
   harengus) embryos and larvae were reared from hatching to respectively
   47 and 60 days post-hatching (dph), under present day conditions and a
   scenario predicted for the year 2100 (IPCC RCP8.5). Otolith
   morphogenesis was tracked by analyzing area and normalized Elliptical
   Fourier coefficients. We found that otolith area for fish of similar
   size increased under the predicted 2100 climate change scenario compared
   to the present day. Climate change does not, however, seem to directly
   affect the otolith shape. Finally, the onset of otolith morphogenesis is
   hardwired, but the relationship between otolith and fish size is
   environment-dependent.},

Title = {Rehabilitation promotes rapid recovery of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   in iron mining areas},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform important ecological
   functions in the rehabilitation of degraded areas, acting through
   several mechanisms, such as the production of glomalin-related soil
   proteins (glomalin), which act as cementing agents and nutritional
   reserves and sequester carbon in soil. The aim of the present study was
   to determine whether a short rehabilitation time influenced the soil AMF
   community diversity and glomalin production in areas undergoing
   rehabilitation after iron mining. We analyzed the number of spores,
   mycorrhizal colonization, AMF species richness, and concentrations of
   easily extractable and total glomalin-related soil proteins. Species
   richness was reduced by approximately 50 \% after mining activity.
   However, after the initial rehabilitation of degraded areas, we observed
   an increase in the number of spores, colonization, and AMF species.
   Families Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae were considered dominant in the
   studied areas. Glomus sp.1 and Acaulospora mellea were the most frequent
   morphotypes. The relationship between glomalin and the levels of
   dissolved organic carbon, total carbon, and total nitrogen in the soil
   was found to be an interesting and easily interpretable parameter of the
   influence of AMF on the storage of organic matter in the soil,
   indicating the degree of equilibrium and/or recovery of revegetated
   environments. Rehabilitation, even in early stages, favored
   im-provements in AMF status and provided increases in total
   glomalin-related soil protein production, which may have contributed to
   the enrichment of carbon and nitrogen in the soil. These characteristics
   are indicative of the success of the rehabilitation actions carried out
   in these areas after mining activity.},

Title = {Effects of phylogeny, traits, and seasonality on invertebrate herbivory
   damage in a meadow community},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invertebrate herbivory affects the composition of meadow communities by
   differentially decreasing the fitness of individual species. The ability
   of individual species to resist herbivore pressure depends on their
   traits, which are often phylogenetically structured, and changes
   seasonally. We conducted a field study assessing invertebrate herbivory
   damage of 17 selected plant species in an oligotrophic wet meadow,
   aiming to assess the effect of functional traits, specifically leaf dry
   matter content (LDMC), carbon content (C), nitrogen content (N),
   carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N), specific leaf area (SLA), and plant height
   on invertebrate herbivory damage, while taking into account seasonal
   dynamics of herbivory and phylogenetic relationships of studied species.
   Herbivory damage was different among individual species, with the
   biggest distinction between monocots and dicots. Herbivory was best
   predicted by LDMC, season, and interaction of height with season. After
   filtering the effect of common evolutionary history from the model, the
   effect of C, height, and interaction of C with season became
   significant. LDMC was the best trait predictor in both models. Unique
   relative contributions of phylogeny and traits to the model explained
   variability were 15.4\% and 33.9\%, respectively (with phylogeny using 3
   and traits 6 df), with their substantial overlap (35.7\%) emphasizing
   that traits are considerably phylogenetically structured. The effect of
   seasonality was rather minor (15\%). In this study, we point out to the
   strong interplay between traits, evolutionary history, and seasonal
   changes influencing herbivory damage and stress the importance of
   phylogenetic context when evaluating the effect of plant characteristics
   in plant-herbivore interactions.},

Title = {Environmental factors controlling structure, litter productivity, and
   phenology of mangroves in arid region of the Gulf of California},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems permanently contributing,
   through their litter productivity, with organic material into the
   superior trophic compartments. This research took place in three coastal
   lagoons on the southeast coast of the Gulf of California. The objective
   is to describe environmental factors controlling structure,
   phenological, and litter productivity in arid zone mangruves. The study
   sites were established along a latitudinal arid climate gradient, were
   evaporation (-3000 mm year(-1)) exceeds precipitation (-300 mm
   year(-1)), and a microtidal regime predominates. The study period was
   from June 2018 to May 2019. Litter productivity was quantified using
   litter traps, while piezometer were used to monitor surface,
   interstitial, and groundwater physicochemical properties and the water
   level. The different mangrove species present in the study area are
   influenced by high interstitial salinity, due to scarce freshwater
   inputs, because precipitation runoff is limited to the monsoon
   (June-August). The flowering phenophase started before the monsoon and
   peaked during the monsoon season, propagules production was highest in
   september and peaked from august to october (highest water level). Air
   and water temperature in warmer months influenced flower and propagules
   production. Despite the harsh environmental conditions provide a
   suboptimal scenario for mangroves to grow, resulting in low structural
   development and low litter productivity (-4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1))
   influenced by temperature, and water properties (i.e. temperature,
   salinity and ORP), precipitation and flood pattern. An important
   highlight of this research is the triggered phenological response to
   temperature (air and water), therefore the importance of long-term
   monitoring of such processes and variables.},

Abstract = {The choice of a host and feeding site is particularly interesting in the
   case of species feeding on conifers, where the larvae usually have a
   choice of several age classes of needles. The subject of this research
   is to answer whether the larvae have a specific preference for a certain
   needle age class, as well as how such foraging decisions influence
   larval performance and overwintering. We present the results of food
   choice tests and the influence of food quality (different age classes of
   Scots pine Pinus sylvestris needles) on the performance and
   overwintering of Dendrolimus pini larvae. The obtained results indicate
   that larvae fed with the youngest needles have the highest performance;
   however, in the food choice tests, one year old needles were chosen
   significantly more often. It was also shown that feeding on one year old
   needles led to the best overwintering survival. Differences in the
   contents of elements and metabolites explained the cause of the worst
   food, the oldest needles, and also the differentiation between current
   year and one year old needles. Water content may be of key importance,
   which is lower in one year old needles than in current year needles; its
   lower content may elevate the concentration of cryoprotectant
   substances.},

Title = {Scale and representation of landscapes in mammal studies in Brazil},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {When studying landscapes, defining the scale implies gains and losses of
   information associated with the choices of resolution and extent needed
   to understand a given phenomenon. Whereas the local scale is able to
   provide a more accurate understanding of local dynamics, the global
   scale able to provide a broader understanding of regional dynamics, yet
   is more susceptible to suppressing certain localized elements. Is there
   a common approach to defining the scale and representation of landscapes
   when studying a specific group? Specifically, for mammalian landscape
   ecology studies in Brazil, what would this approach be? We carried out a
   literature review to examine how previous studies have addressed scale
   and landscape representations and discuss best practices based on
   Landscape Ecology concepts. We searched in Scopus and Scielo using the
   keywords: landscape, Brazil, and mammal in the titles, abstracts, and
   keywords sections. We analyzed every paper that was carried out at the
   landscape scale. From the 182 articles found and analyzed, only 24 of
   them justified why they had adopted the chosen scale. All 24 articles
   justified the spatial scale by explaining the spatial extent they had
   adopted, however, only three papers justified the adopted resolution.
   Moreover, among the 24 studies, only 13 covered heterogeneous
   landscapes. We found that the majority of landscape and mammal studies
   in Brazil do not justify their choice of scale and landscape
   representation. This can lead to misinterpretations and omissions about
   events, such as habitat movement, that are not noticeable in the chosen
   scale. The systematic directions presented here can serve as a guide to
   appropriate landscape scale and representation choices in future studies
   on landscape ecology.},

Title = {Short-term modifications of mycorrhizal fungi, glomalin and soil
   attributes in a tropical agroforestry},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community and the Glomalin-related
   soil protein (GRSP) they produce plays important roles in maintaining
   soil ecosystem functions, promoting ecological restoration, and are
   important for monitoring changes in soil health from land use change.
   This research addressed the subtle modifications of AMF and GRSP in
   different land use types and their association with soil properties. Our
   objectives were: 1) to assess land use effects on AMF spore density,
   diversity, and composition besides glomalin fractions (EEG, easily
   extracted GRSP; TG, total GRSP), and 2) to quantify the relationships
   between glomalin, AMF community metrics, soil organic carbon (SOC), and
   key soil quality parameters. Soils were collected in the dry and rainy
   seasons of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of
   agroforestry systems (AS1, A52 and A53), an unmanaged pasture and a
   secondary forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Linear
   mixed-effects model and multivariate analyses showed that land uses had
   influenced the AMF community, meanly at the family level. On the other
   hand, seasonality has not proved to be an essential factor that
   modulates the changes of the AMF community and glomalin production. The
   management practices had influenced AMF sporulation and the number of
   total species in agroforestry systems. Glomalin is a potential
   contributor for SOC, mainly in agroforestry systems and pasture plots.
   Moreover, we found a correlation between the AMF community and key soil
   parameters. For example, most of the AMF families and spore density were
   positively correlated with the stability of soil aggregates and SOC. Our
   findings shed light on that land-use change can shift the AMF community,
   glomalin and their relationship to key soil quality parameters.
   Moreover, the adoption of agroforestry systems indicates maintenance of
   biodiversity and other soil quality parameters with future implications
   for their use to recover degraded areas.},

Title = {Physiological responses of the upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea
   (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa: Cassiopeidae) to temperature and implications for
   their range expansion along the east coast of Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {554},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea spp.) are predominantly tropical, but
   there have been recent reports of medusae in temperate environments. In
   2017 they were recorded in temperate Lake Macquarie, Australia, where
   they have a tendency to disappear from this area through late winter
   (Austral, August). This raises questions about the role of temperature
   as a controlling factor of their abundance, and future density increases
   with warming oceans as a result of climate change. Here we test the
   degree to which temperature may drive winter die-offs of the medusa
   stage in temperate environments, and how this may change with altered
   thermal regimes. We assessed the physiological response of Cassiopea
   (via measurement of bell pulsation rate, bell diameter, and routine
   metabolic rate) under a regime mirroring Lake Macquarie's seasonal
   temperature drop (autumn into winter) compared to three other
   temperature profiles: 1) seasonal profile with predicted climate change
   (+ 2 C), 2) stable temperatures equivalent to the end of autumn (20 C)
   and, 3) a profile that mimicked the increasing temperatures from winter
   into summer (20 C increasing to 24 C). Overall, the results indicate
   that, compared to the ambient state, elevated temperatures can have
   positive effects on performance of Cassiopea medusae as evidenced by
   greater bell pulsation rate and bell diameter. The rate of bell diameter
   decline was lower in all elevated temperature treatments relative to the
   ambient profile. This highlights the capacity for elevated temperatures
   in the future to slow the rate of bell degradation, contributing to an
   increased probability of overwinter survival, thus increasing the size
   and duration of Cassiopea blooms in temperate waterways such as Lake
   Macquarie.},

Title = {Chemotaxis is important for fine scale habitat selection of early
   juvenile Panulirus cygnus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {553},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus {[}George 1962]) is the basis
   for Australia's most valuable single species wild caught fishery. The
   ability of early juvenile western rock lobster to select and settle onto
   suitable habitats is critical for the recruitment of this commercially
   important species. Many marine organisms, including the western rock
   lobster, have highly complex olfactory systems that allow for various
   behaviours including habitat selection and the location of food. We
   tested the active habitat selection of early juvenile western rock
   lobsters using only chemotaxis in scent based trials. We used a Y-maze
   bio-assay with which we were able to present individuals with several
   different natural scent stimuli. This study used three commonly observed
   broad habitat complexes followed by three fine scale seagrass
   assemblages to provide different scent stimuli. Seagrass habitats were
   chosen significantly more often by the juvenile lobsters in the broad
   habitat scale trials over bare sand and turf habitats. At a finer scale,
   lobsters showed a mixed response but tended to choose the canopy forming
   seagrass species, Amphibolis antarctica {[}(Labillardie`re) Sonder \&
   Ascherson ex Ascherson, 1868] and Posidonia australis {[}Hooker, 1858]
   significantly more often than the other scents provided. This study
   developed a Y-maze chemotaxis assay for P. cygnus and confirmed that
   they respond to habitat related scent cues. These findings suggest the
   importance of seagrass habitats to early juvenile western rock lobsters
   and the potential impacts that habitat change may have on the successful
   recruitment of this commercially important species.},

Title = {Polyhydroxy Acids as Fabaceous Plant Components Induce Oviposition of
   the Common Grass Yellow Butterfly, Eurema Mandarina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The common grass yellow butterfly, Eurema mandarina is a
   Fabaceae-feeding species, the females of which readily oviposit on
   Albizia julibrissin and Lespedeza cuneata in mainland Japan. We
   previously demonstrated that the methanolic leaf extracts of these
   plants, and their highly polar aqueous fractions strongly elicit female
   oviposition. Furthermore, the three subfractions obtained by
   ion-exchange chromatographic separation of the aqueous fraction have
   been found to be less effective alone, but synergistically stimulate
   female oviposition when combined. This indicates that female butterflies
   respond to multiple compounds with different acidity. We have previously
   identified d-pinitol from the neutral/amphoteric subfractions and
   glycine betaine from the basic subfractions as oviposition stimulants of
   E. mandarina. The present study aimed to identify active compounds in
   the remaining acidic subfractions of A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaf
   extracts. GC-MS analyses of trimethylsilyl-derivatized samples revealed
   the presence of six compounds in the acidic subfractions. In bioassays
   using these authentic chemicals, erythronic acid (EA) and threonic acid
   (TA) were moderately active in eliciting oviposition responses in E.
   mandarina, with their d-isomers showing slightly higher activity than
   their l-isomers. Female responsiveness differed between d-EA and l-TA,
   the major isomers of these compounds in plants, with the response to
   d-EA reaching a plateau at concentrations above 0.005\% and that to l-TA
   peaking at a concentration of 0.01\%. The natural concentrations of d-EA
   and l-TA in fresh A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaves were sufficient
   to stimulate oviposition. Furthermore, mixing 0.001\% d-EA or 0.001\%
   l-TA, to which females are mostly unresponsive, with 0.1\% d-pinitol

Abstract = {This study investigated effects of volatile blends released from

   plants of three green gram cultivars {[}PDM 54, Pusa Baisakhi and
   Samrat] including synthetic blends on the behavior of conspecific adult
   moths in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. Females showed attraction
   towards volatile blends of UD, ID and MD plants of these green gram
   cultivars against the control solvent (CH2Cl2). The components of
   volatile blends in UD plants of three green gram cultivars are not
   similar, but no any difference was found among three cultivars in term
   of the attractive effect on the insect moths when volatile blends from
   UD plants of these three cultivars were tested against one another.
   Females were more attracted towards volatile blends of ID plants of a
   particular cultivar compared to UD plants of the same cultivar. Total
   amount of volatiles was higher in ID plants than UD plants. Some
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles - (Z)-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol,
   (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 2-octanol and ocimene were attractive to the
   insect moths. Females were attracted towards three synthetic blends
   resembling amounts present in natural volatile blends of ID plants of
   these three cultivars in Y-tube olfactometer and wind tunnel bioassays,
   suggesting that involvement of host-specific chemical cues in long-range
   host location by S. obliqua females. If attraction of adult S. obliqua
   to these synthetic volatile blends is upheld by field trials then these
   blends may find practical application in detection and monitoring of S.

Title = {Changes in urban soil yeast communities after a reduction in household
   waste during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The soils of streets, urban parks and suburban areas were examined for
   yeasts in the summer of 2020 on the territory of the southern cities of
   Russia and the Republic of Crimea: Krasnodar, Maykop, Sochi and
   Simferopol. The results of this study are compared with the results of a
   previous study carried out in these cities in 2019. This study was
   conducted three months after the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
   which led to a sustained decline in household waste deposition in these
   areas. The number of tourists visiting these southern cities decreased
   significantly, and the number of walkers and visitors to urban parks
   fell sharply. In 2020, after the decline of household waste loads, the
   yeast abundance was slightly but reliably higher than in 2019. A total
   of 30 yeast species were observed -11 ascomycetes and 19 basidiomycetes.
   This was more than in 2019 and was caused by twice as many autochthonous
   basidiomycetous yeast species (natural core community), which were found
   in urban soils only after the reduction in household waste in the
   environment -Apiotrichum dulcitum, A. laibachii, Saitozyma podzolica
   Solicoccozyma terricola. And at the same time, the proportion of
   clinically sig-nificant (opportunistic) yeasts, Candida sake and
   Meyerozyma guilliermondii, was much lower in 2020 than in 2019. Thus,
   the observed changes in yeast communities in urban soils could be a
   short-time response of the microbial community to a reduction in
   household waste.},

Abstract = {Synthetic sex pheromone lures are useful tools to monitor and control
   populations of adult click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae). However,
   sex pheromones for Agriotes click beetle species native to North America
   have yet to be identified. Here we report the identification and field
   testing of the sex pheromone of Agriotes ferrugineipennis. Headspace
   volatiles from female beetles were collected on Porapak Q, and aliquots
   of Porapak extract were analyzed by gas
   chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and GC-mass
   spectrometry. 7-Methyloctyl 7-methyloctanoate (7Me7Me) emitted by
   females was more abundant and elicited much stronger responses from male
   antennae than the aldehydes octanal and nonanal and the ketone
   6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone. In a field experiment, captures of A.
   ferrugineipennis males in traps baited with candidate pheromone
   components exceeded those of unbaited control traps, on average by
   nearly 1,200 times. Neither the ketone nor the aldehydes as lure
   constituents appeared to alter captures of males in 7Me7Me-baited traps.
   We conclude that 7Me7Me is the major, and possibly the only, sex
   attractant pheromone component of female A. ferrugineipennis.},

Title = {The stress gradient hypothesis explains plant-plant interaction networks
   in edapho climatic gradients},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {115},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts a shift from facilitation
   to competition as the environment turns from severe to favorable.
   Different authors have reported conflicting results when testing the
   SGH, mainly concerning the role of facilitation in stressful
   environments. We aimed to infer the mechanisms best explaining the
   variation of interspecific interactions across gradients through the
   joint analysis of network metrics and abiotic variables. We analyzed six
   plant-plant interaction networks (size, number of links, connectance,
   average degree, nestedness, and modularity) in edapho-climatic gradients
   in northeastern Brazil. Nestedness occurs when many species connect both
   with each other and with a set of other species with few connections,
   indicating facilitation. Modularity occurs when the network is split
   into groups of species linking to each other only within the groups,
   indicating competition. We used correlation, multiple linear
   regressions, and a generalized linear model to understand how the
   abiotic variables could drive network alterations and if the abundance
   of a possible benefactor species (Fabaceae trees) could increase
   facilitation. All the climate, soil, and network variables varied widely
   across the sites. All the sites had aluminium-toxic, nutrient-poor and
   nitrogen-limited soils, and Hol-dridge's life zones varied from very dry
   to moist tropical forests. Climate, soil, and network variables were
   correlated to each other, but the soil was the main driver of variation
   in the network metrics. Nestedness and modularity were negatively
   correlated, and both were correlated with the number of Fabaceae trees
   in each community. Deciduous species in very dry and dry forests require
   more nitrogen than evergreen species in dry/ moist and moist forests, so
   the soil was more limiting to the deciduous species, which associated
   with Fabaceae trees and increased network nestedness. Our data
   corroborated the SGH, which, in this case, was mediated by the soil
   nutrient status and had Fabaceae as the benefactor species.},

Title = {Hermit crabs use vision, olfaction, and eavesdropping to detect
   potentially available gastropod shells on a natural rocky shore},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {559},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Intertidal marine crustaceans use multimodal cues to find resources,
   relying most heavily on chemical cues. However, water movement on
   intertidal shores acts as a sensory stressor, diluting and modifying the
   direction of waterborne chemicals, which may increase the relative
   importance of visual cues. We compared the influence of visual cues,
   chemical cues, and their combination in attracting free-living hermit
   crabs (Calcinus californiensis) to potentially available shells in
   shallow natural wave-protected tide pools. We used the tissue of dead
   gastropods as a chemical cue and clean, varnished shells as a visual cue
   from the gastropod species whose shell is most preferred by C.
   californiensis. The visual, chemical, or combined (bimodal) cue was
   placed in the center of a circular arena. We counted the crabs that
   entered the arena and classified their behavior into one of three
   mutually exclusive categories: touching the stimulus, remaining in the
   arena without reaching the stimulus, or leaving the arena without
   touching the stimulus. We ranked the quality of each hermit crab's
   current shell and recorded the time they took to reach the stimulus.
   Since more than one hermit crab participated in each trial in the field,
   we explored potential eavesdropping by comparing the time required to
   reach the stimulus among the first three hermit crabs. Cue type did not
   affect the number of crabs that entered the arena. However, most hermit
   crabs that entered the arena reached the chemical and bimodal shell
   cues; in contrast, with the visual cue alone most crabs remained in the
   arena without touching the stimulus, and those that touched it took
   longer to do so. Hermit crabs were more likely to touch the stimuli when
   a bimodal cue was presented in the arena and when they were in a broken
   shell (a low-quality refuge). Interestingly, there was only an apparent
   eavesdropping effect in the unimodal visual cue; subsequent crabs
   touched the visual stimulus more quickly once a pioneer crab had already
   touched it. Previous demonstrations that C. californiensis can visually
   discriminate shells suggest that the reduced number of crabs that
   touched the visual stimulus and their longer latency to do so was not
   due to low visual acuity or inability to interpret the image. Rather, it
   is likely due to the incongruous set of cues (visible shell without
   odor), which may reduce the perceived value or certainty about the
   shell, therefore the benefit/risk relationship in the natural
   environment. Our results highlight the importance of matching chemical
   sensing with vision as a trigger for decision-making in dynamic and
   unpredictable environments.},

Title = {No evidence of altered relationship between diet and consumer fatty acid
   composition in a natural plankton community under combined climate
   drivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {551},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fatty acids (FA), especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), are key
   biomolecules involved in immune responses, reproduction, and membrane
   fluidity. PUFA in marine environments are synthesized exclusively by
   primary producers. Therefore the FA composition of these organisms at
   the base of the food web (i.e., phytoplankton) and their primary
   consumers (i.e., zooplankton) are important determinants of the health
   and productivity of entire ecosystems as they are transferred to higher
   trophic levels. However, environmental conditions such as seawater pH
   and temperature, which are already changing in response to climate
   change and predicted to continue to change in the future, can affect the
   FA composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton at both the organismal
   and community level. During a 20 day mesocosm experiment, we tested the
   effect of ocean acidification alone and in combination with ocean
   warming on 1) the fatty acid composition of a natural prey community for
   zooplankton (i.e. phytoplankton and microzooplankton), 2) the fatty acid
   composition of zooplankton, and 3) the relationship between prey and
   consumer fatty acid compositions in coastal waters. Significant effects
   of the climate stressors were not detected in the fatty acid composition
   of the prey or the relationship between diet and consumer fatty acids. A
   significant decrease in C18:4n-3 (stearidonic acid) was observed in the
   zooplankton but not their diet, but understanding the mechanism behind
   this decrease and its potential biological implications requires further
   investigation. These results highlight the importance of multistressor
   investigations on dynamics and variability contained within natural
   coastal plankton communities.},

Title = {Responses of edaphic factors and microbial community to terrestrial
   succession and experimental warming in coastal salt marshes},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To date, how the combined effects of terrestrial succession and climate
   warming will affect the edaphic factors and microbial community of
   coastal salt marshes remains unclear. To address this question, we
   compared the growth traits (i.e., morphology and biomass), edaphic
   properties, microbial community and function of Phragmites australis and
   Imperata cylindrica communities under natural vegetation succession
   (i.e., shift from P. australis to I. cylindrica) with or without warming
   treatment of I. cylindrica over two growing seasons (2019-2020). The
   results showed that after terrestrial succession, soil water content
   (SWC), electrical conductivity, clay content, total organic carbon and
   total nitrogen decreased significantly, while soil pH and contents of
   nitrate (NO3--N) and ammonium (NH4+-N) increased. The microbial
   community structure was greatly altered by terrestrial succession. The
   combination of terrestrial succession and experimental warming
   reinforced the change trends of SWC and pH but caused NO3--N and NH4+-N
   to decline to levels as low as those before succession. Although little
   response in microbial community structure was detected, the relative
   abundances of some dominant microorganisms and functional groups
   involved in C and N cycling were altered under the combination
   treatment. These variations in dominant microorganisms and predicted
   functional groups were related to changes in SWC, pH and particle size
   fractions and further influenced soil aeration and C/N availability. We
   concluded that in coastal salt marshes, experimental warming could
   further alter soil edaphic factors after terrestrial succession with
   little effect on microbial community structure. The changes in microbial
   community composition and function had a close correlation with edaphic
   factors. Our results suggested that adaptive soil management practices
   (i.e., inoculation of important microorganisms) should be considered to
   mitigate the soil degradation of coastal salt marshes with terrestrial
   succession under predicted climate warming.},

Abstract = {Honeydew is the keystone of many interactions between aphids and their
   predators, parasitoids, and mutualistic partners. Despite the crucial
   importance of honeydew in aphid-ant mutualism, very few studies have
   investigated the potential impacts of climate change on its production
   and composition. Here, we quantified changes in sugar compounds and the
   amount of honeydew droplets released by Aphis fabae reared on Vicia faba
   plants under elevated temperature and/or CO2 conditions. Following the
   combined elevation of these two abiotic factors, we found a significant
   increase in the fructose content of A. fabae honeydew, accompanied by
   nonsignificant trends of increase in total honeydew production and
   melezitose content. The environmental conditions tested in this study
   did not significantly impact the other honeydew sugar contents. The
   observed changes may be related to changes in phloem composition under
   elevated CO2 conditions as well as to increases in aphid metabolism and
   sap ingestion under elevated temperatures. Although limited, such
   changes in aphid honeydew may concurrently reinforce ant attendance and
   mutualism under elevated temperature and CO2 conditions. Finally, we
   discuss the enhancing and counteracting effects of climate change on
   other biological agents (gut microorganisms, predators, and parasitoids)
   that interact with aphids in a complex multitrophic system.},

Title = {Comparative predator-mediated habitat use in early juvenile southern
   Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), and
   red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {555},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite declining populations, southern Tanner crab (Chionoecetes
   bairdi), snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and red king crab (Paralithodes
   camtschaticus) support economically important fisheries in the Gulf of
   Alaska and the southeastern Bering Sea. In the southeastern Bering Sea
   these crab species have distinct although overlapping habitats. Juvenile
   snow crab, a stenothermic arctic species, are concentrated in waters
   below 2 C, in contrast to the distributions of Tanner crab and red king
   crab which occupy much wider thermal ranges. Other aspects of the
   habitat associations of early benthic stages of Chionoecetes spp. have
   not been extensively studied. We describe habitat selection and
   predation avoidance strategies of early benthic stages (C1-C4) of Tanner
   crab, snow crab, and red king crab with experiments examining (1)
   sediment grain size associations, (2) burial behavior and (3) use of
   emergent benthic habitat structure (artificial worm tubes) in response
   to a predator presence, and (4) effect of worm tube density on the
   survival of age-0 Tanner crabs in the presence of predatory juvenile
   Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and age-1 Tanner crab. Tanner crabs
   were the only species that exhibited a clear sediment association,
   selecting silty muds to fine sand rather than larger sands and pebbles.
   Tanner and snow crabs buried deeper in sandy mud than in fine sand and
   both species significantly increased burial behavior in response to
   introduction of a cod predator. Conversely, red king crabs did not
   exhibit burial behavior even in the presence of a predator. Early
   juvenile Tanner and red king crabs displayed strong affinity for
   emergent structure, while snow crabs were evenly distributed between
   emergent structure and bare sand habitats. Contrary to ex-pectations,
   crab selection of emergent structure was not significantly influenced by
   a cod predator presence. In trials with actively foraging predators,
   survival of juvenile Tanner crabs was higher in worm tube habitat. Our
   results demonstrate that early juvenile Tanner and snow crabs use burial
   behavior as the first line of avoidance/ defense, while red king crabs
   rely upon occupancy of structurally complex habitat. Tanner crab
   affinity for worm tube structure may facilitate foraging in addition to
   serving as a refuge. Snow crabs settle on organically rich, fine
   sediments with little to no emergent structure in the eastern Bering Sea
   and may benefit from reduced predation pressure in cold waters,
   suggesting the importance of low temperature as a critical habitat
   feature for this species.},

Title = {Chemical Ecology of the host searching behavior in an Egg Parasitoid:
   are Common Chemical Cues exploited to locate hosts in Taxonomically
   Distant Plant Species?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 3},
Abstract = {Parasitoids are known to exploit volatile cues emitted by plants after
   herbivore attack to locate their hosts. Feeding and oviposition of a
   polyphagous herbivore can induce the emission of odor blends that differ
   among distant plant species, and parasitoids have evolved an incredible
   ability to discriminate them and locate their hosts relying on olfactive
   cues. We evaluated the host searching behavior of the egg parasitoid
   Cosmocomoidea annulicornis (Ogloblin) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) in
   response to odors emitted by two taxonomically distant host plants,
   citrus and Johnson grass, after infestation by the sharpshooter Tapajosa
   rubromarginata (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), vector of Citrus
   Variegated Chlorosis. Olfactory response of female parasitoids toward
   plants with no herbivore damage and plants with feeding damage,
   oviposition damage, and parasitized eggs was tested in a Y-tube
   olfactometer. In addition, volatiles released by the two host plant
   species constitutively and under herbivore attack were characterized.
   Females of C. annulicornis were able to detect and significantly
   preferred plants with host eggs, irrespectively of plant species.
   However, wasps were unable to discriminate between plants with healthy
   eggs and those with eggs previously parasitized by conspecifics.
   Analysis of plant volatiles induced after sharpshooter attack showed
   only two common volatiles between the two plant species, indole and
   beta-caryophyllene. Our results suggest that this parasitoid wasp uses
   common chemical cues released by many different plants after herbivory
   at long range and, once on the plant, other more specific chemical cues
   could trigger the final decision to oviposit.},

   risk of attack by their natural enemies when making oviposition
   decisions. Yet, which factor is more important remains unresolved in
   plant-insect ecology. Here, we report the oviposition preference and
   larval performance of the brassicaceous specialist Plutella xylostella,
   in the context of plant quality (cabbage Brassica oleracea vs. mustard
   B. juncea) and associated natural enemies. Despite the greater larval
   weight and adult lifespan on cabbage, ovipositing females strongly
   preferred mustard. Both the egg parasitoid Trichogrammatoidea bactrae
   and the larval ectoparasitoid Bracon brevicornis are more likely to
   attack P. xylostella that feed on cabbage; thus, mustard represents
   enemy-reduced space from these two parasitoids. However, larval diet had
   no impact on the parasitism rate of specialist Cotesia vestalis. Feeding
   on mustard improved larval immune responses. The total hemocyte number,
   diversity, and phenoloxidase activity were higher in mustard-fed larvae
   which increased their survival against the entomopathogen, Bacillus
   thuringiensis. Interestingly, host plants altered the larval body odor
   profile. Mustard-fed larvae emitted allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and
   butyl isothiocyanate (BITC) while cabbage-fed larvae emitted dimethyl
   disulphide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS) that served as
   short-range cues for larval parasitoids. For B. brevicornis, host body
   odor guided oviposition choice was crucial as their fitness was affected
   by the host larval diet. Although C. vestalis showed a clear preference
   towards volatiles emitted by mustard fed larvae, their fitness was
   unaltered. Taken together, our results illustrate that P. xylostella
   prefers to lay eggs on mustard plants providing enemy-reduced space from
   some, but not all, natural enemies.},

Title = {Fisheries restrictions and their cascading effects on herbivore
   abundance and macroalgae removal at Kenyan coral reefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {559},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The increase of macroalgae at degraded reefs impedes several ecosystem
   services and calls for effective methods to facilitate a return to coral
   dominance. Removal of macroalgae (browsing) is typically realized by
   fish, but the role and identity of browsers at the heavily-fished East
   African coast is still largely unknown. This study investigated how
   browsing pressure at Kenyan reefs (-4.700, 39.396) related to fisheries
   management and herbivore community. From October 2018 to January 2019,
   consumption during 24-h buffet assays using the brown macroalgae
   Sargassum and Padina was determined and video recorded at six sites: two
   in fished zones, two in marine reserves (traditional fishing allowed)
   and two in no-take zones. Herbivorous fish composition, biomass and sea
   urchin density were also determined. Consumption of Sargassum and Padina
   was nearly three-fold lower in the fished zones (26\% and 28\% of
   macroalgal biomass consumed, respectively) compared to the no-take zones
   (62\% and 82\%), with intermediate consumption in the marine reserves
   (48\% and 71\%). Herbivore biomass was seven-fold higher in no-take
   zones and included substantially more browsers (mainly unicornfishes,
   Naso spp.) and scrapers (scarids), which were associated with the higher
   browsing pressure. Browsers and scrapers were predominantly responsible
   for the consumption of macroalgae as determined by video recordings,
   though key species differed across sites. In contrast,
   damselfish-dominated fished sites were associated with high sea urchin
   densities and low browsing pressure. These results indicate that fishing
   restrictions are likely to support reef resilience by increasing
   herbivorous fish biomass of key species and thereby promote macroalgae
   removal.},

Title = {Survival and growth of coral recruits in varying group sizes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coral larvae usually settle as solitary individuals but sometimes also
   in aggregations, especially when settlement sites are limited. Fusion of
   coral individuals can consist of different group sizes with varying
   numbers of adjacent coral spat. However, little is known about the
   performance of coral individuals in different group sizes, especially
   during the early post-settlement phase, where high mortality usually
   occurs. Here, we investigated the perfor-mance of Acropora verweyi
   juveniles in varying group sizes of fused coral spat. Specifically, we
   examined the survival and growth rate of coral individuals, with four
   group size levels: solitary spat, 2, 3-5, 6-9, and 10-28 -spat group
   size, over 21 weeks post-settlement. The highest survival was detected
   in the 6-9 spat group size followed by the 3-5 and 10-28 group sizes,
   with lower survival in the 2-spat group size and solitary spat. Overall,
   7.4\% of the 338 coral individuals reared in ex-situ hatchery conditions
   survived up to the last monitoring at 21 weeks. At 15 weeks
   post-settlement, the mean surface areas of solitary and 2-spat group
   sizes were five-to eight-fold smaller than in larger fused coral
   individuals. However, there were no significant differences between the
   percent growth changes among the coral group sizes. The present study
   suggests that fused coral spat of larger group sizes can immediately
   gain size, but not necessarily have higher growth rates within the first
   15 weeks post-settlement. Results also revealed that fusions of at least
   six A. verweyi spat had higher survival than small fused individuals and
   solitary spat, at least in the first few months after settlement. The
   advantage of such fu-sions, especially in larger group sizes, may offer
   an enhanced survival for coral spat during the critical period of early
   post-settlement. This outcome provides potential advantages for coral
   restoration using sexual production of larvae.},

Title = {Intergenerational effects of ocean acidification on reproductive traits
   of an estuarine copepod},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Copepods are an important part of the marine food web because of their
   high biomass productivity and nutrient turnover rate compared to other
   zooplankton in the marine ecosystem. Despite their great ecological role
   in the ocean, there is only limited information available on the
   consequences of ocean acidification (OA) induced by the future increase
   in CO2 on the planet. More specifically, there is almost no information
   about the impact of OA on the European copepod Calanipeda aquaedulcis
   Kritschagin, 1873. Therefore, the present investigation hypothe-sized
   that OA would not produce negative multigenerational effects on the
   survival and reproductive perfor-mance of this copepod species. Here we
   assessed, the multigenerational (F1 and F2) effect of OA on eight
   important reproductive traits (maturity, prosome length, fertility, egg
   release, hatching success, survival rate, reproductive performance, and
   the total number of adults per generation). For this study, C.
   aquaedulcis were collected from the Guadalquivir River (southwest of
   Spain) and were exposed to four different pH gradients (pH 8.1 as
   control and pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5 as acidified conditions) to mimic the
   future seawater acidification scenarios. The survival rate from nauplius
   to adult, C. aquaedulcis was significantly reduced by pHs and across
   generations. Besides, results also indicated that there were marked
   effects on fertility, reflected by a significantly lower number of eggs
   per female in each generation. Similarly, hatching success also showed a
   decreasing pattern towards low pH, and importantly, F1 females had lower
   hatching success than F0 females. While a beneficial parental effect was
   detected in the offspring in response to OA, it was insufficient to
   offset the negative effects caused by it. The findings presented here
   appear to have ecological significance, as decreasing the reproductive
   performance of copepods may have a negative impact on the marine food
   web, as ichthyofaunal feeding and growth are heavily reliant on this
   component of the food web.},

Title = {The impact of UV-B radiation on pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas health
   and pathogen Vibrio aestuarianus development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {555},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {UV-B (lambda 280-315 nm) radiation is an important aquatic ecosystem
   regulator which influences animal motility and orientation, immune
   health, and mating behaviour. However, UV-B can also induce adverse
   genotoxic effects on microbial, plant and animal life, including on
   surface water pathogens such as Vibrio species which can be pathogenic
   to humans and aquatic animals e.g., V. cholerae, V. splendidus, and V.
   aestuarianus. Thus, UV-effects on organisms are multifaceted, and can be
   positive or negative. Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas are typically
   cultured in the intertidal zone and experience extreme fluctuations in
   environmental conditions including increased variations in exposure to
   UV radiation during the diurnal tidal flow. C. gigas stocks experience
   mor-tality events during the summer months, and these are typically
   associated with environmental stressors such as elevated sea and air
   temperature, high salinity, low nutrient availability and pathogens such
   as protozoa, viruses and bacteria including from the Vibrio genus such
   as V. aestuarianus and V. splendidus. The role of UV-B in such mortality
   events or in contributing to underlying physiological pathologies is
   unknown. To assess the impact of UV-B exposure this study used lab-based
   experiments whereby C. gigas seed were exposed to i) a short, high
   intensity UV-B dose while submerged in seawater or ii) a longer, low
   intensity UV-B exposure while the oysters were aerially exposed. Impacts
   on oyster survival and development of Vibrio aestuarianus and related
   and un-related pathologies were measured. V. aestuarianus infected
   oysters exhibited pathologies commonly associated with vibriosis such as
   diapedesis, haemocyte accumulation, tissue degradation and digestive
   gland atrophy. UV-B exposure did not affect oyster tissue structure and
   morphology. Yet, results from both low and high intensity exposure
   trials showed that UV-B exposure increased the rate of mortality in
   oyster seed, with highest mortality in the smaller seed. Prevalence and
   intensity of V. aestuarianus infection transiently decreased in oysters
   exposed to UV-B. Prevalence and intensity of V. aestuarianus infection
   were most reduced in oysters submerged in seawater during the UV
   exposure treatment. Thus, UV-B caused more C. gigas death, despite a
   decrease in Vibrio infection. The data identify a causative factor for,
   thus far, unexplained mortality events during the summer. These findings
   will inform husbandry management of this commercially important species.},

Title = {Abundance, isolation, and characterization of halotolerant microbes from
   common oligosaline soils},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Halotolerant microbes that grow at high NaCl concentrations were studied
   in common soils with low salinity. The abundance of microbes in common
   oligosaline (< 1.0\% salinity) soils was measured by most probable
   number analyses, where statistically valid replicates of serial
   dilutions were assessed for growth in liquid Salt Plains medium with
   0.1, 10, or 20\% (w/v) NaCl. Common Kansas soils were collected from
   oligosaline agri-cultural fields (corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybean),
   pond margin, prairie grassland, and woodland. The abundance of microbes
   able to grow at 10\% NaCl was 0.0025-0.32\% of the total counts at 0.1\%
   NaCl. Only marginal growth was observed at 20\% NaCl, about 100-fold
   lower than at 10\% NaCl. Bacterial isolates were collected from 20\%
   NaCl enrichments of oligosaline turf soil by repetitive streak-plating.
   The bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
   characterized. The isolates clustered with low G+C Gram-positive genera
   (Bacillus, Halobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Virgibacillus). Broad
   halotolerances (0.1-20\% NaCl) were observed for most isolates, but all
   grew at low salt. Soils were boiled to kill vegetative cells and
   compared by most probable number analyses with unboiled specimens. The
   abundance of microbes able to grow at 10\% NaCl showed a 3-log decrease
   with boiling, while microbes able to grow at 0.1\% NaCl showed a 5-log
   decrease in abundance with boiling. It appears that halotolerant
   microbes in oligosaline soils are cultivable vegetative cells, not
   perennating structures such as spores. Discrete salt phases are not
   obvious in oligosaline soils, but could provide a selective advantage to
   autochthonous halotolerant microbes. Allochthonous microbes associated
   with salt evaporite particles may be transported by winds, thereby

Abstract = {Plants have to allocate their resources in both growth and defense under
   different environmental challenges. Several plant species have become
   invasive particularly in disturbed fertile habitats, which may influence
   their resource allocation. We studied the effects of nitrate
   fertilization (low versus high) on various plant responses towards a
   pathogenic fungus, Alternaria brassicae, and a herbivorous insect
   species, Mamestra brassicae, in a population of Bunias orientalis, which
   is invasive in parts of central Europe. Aboveground biomass and leaf
   trichome density were enhanced in plants under high fertilization. In
   contrast, the short-term fungal infection and herbivory had no effect on
   aboveground biomass. Leaf water, nitrogen content and glucosinolate
   concentrations were neither affected by fertilization nor in response to
   antagonist attack. The total soluble sugar content, especially fructose,
   as well as leaf peroxidase activity increased significantly in leaves
   upon fungal infection, but independent of fertilization. Larval biomass
   gain and herbivore survival were likewise unaffected by fertilization.
   Our findings highlight that under conditions of high fertilization, B.
   orientalis plants allocate more resources into growth and morphological
   defenses than chemical defenses. In contrast, induced responses to
   short-term antagonist attack seem independent of nitrate availability in
   this population.},

Title = {Sex pheromones from male forewings of the Common Grass Yellow Eurema
   mandarina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5-6, SI},
Pages = {518-530},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The common grass yellow Eurema mandarina has a characteristic patch (sex
   brand) composed of specialized scales (androconia) and wing
   intermembranous cells on the ventral surface of its male forewing. This
   structure is specific to males and is thought to release compounds that
   induce female mate acceptance. However, no study has demonstrated that
   these compounds function as sex pheromones in the genus Eurema. Here we
   report the identification of sex pheromones in males of E. mandarina.
   Chemical analyses revealed that 6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one (TMP)
   and (E/Z)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-enal {[}(E/Z)-phytal] were
   male-specific and abundant in particular regions of the male forewings.
   TMP was highest in the sex brand, whereas (E/Z)-phytal was concentrated
   in the anal cell (cell 2 A), lacking androconia and intermembranous
   cells. The content of these compounds increases with age in males after
   emergence. In bioassays, virgin females displayed a posture of bending
   their abdomens as mating acceptance in response to stimulation by fresh
   male forewings. However, solvent-washed male wings did not induce such
   female responses, suggesting that some compounds from male wings serve
   as triggers. When we examined female responses to compounds applied to
   solvent-washed male wings, authentic TMP and (E/Z)-phytal alone showed
   little activity. However, the mixture elicited abdomen-bending responses
   in one-third of the females. Therefore, TMP and (E/Z)-phytal were found
   to act synergistically as aphrodisiac sex pheromones for E. mandarina
   females, although these activities were weak.},

Abstract = {Once a booming fishery in the Gulf of Maine, green sea urchin
   (Stronglocentrotus droebachiensis) catches declined drastically in the
   1990s and have remained low over the past couple decades. To monitor
   changes in urchin populations, settlement patterns of S. droebachiensis
   at sites in the northern (Eastport and Frazer Point, ME) and southern
   Gulf of Maine (York, ME and Isles of Shoals, NH) were recorded. From
   1994 to 2019, AstroTurf (R) panels attached to wire frames were
   intermittently laid on the ocean bottom at five sites along the Gulf of
   Maine in late spring and retrieved in the mid to late summer. The
   present study examined changes in recruitment densities over the 23-year
   period from 1996 to 2019 and found a drop in recruitment at the southern
   sites by two orders of magnitude over the time span. Aside from the
   likely pressure of overfishing, recruitment declines may be influenced
   by anthropogenic climate change and higher predation rates by Jonah
   crabs, Cancer borealis.},

Title = {Experimental effects of warming and epiphyte grazing on the
   ecophysiology of two seagrass morphotypes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seagrasses form important ecosystems providing essential provisioning
   and regulating services. They exhibit acclimative properties to contend
   with environmental change while intrinsic responses allow seagrasses to
   persist in sub-and supra-optimal temperatures, and are critical to
   understanding their ability to cope with a changing climate. An indoor
   mesocosm approach was used to investigate the effects of warming, i.e.
   mean summer (24 degrees C) and extreme (30 degrees C) temperatures, and
   epiphyte grazing on large-leaved and small-leaved morphotypes of a dwarf
   eelgrass (Zostera capensis) from a temperate lagoon habitat. Both
   morphotypes displayed similar responses under extreme temperatures with
   greater losses observed in shoot densities and total biomass compared to
   summer mean temperatures. However, higher photosynthetic rates and
   accumulations of carbon, nitrogen and phenolics were observed in
   small-compared to large-leaved plants. This suggests that small-leaved
   populations possess a larger propensity to store resources -a potential
   for resilience. Large-leaved populations appeared to have channelled
   resources towards growth suggesting a greater susceptibility to stress
   from e.g. fouling. Epiphyte biomass increased under extreme temperatures
   and, even though grazing had a positive effect on seagrass biomass under
   summer mean conditions, grazers did not regulate algal growth under
   extreme temperatures which may have been too rapid for grazer control.
   These findings indicate that seagrasses will be negatively affected by
   extreme warming with ensuing reductions in biomass, increasing their
   susceptibility to stressors. However, acclimation strategies including
   carbon and nitrogen stores provide high resilience potential and attest
   to a system's ability to cope with stress.},

Title = {Forest type and pH affecting the occurrence and life status of land
   snails in South American temperate forest},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The genus Plectostylus (Stylommatophora: Bothriembryontidae) is found in
   temperate and Mediterranean eco-systems in central Chile, which are
   highly fragmented landscapes and vulnerable to human perturbations.
   However, it is unknown what habitat or environmental variables influence
   their occurrence and life status. This study analyzed how different
   habitat and environmental predictors influence the occurrence and life
   status (alive vs. dead) of Plectostylus chilensis species in central
   Chile. The snails (or shells) were sampled in different frag-ments (n =
   50). In each fragment, land snails were searched in different
   microhabitats (e.g., leaf litter or trunks) with different environmental
   conditions (shady, sunny, humid, dry). At the landscape level,
   temperature, pre-cipitation, and pH at two levels were incorporated into
   the analysis. Predictors and responses were analyzed with logistic
   regression models. Land snail abundance was also analyzed with path
   analysis. The native forest type (open sclerophyllous scrub) was the
   only variable that influenced the occurrence of land snails. The life
   status of P. chilensis was also influenced by forest pH at depths of 0-5
   cm, with open sclerophyllous forests, and average top layer pH of 6.1
   exhibited higher probabilities of finding alive individuals. The
   Non-Metrical Multidimen-sional Scaling associated the land snail
   abundance with the microsite conditions and the dominant tree species.
   However, path analysis has not shown significant effects. The smaller
   privately-owned native forest fragments are key for the occurrence and
   life status of P. chilensis, although the absence of high-quality
   microhabitats at any forest patch size could limit their
   abundance/presence of land snails in time. Facing the ecological and
   climatic crisis that Chile will experience in the coming decades, the
   resilience of Chile's terrestrial mollusks will depend on the potential
   measures of management to protect the remaining native forest patches.},

Title = {Mesofauna community influences litter chemical trajectories during
   early-stage litter decay},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decomposition of organic material is moderated by both litter chemistry
   and decomposer communities. Chemical alteration of the litter occurs
   throughout decomposition, yet our understanding of the nature of
   chemical change during decomposition is limited, particularly beyond
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The decomposer food web likely interacts
   with these chemical changes in their basal resource to alter the
   trajectories of chemical changes during decay. To investigate how
   decomposer mesofauna influence patterns of litter chemical change
   throughout early stages of decay, we tracked mass loss, macro-and
   micronutrient elements, and fiber chemistry dynamics in Arizona sycamore
   (Platanus wrightii) leaves decomposed in a mesocosm of optimal decay
   conditions in a bio-tically diverse compost pile. By using litterbags of
   two different mesh sizes to manipulate the mesofauna gaining access to
   the litter, we identify how the complexity of the soil mesofauna
   community changes the trajectory of litter chemistry, beyond the typical
   focus on mass loss and N dynamics. Counter to many examples in the
   literature, the more abundant and complex arthropod community slowed
   mass loss and enhanced nutrient immobilization, perhaps due to
   competition and grazing pressure on the microbial community to
   immobilize N, P, and Ca sooner from the surrounding compost.},

Title = {Functional significance of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes
   (Formicidae) in coffee plantations: An enemy or an ally?},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Leaf-cutter ants are appreciated as ecosystem engineers. Conversely,
   under agricultural scenarios, they are considered serious pests. Coffee
   is one of the crops selectively foraged by this species either under
   traditional shading or unshaded intensified systems. Despite the
   economic importance of coffee in Neotropical regions, there are few
   observational field studies on the impact of leaf-cutter ants on coffee
   plantation soils and how impact may differ in response to shade
   management. Three hypotheses were tested in coffee plantations in
   presence of Atta cephalotes: (1) bioturbation activity by leaf-cutter
   ants depends on the soil properties, which in turn, are affected by
   agronomic management of the coffee plantations; (2) a relatively higher
   concentration of resources (i. e., coffee plants) results in greater
   leaf-cutter ant activity in unshaded plantations than in shaded
   plantations; and (3) the effect of ant defoliation on fruit production
   depends on the level of foliar damage. Ten active ant nests were
   selected from each management system in ten farm plots. Soil samples
   were collected from nests and from outside the nests (control),
   physical, chemical and biological properties were analysed, and
   leaf-cutter ant herbivory was also assessed. No significant differences
   in microbial activity, evaluated through respiration, were found between
   nest and control soils. Nest soils had higher and lower percentages of
   sand and silt, respectively, than the control soils. Nest soils
   contained significantly higher amounts of sulphur, regardless of shade
   management. A. cephalotes translocated mineral soils and improved water
   infiltration in nest soils. The herbivory index and proportion of damage
   were greater in unshaded coffee, although fruit production tended to
   increase, possibly due to a compensatory effect as coffee plants
   responded to low levels of foliar damage. Therefore, the first
   hypothesis was only partially supported since bioturbation depended on
   soil properties, and certain soil properties were affected by coffee
   management, while the second and third hypotheses were supported by the
   data, suggesting that leaf-cutter ants differentially affect coffee
   plantations based on their shade management and on the moment the coffee
   plants are affected. Our results form the basis for the development of
   future studies that evaluate production impacts and economic damage in
   coffee varieties by leaf-cutter ants. Depending on the ecological
   context of the agroecosystem and management practices used, leaf-cutter
   ants can have positive or negative impacts for coffee production.},

Title = {Volatile-Mediated Induced and Passively Acquired Resistance in Sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9-10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Plants produce a diversity of secondary metabolites including volatile
   organic compounds. Some species show discrete variation in these
   volatile compounds such that individuals within a population can be
   grouped into distinct chemotypes. A few studies reported that
   volatile-mediated induced resistance is more effective between plants
   belonging to the same chemotype and that chemotypes are heritable. The
   authors concluded that the ability of plants to differentially respond
   to cues from related individuals that share the same chemotype is a form
   of kin recognition. These studies assumed plants were actively
   responding but did not test the mechanism of resistance. A similar
   result was possible through the passive adsorption and reemission of
   repellent or toxic VOCs by plants exposed to damage-induced plant
   volatiles (DIPVs). Here we conducted exposure experiments with five
   chemotypes of sagebrush in growth chambers; undamaged receiver plants
   were exposed to either filtered air or DIPVs from mechanically wounded
   branches. Receiver plants exposed to DIPVs experienced less herbivore
   damage, which was correlated with increased expression of genes involved
   in plant defense as well as increased emission of repellent VOCs. Plants
   belonging to two of the five chemotypes exhibited stronger resistance
   when exposed to DIPVs from plants of the same chemotypes compared to
   when DIPVs were from plants of a different chemotype. Moreover, some
   plants passively absorbed DIPVs and reemitted them, potentially
   conferring associational resistance. These findings support previous
   work demonstrating that sagebrush plants actively responded to alarm
   cues and that the strength of their response was dependent on the
   chemotypes of the plants involved. This study provides further support
   for kin recognition in plants but also identified volatile-mediated
   associational resistance as a passively acquired additional defense
   mechanism in sagebrush.},

Title = {High sclerobiont calcification in marginal reefs of the eastern tropical
   Pacific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A sclerobiont is any organism capable of fouling hard substrates.
   Sclerobionts have recently received attention due to their notable
   calcium carbonate contributions to reef structures and potential to
   offset drops in carbonate budgets in degraded reefs. However, due to
   their encrusting nature, it is difficult to quantify net calcium
   car-bonate production at the level of individual taxonomic groups, and
   knowledge regarding the main environmental factors that regulate their
   spatial distributions is limited. In addition, the material types used
   to create experi-mental substrates, their orientations, and their
   overall deployment times can influence settlement and the composition of
   the resulting communities. Thus, comparative evaluations of these
   variables are necessary to improve future research efforts. In this
   study, we used calcification accretion units (CAUs) to quantify the
   cal-cium carbonate contributions of sclerobionts at the taxonomic group
   level and evaluated the effects of two frequently used materials
   {[}i.e., polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and terracotta (TCT) tiles] on the
   recruitment and calcification of the sclerobiont community in the
   tropical Mexican Pacific and the Midriff Island Region of the Gulf of
   California over 6 and 15 months {[}n = 40; 5 CAUs x site (2) x
   deployment time (2) x material type (2)]. The net sclerobiont
   calcification rate (mean +/- SD) reached maximum values at six months
   and was higher in the Mexican Pacific (2.15 +/- 0.99 kg m- 2 y-1) than
   in the Gulf of California (1.70 +/- 0.67 kg m- 2 y-1). Moreover, the
   calcification rate was slightly higher on the PVC-CAUs compared to that
   of the TCT-CAUs, although these dif-ferences were not consistent at the
   group level. In addition, cryptic microhabitats showed low calcification
   rates when compared to those of exposed microhabitats. Crustose
   coralline algae and barnacles dominated the exposed experimental
   surfaces, while bryozoans, mollusks, and serpulid polychaetes dominated
   cryptic surfaces. Regardless of the site, deployment time, or material
   type, barnacles made the greatest contributions to calcimass production
   (between 41 and 88\%). Our results demonstrate that the orientation of
   the experimental substrate, and the material to a lesser extent,
   influence the sclerobiont community and the associated calcification
   rate. Upwelling-induced surface nutrient levels, low pH levels, and the
   aragonite saturation state (omega Ar) limit the early cementation of
   reef-building organisms in the tropical Mexican Pacific and promote high
   bioerosion rates in corals of the Gulf of California. Our findings
   demonstrate that sclerobionts significantly contribute to calcium
   carbonate production even under conditions of high environmental
   variability.},

Title = {High variability in nest site selection in a loggerhead turtle rookery,
   in Boa Vista Island, Cabo Verde},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Among sea turtles, nest site selection is a crucial factor for hatching
   success and population viability. The relocation of otherwise doomed
   clutches to safe hatcheries has been widely promoted as a conservation
   strategy, although this may promote artificial selection of poorly
   adapted genotypes. In this study, we used multiyear spatial nesting data
   of individual loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from one of the
   largest Atlantic rookeries, in Cabo Verde, across six consecutive
   nesting seasons (2013-2018), to identify spatial nesting patterns,
   assess how individual nest site selection is influenced by female size
   and age, and estimate the impacts on the reproductive output. Although
   females nested across the entire beach width, they preferentially nested
   in the middle of the beach, avoiding to nest both close to the tideline
   and close to the vegetation line. Hatching success decreased towards the
   waterline, while the risk of nest inundation or predation was high,
   regardless of nest location. In general, females showed high variability
   in nest site selection, except larger females (> 93 cm curved carapace
   length) that showed higher repeatability (r = 0.50, SE = 0.14, 95\% CI:
   0.16-0.72) in distances to the vegetation. We therefore suggest that the
   relocation of doomed clutches should be considered for this endangered
   rookery, as clutch relocation should not substantially distort the gene
   pool, assuming nest choice is a heritable trait. In addition, we
   recommend the preservation of beach vegetation, particularly in areas
   with human development.},

Abstract = {Silicon (Si) fertilization alleviates biotic stresses in plants. Si
   enhances plant resistance against phytophagous insects through physical
   and biochemical mechanisms. In particular, Si modifies jasmonic acid
   levels and the emissions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).
   Here, we investigated whether Si accumulation in the tissues of maize
   leaves modifies the emissions of constitutive and herbivore-induced
   plant volatiles, with cascade deterrent effects on oviposition site
   selection by Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Maize
   plants were cultivated in a hydroponic system under three Si
   concentrations, resulting in three groups of plants expressing different
   Si concentrations in their tissues (0.31 +/- 0.04, 4.69 +/- 0.49, and
   9.56 +/- 0.30 g Si. Kg(- 1) DW). We collected volatiles from undamaged
   and caterpillar-infested plants, and found that Si concentration in
   plant tissues had no significant impact. Jasmonic acid content was high
   in insect-infested plants, but was similar across all Si treatments.
   Oviposition site selection bioassays using fertilized S. exigua females
   showed that Si concentration in plant tissues did not affect the number
   of eggs laid on Si-treated plants. In conclusion, our study shows that
   the Si content in maize tissues does not impact the semiochemical
   interactions with S. exigua.},

Title = {Identification of the Sex Pheromone of the Pink Grass Worm, Tmetolophota

Abstract = {The pink grass worm, Tmetolophota atristriga (Walker), is an endemic New
   Zealand noctuid moth species that is abundant throughout the North and
   South Islands. The larvae are minor defoliators of agricultural pasture.
   We investigated the sex pheromone of this species. Analysis of extract
   of the female sex pheromone gland identified six compounds: two
   monounsaturated compounds, (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) and
   (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:Ac), three saturated compounds,
   hexadecanal (16:Ald), hexadecyl acetate (16:Ac) and octadecan-1-ol
   (18:OH), and a triene hydrocarbon, (3Z,6Z,9Z)-tricosatriene
   (Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy). Several field-trapping experiments testing combinations
   of the six compounds were conducted. Results suggested that males of two
   different populations of T. atristriga responded differently to
   different blends of the compounds. Males of one population responded
   equally to a two-component blend as to other blends, including the one
   with all six compounds. By contrast, males of the second population
   responded only to the six-component blend or a ternary blend of
   Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:Ac and Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy. In experiments testing different
   doses of Z11-16:Ald and Z11-16:Ac in a binary or a six-component blend,
   a 1 mg dose of the binary blend gave the greatest male catch for both
   populations. This is the second sex pheromone identification of a New
   Zealand species of Noctuidae and is the first reported occurrence of
   Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy as a sex pheromone component of any noctuid species.},

Title = {Constitutive and Induced Defenses in Long-lived Pines Do Not Trade Off
   but Are Influenced by Climate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9-10},

Abstract = {Plants resist herbivores and pathogens by using constitutive (baseline)
   and inducible (change in defense after an attack) defenses. Inducibility
   has long been predicted to trade off with constitutive defense,
   reflecting the economic use of resources. However, empirical evidence
   for such tradeoffs is variable, and we still lack understanding about
   when and where defense trade-offs occur. We tested for tradeoffs between
   constitutive and induced defenses in natural populations of three
   species of long-lived pines (Pinus balfouriana, P. flexilis, P.
   longaeva) that differ greatly in constitutive defense and resistance to
   mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae). We also assessed
   how climate influenced constitutive and inducible defenses. At seven
   high-elevation sites in the western U.S., we simulated MPB attack to
   induce defenses and measured concentrations of terpene-based phloem
   defenses on days 0, 15, and 30. Constitutive and induced defenses did
   not trade off among or within species. Simulated MPB attack induced
   large increases in defense concentrations in all species independent of
   constitutive levels. MPB and its symbiotic fungi typically kill trees
   and thus could be selective forces maintaining strong inducibility
   within and among species. The contrasting constitutive concentrations in
   these species could be driven by the adaptation for specializing in
   harsh, high-elevation environments (e.g., P. balfouriana and P.
   longaeva) or by competition (e.g., P. flexilis), though these hypotheses
   have not been empirically examined. Climate influenced defenses, with
   the greatest concentrations of constitutive and induced defenses
   occurring at the coldest and driest sites. The interactions between
   climate and defenses have implications for these species under climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Insect herbivores have evolved a broad spectrum of adaptations in
   response to the diversity of chemical defences employed by plants. Here
   we focus on two species of New Guinean Asota and determine how these
   specialist moths deal with the leaf alkaloids of their fig (Ficus)
   hosts. As each focal Asota species is restricted to one of three
   chemically distinct species of Ficus, we also test whether these
   specialized interactions lead to similar alkaloid profiles in both Asota
   species. We reared Asota caterpillars on their respective Ficus hosts in
   natural conditions and analyzed the alkaloid profiles of leaf, frass,
   caterpillar, and adult moth samples using UHPLC-MS/MS analyses. We
   identified 43 alkaloids in our samples. Leaf alkaloids showed various
   fates. Some were excreted in frass or found in caterpillars and adult
   moths. We also found two apparently novel indole alkaloids-likely
   synthesized de novo by the moths or their microbiota-in both caterpillar
   and adult tissue but not in leaves or frass. Overall, alkaloids unique
   or largely restricted to insect tissue were shared across moth species
   despite feeding on different hosts. This indicates that a limited number
   of plant compounds have a direct ecological function that is conserved
   among the studied species. Our results provide evidence for the
   importance of phytochemistry and metabolic strategies in the formation
   of plant-insect interactions and food webs in general. Furthermore, we
   provide a new potential example of insects acquiring chemicals for their
   benefit in an ecologically relevant insect genus.},

Abstract = {The canola flower midge, Contarinia brassicola Sinclair (Diptera:
   Cecidomyiidae), is a newly-described species that induces galls on
   canola, Brassica napus Linnaeus and Brassica rapa Linnaeus
   (Brassicaceae). Identification of the sex pheromone of C. brassicola is
   essential to developing monitoring tools to elucidate the geographic
   range and hosts of this new pest, and the extent to which it threatens
   the \$30 billion Canadian canola industry. The aim of this study was to
   identify and synthesize the female-produced sex pheromone of C.
   brassicola and demonstrate its effectiveness in attracting males to
   traps in the field. Two peaks were identified through GC-EAG analysis of
   female-produced volatiles which elicited electrophysiological responses
   in male antennae. These peaks were initially characterized through GC-MS
   and synthesis as 2,7-diacetoxynonane (major component) and
   2-acetoxynonane (minor component), and the racemic compounds elicited
   EAG responses in male antennae. All four stereoisomers of
   2,7-diacetoxynonane were synthesized and the naturally-produced compound
   was shown to be primarily the (2R,7S)-isomer by analysis on an
   enantioselective GC column, with a small amount of
   (2R,7R)-2,7-diacetoxynonane also present. The configuration of the minor
   component could not be determined because of the small amount present,
   but this was assumed to be (2R)-2-acetoxynonane by comparison with the
   configuration of the other two components. In field trials, none of the
   four stereoisomers of 2,7-diacetoxynonane, presented individually or as
   a racemic mixture, was attractive to male C. brassicola. However,
   dispensers loaded with a 10 mu g:1 mu g blend of (2R,7S)- and
   (2R,7R)-2,7-diacetoxynonane caught large numbers of male C. brassicola
   and significantly more than other blends tested. The addition of 0.5 mu
   g of (2R)-2-acetoxynonane to this blend further increased the number of
   males caught. In future work, we will seek to identify the optimum
   trapping protocol for the application of the pheromone in monitoring and
   surveillance.},
