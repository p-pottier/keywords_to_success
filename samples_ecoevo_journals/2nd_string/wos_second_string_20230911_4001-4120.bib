Abstract = {Soil particle-size fractions play an important influence soil
   physico-chemical properties, microbial biomass processes as well as fine
   roots morphological traits in beech forest ecosystem. The objectives of
   study were to determine how soil texture interacts with soil
   physico-chemical properties and microbial biomass as well as fine roots
   traits in oriental beech forest in Guilan province, northern Iran. Five
   subplots of 400 m2 were randomly selected at a plot of 1 ha. At five
   different locations, soil samples were collected at depth of 0-20 cm and
   fine root samples were also taken from beech trees. Results indicated
   that clay content was positively correlated with carbon, carbon/nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio, and moisture, but negatively correlated with nitrogen (N)
   and phosphorous (P). Silt values had significant positive correlation
   with C/N, and negative correlation with N and P. The microbial biomass
   carbon/carbon (MBC/C) ratio in soil increased significantly with clay,
   but microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) decreased significantly with
   increasing clay. The MBC/C ratio decreased significantly with sand
   values in soil at depth 0-20 cm. Results showed that silt value of soil
   profile was negatively correlated with MBN, but positively with MBN/N
   ratio. Soil acidic phosphatase concentration was negatively correlated
   with clay content, but soil alkaline phosphatase was positively
   correlated with silt. Clay and sand contents were positively correlated
   with fine root density, fine root biomass, fine root length, and surface
   root area. Sand content was negatively correlated with fine root volume.
   The results of research, considering the correlation between soil
   particle-size fractions and some soil characteristics as well as fine
   root traits, show that soil texture in oriental beech forest can play an
   important role in forest stand dynamics.},

Abstract = {Bathycoelia distincta (Pentatomidae) is the dominant pest in South
   African macadamia orchards, where adults are responsible for causing
   severe yield losses. Similar to other hemipterans, B. distincta release
   volatile compounds from scent glands that can deter natural enemies and
   act as an alarm signal among conspecifics. The overall aim of this study
   was to characterise the alarm pheromone of B. distincta. We: (i)
   analysed the scent gland contents of individual adult B. distincta by
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (ii) quantified volatiles
   released from live stink bugs after stress, and (iii) evaluated the
   electrophysiological and behavioural activity of alarm pheromone
   compounds with dose-response experiments. A blend of fourteen compounds
   was identified in the scent gland extracts of adult stink bugs. Of
   these, six compounds were detected in the effluvia of live stressed
   stink bugs {[}(E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, tridecane, dodecane,
   (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal and (E)-2-decenyl acetate]. No qualitative or
   quantitative differences were observed between sexes. Tridecane was the
   most abundant compound, comprising similar to 50\% of total secretions.
   Only (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal elicited an
   antennal response in both sexes. Finally, exposure to a mixture of
   (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal resulted in an
   increase in the speed and distance travelled by walking bugs and a
   decrease in time spent resting compared to unexposed bugs. Our results
   show that the blend of (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and
   (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal can induce an alarm response in B. distincta.},

Title = {Octopamine modulates insect mating and Oviposition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 10},
Abstract = {The neuro-mechanisms that regulate insect reproduction are not fully
   understood. Biogenic amines, including octopamine, are neuromodulators
   that have been shown to modulate insect reproduction in various ways,
   e.g., promote or inhibit insect mating or oviposition. In this study, we
   examined the role of octopamine in regulating the reproduction behaviors
   of a devastating underground insect pest, the dark black chafer
   (Holotrichia parallela). We first measured the abundance of octopamine
   in different neural tissues of the adult chafer pre- and post-mating,
   demonstrating that octopamine decreased in the abdominal ganglia of
   females but increased in males post-mating. We then fed the adult H.
   parallela with a concentration gradient of octopamine to test the
   effects on insect reproductive behaviors. Compared with its antagonist
   mianserin, octopamine at the concentration of 2 mu g/mL resulted in the
   highest increase in males' preference for sex pheromone and females'
   oviposition, whereas the mianserin-treatment increased the survival rate
   and prolonged the lifespan of H. parallela. In addition, we did not
   observe significant differences in egg hatchability between octopamine
   and mianserin-treated H. parallela. Our results demonstrated that
   octopamine promotes H. parallela mating and oviposition with a clear low
   dosage effect, illustrated how neural substrates modulate insect
   behaviors, and provided insights for applying octopamine in pest
   management.},

Title = {Genetic and morphological identification of formalin fixed, preserved
   larval fishes; can we have the best of both worlds?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {553},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Surveys of larval fishes require accurate identifications of larvae,
   which are essential to understand early life history of fish, fish
   ecology and fisheries. However, the identification of larval fishes
   requires microscopic examination that is substantially more difficult
   than that of juvenile and adult fishes, as many larval stages remain
   undescribed. Furthermore, the traditional, formalin fixation of larval
   fishes were previously thought to prevent genetic sequencing compared to
   ethanol preserved larvae. In this study, we used an integrative
   taxonomic approach based on morphology, imaging and DNA barcoding of the
   mitochondrial (mtDNA) cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COI) gene. We used
   this approach in both cultured yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi and
   wild sourced fish larvae that had been fixed in 5\% formalin. Based on
   controlled and in-field formalin treatments, DNA barcoding and genetic
   species identification was 100\% successful in cultured yellowtail
   kingfish fixed in formalin for up to 6 months, while barcoding of wild
   caught fish larvae enabled species identification of 93\% of up to
   8-weeks formalin fixed specimens. Furthermore, we demonstrated the
   viability of using either whole larval individuals or a single eyeball
   (<1 mm diameter, thus retaining the specimen intact) from formalin fixed
   larval fish for genetic species identification. While COI genetic
   identifications from the in-field experiments were patchier than the
   controlled experiments, our study highlights the possibility of
   recovering suitable DNA from larvae that have been fixed in formalin for
   up to six months. This was achieved by applying DNA extraction methods
   that use de-cross-linking steps and species identification based on both
   full-length reference and minibarcodes. Our study provides the larval
   fish research community with a practical framework for undertaking both
   morphological and genetic identifications of larval fish assemblages,
   particularly when geographic relevant reference sequence databases
   (based on vouchered adult fishes) are available for interrogation. It
   also simplifies field-based collection of samples allowing their
   preservation in formalin without compromising the genetic identification
   of species.},

Title = {Sea Lamprey Alarm Cue Comprises Water- and Chloroform- Soluble
   Components},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {A diversity of aquatic organisms manage predation risk by avoiding
   waters activated with conspecific alarm cues, a chemical mixture
   released from injuries. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a
   nocturnal migratory species that relies on its alarm cue to navigate
   around areas of predation risk when moving through river channels.
   Identification of the cue's chemistry would allow managers to harness
   this innate behavioral response to guide migrating sea lamprey to traps
   (invasive population in the Laurentian Great Lakes) or to fish passage
   devices where dams block migrations in their native range. We pursued
   isolation of the sea lamprey alarm cue through behaviorally guided
   fractionation, fractionating the alarm cue into water-soluble and
   chloroform-soluble fractions, each of which elicited a substantial
   avoidance response. Recombining the two fractions restored full
   reactivity, suggesting the alarm cue mixture contains components that
   exhibit high solubility in water (e.g., nitrogenous compounds),
   chloroform (e.g., lipids), or perhaps materials that dissolve readily in
   either solvent. We further screened 13 individual compounds or pure
   isolates and 6 sub-fractions from the water-soluble fraction and found
   one of the pure isolates, isoleucine, evoked an avoidance response on
   its own, but not consistently when found in other mixtures. In a third
   experiment, we observed no behavioral response after recombining 32
   compounds isolated and identified from the water-soluble fraction. These
   results confirm other suggestions that the process of elucidating alarm
   cue constituents is challenging. However, we suggest the pursuit is
   worthwhile given the strong evidence for the utility of alarm cues for
   use in the conservation and management of fishes and other aquatic
   organisms.},

Title = {Sex Pheromone of the Azalea Mealybug With a Non-Terpene Structure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 9},
Abstract = {Mealybug females release sex pheromones to attract conspecific males for
   mating. It is critical for mealybug males, which are fragile and
   short-lived, to respond to the pheromone of their species without time-
   and energy-consuming cross-attractions to other species. Thus, mealybug
   pheromone systems are considered to have evolved to be species-specific
   with unique structures in each species and offer an opportunity to study
   the diversity of pheromone chemistry that mediates intersexual courtship
   signals. More than 20 mealybug pheromones are reported to be
   monoterpenes in general, with only one exception, a hemiterpene alcohol
   esterified with a medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA), found in the Matsumoto
   mealybug, Crisicoccus matsumotoi. However, it is unknown whether this is
   truly exceptional, or if similar compounds are used in other related
   mealybugs. In this study, we isolated and characterized the pheromone of
   an allied species, the azalea mealybug C. azaleae. Using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy, and bioassays with synthetics, the pheromone was shown to
   be composed of isopropyl (E)-7-methyl-4-nonenoate, isopropyl
   (E)-7-methyl-4-octenoate, and ethyl (E)-7-methyl-4-nonenoate.
   Surprisingly, the structures of these compounds do not include
   hemiterpene nor monoterpene motifs but have methyl-branched MCFA parts
   that are similar to an acid moiety of the C. matsumotoi pheromone. This
   study implies irregular events for the divergence of pheromone
   structures in ancestors of the genus Crisicoccus and other mealybugs.},

Title = {Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of
   Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism
   is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate
   intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain
   defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes
   (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is
   unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have
   intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on
   maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of
   endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in
   the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe
   occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids
   known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated
   the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration,
   resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass.
   Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines
   in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants.
   There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect
   increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic
   plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than
   their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not
   affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the
   progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic
   regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this
   regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont.
   Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and
   non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence
   of herbivores.},

Title = {Fast improvement of macrofauna communities and soil quality in plantain
   crops converted to agroecological practices},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Plantain (Musa paradisiaca AAB) is one of the main staple food crops in
   tropical areas, particularly in the Caribbean region. Therefore,
   supporting a sustainable production of plantain in this zone is crucial
   to secure food and to provide income to millions of people. We
   hypothesized that agroecological practices based on multi -functionality
   and biodiversity and that preserve soil should i) increase macrofauna
   abundance, ii) enhance soil chemical fertility, iii) improve soil
   physical structure, iv) reduce plant infestation by parasitic nematodes,
   and v) immediately achieve similar yield as in conventional systems. For
   this purpose, we compared plantain conventional and agroecological
   systems at the farm scale. The agroecological system consisted in a
   combination of three innovations: i) inputs of vermicompost to replace
   mineral fertilizers, ii) use of healthy planting material and iii) use
   of a mulching of living crop to control weeds. Ten months after the
   plantation, soil macrofauna abundance had doubled and taxonomic richness
   had increased by 45\% in the agroecological system. In addition, soil
   structure was improved in the agroecological system (52\% of biogenic
   aggregates in the agroecological system vs. 21 \% in conventional
   systems), as well as the abundance of free-living nematodes associated
   to plantain roots increased by 73 \% in the agroecological system. The
   abundance of Radopholus similis, one of main plant parasitic nematodes,
   decreased in the agroecological system. Moreover, the agroecological
   system achieved similar crop yield level than conventional systems.
   Agroecological practices are thus an efficient option to allow a fast
   transition from conventional to environmentally friendly cropping
   systems.},

Title = {Crop residues in corn-wheat rotation in a semi-arid region increase CO2
   efflux under conventional tillage but not in a no-tillage system},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Appropriate management of crop residue plays a key role in mitigating
   greenhouse gas emissions. However, it has been inadequately implemented
   in general agricultural management practices. In a field investigation
   using static chambers, we evaluated the effects of crop residue at three
   different rates -100 \% (R100), 50 \% (R50), and residue removal (R0)
   -on carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux. The field study was conducted in
   corn-wheat rotation under conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems
   in a semi-arid region. The main results showed that CO2 efflux was
   positively correlated with higher soil temperature (0.43-0.79) and
   microbial biomass carbon (0.66-0.89). The crop residue treatments
   affected these traits. A strong positive relationship between CO2 efflux
   and the crop residue (R-2 = 0.96, CT and R-2 = 0.9 for NT) was observed.
   In the CT system, significant increases were detected among residue
   rates on cumulative CO2 efflux, where R100 and R50 resulted in 36 \% and
   25 \% higher cumulative CO2 efflux, respectively, than R0. In contrast,
   there was no significant difference in cumulative CO2 efflux among the
   crop residue retention (R100 and R50) and removal (R0) treatments under
   the NT system. Our study revealed that crop residue retention led to
   increased CO2 efflux under the CT system in semi-arid conditions during
   the first year of application, while under the NT system, CO2 efflux was
   not impacted by crop residue. Our results indicate that there is
   considerable potential for improving soil management practices in the
   context of soil degradation, climate change, increasing crop
   productivity, and carbon (C) sequestration.},

Abstract = {Ants use a variety of semiochemicals for essential activities and have
   been a source for many novel natural products. While ant taxa produce a
   wide variety of chemicals, the chemistry and ecology of male ants have
   remained understudied. Tyramides are a class of compounds that have been
   found only in males of the Myrmicinae ant subfamily. Tyramides found in
   the fire ant Solenopsis invicta are transferred to gynes during mating
   where they are converted to tyramine, leading to rapid reproductive
   development. To further understand the evolution of tyramide production
   in male ants, we determined the tyramide composition in males of 15
   fungus-growing ant species (Formicidae: Myrmicinae: Attini: Attina) and
   a Megalomyrmex species (Formicidae: Myrmicinae: Solenopsidini). Thirteen
   tyramides were identified, four for the first time in natural sources,
   and their percent composition was mapped to the fungus-growing ant
   phylogeny.},

Title = {Odor Perception in the Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, Exposed to
   Juglans regia, a Marginal Host Plant},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 13},
Abstract = {The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is one of the most
   destructive agricultural pests in the world, infesting cotton, maize,
   soybean, and many other crops. In recent years, H. armigera has been
   observed damaging walnuts, Juglans regia, in Xinjiang China. Here we
   examine the chemical perception by H. armigera of the marginal host J.
   regia. In Y-tube olfactometer tests, we found H. armigera females and
   males both showed significant behavioral responses to odors from walnut
   branches. Furthermore, nine electrophysiologically active volatiles
   (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, limonene, eucalyptol, ocimene,
   beta-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-farnesene, and germacrene D) were
   identified from walnuts with gas chromatography coupled with
   electroantennography (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS). Among these volatiles, beta-pinene and eucalyptol were released
   in relatively higher amounts. In electroantennogram (EAG) dose-dependent
   trials, all compounds evoked responses in H. armigera adults when tested
   at high concentrations, with germacrene D evoking the greatest response.
   In wind tunnel tests, H. armigera females preferred eight of the
   electrophysiologically active volatile dilutions compared with clean
   air, while males showed preference for only five compounds. As such we
   describe the chemical recognition of H. armigera for walnut, a marginal
   host. This study contributes to understanding the interaction between
   polyphagous pests and their host plants.},

Abstract = {In most commercial pine farms in southern Brazil, black capuchin causes

   the aroma compounds using SPME-GC-MS. Each technique provided a
   different set of metabolites that we can correlate to monkey
   predilection. The PCA showed monosaccharide (detected by NMR) and
   alpha-pinene (pine-like and resinous flavor descriptors) as attractive
   compounds for monkeys. On the other hand, the low content of
   monosaccharide and the high content of beta-phellandrene (citrus odor
   descriptor) was observed in less attacked pine species (P. patula). The
   data fusion on primary metabolites and aroma compounds corroborated the
   individual analyses, complementing the comprehension of the monkey
   predilection. Thus, P. elliottii was an avoided tree even with high
   content of sugars possibly due to its high content of beta-phellandrene
   (citrus odor). The results are useful for further behavioral studies to
   determine the role that each highlighted metabolite plays in chemically
   mediated animal-plant interactions.},

Abstract = {Climate change constitutes a major challenge for marine urban ecosystems
   and ocean warming will likely strongly affect local communities.
   Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) have been shown to often have higher heat
   resistance than natives, but studies investigating how forthcoming
   global warming might affect them in marine urban environments remain
   scarce, especially in Situ studies. Here we used an in Situ warming
   experiment in a NW Mediterranean (warm temperate) and a NE Atlantic
   (cold temperate) marina to see how global warming might affect recruited
   communities in the near future. In both marinas, warming resulted in
   significantly different community structure, lower biomass, and more
   empty space compared to control. However, while in the warm temperate
   marina, NIS showed an increased surface cover, it was reduced in the
   cold temperate one. Metabolomic analyses on Bugula neritina in the
   Atlantic marina revealed potential heat stress experienced by this
   introduced bryozoan and a potential link between heat stress and the
   expression of a halogenated alkaloid, Caelestine A. The present results
   might indicate that the effects of global warming on the prevalence of
   NIS may differ between geographical provinces, which could be
   investigated by larger scale studies.},

Title = {Tree visitation and potential seed dispersal of keystone Ficus species
   by vertebrates in an urban mosaic landscape in eastern South Africa},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Globally with the human population increase, urban expansion has
   increased, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Visitation of
   fruiting trees by vertebrate frugivores can influence the persistence of
   fleshy fruited trees and so further maintain frugivore communities in
   transformed landscapes. Figs (Ficus spp.) have been recognised as
   keystone plant resources that support diverse frugivorous vertebrate
   communities. Our main objective was to identify the frugivorous
   vertebrates visiting fruiting Ficus trees in an urban mosaic landscape
   of Durban, Ethekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using
   camera traps focused on focal fig trees. We quantified the diurnal and
   nocturnal frugivore visitation rates and levels of interactions. We
   analysed frugivore visits to 12 individual trees of five Ficus species
   between 2019 and 2020. During 3888 h, we recorded a total of 4,071
   videos from camera traps with 10,016 visits and levels of interactions
   of three main vertebrate taxa (8958 fruit bat visits, 808 bird visits
   and 250 monkey visits). These were in five Ficus species (F. buriei, F.
   lutea, F. natalensis, F. sur and F. sycomorus). Of the bird species
   visiting, we identified a total of 34 species, but some species were
   unidentified. We recorded a total of 8958 visits by Wahlberg's
   epauletted fruit bats Epomophorus wahlbergi, and 250 visits by vervet
   monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus. The latter tended to stay for prolonged
   periods in the trees feeding. Our data showed the importance of fruiting
   fig trees for vertebrate frugivores in the urban mosaic landscape. This
   highlights the conservation implications of figs as keystone resources
   in the urban mosaic landscape. Our findings support the planting and
   conservation of native Ficus tree species in transformed urban mosaic
   landscapes for the persistence of forest species biodiversity.},

Title = {Does the consumption of pioneer-tree seeds from flooded forests by
   freshwater sardines affect seed germination?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To understand the ecological relevance of fish-forest interactions, we
   sampled fish for a period of 8 months in a lowland forest of the
   Brazilian Amazon and evaluated the germination of intact seeds recovered
   from the in-testine of three species of congeneric and sympatric
   freshwater sardines, Triportheus albus, T. angulatus and T. auritus. The
   number of seeds consumed by the three fish species and the possible
   effect of individual fish size on seed germination were investigated. We
   captured 150 individual sardines, of which N = 59, contained 982 intact
   seeds from seven flooded forest tree species. All the seeds were already
   pulped due to the digestive process and were sown to check its
   germination rates. We selected two pioneer tree species, Cecropia
   latiloba and Laetia corymbulosa, which were the two most consumed seeds
   to analyze the effects of its passage through the fishes' digestory
   tracts on seed germination rates and speed, compared to intact seeds
   directly collected from trees (control). Seeds harvested from the wild
   were not scarified or scrapep to remove the pulp because of the large
   amount of diminutive seeds of the two pioneer tree species. Fish body
   size did not affect the probability of germination of the consumed seeds
   of C. latiloba or L. corymbulosa. For both plant species, there was a
   reduction in the probability of germination of seeds taken from the
   intestine of fish in relation to control seeds collected in nature.
   Control seeds also germinated faster than those consumed by fish.
   Despite the seemingly negative effects on germination rates and speed
   after passing through the digestory tracts of the freshwater sardines,
   the fishes' ability to transport seeds away from the parent plants can
   compensate for the loss of viability of some of the ingested seeds,
   especially when the proportion of viable seeds remains high.},

Title = {How are arthropod communities structured in a modified wetland under
   different productive activities?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems around the world due
   to changes in land use. Particularly, in the Lower Parana River Delta
   the main productive activities with economic impact in the region are
   planted forest and silvopastoral systems. To carry out these productive
   activities, natural hydrology of this wetland has been deeply modified
   and different management practices are implemented. Ground-dwelling
   arthropods are among the most sensitive taxa to environmental changes,
   so they are good bioindicators of the effect of these changes on
   biodiversity. In this context, we compare the structure and composition
   of ground-dwelling arthropod communities and their seasonal variations
   in the planted forest and silvopastoral systems of the Lower Parana
   River Delta, to characterize these land use associated with different
   management practices. We recorded a total of 73 families using pitfall
   traps (N = 1728). We observed that communities in intensive-managed
   planted forests were less rich and more evenness, while communities in
   less-managed planted forests were richer and less evenness. Also, we
   observed that warm seasons presented more arthropod family richness than
   cold seasons. The intensity of management practices, the presence of
   cattle and seasonality are factors that significantly decrease
   ground-dwelling arthropod richness. So, Silvopastoral systems negatively
   affect ground-dwelling arthropod communities compared to planted forest.
   A decrease in the intensity of management practices favors the
   understory growth, offering more resources for the arthropod families
   already established and facilitating the establishment of new ones. This
   increase in arthropod diversity promotes the presence of benefic species
   and the conservation of biodiversity in this modified wetland ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Frogs of the families Mantellinae and Hyperoliidae possess male specific
   femoral or gular glands that are used during courtship. These glands
   release volatile compounds, e. g. the macrocyclic lactone
   gephyromantolide A (2,6,10-trimethyl-6-undecen-11-olide) in the case of
   Gephyromantis boulengeri (Mantellinae). During the analysis of the
   volatiles of Hyperolius cinnamomeoventris (Hyperoliidae) we detected an
   unknown compound A, which we called cinnamomeoventrolide, whose mass
   spectrum showed high similarity with the spectrum of gephyromantolide A.
   Nevertheless, slight spectral differences led to the proposal of a
   regioisomer of gephyromantolide A as a structure for A,
   2,6,10-trimethyl-5-undecen-11-olide. A versatile synthesis of this
   compound was developed to allow access to all four stereoisomers from a
   single chiral starting material, the so-called (S)-Roche ester, using
   ring-closing metathesis as a key step. With these stereoisomers, the
   absolute configuration of the natural product was established to have
   the (2R,10S)-configuration by GC on a chiral phase. The configuration of
   natural gephyromantolide A is the opposite. Both frogs seem to use a
   similar biosynthetic pathway to access the target compounds, differing
   in the stereochemistry of the reduction steps, and requiring an
   additional isomerization in case of G. boulengeri. This unique
   regioisomeric differentiation of double bonds in semiochemicals has so
   far only been observed in insects. The compounds are likely to play a
   role in species-recognition of the frogs.},

   Profiles in Dung Beetles: The Importance of Dung Odor Bouquets},

Abstract = {The detection of dung odors is a crucial step in the food-searching
   behavior of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea). Yet, whether
   certain compounds characteristic of a given dung type contribute to a
   `choosy generalism' behavior proposed for this taxonomic group is
   unknown. To address this, we analyzed the chemical composition of three
   types of dung (cow, horse, and rabbit) and conducted behavioral and
   electroantennogram (EAG) bioassays on 15 species of dung beetles using
   19 volatile organic compounds representing the three dung samples.
   Chemical analyses revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative
   differences among dung types. When offered these food options in an
   olfactometer, 14 species exhibited a feeding preference. Surprisingly,
   all 19 compounds used in the EAG assays elicited antennal responses,
   with species displaying different olfactory profiles. The relationship
   between behavioral preferences and electrophysiological profiles
   highlighted that species with different food preferences had differences
   in antennal responses. Moreover, a specific set of EAG-active compounds
   (nonanal, sabinene, acetophenone, rho-cresol, 2-heptanone, 1H-indole,
   and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) were the strongest drivers in the distinct
   sensory profiles of the trophic preference groups. Our results point to
   the importance of the whole bouquet of dung-emanating compounds in
   driving food-searching behavior, but specific volatiles could aid in
   determining highly marked trophic preferences in certain species.},

Title = {Reasons to move far away: studying the drivers of Carpetania matritensis
   (Hormogastridae: Crassiclitelatta) dispersal behaviour},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dispersal is a crucial process for animal populations as it allows the
   colonisation of new habitats and the maintenance of genetic diversity.
   However, it has not been studied enough for soil fauna, which is the
   basis for a wide variety of ecosystem services. Therefore, the study of
   their dispersal and the factors that trigger this behaviour is a
   relevant area of knowledge for the maintenance of the services they
   provide. For this work, Carpetania matritensis, an endogeic earthworm
   species endemic to the central Iberian Peninsula, has been used as a
   model to study the effect of habitat quality and conspecific density on
   dispersal and exploratory behaviour. The experiment was carried out in
   horizontal mesocosms divided into three sectors of the same dimensions:
   an inoculation section (left), a crossing section (centre) and a target
   sector (right). Those sectors were occupied by soil, a favourable
   habitat for earthworms, or sand, which represents an unsuitable habitat
   for earthworms and a physical barrier for their displacement. Earthworms
   were inoculated at two different densities (2 and 6 in-dividuals per
   mesocosm; 848.86 and 2546.58 individuals/m3 respectively) and at two
   experimental durations (4 and 8 days) for each of the three different
   experimental treatments (unsuitable-unsuitable-suitable (U-U-S),
   suitable-unsuitable-suitable (S-U-S) and suitable-suitable-suitable
   (S-S-S), depending on the habitat type filling the inoculation, crossing
   and target section respectively). The results showed a large effect of
   treatment on the dispersal rate, being higher when earthworms were
   inoculated in an adverse environment, establishing habitat quality as a
   driver of the species' dispersal behaviour. No significant effects of
   conspecific density, experimental duration or its interactions were
   found. Further studies are needed to clarify the species dispersal
   behaviour with a view to its conservation.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the effect on litter decomposition of the
   geographical and land-use gradient from the dry Cerrado in Mato Grosso
   to the southern Amazonian rainforest in Par ` a, Brazil. The study area
   also rep-resents a gradient of land-use intensification, reaching from
   the southern Cerrado region which had the most active land use change
   and agricultural intensification in the past to the northern rainforest
   region where agricultural use is currently intensifying. We assessed the
   effects on litter decomposition of climate (seasonality: rainy vs dry),
   litter quality (litter type: standard maize litter vs local habitat
   litter), disturbance (land-use: forest vs pasture vs cropland), soil
   organisms (soil fauna: inclusion vs exclusion), and original land
   cover/vegetation gradient (region: savanna vs transitional zone vs rain
   forest). Our results showed that the contribution of the different soil
   organism groups (mesh size) to litter decomposition was strongly
   influenced by the change in land -use, but also by the original
   land-cover/vegetation of the region. The overall effect of climate
   seasonality on decomposition was particularly pronounced at higher
   latitudes, whereas at lower latitudes only minimal effects were found.},

Abstract = {Tephritid fruit flies are major horticultural pests of fruit and
   vegetable crops. Developing an odour lure that can attract mated female
   flies under field conditions has presented a major challenge to chemical
   ecologists around the globe. We have designed a new lure to attract
   female Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, based on the knowledge
   that this pest tephritid is attracted not only to odours from ripening
   fruits, but also to odours of symbiotic (gut-associated) yeasts on which
   the larvae feed. Initial field trials screened four volatile mixtures,
   each containing a base mix of three, short-chain ``fruit ripening{''}
   esters and differing in the addition of long-chain ``fruity{''} esters
   and / or alcohols produced by live yeasts. Results demonstrated that the
   lure formulated from short-chain esters and live yeast alcohols
   attracted the most female flies, with significantly higher catches than
   an odourless control trap, and a protein-baited trap. As
   electrophysiological studies exploring peripheral responses in
   tephritids to alcohols associated with fermentation have not been
   extensively investigated, we conducted this work on both the antennae
   and maxillary palps, and discovered that three yeast alcohols were
   detected by both sensory organs. Performance trials conducted in pome
   fruit and stone fruit orchards evaluated the six-component blend of
   short-chain ester and live yeast alcohol lure against a commercially
   available synthetic fruit-odour lure and a protein-based lure. In the
   apple orchard, the new lure caught significantly more female flies, and
   in particular mated females, compared to the commercially available
   lures. In the stone fruit orchard, while the new lure again caught the
   most mated female flies compared to the other lures, differences were
   not significant. The visual stimulus (trap design) used had a
   significant effect on capture, with a Ladd trap (red sphere on a yellow
   panel) being considerably more effective than the other traps. We
   discuss the implications of this study, including why the degree of
   effectiveness of the new lure might have differed among the test
   orchards (citrus, apple, stonefruit), and why yeast odours might
   increase attractiveness to ``ripening fruit{''} volatile blends under
   field conditions.},

Abstract = {In a previous study, we reported the identification and synthesis of a
   male-specific sex pheromone component of the stink bug, Pellaea
   stictica, as the alcohol 2,4,8,13-tetramethyltetradecan-1-ol (1). To
   establish the correlation between the stereochemistry of the pheromone
   and its bioactivity, it first was necessary to determine its absolute
   configuration. For this purpose, a series of syntheses were designed to:
   (a) furnish a mixture of all possible stereoisomers; (b) a narrowed down
   group of diastereomers, and (c) one specific enantiomer. A crucial step
   in the syntheses involved a coupling reaction between two key
   intermediates: a phosphonium salt and an aldehyde, through a Wittig
   olefination. Nuclear magnetic resonance data of a mixture of the
   synthetic pheromone diastereomers and further comparison of GC retention
   times with that of the natural product by gas chromatography suggested
   that the methyl branches at C2 and C4 were in a syn relationship,
   reducing the possibilities to only four of the eight possible
   stereoisomers. Employing GC analysis, chiral derivatization reagents and
   synthetic (8R)-2,4-syn-1 it was possible to confirm the configuration of
   the methyl branch at C8 as R, reducing the number of possible
   stereoisomers to two. After enantioselective synthesis of (2R,4R,8R)-1,
   the absolute configurations of all methyl branches of the natural

Title = {Acquisition of nitrogen from tannin protein complexes in ectomycorrhizal
   pine seedlings},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal and ericoid fungi are increasingly recognized for their
   capacity to break down soil organic matter and getting access to organic
   nitrogen (N). In many forest ecosystems proteins complexed by
   plantproduced tannins constitute a substantial amount of organic N. Yet,
   it is currently unknown to what extent these N sources are accessible to
   ectomycorrhizae and their associated plants. In a pot experiment, we
   provided ectomycorrhizal pine (Pinus pinea) seedlings with exactly the
   same amount of N either in mineral form, as protein, or as two different
   tannin-protein complexes, formed with commercially available tannins or
   tannins isolated from pine leaf litter. Over a period of 18 months, pine
   seedlings grew at least two times bigger in all Ntreatments. However,
   growth and N acquisition were roughly two and three times larger,
   respectively, with mineral N or protein supply compared to
   tannin-protein complexes as the sole N source (no difference between the
   two different complexes). With tannin-protein complexes, pine seedlings
   allocated relatively more biomass into fine roots. In addition, the
   decrease in tissue N concentration in the tannin-protein complex
   treatments was lower in fine roots (30\%) than in needles (53\%). Our
   results showed that tannins strongly influence N nutrition in
   ectomycorrhizal pine seedlings. Tannin-protein complexes are an
   accessible N source for ectomycorrhizal pine seedlings although they
   grew better with easier accessible N. The respective contributions of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi and other free or root-associated microorganisms
   in the breakdown of tannin protein complexes recquires further
   exploration. Tannin-protein complexes may be an important N source in
   ecosystems where organic nitrogen dominates, but the respective
   contributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi and other free or root-associated
   microorganisms in the breakdown of tannin protein complexes recquires
   further exploration.},

Title = {Nematode contributions to the soil food web trophic structure of two
   contrasting boreal peatlands in Canada},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93-94},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Free-living soil nematodes span several trophic levels and play a key
   role in soil food webs. As such, the relative abundances and diversity
   of nematode feeding groups, along with nematode body size that is
   correlated with trophic transfer efficiency may provide useful
   information in understanding carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil
   systems. Yet, despite their role in soil carbon dynamics, there is a
   lack of knowledge regarding nematode trophic diversity in high carbon
   storage systems such as boreal peatlands. Here we assessed nematode
   communities using feeding groups (bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores,
   omnivores, and predators) based on mouthpart morphology, and their body
   sizes (length and mass) in two contrasting boreal peatlands in Northern
   Ontario, Canada that differ in vegetation (Sphagnum vs Carex),
   hydrology, nutrient availability, and microbial decomposition. We found
   that nematode trophic diversity was higher in the Sphagnum-dominated
   fen, and that the dominant nematode group corresponded to the dominant
   microbial group at each site. Predatory nematodes were significantly
   more abundant and larger in the Sphagnum-dominated fen, consistent with
   greater food web complexity, but the average body size of nematodes (all
   feeding groups included) was not significantly different between the
   fens. Taken together, these observed trends in nematode feeding groups
   and body sizes, along with higher microbial biomass in the
   Sphagnum-dominated fen supports the idea that the two sites may differ
   ecologically, and generally follow differences in microbial communities.
   Our study provides important baseline information for understanding
   peatland soil food web dynamics and their implications for carbon and
   nutrient dynamics.},

Title = {Earthworms regulate the nematode community by directly enhancing the
   bacterial-based energy channel rather than through the effect of casts},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Earthworms and their casts act as biocatalysts and regulators of the
   biotic and abiotic processes in soil ecosys-tems. However, the relative
   importance of the presence of earthworms and earthworm casts in
   affecting other soil biota remains underexplored. In this study, we
   conducted a manipulative mesocosm experiment in a 30-year -old
   subtropical broadleaved plantation forest to determine how epi-endogeic
   earthworms (Amynthas corticis) and their casts affect soil nematode
   communities individually and additively. We found that the addition of
   the epi-endogeic earthworms significantly increased the proportion of
   the Ba1 guild nematodes and enhanced the enrichment index of the soil
   nematode community, but decreased the channel index. These results
   indicate that the soils become enriched in nutrients with a higher
   activity in bacterial-based decomposition pathways in the presence of
   earthworms. However, cast addition alone had a minor effect on soil
   nematodes. Results of a redundancy analysis suggest that elevated
   contents of soil ammonium and available phosphorous were the major
   influencing factors on soil nematode abundances in the presence of
   epi-endogeic earthworms. Our results indicate that epi-endogeic
   earthworms rather than through their casts contributed to the
   structuring of the nematode communities and enhancing of the
   bacterial-based energy channel. This finding contributes to our
   understanding of soil biodiversity maintenance mechanisms and how the
   relationship of the soil biota affects their functions in soil food
   webs.},

Title = {Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil
   attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in
   the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density,
   and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to
   intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity,
   and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers,
   are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The
   slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in
   Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other
   regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its
   potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with
   soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in
   the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often
   used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by
   land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates
   the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch
   system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density,
   and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical
   and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and
   secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil
   fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity
   and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional
   groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with
   slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change.
   Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth
   forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil
   invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their
   conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show
   the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance
   the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil
   quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of
   soil functionality and agriculture productivity.},

Abstract = {Information on factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality of
   the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena
   mysticetus) is fundamental to its successful management and recovery.
   The Alaska Arctic coastline is remote and expansive, making monitoring
   for and gross examination of carcasses difficult. However, sighting data
   and imagery collected during aerial surveys in the eastern Chukchi (EC)
   and western Beaufort (WB) seas from 2009 through 2019 provide
   information on bowhead whale mortality. We present bowhead whale carcass
   data from the 2019 aerial surveys that add to the long series of
   consistent information on floating and beach-cast bowhead whale
   carcasses. The 2019 carcass data suggest an increased occurrence of
   probable killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation on bowhead whales in the
   WB. Eleven bowhead whale carcasses were photo-documented from July to
   October 2019 in the EC and WB study areas. Of the 11 carcasses
   documented, 7 had injuries consistent with probable killer whale
   predation-2 in the EC and 5 in the WB. Probable cause of death could not
   be assigned to four carcasses. No carcasses were associated with
   aboriginal subsistence hunting. Despite similar annual survey effort
   from 2009 to 2019, several compelling deviations in carcass numbers and
   locations were observed in 2019. Compared to 2009-2018, 2019 had the
   highest yearly number of documented carcasses and the most categorized
   as probable killer whale predation. Carcass locations exhibited a
   striking shift from the EC to the WB. Lastly, more carcasses were
   categorized as probable killer whale predation in the WB during 2019
   than in 2009-2018 combined.},

Abstract = {Research surveys provide the foundation for sound, effective management
   of fishery resources and are integral to observing fish population
   trends. However, bias in sampling gear and operating hours may confound
   observed shifts in species distributions over space and time. Within
   North Pacific waters off Alaska, Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus)
   support a large, commercial fishery and is an example of a species that
   experiences spatial and temporal shifts. Seasonal migratory shifts are
   difficult to incorporate into stock assessment models and are further
   complicated if research surveys do not effectively sample the underlying
   size distributions. In the Bering Sea, differences in median fish size
   between the winter Pacific cod bottom-trawl fishery (directed) and the
   summer research survey have been observed since the onset of the surveys
   in the 1980s (66 and 41 cm, respectively). Because of this, it has been
   suggested that large Pacific cod may not be available to the summer
   research survey for varying reasons. In this study, we compared
   standardized observations of mature Pacific cod length distributions
   from a summer multi-species fishery with the National Marine Fisheries
   Service summer research survey from 2009 to 2018 in the Bering Sea.
   Controlling for spatiotemporal effects, there was no difference detected
   in Pacific cod length distributions between the fishery and survey,
   suggesting that the survey accurately captures the entire size
   distribution of Pacific cod in the summer. Although standardized
   research surveys are considered to be representative samples of the
   entire population, using non-random fishery observations, where the
   fishery and survey spatiotemporally overlap, can validate survey
   observations and inform selectivity relationships in stock assessment
   models.},

Abstract = {Changes to Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) habitat and
   foraging behavior may affect exposure to both toxic and essential trace
   elements in walrus tissue. This study measured the trace element
   concentrations of silver (Ag), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co),
   copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), total (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg),
   selenium (Se), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in walrus skeletal muscle
   sampled during 2009-2015. Females had significantly higher
   concentrations of THg (p = 0.021), MeHg (p = 0.037), Cd (p = 0.021), Cu
   (p = 0.003), and Se (p = 0.001) compared to males. Females with no calf
   had significantly higher concentrations of Cd compared to females with a
   calf (p = 0.001) and pregnant females and females with a calf had
   significantly lower Se concentrations compared to females with a
   yearling or no calf (p < 0.05). Bering Sea males had significantly
   higher Ni concentrations (p = 0.001) and significantly lower Se (p =
   0.006) and Zn concentrations (p = 0.001) compared to other locations.
   THg, MeHg, and As tissue concentrations decreased with age (p < 0.01),
   suggesting these toxic elements are not accumulating in this tissue
   while Cd increased with age (p < 0.05). The narrower range in element
   concentrations among pregnant and nursing females may indicate less
   variation in prey species, and coupled with the reproductive needs for
   essential elements, suggests they may be more vulnerable to changes in
   prey availability compared to other walruses.},

Title = {Persistent organic pollutants and mercury in a colony of Antarctic
   seabirds: higher concentrations in 1998, 2001, and 2003 compared to 2014
   to 2016},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Over decades, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace metals like
   mercury (Hg) have reached the remotest areas of the world such as
   Antarctica by atmospheric transport. Once deposited in polar areas, low
   temperatures, and limited solar radiation lead to long environmental
   residence times, allowing the toxic substances to accumulate in biota.
   We investigated the load of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs) and metabolites (DDEs, DDDs) in
   embryos from failed eggs of the smallest seabird breeding in Antarctica,
   the Wilson's storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) at King George Island
   (Isla 25 de Mayo). We compared samples of different developmental stages
   collected in 2001, 2003, and 2014 to 2016 to investigate changes in
   pollutant concentrations over time. We detected eight PCBs including the
   dioxin-like (dl) congeners PCB 105 and 118 (sigma PCBs: 59-3403 ng g(-1)
   ww) as well as 4,4'-DDE, and 4,4'-DDD (sigma DDX: 19-1035 ng g(-1) ww)
   in the embryos. Samples from the years 2001 and 2003 showed higher
   concentrations of PCBs than those from 2014 to 2016. Concentrations of
   DDX was similar in both time intervals. Furthermore, we determined Hg
   concentrations in egg membranes from 1998 to 2003, and 2014 to 2016.
   Similar to PCBs, Hg in egg membranes were higher in 1998 than in 2003,
   and higher in 2003 than in the years 2014 to 2016, suggesting a slow
   recovery of the pelagic Antarctic environment from the detected legacy
   pollutants. Embryos showed an increase in pollutant concentrations
   within the last third of their development. This finding indicates that
   contaminant concentrations may differ among developmental stages, and it
   should be taken into account in analyses on toxic impact during
   embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {The main target of this paper is to improve the knowledge of the species
   composition of sea stars in Patagonian Argentine deep sea reaching
   depths of 2062 m. In addition, these results offer us the opportunity to
   analyze the possible connections between Argentinian marine fauna and
   adjacent Antarctic areas that have become a topic of interest in the
   past few years. This work is based on Atlantic Projects' surveys carried
   out on an atypical and especially vulnerable marine ecosystems (canyons
   created from craters collapse by gas leaks). These are profusely
   impacted by frequent fishing activities, being one of the most important
   and international fishing grounds, where 887 records (1878 specimens) of
   41 species of asteroids were collected in 217 stations ranging from 219
   to 2062 m in depth. Seven of those species are proposed as new records:
   (Diplasterias octoradiata (Studer 1885), Plutonaster bifrons (Wyville
   Thomson, 1873), Radiaster elegans Perrier, 1881, Anseropoda antarctica
   Fisher, 1940, Pillsburiaster calvus Mah, 2011, Paralophaster lorioli
   (Koehler, 1907), Pteraster flabellifer Mortensen 1933). After refining
   the database built from literature and open-access databases such as
   OBIS and AntBIF, the new Argentinian asteroids deep-water checklist
   contains 2198 records from 64 asteroids species including the 7 new
   records proposed. Most of these 64 species (89.06\%) are present in
   Antarctic-adjacent waters, and after the study of their occurrences at
   traditional biogeographic entities, our results support the hypothesis
   that Argentinian waters (in the case of the class Asteroidea) should be
   considered part of the sub-Antarctic entity.},

   predation risk, and shorebird daily nest survival near Churchill by
   measuring these variables at varying distances from town during two
   nesting seasons. Active fox dens decreased in number close to town;
   however, there was no clear trend in avian predator abundance in
   relation to town. Predation risk on artificial nests decreased as
   distances from active fox dens and Parasitic Jaeger (Stercorarius
   parasiticus) nests increased, decreased with proximity to town, and
   decreased with a camera present. Shorebird daily nest survival tended to
   be lower near jaeger nests and there was some support for a positive
   effect of camera presence and proximity to town. Overall, these results
   suggest that shorebird nest survival in the sub-Arctic can be heavily
   impacted by proximity to nests of avian predators, but that shorebirds
   may benefit from proximity to town likely due to reduced fox denning
   activity.},

Abstract = {Copepods of the genera Calanus and Pseudocalanus are important
   components of Arctic marine ecosystems. Despite the key roles of these
   zooplankters, little is known about the organisms they interact with
   most intimately, their parasites and symbionts. We applied metabarcode
   sequencing to uncover eukaryotic parasites present within these two
   copepod genera from three areas around the high Arctic archipelago of
   Svalbard. Ten distinct parasite groups were observed: four different
   Apostome ciliates, four different dinoflagellates (Chytriodinium sp.,
   Ellobiopsis sp., Thalassomyces sp., and Hematodinium sp.), a Paradinium
   sp., and a trematode. Apostome ciliates closely related to
   Pseudocollinia spp. were the most commonly observed parasite, with
   overall infection rates of 21.5\% in Calanus and 12.5\% in
   Pseudocalanus. Infection by these ciliates varied seasonally, with no
   infections observed in early winter, but infection rates exceeding 75\%
   in spring. Host specificity varied between parasites, with significant
   differences in infection rate between the two host copepod genera for
   four parasites (two ciliates, Chytriodinium, and a trematode). The
   diverse assemblage of parasites observed in these copepods, and the
   frequency of infection, with over one in five copepod individuals
   infected, suggest parasites may be playing a greater role in Arctic
   plankton communities than generally acknowledged.},

Abstract = {The inshore waters off the Argentine Islands host a diversified benthic
   fish community largely dominated by the black rockcod, Notothenia
   coriiceps. Compared to other areas along the western Antarctic
   Peninsula, the feeding habits of this species in this location are
   poorly known. Hence, the aim of the study is to assess food preferences
   by the stomach content examination, applying a sophisticated analytical
   approach. As reported elsewhere, the black rockcod is omnivorous,
   relying primarily on algae, gastropods, amphipods, euphausiids and
   fishes, each consumed with different foraging strategies. Based on
   multidimensional scaling statistical procedures, fish size and water
   depth are the primarily contributers to prey resource diversification
   and partitioning. Overall the sampled population of the black rockcod
   are generalist feeders with a relatively high between-phenotype
   component to the niche width, consisting of specialized individuals with
   little or no overlap in food resource use.},

Title = {Structure of virioplankton and viral lysis of prokaryotes on the shelf

Abstract = {A small amount of information about the composition and functioning of
   prokaryotes and viruses in the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas makes
   it impossible to provide a quantitative assessment of all parameters of
   the carbon cycle which is necessary to analyze and predict the impact of
   climate change on the entire Arctic biota. Of particular interest are
   the areas of the inner and outer shelf of the Arctic seas which are, on
   the one hand, a zone of mixing of river and sea waters of the Ob,
   Yenisei, Lena, Indigirka and Kolyma rivers with a large amount of the
   smallest detrital particles; on the other hand, it is a zone of highly
   saline marine areas, which determined the task of our study. The modern
   methods of studying the structural and functional characteristics of
   microorganisms are used in the work: epifluorescence microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy; the growth rate and production of
   plankton heterotrophic prokaryotes were determined by dilution method in
   situ and the method involving application of antibiotics, modified for
   natural habitats. On the shelf of the Siberian Arctic seas, the
   abundance of free viruses, frequency of visibly infected prokaryotic
   cells and viral-mediated mortality of prokaryotes values varied within
   0.1-13.6 x 10(6) viruses mL(-1), 0.2-5.6\% abundance of prokaryotes,
   1.4-64.4\% production of heterotrophic prokaryotes, respectively. We
   suggest that the input of a large amount of the smallest organic
   particles on which a significant amount of viruses is absorbed into the
   coastal waters of the Siberian seas (including riverine-marine water
   mixing zone) leads to a decrease in viral infection and mortality of
   prokaryotes.},

   environmental change},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Wolverines (Gulo gulo) occupy most of the globe's Arctic tundra. Given
   the rapidly warming climate and expanding human activity in this biome,
   understanding wolverine ecology, and therefore the species'
   vulnerability to such changes, is increasingly important for developing
   research priorities and effective management strategies. Here, we review
   and synthesize knowledge of wolverines in the Arctic using both Western
   science sources and available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) to improve our
   understanding of wolverine ecology in the Arctic and better predict the
   species' susceptibility to change. To accomplish this, we update the
   pan-Arctic distribution map of wolverines to account for recent
   observations and then discuss resulting inference and uncertainties. We
   use these patterns to contextualize and discuss potential underlying
   drivers of distribution and population dynamics, drawing upon knowledge
   of food habits, habitat associations, and harvest, as well as studies of
   wolverine ecology elsewhere. We then identify four broad areas to
   prioritize conservation and research efforts: (1) Monitoring trends in
   population abundance, demographics, and distribution and the drivers
   thereof, (2) Evaluating and predicting wolverines' responses to ongoing
   climate change, particularly the consequences of reduced snow and sea
   ice, and shifts in prey availability, (3) Understanding wolverines'
   response to human development, including the possible impact of
   wintertime over-snow travel and seismic testing to reproductive denning,
   as well as vulnerability to hunting and trapping associated with
   increased human access, and (4) Ensuring that current and future harvest
   are sustainable.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {In Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen), we quantified the zonation of visually
   dominant macroalgal taxa and of detached macroalgae from underwater
   videos taken in summer 2009 at six transects between 2 and 138 m water
   depth. For the first time, we provide information on the occurrence of
   deep water red algae below the kelp forest and of detached macroalgae at
   water depth > 30 m. The presence and depth distribution of visually
   dominant red algae were especially pronounced at the outer fjord,
   decreased with proximity to the glacial front and they were absent at
   the innermost locations. Deepest crustose coralline red algae and
   foliose red algae were observed at 72 and 68 m, respectively. Brown
   algae were distributed along the entire fjord axis at 2-32 m. Green
   algae were only present at the middle to inner fjord and at areas
   influenced by physical disturbance at water depths of 2-26 m. With
   proximity to the inner fjord the depth distribution of all macroalgae
   became shallower and only extended to 18 m depth at the innermost
   location. Major recipients of detached macroalgae were sites at the
   shallower inner fjord and at the middle fjord below the photic zone at
   depths to 138 m. They may either fuel deep water secondary production,
   decompose or support carbon sequestration. Univariate and community
   analyses of macroalgal classes including detached macroalgae across
   transects and over depths reveal a considerable difference in community
   structure between the outermost sites, the central part and the inner
   fjord areas, reflecting the strong environmental gradients along glacial
   fjords.},

Abstract = {Studying life-history traits is critical to understanding the
   intraspecific variation among fish populations. In this research, we
   investigated the age, growth, and sexual maturity of Galaxias maculatus
   population from Laguna Negra (LN), the southernmost landlocked
   population of the species, and compared the results obtained with those
   obtained before for the diadromous population from Arroyo Negro (AN),
   1.8 km away from LN. We read otolith growth bands to estimate age
   structure and calculated the gonadosomatic index to estimate sexual
   maturity. We found five age classes (0 + to 4 +) in LN; the maximum age
   was 4.5 years, the maximum documented age for the species, exceeding in
   1 year the maximum age found previously for the AN population. Age class
   2 + was the most represented throughout the year, and the greater age
   and length-at-age ratio observed in this landlocked population suggest a
   slower growth rate than that of AN. We hypothesize that landlocked
   individuals reach their first sexual maturity 1 year later than their
   diadromous counterparts. The protracted reproductive season detected in
   this landlocked population (9 months) may be related to the high size
   variability within age classes, where some individuals might maximize
   growth while others might maximize first sexual maturity. Our results
   suggest higher energetic costs for these basic biological activities in
   landlocked than diadromous populations from Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.
   Further studies are necessary to understand the trade-off between growth
   and sexual maturation in sub-Antarctic G. maculatus populations.},

Abstract = {Planktonic ciliates are important components of microzooplankton in
   marine pelagic ecosystems. However, the study of planktonic ciliate
   distribution in different water masses of the Southern Ocean was scarce.
   We investigated planktonic ciliate distribution in different water
   masses of the Cosmonaut and Cooperation Seas during December 6, 2019 to
   January 6, 2020. Tintinnids contributed 5.97\% and 3.65\% to total
   planktonic ciliate abundance and biomass, respectively. Both total
   planktonic ciliate and aloricate ciliate abundances were highest in the
   Winter Water (WW), while tintinnid abundance was highest in the Summer
   Surface Water (SSW). The biomasses of total planktonic ciliates and
   aloricate ciliates were highest in SSW, while that of tintinnids was
   highest in WW. The lowest values were all observed in the Circumpolar
   Deep Water (CDW). Fourteen tintinnid species were grouped into three
   types based on their distribution characteristics: Type I
   (Amphorellopsis quinquealata, Codonellopsis gaussi, Cymatocylis
   antarctica, Cymatocylis cf. calyciformis, Cymatocylis cf. convallaria,
   Salpingella faurei, and Salpingella sp.) species distributed in all the
   water masses; Type II species (Cymatocylis cf. cristallina, Cymatocylis
   cf. drygalskii, and Laackmanniella naviculaefera) were found in SSW and
   WW; and Type III species (Amphorides laackmanni, S. costata, S.
   laackmanni, and one undefined species) were restricted to WW and CDW.
   Our results characterize the distribution patterns and influencing
   factors of planktonic ciliates in different water masses in the
   Cosmonaut and Cooperation Seas, which will be helpful to understand the
   pelagic assemblage variation and constitute a baseline for studying the
   marine food web variation in the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Diet, isotopic niche, and spatial distribution of the white-headed
   petrel (Pterodroma lessonii) at Kerguelen Islands},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {45},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The subantarctic white-headed petrel is unique amongst Procellariidae by
   its biennial breeding frequency. Its food and feeding ecology is poorly
   known with limited available bio-logging data and no dietary and
   isotopic information. Our goal was to detail its prey species and
   isotopic niche at Kerguelen Islands, which is the most important
   breeding site in the Indian Ocean. Analysis of stomach contents (n = 56)
   indicated chicks were fed on fish (68\% by mass) and secondarily on
   cephalopods (26\%), whilst crustaceans were minor dietary components.
   Mesopelagic fishes were the main prey, with myctophids and melamphaids
   being the most important fish family in terms of both abundance (50\%
   and 15\% of the fish, respectively) and diversity (10 and three
   species). Prey distribution indicated that petrels foraged primarily in
   subantarctic waters and secondarily further south to feed their chicks,
   which is corroborated by the lower blood delta C-13 values of fledglings
   (n = 10) than incubating adults (n = 9). Body feather delta C-13 values
   (n = 45) indicate that adult white-headed petrels moulted over different
   latitudinal habitats, from the subtropics to Antarctica where delta N-15
   values showed they fed on low trophic-level prey (most likely Antarctic
   krill). Indeed, three geolocator-tracked birds ranged widely, from the
   mid-Atlantic (18 degrees W) to the eastern Indian Ocean (110 degrees E)
   and from the warmer Subtropical Zone (19\% of the locations), across the
   Subantarctic Zone (58\%) to the colder Antarctic Zone (23\%). Neither
   fishery-related items nor plastic debris were found in chick food
   samples, thus indicating no significant interactions with human
   activities, which is a key positive issue for the conservation of
   white-headed petrels.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1459-1463},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Living specimens of the macroalga Palmaria decipiens were collected from
   100 m depth, representing a new confirmed depth record, considerably
   exceeding the previous record of 42 m depth. Previous deeper collections
   (below conventional SCUBA depths) have relied on dredge/grab samples or
   drop camera surveys. Remote techniques cannot conclusively prove that
   macroalgae are living at these depths, as algae detach from shallower
   substrata, e.g., through ice scouring, and drift to depths below their
   growth limit. This, combined with a low rate of decay of macroalgae
   around Antarctica, requires validation that algal samples from depth
   have grown in situ. Estimates of macroalgal biomass, energy fluxes, and
   the potential energy fixation may need adjusting to consider the deeper
   growing depths particularly with glacial retreat along the Antarctic
   Peninsula revealing areas of rocky substrata for macroalgal
   colonisation. The confirmed extension of depth where macroalgae can grow
   will have implications for assessments of benthic productivity and food
   webs in Antarctica.},

Title = {Diet of adult and immature imperial cormorants, Leucocarbo atriceps,

   analysis of stable isotopes of pellet membrane},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The use of combined conventional and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to
   study the diet of seabirds has become very frequent. Unfortunately,
   information on the trophic ecology of immature seabirds remains scarce
   because the sampling of tissues to perform SIA is often very limited due
   to the difficulty to capture these birds. The koilin membrane, which
   covers the regurgitated pellet casts of some seabirds, could offer an
   interesting non-intrusive alternative tissue to perform SIA. In this
   two-year study of the diet of imperial cormorants in southern Patagonia,
   we (1) compare the diets of breeding and non-breeding birds through
   conventional pellet analysis; (2) describe the diet of breeding adults
   and chicks through a combined method of pellet analysis and whole blood
   SIA; and finally, (3) compare SIA values of breeding adults obtained
   from blood with those obtained from koilin membranes. We found that
   immature individuals incorporated abundant invertebrate taxons, compared
   with breeding adults which relied mainly on fish. Younger and
   inexperienced individuals, which are not under the constraint to feed
   chicks, are feeding on more predictable, but lower trophic and less
   energetic prey. By comparing the stable isotope values of koilin and
   blood in breeding adults, a correlated interannual difference between
   the two seasons was found. Under the light of our results, the koilin
   offers an encouraging alternative to blood in the study of trophic
   ecology, particularly for ages or stages in which capture is not
   possible.},

Abstract = {Fin (Balaenoptera physalus, Linnaeus 1758) and humpback (Megaptera
   novaeangliae, Borowski 1781) whales feed during the austral summer in
   Antarctic waters. Despite the spatial (two-dimensional) sympatry of both
   species, they exhibit trophic segregation (three-dimensional). We used
   multitemporal presence-only data of fin and humpback whales and
   Antarctic hill (Euphausia superba, Dana 1852) combined with
   environmental variables to produce species distribution models (SDMs).
   We aimed to (1) determine the environmental suitability in the Southern
   Ocean for fin and humpback whales and hill, with field validation in a
   region of interest, (2) calculate the areas of spatial overlap between
   the two whale species and between the whales and hill and (3) quantify
   the presence of the target species within the protected areas from the
   world database on protected areas (WDPA). All the SDMs had high
   performances, with AUC and TSS values higher than 0.8. On a
   circum-Antarctic scale, fin whales had northern distributions, whilst
   humpbacks had southern distributions. There was a spatial overlap of
   47\% between whales and 16\% between them and hill. Nearly 92\% of fin
   whale sightings overlapped spatially with their binary predictions, this
   value was 91\% for humpback whales. For fin whales, 2\% of their
   environmental suitability was projected in some WDPA areas, and this
   value was 4\% for humpback whales and 15\% for hill. Despite
   international efforts, the environmental niches of target species are
   partially protected by the WDPA, mainly where the spatial overlap
   between species was greatest. The anthropic and climatic pressures that
   Antarctica is experiencing challenge us to propose new responsible
   scientific responses to environmental dynamics and biodiversity.

Abstract = {Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are
   critical molecules in the global sulfur cycle and in climate regulation.
   Bacterial DMSP-dependent DMS production is an important natural source
   of DMS. The aim of the present work was to use RNA-seq technology to
   investigate the changes in gene expression profiles of Antarctic
   Rhodococcus sp. NJ-530 in response to DMSP, and the possible mechanism
   of DMSP metabolism. In this study, Rhodococcus sp. NJ-530 cells were
   exposed to 0 (control) and 1 mM DMSP for 9 h. The results showed that
   DMSP induces transcriptional changes to Rhodococcus sp. NJ-530. DMSP
   caused upregulation of several genes that may play a potential role in
   DMSP metabolization. Additionally, transcriptome analysis of DMSP
   metabolism determinized a total of 1159 differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) between two treatment strategies. qRT-PCR was performed to
   further confirm the changes in these results. GO and KEGG enrichment
   analyses showed that DMS production is the result of the coordinated
   action of a multitude of DMSP lysis-associated genes along a pathway,
   including absorption mechanism, secondary metabolisms, and cellular
   signaling. In conclusion, our data indicated that DMSP exposure induced
   DMSP cleavage pathway activity, and the effects on the gene expression
   profile of strain NJ-530 were analyzed at the transcriptional level
   during the degradation of DMSP. This work provided insight into the
   transcriptional characterization of Rhodococcus sp. NJ-530 in response
   to DMSP and contributed to clarifying the biodegradation and underlying
   mechanism of DMSP in Rhodococcus sp. NJ-530.},

Title = {Molecular dietary analysis of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Gentoo
   (Pygoscelis papua) penguins breeding sympatrically on Antarctic Ardley
   Island using fecal DNA},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Penguins are one of the key components of the Antarctic ecosystem.
   Changes in penguin population size can indicate Antarctic ecosystem
   change. The two species of pygoscelid penguins, Adelie (Pygoscelis
   adeliae) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, breed sympatrically on
   Ardley Island, King George Island, Antarctica. However, there has been
   an increase in the Gentoo penguin breeding population and a decline in
   the Adelie penguin breeding population on the island. Whether the
   difference in population fluctuations between the two penguin groups is
   connected to their diet remains uncertain. Herein, the 18S ribosomal
   ribonucleic acid (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI) genes were sequenced from penguin feces using the
   Illumina MiSeq platform to investigate the fecal eukaryote composition
   of the two pygoscelid penguin groups to obtain insight into their diets.
   Significant differences in the abundance of Tardigrada and Rotifera
   sequences in the fecal eukaryote composition were observed between the
   Adelie and Gentoo groups. A range of food groups, including Actinopteri,
   Bivalvia, Coscinodiscophyceae, Florideophyceae, Haptophyceae, Hydrozoa,
   Malacostraca, and Phaeophyceae, were discovered in the penguin diets.
   Euphausia was the most important component of the diets of both
   Pygoscelis penguins. Compared with Adelie penguins, which showed a
   higher abundance of Actinopteri, Gentoo penguins presented a higher
   percentage of Euphausiidae in their diet. The COI gene is a more
   suitable taxonomic marker than the 18S rRNA gene for the dietary
   analysis of penguins. The results allowed the dietary components of
   Adelie and Gentoo penguins on Ardley Island to be characterized.},

Abstract = {In 2018, commercially exploitable concentrations of Atlantic cod Gadus
   morhua were found on the shelf around the Arctic island Jan Mayen (7 1
   degrees N, 8-9 degrees W) and in 2019-2021 an exploratory cod fishery
   with longline was carried out in the area. The total catch in the period
   2018-2021 was 1737 tonnes. The first records of cod fishery in the Jan
   Mayen area are from the early 1930s but catches before 2018 were
   minimal. In 2019-2020 cod spawning was documented in this area for the
   first time. Catches in 2019 and 2020 were dominated by cod between 70
   and 100 cm, while in 2021 the main part of the catches was cod between
   60 and 100 cm. Catch rates were highest in autumn. We summarize the
   history of cod observations and the experience from the recent
   exploratory fishery in this shelf area where there has been no regular
   monitoring of demersal fish abundance. Further, we consider possible
   links with cod stocks in other Arctic and sub-Arctic areas and discuss
   the occurrence of cod in the Jan Mayen area in relation to the biology
   and recent development of other cod stocks.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1415-1425},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Arctic streams are highly sensitive to climate warming due to changes in
   water temperature and nutrient availability. Mosses are the dominant
   benthic primary producers in low-order streams in Greenland, and climate
   induced ecosystem alterations are expected to cause significant changes
   to their growth and productivity rates. However, the combined effects of
   climate change to stream mosses are relatively unknown. In this study,
   we conducted a full factorial experiment with three levels of nutrients
   and temperatures, and we measured primary productivity by applying the
   C-14-CO2 tracer method, relative growth rate (RGR), shoot elongation
   (SE) and lateral growth (length of branches, LB; Shoot density, SD). We
   aimed to investigate the single and interactive effect of temperature
   and nutrient enrichment on growth (biomass and elongation), primary
   productivity and shoot morphology of the Arctic aquatic moss
   Hygrohypnella ochracea. We found that low temperature determines H.
   ochracea growth however, the effect of nutrient enrichment became
   increasingly significant with increasing temperature. We also found
   important morphological changes in moss lateral growth which is expected
   to cause fundamental changes in moss community structure. Our results
   demonstrated that, in the low-order Arctic streams, climate change will
   cause shifts in benthic primary productivity, growth and morphology, and
   these changes are expected to cause cascading effects on the stream
   ecosystem structure, biodiversity and function.},

Abstract = {Studying the trophic ecology of marine fishes in their natural habitat
   provides insights into their behavior, their role in community dynamics,
   and in energy flow through ecosystems. The long tail hake Macruronus
   magellanicus Lonnberg, 1907, is distributed from 35 degrees S in the
   Atlantic Ocean and 33 degrees S in the Pacific Ocean and supports
   important fisheries around the southern tip of South America. The
   trophic ecology of this species was evaluated in the Southwestern
   Atlantic (52 degrees-56 degrees S, 106 to 932 m depth) for the first
   time. This is the main fishing area in the southern region of its
   distribution. Stomach contents and C and N stable isotope analysis were
   used to assess ontogenetic and spatial variability in long tail hake
   diet. The main prey items identified in the stomach contents varied
   spatially, differentiating three feeding grounds with euphausiids,
   Fuegian sprats (Sprattus fitegensis), and squat lobsters (Munida
   gregaria) as the main prey in each. However, these differences were not
   reflected in the stable isotope signals of their muscles. Our results
   suggest that long tail hake move between feeding grounds in a shorter
   time period than the isotopic turnover rate of muscle (similar to 2-5
   months). Independent of the feeding grounds, both methodologies showed
   ontogenetic variability in diet. Our evidence suggests in the southern
   tip of South America, long tail hake move among grounds to take
   advantage of the availability of different resources. These results
   provide valuable information on the trophic ecology of long tail hake to
   consider in management and conservation policies.},

Title = {Significance of autumn and winter food consumption for reproduction by

Abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the southern Beaufort Sea experience
   long annual periods when preferred seal prey are scarce or are
   unavailable. Consumption of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) carcasses
   from native Alaskan subsistence hunting is increasingly common for
   onshore polar bears, yet the energetic consequences of this consumption
   remain unclear. We use data on bears captured repeatedly over periods
   that encompassed autumn and winter, combined with calculations, to show
   that adult female bears likely consume an average of at least 4 seal
   equivalents during both autumn and winter periods and that considerable
   variation in energy intake exists across individual bears. We further
   show that subsistence-caught whale carcasses provide an upper threshold
   of > 4000 seal equivalents, which could potentially meet mean
   consumption needs of similar to 80\% of the southern Beaufort Sea bear
   subpopulation during autumn and winter periods. Finally, we modify an
   existing model to show that observed mass changes over autumn and winter
   could substantially alter spring foraging habitat choice by females with
   cubs and the chance that a female with reduced energy reserves would
   abort a pregnancy or abandon cubs in favor of increasing her own
   survival; these behaviors could potentially influence population vital
   rates. Our study highlights the importance of mass dynamics over the
   autumn and winter months, points to the need for additional data on
   foraging and energetics over this period, and indicates that the recent
   declines in polar bear body condition in some subpopulations could have
   complex effects on reproduction.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Southern Ocean phytoplankton are especially subjected to pronounced
   seasonal and interannual changes in light availability. Although
   previous studies have examined the role of light in these environments,
   very few combined pigment-based taxonomy with flow cytometry to better
   discriminate the light response of various phytoplankton groups. In
   particular the different populations within the diverse and important
   taxonomic group of diatoms require further investigation. Six incubation
   experiments (9-10 days) were performed during the main productive period
   with natural seawater collected at the Western Antarctic Peninsula.
   Standing stock of Phaeocystis spp. cells displayed relatively fast
   accumulation under all levels of light (low, medium, high; 4-7, 30-50
   and 150-200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), whilst the small- and
   larger-sized diatom populations (4.5 and 20 mu m diameter) exhibited
   faster accumulation in medium and high light. In contrast,
   intermediate-sized diatoms (11.5 mu m diameter) displayed fastest net
   growth under low light, subsequently dominating the phytoplankton
   community. Low light was a key factor limiting accumulation and peak
   phytoplankton biomass, except one incubation displaying relatively high
   accumulation rates under low light. The 3-week low-light period prior to
   experimentation likely allowed adaptation to maximize achievable growth
   and seems a strong determinant of whether the different natural
   Antarctic phytoplankton populations sustain, thrive or decline. Our
   study provides improved insight into how light intensity modulates the
   net response of key Antarctic phytoplankton, both between and within
   taxonomic groups.},

Title = {Autumn migration phenology of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in Hudson
   Bay, Canada},

Pages = {1023-1034},

Abstract = {Migratory species may shift phenology with climate change so
   understanding the energetic consequences of behavioural plasticity may
   provide insight into how migrants respond to warming. We examined the
   autumn migration of 151 adult female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in
   Hudson Bay, Canada from 1991 to 2020 using satellite telemetry. We
   examined trends in sea ice freeze-up experienced by bears as adults and
   dependent juveniles to assess if maternal behaviour influenced migrating
   adults. To quantify vulnerability to increasing fasting, we examined the
   condition and starvation threshold of 136 females with offspring. There
   were no temporal trends in departure date or sea ice, but bears departed
   onto sea ice further north over time by approximately 7 km/year (SE 12
   km). Freeze-up date was delayed 0.4 (SE 0.8) days/year for the time when
   juveniles were dependent on their mothers. Departure date varied across
   individuals each year by a mean difference of 14 (SE 1.5) days.
   Inter-annual variation in the on-ice departure date was explained by
   freeze-up date, delaying in years with later freeze-up, and individual
   age, with younger bears departing earlier. Condition of females with
   first-year cubs declined over time, and we estimate that 67\% of females
   with offspring have ceased lactation by on-ice departure or risk
   starvation while 20\% still risk starvation having ceased lactation.
   Delayed freeze-up over the juvenile period may explain the population's
   northward shift in migration suggesting learned behaviour. Declining
   energetic stores available to females with cubs during this critical
   stage in their life history is a developing conservation issue.},

Abstract = {Changes in habitat availability and prey abundance are predicted to
   adversely influence survival and reproduction of wildlife in the
   Southern Ocean. Some populations of southern right whale (SRW; Eubalaena
   australis) are showing dramatic changes in habitat use. Surveys were
   undertaken in the austral winters of 2020 and 2021 at the key nursery
   and socialising ground for New Zealand SRWs: Port Ross, Auckland
   Islands, with 548 encounters and 599 skin biopsy samples collected. Data
   from these two surveys spanned peak periods of use and were used to test
   the hypothesis there have been shifts in the phenology, demographic
   composition and behaviour of SRWs using the Auckland Islands over the
   past three decades. The behavioural phenology and demographic
   composition of SRW resembles that observed in the 1990s. In contrast,
   the proportion of groups containing cow-calf pairs increased from 20\%
   in the 1998 survey to 50\% in 2020/21. These changes are consistent with
   a growing population undergoing strong recruitment, not limited by food
   resources. Continued use of Port Ross by all SRW demographic classes
   confirms this as key habitat for SRW in New Zealand waters, and we
   support increased enforcement of existing management measures to reduce
   whale-vessel interactions in this remote subantarctic archipelago.},

Pages = {1673-1688},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trait-based approaches connect the traits of species to ecosystem
   functions to estimate the functional diversity of communities and how
   they may respond to environmental change. For the first time, we
   compiled a traits matrix across 11 traits for 28 species of Arctic ice
   meiofauna, including Copepoda (Subclass), Nematoda (Phylum), Acoela
   (Order), Rotifera (Phylum), and Cnidaria (Phylum). Over 50 years of
   pan-Arctic literature were manually reviewed, and trait categories were
   assigned to enable future trait-function connections within the
   threatened ice-associated ecosystem. Approximately two-thirds of the
   traits data were found at the genus or species level, ranging from 44\%
   for Nematoda to 100\% for Cnidaria. Ice meiofauna were shown to possess
   advantageous adaptations to the brine channel network within sea ice,
   including a majority with small body widths < 200 mu m, high body
   flexibility, and high temperature and salinity tolerance. Diets were
   found to be diverse outside of the algal bloom season, with most
   organisms transitioning to ciliate-, omnivore-, or detritus-based diets.
   Eight species of the studied taxa have only been recorded within sea
   ice, while the rest are found in a mixture of sympagic-pelagic-benthic
   habitats. Twelve of the ice meiofauna species have been found with all
   life stages present in sea ice. Body width, temperature tolerance, and
   salinity tolerance were identified as traits with the largest research
   gaps and suffered from low-resolution taxonomic data. Overall, the
   compiled data show the degree to which ice meiofauna are adapted to
   spending all or portions of their lives within the ice.},

Abstract = {Patagonotothen ramsayi has the highest concentrations at Burdwood Bank,
   playing a key ecological role in the demersal food web. The aim of this
   study was to describe and analyze the feeding ecology of longtail
   southern cod in the Marine Protected Area Namuncura-Burdwood Bank
   (MPAN-BB). From 369 specimens sampled, 229 (62.06\%) contained food.
   Prey-specific index of relative importance (\%PSIRI) for each prey was
   calculated showing that P. ramsayi preyed mainly on polychaetes
   (21.07\%), amphipods (14.89\%), other crustaceans (13.25\%), and
   decapods (11.62\%). The analysis of the feeding strategy confirms that
   P. ramsayi is a generalist feeder. The effect of sex, ontogenetic stage,
   total length (TL), and capture depth was evaluated using generalized
   linear models. All prey categories were independent of sex, while a
   differential consumption of isopods and polychaetes according to the
   ontogenetic stage was observed. Isopods were more consumed by juveniles,
   while polychaetes were fed by adults. The intake of amphipods and
   decapods was not influenced by any of the studied variables. Regarding
   capture depth, the consumption of euphausiids and polychaetes was higher
   in shallower areas, in contrast to teleost and isopods that were more
   ingested at greater depths. Finally, the intake of euphausiids,
   teleosts, and polychaetes was positively influenced by the total length
   of the predator, while the consumption of other invertebrates was
   negatively related. It may be concluded that Patagonotothen ramsayi in
   the MPAN-BB has a generalist diet and demersal-benthic feeding habits,
   changing its diet with total length and depth of capture.},

Abstract = {The establishment of baseline information on biodiversity is important
   as contemporary biodiversity might act as a bioindicator of
   environmental change. It is especially important at locations which are
   expected to be largely impacted by climate change, such as Icelandic
   waters. The present study focuses on the diversity of bryozoan species
   in Iceland. An Icelandic bryozoan species list was compiled from three
   main data sources: species collected during the BIOICE programme,
   species deposited in old museum collections and from literature. A total
   of 288 species were recorded from the study area, 67 of which are new
   records in Icelandic waters and three are potentially non-indigenous
   species. Such diversity is relatively high in comparison to other areas
   and yet predicted to be even higher if more studies were to be
   conducted. Encrusting forms (56\%) were by far the most numerous among
   studied bryozoans. The highest number of species (71) was recorded in
   the shallowest 0-100 m zone which is most likely a result of complex
   factors including high primary productivity of that zone. This study
   reveals a large proportion of new species records for the area, showing
   how little is known about bryozoan diversity and its ecological aspects
   in such important areas as Icelandic waters. It is a starting point for
   further in-depth investigations of this specific group of organisms.},

Abstract = {This paper provides data on a newly discovered colony of Magellanic
   penguins Spheniscus magellanicus in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. A new
   settlement was found while conducting southern rockhopper penguin
   Eudyptes chrysocome studies in the San Juan de Salvamento colony in
   Staten Island, Argentina. The colony holds 88 breeding pairs. While the
   origin of the founders was unknown, it is possible that they came from
   the nearby Observatorio Island colony located similar to 20 km away. New
   colonies allow populations to expand and establish in new areas, which
   could allow a species to respond to changes in climate. Nonetheless,
   this expansion might be a detriment to other penguin species that
   already occupied the area.},

Abstract = {Conventional microbiological methods reveal the diversity of culturable
   microorganisms and are used for the isolation of strains with various
   properties. On the Argentine Islands-Kyiv Peninsula region, a study of
   microorganisms of plant communities has been reported; however, they to
   the full extent did not elucidate the microbial diversity. Animal
   populations are shifting because of climate change, which, together with
   anthropogenic influence, causes the shaping of microbial communities.
   The study aimed to establish the diversity, enumeration of
   microorganisms of different groups, and relationships with the physical
   and chemical properties of the samples from the ecosystem of the
   Argentine Islands-Kyiv Peninsula region that were collected from the
   vegetation and soils of the nesting and feeding site of Larus
   dominicanus (a Kelp Gull). The microbial communities and relationships
   between the Antarctic Peninsula maritime ecosystems (Galindez Island and
   Booth Island) factors were studied with the application of conventional
   microbiological techniques, statistical analyses, and 16S rRNA-based
   taxonomy. The study of the content of trace elements and the enumeration
   of cultivated microorganisms of different groups in soil samples
   demonstrated the difference in the enumeration of microorganisms between
   soil layers and the relationship between microbial enumeration and the
   properties of the samples. The samples from Booth Island differed in
   microbial enumeration from samples from Galindez Island. The greatest
   diversity and abundance of microorganisms were found in the samples from
   the most polluted due to the activity of the diesel station area. Among
   over 200 isolates, several of them were found to be tolerant to high
   levels of trace elements.},

Abstract = {Introduction of non-indigenous microbial organisms is forecast to pose a
   significant threat to the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) marine
   environments, but reliable data are still lacking. In order to explore
   the diversity of phytoplankton community, especially discover harmful
   bloom species that never reported in early studies due to the paucity of
   molecular investigation in the NAP, we collected plankton samples from
   the north of South Shetland Islands to east of the South Orkney Islands
   and sequenced their 18S rRNA gene V4 region metabarcoding. The dominate
   groups in the samples were dinoflagellates, diatoms, cryptophytes, and
   haptophytes. We discovered 1340 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)
   associated with the Dinophyceae, and 742 ASVs of which were categorized
   to the genus or species level using the DINOREF database. Dinophyceae
   Gyrodinium, Warnowia, Ptychodiscus, Gymnodinium, Karenia, Brachidinium,
   Polarella, Islandinium, and Scrippsiella were the dominate taxa,
   accounting for 75 percent of the dinoflagellate reads. Karenia
   papilionacea and Scrippsiella acuminata were first-ever detected in the
   NAP, and they might be carried in from outside the Antarctic by shipping
   activities. Their relative abundance suggests that there is a risk of
   harmful blooms emerging in the northern Antarctic Peninsula as a result
   of climate change and human activities.},

Title = {Biological and geochemical proxies in sediment cores reveal shifts in
   marine predator population dynamics relative to historic anthropogenic
   exploitation and recent climate change at South Georgia Island
   sub-Antarctic},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Historical climate change and human exploitation are thought to have
   played important roles in shaping population dynamics of sub-Antarctic
   marine predators, such as king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and
   Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazelle). For example, Antarctic fur
   seals on the sub-Antarctic South Georgia Island were nearly hunted to
   extinction by humans before the early 1900s. However, records of
   occupation history pre- and post-anthropogenic stress are often sporadic
   and challenging to interpret. In this study, we investigated
   paleoecological proxies in sediment cores from South Georgia Island to
   examine past marine predator population dynamics in the face of climate
   change and exploitation pressure. Sediment cores representing 1854 CE to
   present were collected from two sites on South Georgia Island in the
   South Atlantic and analyzed for geochemical (total carbon, total
   nitrogen, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values) and biological (e.g., seal
   hairs, penguin feathers) proxies. Proxies in both cores indicated the
   onset of the recovery of penguin and fur seal populations in the early
   to mid-1900s, following the cessation of hunting. Additionally, our
   results suggest marked increases in both penguin and seal populations
   beginning around 1950 CE. Between the 1950s and 2019, 97\% of South
   Georgia Island's glaciers retreated associated with recent climatic
   warming. This warming increased the availability of local breeding areas
   for king penguins, which likely explains the population rise during that
   time. This study deepens our understanding of the response of
   sub-Antarctic marine predator populations to past climate change and
   human exploitation, which may aid in predicting future ecosystem
   responses to environmental disturbance.},

Abstract = {Complex bottom topography and the presence of floating ice significantly
   complicate the use of traditional sampling methods in Arctic coastal
   waters, forcing to look for alternative approaches. One such technique
   is underwater imagery, which has grown in popularity in recent decades
   based on its effectiveness in hard-to-reach places. We demonstrate that
   an underwater video mosaic can be a reliable method for comparative
   analysis of Arctic habitats under the glacier influence and glacier
   influence-free habitats. The filming was carried out in the upper
   sublittoral (2-65 m) of Hornsund and Isfjorden areas, representing two
   ice-free and two glaciated bays. Video footage was obtained using an ROV
   mounted and ``drop-down{''} video cameras and transformed into 148 video
   mosaics. Based on the lowest possible taxonomic level, 31 biological
   features (morphospecies) were identified and ascribed to benthic
   functional groups based on their feeding and mobility type. The
   morphospecies and functional groups were used for the comparative
   analysis to reveal the ecologically meaningful differences in benthic
   community structure in different Arctic benthic habitats. We discovered
   greater abundances of motile scavengers in glacier-influenced bays
   whereas glacier influence-free bay had more sessile suspension filters
   and glacier influence-free riverine bay was dominated by discreetly
   motile and deposit feeders. Underwater imagery mosaics have proven to be
   a fairly reliable tool for fieldwork-efficient quantitative
   characterization of benthic communities in the hard-to-reach Arctic's
   upper sublittoral.},

Title = {Bottom-feeding gray whales Eschrichtius robustus demonstrate a finer

Abstract = {In zooplankton-feeding baleen whales, site fidelity on the feeding
   grounds is usually expressed at a relatively large scale: although the
   whales remain in the general area, they move broadly within it, covering
   tens of kilometers per day. The gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, is
   the only dedicated bottom feeder among baleen whales and its largely
   infaunal and epibenthic invertebrate prey are more sedentary and
   therefore have a more predictable distribution than zooplankton. We
   analyzed movements of individually identified gray whales and humpback
   whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in an Arctic feeding area to see if
   specialization on stationary benthic prey would result in finer-scale
   site fidelity than specializing in more mobile zooplankton prey in the
   same area. Compared to humpback whales, the number of feeding gray
   whales in Senyavin Strait, Eastern Chukotka over three study years was
   higher; however, the resighting rate between years was lower than for
   humpback whales in the same area over the same period. All humpback
   whales moved broadly within their feeding range, while individual gray
   whales tended to remain at specific locations, returning to these
   locations in subsequent years. Thus, the fine-scale site fidelity was
   higher for gray whales and this should be a consideration when
   estimating anthropogenic impacts-for example, the effects of shipping
   traffic, fishing, and aboriginal whaling. Gaining an understanding of
   whale movement patterns, including site fidelity, is crucial for the
   conservation and sustainable management of whales and their habitats,
   especially in light of increasing anthropogenic pressures in the warming
   Arctic.},

Abstract = {Antarctic notothenioid fishes are recognised as one of the rare examples
   of adaptive radiation in the marine system. Withstanding the freezing
   temperatures of Antarctic waters, these fishes have diversified into
   over 100 species within no more than 10-20 million years. However, the
   exact species richness of the radiation remains contested. In the genus
   Channichthys, between one and nine species are recognised by different
   authors. To resolve the number of Channichthys species, genetic
   information would be highly valuable; however, so far, only sequences of
   a single species, C. rhinoceratus, are available. Here, we present the
   nearly complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of C. rugosus,
   obtained from a formalin-fixed museum specimen sampled in 1974. This
   sequence differs from the mitochondrial genome of C. rhinoceratus in no
   more than 27 positions, suggesting that the two species may be
   synonymous.},

Abstract = {Marine animals such as the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina)
   rely on a productive marine environment and are vulnerable to oceanic
   changes that can affect their reproduction and survival rates. Davis
   Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals
   that forage in Prydz Bay, but the mitochondrial haplotype diversity and
   natal source populations of these seals have not been characterized. In
   this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these
   moulting seals to identify levels of mitochondrial haplotype diversity,
   natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and
   haul-out periods. Using partial sequences of the mitochondrial control
   region, we identified two major breeding mitochondrial lineages of seals
   at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from
   breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean.
   One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South
   Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two
   stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance
   foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We
   speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment can result in
   a shift in foraging and movement strategies, which subsequently affects
   seal population growth rates.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {987-997},

Abstract = {Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are apex predators that spend
   several months at sea feeding over vast areas. Their population trends
   are related to food availability during winter, which in turn is
   influenced by environmental conditions; thus, fluctuations in their
   populations reflect changes in the ecosystems. Although population
   trends for this species are available for large populations, there are
   still small colonies for which information is scarce, as is the case for
   the colony located at Peninsula Potter, South Shetland Islands. At this
   colony, field censuses of the number of breeding females conducted from
   1995 to 2018 revealed an overall decline of 11.9\% at an annual rate of
   0.6\%. However, contrasting trends before and after 2008 were observed.
   A decrease of 46.5\% at an annual rate of 4.6\% was registered before
   2008, while for the subsequent period (2008-2018) the number of females
   increased by 64.5\% at an annual rate of 5\%. A positive association was
   observed between the extent of sea ice in winter foraging areas and
   population numbers between 1995 and 2008. The females of this colony
   feed on the edge of the sea ice, so in years of low sea ice extension
   the effort required to reach these areas is greater. This could lead
   individuals to choose to breed in areas closer to their feeding grounds
   in order to avoid the energetic expenditure of body reserves acquired
   during winter that would sustain the return trip to their natal colony.},

   Plan, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
   Resources (CCAMLR) has taken on the mantle of progressing efforts to
   achieve it. Within the CBD, Aichi Target 11 represents an agreed
   commitment to protect 10\% of the global coastal and marine environment.
   Adopting an ethos of presenting the best available scientific evidence
   to support policy makers, CCAMLR has progressed this by designating two
   Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean, with three others under
   consideration. The region of Antarctica known as Dronning Maud Land
   (DML; 20 degrees W to 40 degrees E) and the Atlantic sector of the
   Southern Ocean that abuts it conveniently spans one region under
   consideration for spatial protection. To facilitate both an open and
   transparent process to provide the vest available scientific evidence
   for policy makers to formulate management options, we review the body of
   physical, geochemical and biological knowledge of the marine environment
   of this region. The level of scientific knowledge throughout the
   seascape abutting DML is polarized, with a clear lack of data in its
   eastern part which is presumably related to differing levels of research
   effort dedicated by national Antarctic programmes in the region. The
   lack of basic data on fundamental aspects of the physical, geological
   and biological nature of eastern DML make predictions of future trends
   difficult to impossible, with implications for the provision of
   management advice including spatial management. Finally, by highlighting
   key knowledge gaps across the scientific disciplines our review also
   serves to provide guidance to future research across this important
   region.},

Abstract = {Drones, or unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS), can transform the way
   scientific information on wildlife populations is collected. UAS surveys
   produce accurate estimates of ground-nesting seabirds and a variety of
   waterbirds, but few studies have examined the trade-offs of this
   methodology for counting cliff-nesting seabirds. In this study, we
   examined how different UAS survey parameters might influence seabird
   counts for population monitoring and assessed behavioral responses to
   aerial surveys for three sub-Arctic seabird taxa in the Gulf of Alaska:
   common murres (Uria aalge), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla),
   and pelagic and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus and
   Phalacrocorax auritus). We flew two commercially available models of UAS
   in planned approaches at different speeds and distances from colonies
   during incubation and chick-rearing periods. We compared counts from
   UAS-derived images with those from vessel-based photography and assessed
   video recordings of individual birds' behaviors for evidence of
   disturbance during UAS operations and control phases. Count estimates
   from UAS images were similar to or higher than those from conventional
   vessel-based images, and UAS were particularly effective at
   photographing birds at sites with high cliff walls or complex
   topography. We observed no significant behavioral responses to the UAS
   by murres or cormorants, but we did observe flushing by black-legged
   kittiwakes during UAS flights; most of these birds were not incubating
   or brooding. At both the colony and individual level, we observed
   slightly greater responses to the smaller UAS platform and closer
   approaches. These results inform both species specific and general best
   practices for research and recreational usage of UAS near cliff-nesting
   seabird colonies.},

Title = {Differences in the gonadal cycle between two ascidians species,
   Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona robusta, help to explain their invasion
   success in a cold temperate port},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Invasive ascidians are one of the most abundant components of the
   fouling communities of artificial structures. Ascidians' tolerance to
   pollution, salinity, and temperature differences, alongside high
   reproductive and growth rates, facilitate their global spread and
   establishment. However, the influence of ascidians' reproductive ecology
   on their abundance in cold temperate areas is poorly studied. In cold
   regions, ascidians' reproductive ecology fluctuates markedly, depending
   on environmental factors. This might lead to differences in the gonadal
   cycle of invasive ascidians between the native and invaded area. Our
   study investigates the gonadal cycle of two invasive ascidian species,
   Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona robusta, and discusses their potential role
   in the invasion success in a cold temperate port. Using histological
   analysis, the gonadal cycle of each species was compared throughout the
   year and among seasons. Only A. aspersa showed a reproductive cycle
   different from their native range, with mature gonads during spring and
   summer. Ciona robusta showed mature gonads throughout the year, similar
   to its native range. These results were unexpected, as the larger
   abundance of A. aspersa is constant throughout the year, whereas the
   less abundant C. robusta shows a peak during autumn. Future research
   should explore how interspecific competition and predation interact with
   reproductive ecology, shaping the abundance of invasive ascidians.
   Considering the high connectivity of southern South America with
   Antarctica and the future scenarios of global change, knowing how the
   biology of invasive species change in their invasive range is key to
   advance and implement management strategies.},

Abstract = {The presence of marine vertebrates in dense reproductive colonies and
   other aggregations contributes to the input of organic matter and
   nutrients into the local environment and it is believed that chemical
   elements are subsequently remobilized from the excreta of these animals.
   In this study, we investigated the influence of marine vertebrates on
   trace elements levels (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb,
   Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tb, U and Zn), nutrient (total phosphorus) and soil
   organic matter (SOM) content from five locations with and without the
   presence of seabirds and marine mammals in Admiralty Bay, King George
   Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Soils were acid digested
   using a microwave digestion system, elements were quantified using
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and SOM was calculated by
   loss-on-ignition. The non-influenced and vertebrate-influenced soils had
   similar concentrations of most of the trace elements assessed, however,
   we observed a significant increase in SOM and P that was positively
   correlated with the concentrations of As, Cd, Se, Sr and Zn. Although
   marine vertebrates did not appear to significantly increase the
   elemental concentrations in the soils examined here, there is a clear
   evidence of selective enrichment indicating a zoogenic influence.
   Comparing our results with other studies, we conclude that soil
   elemental levels are result from an interplay between local geology,
   vertebrate diet and colony size. Further studies with increased sample
   size are required to obtain a better understanding of the influence of
   marine vertebrates on chemical element levels in Antarctic soils.},

Abstract = {In recent years, functional changes in Southern Ocean are becoming more
   noticeable, due to climate change and increasing human impacts,
   including a growing fishery that is concentrating in the Antarctic
   Peninsula (AP) region. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is often the
   primary prey species for animals such as Pygoscelis penguins, a sentinel
   species for ecosystem monitoring and management. During the last two
   decades in the AP gentoo penguin numbers (Pygoscelis papua) have
   increased and their range has shifted southward, in contrast to the
   decline in numbers of Adelie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus)
   penguins. Given divergent population trends, the goal of this study was
   to examine differences in their diet, and size structure of Antarctic
   krill recovered from penguin diet samples. The study is based on diet
   samples collected during the austral summers on King George Island
   (South Shetland Islands) where P. adeliae, P. antarcticus, and P. papua
   breed in mixed colonies. Results indicate that the penguins consumed
   krill of similar sizes during the breeding period. In contrast to prior
   diet studies, we found higher proportions of krill in the gentoo diet
   and changes in the percentage of krill in the diet relative obtained
   during 1970s. The similarity in diets among all three species suggests
   that the availability prey items (e. g., fishes) may be changing and
   driving higher dietary overlap. Moreover, we also check differences in
   krill length among penguin individuals and we did not find any
   statistically significant differences. We also found plastic debris in
   penguin stomachs during both summers.},

Abstract = {Arctic climate change is leading to an advance of plant phenology (the
   timing of life history events) with uncertain impacts on tundra
   ecosystems. Although the lengthening of the growing season is thought to
   lead to increased plant growth, we have few studies of how plant
   phenology change is altering tundra plant productivity. Here, we test
   the correspondence between 14 years of Salix arctica phenology data and
   radial growth on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada. We
   analysed stems from 28 individuals using dendroecology and linear
   mixed-effect models to test the statistical power of growing season
   length and climate variables to individually predict radial growth. We
   found that summer temperature best explained annual variation in radial
   growth. We found no strong evidence that leaf emergence date, earlier
   leaf senescence date, or total growing season length had any direct or
   lagged effects on radial growth. Radial growth was also not explained by
   interannual variation in precipitation, MODIS surface greenness (NDVI),
   or sea ice concentration. Our results demonstrate that at this site, for
   the widely distributed species S. arctica, temperature-but not growing
   season length-influences radial growth. These findings challenge the
   assumption that advancing phenology and longer growing seasons will
   increase the productivity of all plant species in Arctic tundra
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Three species of Southern Ocean skates, Bathyrajaeatonii,Bathyrajairrasa
   and Bathyrajamurrayi, are commonly caught as incidental by-catch in
   fisheries around Heard Island and McDonald Islands of the Kerguelen
   Plateau. We used length-at-age data to present the species' life history
   information (age, growth and maturity for the first-time). Length- and
   age-at-maturity analyses revealed that B.irrasa matured at > 6 years old
   and > 1000 mm total length (TL), which was older and larger than
   B.murrayi (> 5 years old and > 400 mm TL) but similar to B.eatonii (> 5
   years old and > 900 mm). We fitted growth models using a multi-model
   Bayesian framework. Our findings support the assumption that B.irrasa is
   slow growing and late maturing compared to B.eatonii and B.murrayi,
   consequently putting it at greater risk to fishery-induced increases in
   mortality compared to other species (e.g., B.murrayi). This is the
   first-time age and growth has been estimated for these species, however
   sample sizes for B.murrayi and B.eatonii were small and hence growth
   models should be interpreted with caution. Our results represent vital
   information for population projection models and can therefore assist in
   the development and/or revision of current by-catch limits to inform
   ongoing management strategies and conservation efforts.},

Title = {Passive acoustics suggest two different feeding mechanisms in the

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {45},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The vocal repertoire of walruses has been widely described in the
   bioacoustic literature. These marine mammals produce several distinct
   types of vocalizations for intraspecific communication during the
   breeding season. In this study, we provide the first evidence of
   walrus-generated sounds during foraging dives when they feed on
   bivalves. We recorded two types of sounds that we associated to
   different feeding mechanisms. The first sound type was brief and low in
   frequency that we relate to the suction of soft parts from the bivalves'
   shells through the use of walrus powerful tongues, which is the common
   feeding behavior reported in the walrus literature. We also recorded a
   second sound type composed of multiple broadband pulse trains. We
   hypothesize the latter were associated with bivalve shell cracking by
   walruses, which would represent a new feeding mechanism in the walrus
   literature. This new feeding mechanism is either related to bivalves'
   ecology or to walruses removing the sediment when searching for food.
   During this study, we observed bivalves lying on the seafloor instead of
   being buried in the sediment in walrus feeding areas while scuba diving.
   As a result, walruses cannot use suction to feed on soft body part of
   bivalves and have to use another strategy, mastication. Our findings
   provide a first step towards using passive acoustics to quantify walrus
   behavior and feeding ecology.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {The relationships between birds and invertebrates are very diverse and
   often extend beyond the host-parasite interaction. Birds can be vectors
   of some arthropod species and their nests are a specific microhabitat
   inhabited by mites and springtails. However, the phenomenon is not well
   described in Antarctica. The aim of this article is to compare the
   arthropod communities inhabiting the nests of three species of birds and
   relate observed differences to the biology and ecology of the nest
   building bird species (i.e., living in colonies or in pairs) as well as
   the nature of the nest (i.e., nest lining or lack there off). Outcomes
   include determining the scale of the threat to birds from parasites, as
   well as to information concerning the ecology (microhabitat preferences)
   of the arthropod species. The study was conducted in the vicinity of the
   Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station by comparing the arthropod
   concentrations in nests of three bird species: Southern Giant Petrel
   (Macronectes giganteus), Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and South
   Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki). Four mite (Acari) species and
   five springtail (Collembola) species were found in the collected
   material. None of these species are parasites. The most numerous were
   Hydrogamasellus racovitzai (Acari, Mesostigmata), Alaskozetes
   antarcticus (Acari, Oribatida) and Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus
   (Collembola). The results indicate (e.g. the Shannon index, evenness,
   non-metric multidimensional scaling method, one-way multivariate
   permutation analysis of variances, Kruskal-Wallis test) significant
   variability in community composition and individual abundance in the
   nests dependent on the bird species. Furthermore, that this variability
   depends on the biology and ecology of the bird species.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Pycnogonida, or sea spiders, is a speciose clade with over 1300
   described species that is especially diverse in the Southern Ocean.
   Evolutionary patterns within sea spiders remain unresolved between and
   within the eleven putative, extant families due to shared morphological
   traits and highly reduced forms. A consensus phylogeny of recognized
   families is still debated, and previous work based on various
   methodologies has produced contrasting hypotheses of relationships. To
   better understand phylogenetic relationships between major clades of sea
   spiders, we constructed a dataset of mitochondrial genome data from
   representatives of all eleven currently recognized families. Herein, we
   find that the order of mitochondrial protein-coding genes is consistent
   between all sampled sea spiders, even though arrangement of tRNA genes,
   as well as placement and length of the control region, varies. The
   presence of large non-coding introns present in multiple families
   indicates that pycnogonid mitochondrial genomes have a fast evolutionary
   rate. Our results suggest a new, familial-level phylogeny within
   Pycnogonida, with a monophyletic clade containing Callipallenidae and
   Nymphonidae placed as the sister clade to all other recognized families.},

   fox (Vulpes lagopus) faeces as a monitoring tool for plastic pollution
   in the Arctic environment. Arctic fox faeces were collected in different
   regions of Iceland and analysed for anthropogenic debris presence larger
   than 300 mu m, and diet composition. In total, 235 faecal samples from
   1999, 2017, 2018 and 2020 were analysed. The overall frequency of
   occurrence of plastic and other anthropogenic material was 5.11\% and
   was found in samples across all regions and years. There were no
   statistical differences in anthropogenic debris ingested, depending on
   year or region. There were no obvious differences in diet composition
   between samples that contained anthropogenic debris and samples without.
   The suitability of Arctic fox faeces as a method to monitor plastic and
   anthropogenic debris levels in the Arctic environment remains debatable:
   Whilst the vast distribution range of the Arctic fox and the
   non-invasive collection methodology of faecal samples could be utilised
   as a good monitoring tool, the overall low uptake and unclear source of
   plastic and anthropogenic debris (marine or terrestrial) makes the
   interpretation of the data difficult. Nevertheless, debris ingestion by
   Arctic foxes remains a concern and warrants further studies.},

Abstract = {The summer climate in Maritime Antarctica is characterised by high
   humidity and cloudiness with slightly above zero temperatures. Under
   such conditions, photosynthetic activity is temperature-limited and
   plant communities are formed by a few species. These conditions could
   prevent the operation of the photoprotective xanthophyll (VAZ) cycle as
   low irradiance reduces the excess of energy and low temperatures limit
   enzyme activity. The VAZ cycle regulates the dissipation of the excess
   of absorbed light as heat, which is the main mechanism of
   photoprotection in plants. To test whether this mechanism operates
   dynamically in Antarctic plant communities, we characterised pigment
   dynamics under natural field conditions in two representative species:
   the moss Polytrichum juniperinum and the grass Deschampsia antarctica.
   Pigment analyses revealed that the total VAZ pool was in the upper range
   of the values reported for most plant species, suggesting that they are
   exposed to a high degree of environmental stress. Despite cloudiness,
   there was a strong conversion of violaxanthin (V) to zeaxanthin (Z)
   during daytime. Conversely, the dark-induced enzymatic epoxidation back
   to V was not limited by nocturnal temperatures. In contrast with plants
   from other cold ecosystems, we did not find any evidence of overnight
   retention of Z or sustained reductions in photochemical efficiency.
   These results are of interest for modelling, remote sensing and
   upscaling of the responses of Antarctic vegetation to environmental
   challenges.},

Title = {Cephalopod diet of juvenile male southern elephant seals Mirounga

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina have a circumpolar distribution
   and migrate across broad geographic regions. Therefore, they can provide
   important insights into the responses of top predators to changes in the
   environment, especially those effected by climate change. For this,
   determining trophic interactions is key, and thus it is important to
   investigate the diet of all populations of M. leonina in the Southern
   Ocean. Limited literature exists on the diet of southern elephant seals
   at the Prince Edward Islands in the sub-Antarctic. During August and
   September 1976, the stomach contents of two juvenile male southern
   elephant seals were opportunistically collected at Marion Island
   (46(o)54'S, 37(o)51'E), and later analysed. Accumulated cephalopod beaks
   (n = 137) representing 18 taxa in nine decapod families were found.
   Onychoteuthidae was numerically the most abundant (28.7\%), followed by
   Brachioteuthidae (21.8\%), Neoteuthidae (12.6\%), and Histioteuthidae
   (9.2\%). Slosarczykovia circumantarctica (Brachioteuthidae) was the most
   abundant species (19.5\%) followed by Batoteuthis skolops
   (Batoteuthidae) at 12.6\%. Allometric equations using lower rostral
   lengths showed that the southern elephant seals ingested cephalopods
   with mantle length between 5.2 and 39.9 cm and weighing between 0.003
   and 2.62 kg. There was only one very digested crustacean, and no
   recognizable fish remains in the stomach contents. The continuation of
   the investigation relies on examination of natural mortalities and
   dietary items obtained by stomach lavage of individuals, complemented
   by, for example, stable isotope compositions captured along the length
   of vibrissae and within dentinal growth layer groups of teeth as proxies
   for the elephant seals' trophic ecology.},

Title = {A review of leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) births and pups using a

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Despite the ecological importance of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx)
   as apex marine predators, little is known about their reproductive
   biology. To address this paucity, we reviewed leopard seal birth and pup
   records and applied a standardised age-class classification system to
   differentiate between births/newborns (offspring <= 14 days old) and
   pups (> 14 days but < 6 months old). We compiled 19 birth/newborn and
   141 pup records and examined their occurrence by month, region,
   substrate, birth-specific attributes (i.e. birth observations, fresh
   umbilicus or placental), standard length, weight, presence of mother,
   presence of lanugo, sex, status (e.g. born alive) and fate. These
   records indicate that leopard seal births occur between September and
   December, with peak records from September to November, whilst pup
   records peaked between August and December. The regions with the most
   birth/newborn records were the sub-Antarctic Islands (31.6\%) and Chile
   (31.6\%), followed by Antarctica (15.8\%), New Zealand (15.8\%) and the
   Falkland Islands (5.3\%). Pups were recorded predominantly in the
   sub-Antarctic Islands (54.6\%), followed by the Antarctic (42.6\%),
   Chile (2.1\%) and Australia (0.7\%). Whilst leopard seal birth records
   were predominantly on ice, they were also found on terra firma. The
   northernmost published leopard seal birth records occurred in New
   Zealand whilst the northernmost published leopard seal pup records
   occurred in Australia. This study contradicts the long-standing
   hypothesis that leopard seals only give birth on Antarctic pack ice, and
   instead, here we indicate that 84.2\% and 57.4\% of collated leopard
   seal birth and pup records, respectively, occur outside of Antarctica.
   Our records illustrate the importance of northern regions as part of the
   leopard seal's range. We emphasise the need to conduct research focused
   on the reproductive biology of this keystone species throughout its
   range and that future management of leopard seal populations should also
   consider their northern range.},

Abstract = {Blue whales are rarely sighted off the coasts of South Africa due to
   their low numbers and offshore habitat preference. Visual observations
   to search for marine mammals were conducted onboard a platform of
   opportunity during the Integrated Ecosystems Programme survey in
   November 2019. A cow-calf pair of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus was
   sighted offshore Kleinzee (30 degrees 05'02.4 `' S, 14 degrees 24'53.2
   `' E) at a water depth of 1670 m on the west coast of South Africa in
   the southern Benguela Current System. The pair was identified as
   Antarctic blue whales B. m. intermedia based on the size of the cow
   (similar to 29 m), ``torpedo-shaped{''} body of the cow, known
   distribution ranges and recent acoustic data showing that pygmy blue
   whales B. m. brevicauda do not occur in these waters. The calf was
   likely born in the Benguela ecosystem given its relatively small size.
   This is the first sighting of Antarctic blue whale cow-calf pair in
   South African waters post whaling, indicating that animals might still
   use this area as a calving or nursing ground. Improved protection of
   this region in the low latitudes might benefit the recovery and
   conservation of the species.},

Abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has experienced significant
   changes in seawater temperature over the past 50 years. This warming
   affects seawater and sea ice microbial cycling of organic matter, where
   viral features could play a crucial role in sympagic sea ice melting
   environments. However, there is a lack of information about the sea ice
   viral abundances and processes (e.g. lysis rates and carbon release from
   microorganisms). To gain knowledge of sea ice viral, microbial, and
   chemical characteristics, we collected four different sea ice samples
   and their surrounding surface seawater during the Austral summer of 2019
   north of the WAP. In each sample, we assessed viral and microbial
   abundances and environmental parameters. In the sea ice, we also
   measured viral-driven mortality rates on prokaryotes and protists and
   the consequent release of organic carbon. The viral and microorganism
   abundances in the sea ice were higher (4.5 +/- 1.9 x 10(6) viruses
   mL(-1); 1.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) prokaryotes mL(-1), 9.4 +/- 5.0 x 10(2)
   protists mL(-1)) than in the surrounding surface seawater (1.7 x 10(6)
   viruses mL(-1), 0.4 x 10(6) prokaryotes mL(-1), 7.1 x 10(2) protists
   mL(-1)). Furthermore, viral lytic production on prokaryotes (4.5 +/- 0.8
   x 10(5) mL(-1)day(-1)) and protists (1.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) mL(-1) day(-1))
   in sympagic environments had a higher viral impact on carbon release by
   protist (1.5 +/- 1.1 mu g C L-1 day(-1)) than by prokaryotes (0.3 +/-
   0.1 mu g C L-1 day(-1)). Our results suggest that, after sea ice
   melting, viral abundances and activities may influence the functioning
   of the microbial food web by increasing the release of dissolved organic
   matter, affecting biogeochemical cycles and microbial communities in the
   underlying surface waters.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a circumpolar species with an
   omnivorous diet. Knowledge of krill diet within different regions will
   help predict how environmental change may impact local krill
   populations. Krill from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific sectors of the
   Southern Ocean were compared. The total lipid, lipid class, neutral
   lipid fraction fatty acid and sterol content and composition of whole
   krill, their digestive glands, and stomachs during the late-summer were
   examined. Indian sector krill had a distinctly different dietary lipid
   pattern to Atlantic and Pacific sector krill based on their fatty acid
   profiles (p < 0.001). Indian sector whole krill had higher phospholipids
   (55.0 +/- 8.9\%, \% total lipids) compared to Pacific (45.9 +/- 3.6\%)
   and Atlantic sector whole krill (43.7 +/- 8.2\%) but showed lower
   phospholipid levels in their digestive glands (29.4 +/- 8.5\%, 52.5 +/-
   5.7\%, 52.5 +/- 5.9\%, respectively). Indian sector krill had a more
   copepod and diatomaceous diet (higher levels of 16:1n-7c, 14:0 and 20:1
   and 22:1 isomers), with less flagellate input (lower 18:4n-3, 21:5n-3
   and 18:3n-6) than other regions. Krill from one site in the Indian
   sector had particularly high 22:6n-3 levels. Indian sector krill had
   lower cholesterol levels in their stomachs (52.5 +/- 14.1\%, as \% total
   sterols) than Pacific and Atlantic sector krill stomachs (62.8 +/- 1.9\%
   and 60.9 +/- 4.9\%, respectively). This study details the regional
   differences in late-summer krill diet by assessing the lipid, neutral
   lipid fraction fatty acid and sterol content and composition of
   different tissue types.},

Title = {Estimated ammonium regeneration potentials of two common euphausiid

Abstract = {Zooplankton contribute to nitrogen regeneration for primary productivity
   via ammonium excretion. To improve our understanding of the
   biogeochemical role of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean, ammonium
   excretion rates (AERs) were determined for two major euphausiid species
   (Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias) off Adelie Land, East
   Antarctica, during the austral summer of 2008. AER on a dry weight basis
   (weight-specific rate) for E. superba and E. crystallorophias was 2.5
   +/- 0.6 x 10(-3) and 2.2 +/- 1.0 x 10(-3) mu mol N mg DW-1 h(-1) (mean
   +/- standard deviation), respectively. Using the abundances of the two
   euphausiid species estimated by an acoustic survey with a scientific
   echosounder, areal daily AER along the observational transect was
   estimated to be 0.08-23.10 mmol N m(-2) day(-1) for E. superba and
   0.01-40.89 mmol N m(-2) day(-1) for E. crystallorophias. Contributions
   of the daily AERs of E. superba and E. crystallorophias to the ambient
   ammonium stock in the 20-200 m depth layer accounted for 0.14-40.12 and
   0.02-44.71\%, respectively. Although the median of the contribution was
   significantly higher in E. superba, our data imply non-negligible
   contributions of E. crystallorophias to ammonia concentrations when they
   are distributed with higher abundance in the neritic zone, which is
   comparable to E. superba in slope zones. To evaluate entire nutrient
   cycles in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, information on the life history,
   distribution and abundance of E. crystallorophias should be key data.},

   Phylogenetic and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 8},
Abstract = {A fossil Mycetophilidae from the Aptian Crato Formation-Cretomanota
   gondwanica gen. nov., sp. nov.-is described, which is the first
   mycetophilid from the Crato Formation and corresponds to the oldest
   known fossil leiine and only the second Gondwanan fossil mycetophilid
   described so far. Cretomanota gondwanica and both species of Alavamanota
   Blagoderov and Arillo were added as terminals to the data matrix of a
   general phylogenetic analysis of the Mycetophilidae, and both fit into
   the Leiinae. Alavamanota is monophyletic, sister to the clade composed
   by Cretomanota and the extant genus Manota Williston. The biology of the
   extant members of this fungivorous family corroborates the
   reconstruction of the Crato palaeoenvironment as including woodlands
   with humid habitats and microhabitats. The presence of a Cretaceous
   member of the tribe Manotini at low latitudes in South America
   reinforces the hypothesis that the clade with all manotines except
   Leiella Edwards corresponds to a Lower Cretaceous offshoot from a group
   in southern Gondwana expanding its distribution to more northern areas
   into the Gondwana and into Laurasia.},

Abstract = {The Cenozoic Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of the
   Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau (HTP) are among the most important geological
   events in the world. They have affected the diversification of regional
   biota of many taxonomic groups on and around the HTP. However, the exact
   timing and model of the collision and uplift events and speciation on
   and around the HTP are still in debate. The Himalayas group of Scytodes
   spitting spiders (Araneae: Scytodidae) are distributed at high
   elevations of the HTP and northern Indochina. Here, we reconstruct a
   dated molecular phylogeny for pan-Himalayan Scytodes spiders, including
   the Himalayas group, with full geographical sampling of the species from
   the HTP and Indochina. We test a hypothesis to explain that the rich
   montane biodiversity of the region is uplift-driven diversification-that
   orogeny drives rapid in situ speciation of the resident Scytodes
   lineages. Our findings revealed that the separation of the Himalayas
   clade from the Myanmar clade took place during the middle Oligocene,
   reflecting the final collision of India with Eurasia. The deep
   divergences among three clades (the Himalayas, the Myanmar and the
   Indochina clades) occurred from the middle Eocene to the middle
   Oligocene, corresponding to two early uplift events of the HTP. The
   evolutionary split between the Himalayas + Myanmar and Indochina clades
   were simultaneous with the rapid lateral extrusion of Indochina by the
   initial Himalayan uplift around the Eocene. This study highlights the
   importance of the diversification of dispersal-limited, high-elevation
   invertebrates as independent lines of evidence to reflect key tectonic
   events in the Himalayan-Indochina region, supporting the stepwise model
   for the Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of HTP.},

   embryophyte evolution, many key nodes within this class remain poorly
   resolved, owing to the paucity of genetic loci previously available for
   phylogenetic analyses. Here, we sequenced 54 plastomes, representing 28
   genera, nearly all families, and all orders of Marchantiopsida. Based on
   these plastomes, we present a hypothesis of deep relationships within
   the class, and make the first investigations of gene contents and
   synteny. Overall, the Marchantiopsida plastomes were well-conserved,
   with the exception of the genus Cyathodium that has plastomes with
   higher GC content, fewer single sequence repeats (SSRs), and more
   structural variations, implying that this genus might possess RNA
   editing sites. Abundant repetitive elements and six highly divergent
   regions were identified as suitable for future infrafamilial taxonomic
   studies. The phylogenetic topology of Sphaerocarpales, Neohodgsoniales
   and Blasiales within Marchantiopsida was essentially congruent with
   previous studies but generally we obtained higher support values. Based
   on molecular evidence and previous morphological studies, we include
   Lunulariales in Marchantiales and suggest the retention of narrowed
   delimitation of monotypic families. The phylogenetic relationships
   within Marchantiales were better resolved, and 13 monophyletic families
   were recovered. Our analyses confirmed that the loss of intron 2 of ycf3
   is a synapomorphy of Marchantiidae. Finally, we propose a new genus,
   Asterellopsis (Aytoniaceae), and present an updated classification of
   Marchantiopsida. The highly supported phylogenetic backbone provided
   here establishes a framework for future comparative and evolutionary
   studies of the complex thalloid liverworts.},

Abstract = {We describe two new species of Lophocoronidae: Acanthocorona hedida

   three extinct families, was undertaken. The analysis supported monophyly
   of Glossata although internal relationships remain controversial.
   Acanthocorona and Lophocorona form a monophyletic group. It is likely
   that short and simply structured proboscides of Acanthocorona were used
   to sip water droplets, pollination drops from gymnosperms, nectar from
   early flowers, or sap from injured leaves. Both retracted and extended
   ovipositors are preserved in the material reported here, revealing their
   morphology and indicating that these Cretaceous lophocoronids inserted
   eggs into the tissues of their host plants.},

Title = {When phylogenetics met biogeography: Willi Hennig, Lars Brundin and the
   roots of phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Willi Hennig's (Beitr. Ent. 1960, 10, 15) Die Dipteren-Fauna von
   Neuseeland als systematisches und tiergeographisches Problem applied a
   phylogenetic approach to examine the distributional patterns exhibited
   by the Diptera of New Zealand. Hennig showed how phylogenetic trees may
   be used to infer dispersal, based on the progression and deviation
   rules, and also discussed the existence of vicariance patterns. The most
   important author who applied Hennig's phylogenetic biogeography was Lars
   Brundin, when analysing the phylogenetic relationships of two taxa of
   Chironomidae (Diptera) and using them to examine the biogeographic
   relationships of Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.
   The relevance of Brundin's contribution was noted by several authors, as
   it began the cladistic or vicariance approach to biogeography, that
   implies the discovery of vicariance events shared by different
   monophyletic groups. Both phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography have a
   place in contemporary biogeography, the former for analysing taxon
   biogeography and the latter when addressing Earth or biota biogeography.
   The recent use of the term ``phylogenetic biogeography{''} to refer to a
   posteriori methods of cladistic biogeography is erroneous and should be
   avoided.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny of the tropical wandering spiders (Araneae,
   Ctenidae) and the evolution of eye conformation in the RTA clade},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Tropical wandering spiders (Ctenidae) are a diverse group of cursorial
   predators with its greatest species richness in the tropics.
   Traditionally, Ctenidae are diagnosed based on the presence of eight
   eyes arranged in three rows (a 2-4-2 pattern). We present a molecular
   phylogeny of Ctenidae, including for the first time representatives of
   all of its subfamilies. The molecular phylogeny was inferred using five
   nuclear (histone H3, 28S, 18S, Actin and ITS-2) and four mitochondrial
   (NADH, COI, 12S and 16S) markers. The final matrix includes 259
   terminals, 103 of which belong to Ctenidae and represent 28 of the
   current 49 described genera. We estimated divergence times by including
   fossils as calibration points and biogeographic events, and used the
   phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to reconstruct the evolution of the eye
   conformation in the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade. Ctenidae
   and its main lineages originated during the Paleocene-Eocene and have
   diversified in the tropics since then. However, in some analyses
   Ctenidae was recovered as polyphyletic as the genus Ancylometes Bertkau,
   1880 was placed as sister to Oxyopidae. Except for Acantheinae, in which
   the type genus Acantheis Thorell, 1891 is placed inside Cteninae, the
   four recognized subfamilies of Ctenidae are monophyletic in most
   analyses. The ancestral reconstruction of the ocular conformation in the
   retrolateral tibial apophysis clade suggests that the ocular pattern of
   Ctenidae has evolved convergently seven times and that it has originated
   from ocular conformations of two rows of four eyes (4-4) and the ocular
   pattern of lycosids (4-2-2). We also synonymize the monotypic genus
   Parabatinga Polotov \& Brescovit, 2009 with Centroctenus Mello-Leitao,
   1929. We discuss some of the putative morphological synapomorphies of
   the main ctenid lineages within the phylogenetic framework offered by
   the molecular phylogenetic results of the study.},

Title = {Multi-gene phylogeny of North American clear-winged moths (Lepidoptera:

   mimicry complex},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sesiids are a diverse group of predominantly diurnal moths, many of
   which are Batesian mimics of Hymenoptera. However, their diversity and
   relationships are poorly understood. A multi-gene phylogenetic analysis
   of 48 North American sesiid species confirmed the traditional taxonomic
   tribal ranks, demonstrated the paraphyly of Carmenta and Synanthedon
   with respect to several other genera and ultimately provided minimal
   phylogenetic resolution within and between North American and European
   groups. Character support from each gene suggested inconsistency between
   the phylogenetic signal of the CAD gene and that of the other four
   genes. However, removal of CAD from subsequent phylogenetic analyses did
   not substantially change the initial phylogenetic results or return
   Carmenta and Synanthedon as reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting that
   it was not impacting the overall phylogenetic signal. The lack of
   resolution using genes that are typically informative at the species
   level for other lepidopterans suggests a surprisingly rapid radiation of
   species in Carmenta/Synanthedon. This group also exhibits a wide range
   of mimicry strategies and hostplant usage, which could be fertile ground
   for future study.},

Title = {Hyb-Seq provides new insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the

Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Abstract = {A species complex is an assemblage of closely related species with
   blurred boundaries, and from which species could arise from different
   speciation processes and/or a speciation continuum. Such a complex can
   provide an opportunity to investigate evolutionary mechanisms acting on
   speciation. The Chrysanthemum zawadskii species complex in China, a
   monophyletic group of Chrysanthemum, consists of seven species with
   considerable morphological variation, diverse habitats and different
   distribution patterns. Here, we used Hyb-Seq data to construct a
   well-resolved phylogeny of the C. zawadskii complex. Then, we performed
   comparative analyses of variation patterns in morphology, ecology and
   distribution to investigate the roles of geography and ecology in this
   complex's diversification. Lastly, we implemented divergence time
   estimation, species distribution modelling and ancestral area
   reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of this complex. We
   concluded that the C. zawadskii complex originated in the Qinling-Daba
   mountains during the early Pliocene and then spread west and northward
   along the mountain ranges to northern China. During this process,
   geographical and ecological factors imposing different influences
   resulted in the current diversification and distribution patterns of
   this species complex, which is composed of both well-diverged species
   and diverging lineages on the path of speciation.},

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extinct organisms provide crucial information about the origin and time
   of origination of extant groups. The importance of morphological
   phylogenetics for rigorously dating the tree of life is now widely
   recognized and has been revitalized by methodological developments such
   as the application of tip-dating Bayesian approaches. Traditionally,
   molecular clocks have been node calibrated. However, node calibrations
   are often unsatisfactory because they do not allow the fossil age to
   inform about phylogenetic hypothesis. The introduction of tip
   calibrations allow fossil species to be included alongside their living
   relatives, and the absence of molecular sequence data for these taxa to
   be remedied by supplementing the sequence alignments for living taxa
   with phenotype character matrices for both living and fossil taxa.
   Therefore, only phylogenetic analyses that take into account
   morphological characters can incorporate both fossil and extant species.
   Herein we present an unprecedented morphological dataset for a vast
   group of glirid rodents, to which different phylogenetic methodologies
   have been applied. We have compared the tree topologies resulting from
   traditional parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches and calculate
   stratigraphic congruence indices for each. Bayesian tip-dated clock
   methods seem to outperform parsimony with our dataset. The strict
   consensus tree recovered by tip dating invalidates the classic
   classification and allows dates to be proposed for the divergence and
   origin of the different clades.},

Title = {Female terminalia morphology and cladistic relations among Tok-Tok

Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tok-tokkies are one of the most iconic lineages within Tenebrionidae. In
   addition to containing some of the largest darkling beetles, this tribe
   is recognized for its remarkable form of sexual communication known as
   substrate tapping. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships within
   the group remain poorly understood. This study investigates the
   usefulness of female terminalia morphology for delimiting Sepidiini and
   reconstructing relationships among it. Data on the structure of the
   ovipositors, genital tubes and spicula ventrali have been generated for
   >200 species representing 28 Pimeliinae tribes. This dataset was used in
   a comparative analysis at the subfamilial level, which resulted in
   recognition of several unique features of tok-tokkie terminalia.
   Additionally, new features linking phenotypically challenging tribes
   also were recovered (Cryptochilini + Idisiini + Pimeliini). Secondly, 23
   characters linked to the structure of female terminalia were defined for
   tok-tok beetles. Cladistic analysis demonstrates the nonmonophyletic
   nature of most of the recognized subtribes. The morphological dataset
   was analysed separately and in combination with available molecular data
   (CAD, Wg, cox1, cox2, 28S). All obtained topologies were largely
   congruent, supporting the following changes: Palpomodina Kaminski \&
   Gearner subtr.n. is erected to accommodate the genera Namibomodes and
   Palpomodes; Argenticrinis and Bombocnodulus are transferred from
   Hypomelina to Molurina; 153 species and subspecies previously classified
   within Psammodes are distributed over three separate genera (Mariazofia
   Kaminski nom.n., Piesomera stat.r., Psammodes sens.n.). Psammodes
   sklodowskae Kaminski \& Gearner sp.n. is described. Preliminary
   investigation of the ovipositor of Mariazofia basuto (Koch) comb.n. was
   carried out with the application of microcomputed tomography,
   illuminating the muscular system as a reliable reference point for
   recognizing homologous elements in highly modified ovipositors.},

Abstract = {High-elevation adaptation provides an excellent system for examining
   adaptive evolution, and adaptive variations may manifest at gene
   expression or any other phenotypic levels. We examined gene expression
   profiles of Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans) along an elevational
   gradient from both wild and common-garden acclimated populations.
   Asiatic toads originated from high altitudes have distinctive gene
   expression patterns. We identified 18 fixed differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs), which are different in both wild and acclimated samples,
   and 1217 plastic DEGs, which are different among wild samples. The
   expression levels of most genes were linearly correlated with altitude
   gradient and down-regulated in high-altitude populations. Expression
   variations of several genes associated with metabolic process are fixed,
   and we also identified a co-expression module that is significantly
   different between acclimated populations and has functions related to
   DNA repair. The differential expression of the vast majority genes,
   however, are due to phenotypic plasticity, revealing the highly plastic
   nature of gene expression variations. Expression modification of some
   specific genes related to metabolism and response to UV radiation play
   crucial role in adaptation to high altitude for Asiatic toads.
   Common-garden experiments are essential for evaluating adaptive
   evolution of natural populations.},

Abstract = {When a dispensable gene is duplicated (referred to the ancestral
   dispensability denoted by O+), genetic buffering and duplicate
   compensation together maintain the duplicate redundancy, whereas
   duplicate compensation is the only mechanism when an essential gene is
   duplicated (referred to the ancestral essentiality denoted by O-). To
   investigate these evolutionary scenarios of genetic robustness, I
   formulated a simple mixture model for analyzing duplicate pairs with one
   of the following states: double dispensable (DD), semi-dispensable (one
   dispensable one essential, DE), or double essential (EE). This model was
   applied to the yeast duplicate pairs from a whole-genome duplication
   (WGD) occurred about 100 million years ago (mya), and the mouse
   duplicate pairs from a WGD occurred about more than 500 mya. Both case
   studies revealed that the proportion of essentiality for those
   duplicates with ancestral essentiality {[}P-E(O-)] was much higher than
   that for those with ancestral dispensability {[}P-E(O+)]. While it was
   negligible in the yeast duplicate pairs, P-E(O+) (about 20\%) was shown
   statistically significant in the mouse duplicate pairs. These findings,
   together, support the hypothesis that both sub-functionalization and
   neo-functionalization may play some roles after gene duplication, though
   the former may be much faster than the later.},

Abstract = {Vertebrate blood coagulation is controlled by a cascade containing more
   than 20 proteins. The cascade proteins are found in the blood in their
   zymogen forms and when the cascade is triggered by tissue damage,
   zymogens are activated and in turn activate their downstream proteins by
   serine protease activity. In this study, we examined proteomes of 21
   chordates, of which 18 are vertebrates, to reveal the modular evolution
   of the blood coagulation cascade. Additionally, two Arthropoda species
   were used to compare domain arrangements of the proteins belonging to
   the hemolymph clotting and the blood coagulation cascades. Within the
   vertebrate coagulation protein set, almost half of the studied proteins
   are shared with jawless vertebrates. Domain similarity analyses revealed
   that there are multiple possible evolutionary trajectories for each
   coagulation protein. During the evolution of higher vertebrate clades,
   gene and genome duplications led to the formation of other coagulation
   cascade proteins.},

Title = {Epistasis-Driven Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Secondary Structure},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Epistasis is an evolutionary phenomenon whereby the fitness effect of a
   mutation depends on the genetic background in which it arises. A key
   source of epistasis in an RNA molecule is its secondary structure, which
   contains functionally important topological motifs held together by
   hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs. Here we study
   epistasis in the secondary structure of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by examining properties of derived
   alleles arising from substitution mutations at ancestral WC base-paired
   and unpaired (UP) sites in 15 conserved topological motifs across the
   genome. We uncover fewer derived alleles and lower derived allele
   frequencies at WC than at UP sites, supporting the hypothesis that
   modifications to the secondary structure are often deleterious. At WC
   sites, we also find lower derived allele frequencies for mutations that
   abolish base pairing than for those that yield G center dot U
   ``wobbles,{''} illustrating that weak base pairing can partially
   preserve the integrity of the secondary structure. Last, we show that WC
   sites under the strongest epistatic constraint reside in a three-stemmed
   pseudoknot motif that plays an essential role in programmed ribosomal
   frameshifting, whereas those under the weakest epistatic constraint are
   located in 3' UTR motifs that regulate viral replication and
   pathogenicity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of epistasis in
   the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure, as well as
   highlight putative structural and functional targets of different forms
   of natural selection.},

Title = {Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction of the Ribosomal Protein uS8 and

Abstract = {Understanding the origin and early evolution of proteins is important
   for unveiling how the RNA world developed into an RNA-protein world.
   Because the composition of organic molecules in the Earth's primitive
   environment was plausibly not as diverse as today, the number of
   different amino acids used in early protein synthesis is likely to be
   substantially less than the current 20 proteinogenic residues. In this
   study, we have explored the thermal stability and RNA binding of
   ancestral variants of the ribosomal protein uS8 constructed from a
   reduced-alphabet of amino acids. First, we built a phylogenetic tree
   based on the amino acid sequences of uS8 from multiple extant organisms
   and used the tree to infer two plausible amino acid sequences
   corresponding to the last bacterial common ancestor of uS8. Both
   ancestral proteins were thermally stable and bound to an RNA fragment.
   By eliminating individual amino acid letters and monitoring thermal
   stability and RNA binding in the resulting proteins, we reduced the size
   of the amino acid set constituting one of the ancestral proteins,
   eventually finding that convergent sequences consisting of 15- or
   14-amino acid alphabets still folded into stable structures that bound
   to the RNA fragment. Furthermore, a simplified variant reconstructed
   from a 13-amino-acid alphabet retained affinity for the RNA fragment,
   although it lost conformational stability. Collectively, RNA-binding
   activity may be achieved with a subset of the current 20 amino acids,
   raising the possibility of a simpler composition of RNA-binding proteins
   in the earliest stage of protein evolution.},

Abstract = {In the present note, the genomic compositional rule largely known as
   `Chargaff's 2nd parity rule' (asserting equimolarity between
   Adenine-Thymine and Guanine-Cytosine in any of the two DNA strands) is
   regarded in association with Noether's theorem linking symmetries with
   conservation laws in physics. In the case of the genome, the strict
   physical and mathematical prerequisites of Noether's theorem do not
   hold. However, we conclude that a metaphor can be established with
   Noether's theorem, as inter-strand symmetry concerning DNA functionality
   engenders specific features in genome composition. Inversely, when
   inter-strand symmetry does not hold, the corresponding quantitative
   relations fail to appear. This association is also considered from the
   point of view of the existence of emergent laws and properties in
   evolutionary genomics.},

Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive sequences of DNA that
   replicate and proliferate throughout genomes. Taken together, all the
   TEs in a genome form a diverse community of sequences, which can be
   studied to draw conclusions about genome evolution. TE diversity can be
   measured using models for ecological community diversity that consider
   species richness and evenness. Several models predict TE diversity
   decreasing as genomes expand because of selection against ectopic
   recombination and/or competition among TEs to garner host replicative
   machinery and evade host silencing mechanisms. Salamanders have some of
   the largest vertebrate genomes and highest TE loads. Salamanders of the
   genus Plethodon, in particular, have genomes that range in size from 20
   to 70 Gb. Here, we use Oxford Nanopore sequencing to generate
   low-coverage genomic sequences for four species of Plethodon that
   encompass two independent genome expansion events, one in the eastern
   clade (Plethodon cinereus, 29.3 Gb vs. Plethodon glutinosus, 38.9 Gb)
   and one in the western clade (Plethodon vehiculum, 46.4 Gb vs Plethodon
   idahoensis, 67.0 Gb). We classified the TEs in these genomes and found >
   40 TE superfamilies, accounting for 22-27\% of the genomes. We
   calculated Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices to quantify overall
   TE diversity. In both pairwise comparisons, the diversity index values
   for the smaller and larger genome were almost identical. This result
   indicates that, when genomes reach extremely large sizes, they maintain
   high levels of TE diversity at the superfamily level, in contrast to
   predictions made by previous studies on smaller genomes.},

Title = {d(N)/d(S)-H, a New Test to Distinguish Different Selection Modes in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the most popular measures in the analysis of protein sequence
   evolution is the ratio of nonsynonymous distance (d(N)) to synonymous
   distance (d(S)). Under the assumption that synonymous substitutions in
   the coding region are selectively neutral, the d(N)/d(S) ratio can be
   used to statistically detect the adaptive evolution (or purifying
   selection) if d(N)/d(S) > 1 (or d(N)/d(S) < 1) significantly. However,
   due to strong structural constraints and/or variable functional
   constraints imposed on amino acid sites, most encoding genes in most
   species have demonstrated d(N)/d(S) < 1. Consequently, the statistical
   power for testing d(N)/d(S) = 1 may be insufficient to distinguish
   between different selection modes. In this paper, we propose a more
   powerful test, called d(N)/d(S)-H, in which a new parameter H, a
   relative measure of rate variation among sites, was introduced. Given
   the condition of strong purifying selections at some sites, the
   d(N)/d(S)-H model predicts d(N)/d(S) = 1-H for neutral evolution,
   d(N)/d(S) < 1-H for nearly neutral selection, and d(N)/d(S) > 1-H for
   adaptive evolution. The potential of this new method for resolving the
   neutral-adaptive debates is illustrated by the protein sequence
   evolution in vertebrates, Drosophila and yeasts, as well as somatic
   cancer evolution (specialized as the C-N/C-S-H test).},

Abstract = {In the past few years, our understanding of the RNA virosphere has
   changed dramatically due to the growth and spurt of metagenomics,
   exponentially increasing the number of RNA viral sequences, and
   providing a better understanding of their range of potential hosts. As
   of today, the only conserved protein among RNA viruses appears to be the
   monomeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme belongs to the
   right-hand DNA-and RNA polymerases, which also includes reverse
   transcriptases and eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases. The ubiquity
   of this protein in RNA viruses makes it a unique evolutionary marker and
   an appealing broad-spectrum antiviral target. In this work pairwise
   structural comparisons of viral RdRps and RTs were performed, including
   tertiary structures that have been obtained in the last few years. The
   resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the RdRps from (+)ss- and dsRNA
   viruses might have been recruited several times throughout the evolution
   of mobile genetic elements. RTs also display multiple evolutionary
   routes. We have identified a structural core comprising the entire palm,
   a large moiety of the fingers and the N-terminal helices of the thumb
   domain, comprising over 300 conserved residues, including two regions
   that we have named the ``knuckles{''} and the ``hypothenar eminence{''}.
   The conservation of an helix bundle in the region preceding the
   polymerase domain confirms that (-)ss and dsRNA Reoviruses' polymerases
   share a recent ancestor. Finally, the inclusion of DNA polymerases into
   our structural analyses suggests that monomeric RNA-dependent
   polymerases might have diverged from B-family polymerases.},

Abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most lethal cancer
   types in the world. Currently, the molecular mechanisms and pathways
   underlying NSCLC oncogenesis are poorly understood. Using multiple Omics
   data, we systematically explored the differentially expressed circular
   RNAs (circRNAs) in NSCLC. We also investigated potential microRNA
   sponges (that absorb circRNAs) in NSCLC and downstream target genes with
   experimental verifications. hsa\_circ\_0003497 was down-regulated in
   NSCLC and played an inhibitory role in tumorigenesis. In contrast,
   miR-197-3p was up-regulated in NSCLC. hsa\_circ\_0003497 directly
   interacts with miR-197-3p and releases a target gene of miR-197-3p
   termed CTNND1 (a known tumor suppressor gene). Evolutionary analysis
   reveals fast evolution of this
   hsa\_circ\_0003497-miR-197-3p-CTNND1-NSCLC axis in mammals. This work
   clarified the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of how
   hsa\_circ\_0003497 suppresses NSCLC through miR-197-3p and CTNND1. We
   discovered molecular markers for the prognosis of NSCLC and provided
   potential intervention targets for its treatment.},

Abstract = {We draw attention to an under-appreciated simulation method for
   generating artificial data in a phylogenetic context. The approach,
   which we refer to as jump-chain simulation, can invoke rich models of
   molecular evolution having intractable likelihood functions. As an
   example, we simulate data under a context-dependent model allowing for
   CpG hypermutability and show how such a feature can mislead common codon
   models used for detecting positive selection. We discuss more generally
   how this method can serve to elucidate the ways by which currently used
   models for inference are susceptible to violations of their underlying
   assumptions. Finally, we show how the method could serve as an inference
   engine in the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework.},

Abstract = {Nucleic acids likely played a foundational role in the origin of life.
   However, the prebiotic chemistry of nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis
   has proved challenging on a number of fronts. The recent discovery of
   both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases in carbonaceous chondrite
   meteorites has garnered much attention from both the popular press and
   the scientific community. Here, we discuss these findings in the context
   of nucleoside/nucleotide prebiotic chemistry. We consider that the main
   challenge of prebiotic nucleoside synthesis, that of nucleosidic bond
   formation, is not addressed by the identification nucleobases in
   meteorites. We further discuss issues of selection that arise from the
   observation that such meteorites contain both canonical and
   non-canonical nucleobases. In sum, we argue that, despite the major
   analytical achievement of identifying and characterizing nucleobases in
   meteorites, this observation does little to advance our understanding of
   the prebiotic chemistry that could have led to the first genetic
   molecules that gave rise to us.},

Title = {Bayesian Cross-Validation Comparison of Amino Acid Replacement Models:

Abstract = {Models of amino acid replacement are central to modern phylogenetic
   inference, particularly so when dealing with deep evolutionary
   relationships. Traditionally, a single, empirically derived matrix was
   utilized, so as to keep the degrees-of-freedom of the inference low, and
   focused on topology. With the growing size of data sets, however, an
   amino acid-level general-time-reversible matrix has become increasingly
   feasible, treating amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies as free
   parameters. Moreover, models based on mixtures of multiple matrices are
   increasingly utilized, in order to account for across-site
   heterogeneities in amino acid requirements of proteins. Such models
   exist as finite empirically-derived amino acid profile (or frequency)
   mixtures, free finite mixtures, as well as free Dirichlet process-based
   infinite mixtures. All of these approaches are typically combined with a
   gamma-distributed rates-across-sites model. In spite of the availability
   of these different aspects to modeling the amino acid replacement
   process, no study has systematically quantified their relative
   contributions to their predictive power of real data. Here, we use
   Bayesian cross-validation to establish a detailed comparison, while
   activating/deactivating each modeling aspect. For most data sets
   studied, we find that amino acid mixture models can outrank all
   single-matrix models, even when the latter include gamma-distributed
   rates and the former do not. We also find that free finite mixtures
   consistently outperform empirical finite mixtures. Finally, the
   Dirichlet process-based mixture model tends to outperform all other
   approaches.},

Title = {Origin of Sex-Biased Mental Disorders: Do Males and Females Experience

Abstract = {The origins of sex-biased differences in disease and health are of
   growing interest to both medical researchers and health professionals.
   Several major factors have been identified that affect sex differences
   in incidence of diseases and mental disorders. These are: sex
   chromosomes, sex hormones and female immunity, sexual selection and
   antagonistic evolution, and differential susceptibility of sexes to
   environmental factors. These factors work on different time scales and
   are not exclusive of each other. Recently, a combined Sexual
   Selection-Sex Hormones (SS-SH) Theory was presented as an evolutionary
   mechanism to explain sex-biased differences in diseases and mental
   disorders (Singh in J Mol Evol 89:195-213, 2021). In that paper disease
   prevalence trends were investigated, and non-sex-specific diseases were
   hypothesized to be more common in males than in females in general. They
   showed signs of exceptions to this trend with inflammatory diseases and
   stress-related mental disorders that were more common in females. We
   believe that the SS-SH theory requires the consideration of
   psycho-social stress (PSS) to explain the predominance of female-biased
   mental disorders and some other exceptions in their findings. Here we
   present a theory of sex-differential experience of PSS and provide
   quantitative support for the combined SS-SH-PSS Theory using
   age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) recording the levels of male-
   and female-bias in data obtained from different countries. The grand
   theory provides an evolutionary framework for explaining patterns of
   sex-biased trends in the prevalence of disease and health. Further
   exploration of women's vulnerability to social factors may help to
   facilitate new treatments for female-biased diseases.},

Abstract = {Recent findings, in vitro and in silico, are strengthening the idea of a
   simpler, earlier stage of genetically encoded proteins which used amino
   acids produced by prebiotic chemistry. These findings motivate a
   re-examination of prior work which has identified unusual properties of
   the set of twenty amino acids found within the full genetic code, while
   leaving it unclear whether similar patterns also characterize the subset
   of prebiotically plausible amino acids. We have suggested previously
   that this ambiguity may result from the low number of amino acids
   recognized by the definition of prebiotic plausibility used for the
   analysis. Here, we test this hypothesis using significantly updated data
   for organic material detected within meteorites, which contain several
   coded and non-coded amino acids absent from prior studies. In addition
   to confirming the well-established idea that ``late{''} arriving amino
   acids expanded the chemistry space encoded by genetic material, we find
   that a prebiotically plausible subset of coded amino acids generally
   emulates the patterns found in the full set of 20, namely an
   exceptionally broad and even distribution of volumes and an
   exceptionally even distribution of hydrophobicities (quantified as logP)
   over a narrow range. However, the strength of this pattern varies
   depending on both the size and composition the library used to create a
   background (null model) for a random alphabet, and the precise
   definition of exactly which amino acids were present in a simpler,
   earlier code. Findings support the idea that a small sample size of
   amino acids caused previous ambiguous results, and further improvements
   in meteorite analysis, and/or prebiotic simulations will further clarify
   the nature and extent of unusual properties. We discuss the case of
   sulfur-containing amino acids as a specific and clear example and
   conclude by reviewing the potential impact of better understanding the
   chemical ``logic{''} of a smaller forerunner to the standard amino acid
   alphabet.},

Abstract = {Codon usage is the outcome of different evolutionary processes and can
   inform us about the conditions in which organisms live and evolve. Here,
   we present R\_ENC', which is an improvement to the original S index
   developed by dos Reis et al. (2004). Our index is less sensitive to G+C
   content, which greatly affects synonymous codon usage in prokaryotes,
   making it better suited to detect selection acting on codon usage. We
   used R\_ENC' to estimate the extent of selected codon usage bias in 1800
   genomes representing 26 prokaryotic phyla. We found that
   Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes
   are the phyla/subphyla showing more genomes with selected codon usage
   bias. In particular, we found that several lineages within
   Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes show a similar set of functional
   terms enriched in genes under selected codon usage bias, indicating
   convergent evolution. We also show that selected codon usage bias tends
   to evolve in genes coding for the translation machinery before other
   functional GO terms. Finally, we discuss the possibility to use R\_ENC'
   to predict whether lineages evolved in copiotrophic or oligotrophic
   environments.},

Abstract = {Diseases and environmental stresses are two distinct challenges for
   virtually all living organisms. In light of evolution, cellular
   responses to diseases and stresses might share similar molecular
   mechanisms, but the detailed regulation pathway is not reported yet. We
   obtained the transcriptomes and translatomes from several NSCLC
   (non-small-cell lung cancer) patients as well as from different species
   under normal or stress conditions. We found that the translation level
   of gene ATF4 is remarkably enhanced in NSCLC due to the reduced number
   of ribosomes binding to its upstream open reading frames (uORFs). We
   also showed the evolutionary conservation of this uORF-ATF4 regulation
   in the stress response of other species. Molecular experiments showed
   that knockdown of ATF4 reduced the cell growth rate while overexpression
   of ATF4 enhanced cell growth, especially for the ATF4 allele with
   mutated uORFs. Population genetics analyses in multiple species verified
   that the mutations that abolish uATGs (start codon of uORFs) are highly
   deleterious, suggesting the functional importance of uORFs. Our study
   proposes an evolutionarily conserved pattern that enhances the ATF4
   translation by uORFs upon stress or disease. We generalized the concept
   of cellular response to diseases and stresses. These two biological
   processes may share similar molecular mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Troponin T (TnT) is the thin filament anchoring subunit of troponin
   complex and plays an organizer role in the Ca2+-regulation of striated
   muscle contraction. From an ancestral gene emerged similar to 700
   million years ago in Bilateria, three homologous genes have evolved in
   vertebrates to encode muscle type-specific isoforms of TnT. Alternative
   splicing variants of TnT are present in vertebrate and invertebrate
   muscles to add functional diversity. While the C-terminal region of TnT
   is largely conserved, it contains an alternatively spliced segment
   emerged early in C. elegans, which has evolved into a pair of mutually
   exclusive exons in arthropods (10A and 10B of Drosophila TpnT gene) and
   vertebrates (16 and 17 of fast skeletal muscle Tnnt3 gene). The
   C-terminal alternatively spliced segment of TnT interfaces with the
   other two subunits of troponin with functional significance. The
   vertebrate cardiac TnT gene that emerged from duplication of the fast
   TnT gene has eliminated this alternative splicing by the fixation of an
   exon 17-like constitutive exon, indicating a functional value in slower
   and rhythmic contractions. The vertebrate slow skeletal muscle TnT gene
   that emerged from duplication of the cardiac TnT gene has the exon
   17-like structure conserved, indicating its further function in
   sustained and fatigue resistant contractions. This functionality-based
   evolution is consistent with the finding that exon 10B-encoded segment
   of Drosophila TnT homologous to the exon 17-encoded segment of
   vertebrate fast TnT is selectively expressed in insect heart and leg
   muscles. The evolution of the C-terminal variable region of TnT
   demonstrates a submolecular mechanism in modifying striated muscle
   contractility and for the treatment of muscle and heart diseases.},

Abstract = {14-3-3 proteins are signal moderators in sensing various stresses and
   play essential functions in plant growth and development. Although,
   14-3-3 gene families have been identified and characterized in many
   plant species, its evolution has not been studied systematically. In
   this study, the plant 14-3-3 family was comprehensively analyzed from
   green algae to angiosperm. Our result indicated that plant 14-3-3
   originated during the early evolutionary history of green algae and
   expanded in terricolous plants. Twenty-six 14-3-3 genes were identified
   in the tea genome. RNA-seq analysis showed that tea 14-3-3 genes display
   different expression patterns in different organs. Moreover, the
   expression of most tea 14-3-3 genes displayed variable expression
   patterns under different abiotic and biotic stresses. In conclusion, our
   results elucidate the evolutionary origin of plant 14-3-3 genes, and
   beneficial for understanding their biological functions and improving
   tea agricultural traits in the future.},
